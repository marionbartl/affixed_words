Barack Obama picked up two more superdelegates this morning as Connecticut Democratic State Party Chairwoman Nancy DiNardo and Democratic National Committee Member Jerome Wiley Segovia both endorsed him for president .
It seems that no matter how Clinton figures the math , Obama ’s march to the nomination continues .
Segovia stressed Obama ’s field campaign and support for alternative energy , “ I am excited to add my support to a campaign that has clearly demonstrated a commitment to an inclusive national field campaign , has shattered all previous campaign fundraising records , and is supportive of alternative sources of energy to begin to solve our energy crisis . ”
DiNardo emphasized Obama ’s ability to unify the country , “ Senator Obama offers Connecticut and our country a chance for such unity – at healing the divisions caused by years of war , deficits , and partisan wrangling .
He shares Connecticut ’s and our nation ’s concern for building strong communities and re-building our economy ravaged by Republican policies . ”

She continued , “ More fundamentally , Senator Obama understands the everyday struggles of Americans and is devoted to realizing the vision of a nation in which we and our families , friends and neighbors can earn a decent wage , secure affordable healthcare and housing , send our children to good schools , heat our homes , and breathe clean air .
Senator Obama ’s experience as a community activist and his record in Congress demonstrates his focus on these issues and his ability to effect change without becoming ensnared by and beholden to the political establishment . ”
Obama is now only 44 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination .
I think there has been a masterful bit of campaign strategy involved with rolling out these endorsements .
The pattern has been that when Clinton wins big somewhere , and less than a day later , the Obama campaign unveils several new endorsements .
This illustrates the ongoing tug of war between the Clinton and Obama campaigns over electability question .
For every Clinton argument about the popular vote , Obama can point to the superdelegates .
Most people who have followed this campaign can see through the smokescreen of the popular vote argument anyway , but the Obama camp seems to be taking no chances and nothing for granted .
I suspect the superdelegate endorsements will keep flowing as Obama looks to end the Democratic primary tomorrow night .

Imagine being one of the 300 or so undeclared Democratic superdelegates digesting the Clinton win in Pennsylvania .
Forget that the high voter turnout reflects a wish not to let these party insiders pick the nominee – they probably will .
Her win makes this privileged decision of the 300 more difficult .
The primary 's numerical results only supersize the agony for the unelected Deciders whose levers are n't in voting booths .
Their coming choice risks offending entire groups of the party 's big , but increasingly torn , tent .
Take Mrs. Clinton 's nearly 10 - point victory over Barack Obama .
It 's far less than her 20 - point lead in early opinion polls .
And her victory does n't give her much in delegates to catch Mr. Obama 's lead .
For superdelegates , she has come - back momentum but not the narrative of a knock - out blow .
And in the national popular vote from primaries held so far ( not counting Florida and Michigan ) , the Pennsylvania primary cut Obama 's lead of about 700,000 by some 220,000 .
But a superdelegate would only note that he could easily gain much of that back in coming primaries .
And some portion of those Clinton votes came from Republicans tactically crossing party lines to boost her .
The Supers may see that Obama 's pitch to be a uniter not a divider did n't unite Pennsylvania 's Democrats behind him .
They now have to wonder about his electability just as much as they have seen Clinton 's once - inevitable electability fade away in earlier primaries .
Exit polls also muddy the picture .
Obama made inroads on Clinton 's strength by winning 37 percent of Pennsylvania voters over age 65 compared with his 26 percent in Ohio .
And he took 44 percent of white men , up 5 points from Ohio .
But in one big swing group , he was found wanting : Only 60 percent of Democratic Catholic voters said they would vote for him in a general election , while 21 percent said they would vote for John McCain .
In the end , such reading of primary tea - leaves may not sway the 300 .
Their choice could be more fundamental .
They need to decide if the party wants to adopt Obama 's line that " going negative " in campaigns would only further feed the kind of political polarization and legislative inaction in Washington that voters resent .
Or do they see in Clinton 's " tough tactics " against her opponent the kind of ruthless leadership that would help Democrats steamroll the GOP in both the election and in Congress ?
Many of Obama 's " negatives , " of course , are self - inflicted , such as his comments on " bitter " rural folk .
And his past associations may yet erode his message of hope and change .
But he 's been relatively restrained in " going negative " compared with Clinton 's recent barrage .
" If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen , " the narrator of the recent Clinton TV ad says .
Their campaign styles are telling of what kind of president each might be .
For superdelegates caught on the fence of interpreting primary results , they must ask if the party wants a nominee whose tactics will carry over to the general election against Mr. McCain , then the White House , and ultimately to creating a different America .
Clinton won this primary squarely , but 68 percent of voters thought that she had " attacked unfairly . "
With mixed messages like that , the 300 will need Solomonic wisdom .
America , what the fuck ?

Following on from my earlier post about the restrict keyword , I ’d like to try and dispell the myth around the volatile keyword .
The meaning of volatile is a popular interview question , particularly for embedded development jobs and I ’ve heard some programmers describe the properties of this keyword as if it had super powers .
The volatile keyword does a very simple job .
When a variable is marked as volatile , the programmer is instructing the compiler not to cache this variable in a register but instead to read the value of the variable from memory each and every time the variable is used .
That ’s it – simple is n’t it ?
To illustrate the use of the keyword , consider the following example : volatile int* vp = SOME_REGISTER_ADDRESS ;
for ( int i=0 ; i< 100 ; i++) foo(* vp ) ;[/sourcecode ]
In this simple example , the pointer vp points to a volatile int .
The value of this int is read from memory for each loop iteration .
If volatile was not specified then it is likely that the compiler would generate optimized code which would read the value of the int once , temporarily store this in a register and then use the register copy during each iteration .
Examples of where volatile is often used :
When accessing hardware registers via pointers .
It is necessary for the generated code to always access the hardware registers value and never a potentially out of date copy .
When accessing a variable that is shared between two or more threads or between a thread and an ISR .
Common myths about the volatile keyword :
A volatile variable will never reside in cache memory – e.g. within the L2 cache of a processor .
This is not true .
In the case where the volatile variable is shared between two software threads , it is highly likely that the variable will exist in cached memory and the cache coherency policy will ensure that the threads will see the correct and up - to - date value of the variable in the event that the threads are running on seperate cores that do n’t share the same cache .
When the volatile variable refers to a hardware register , it is likely that the memory map of the system will be setup such that this register is not cacheable in the processor cache , but this is setup and managed by the appropriate device driver and is not something that is provided by the volatile keyword .
Thats ’ it .
So the next time you hear somebody waxing lyrical about the super powers of the volatile keyword , please feel empowered to enlighten them !
Gerard Le Fur , the chief executive of French drug - maker Sanofi-Aventis , presents the company 's 2007 results at a news conference in Paris February 12 , 2008 .
Sanofi-Aventis is to donate 60 million doses of its H5N1 bird flu vaccine to the World Health Organisation , the French drugmaker said on Monday .
REUTERS / Vincent Kessler
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Sanofi-Aventis is to donate 60 million doses of its H5N1 bird flu vaccine to the World Health Organisation , the French drugmaker said on Monday .
The donation over the next three years will help the U.N. health body build a global vaccine stockpile that could be used in poor countries in the event of an outbreak of a human flu pandemic , which many experts fear may be triggered by bird flu .
The United States and some countries have already placed orders for national vaccine stockpiles but there have been concerns that the world ’s poor could be left without protection .
As a result , the WHO has decided to set up a vaccine stockpile to distribute shots at short notice to poor countries .
Sanofi ’s move follows a similar agreement by GlaxoSmithKline last year to donate 50 million doses of its bird flu vaccine to the WHO .
While H5N1 remains mainly a virus of birds , scientists say it is the most likely source of the next global flu pandemic in humans , since it may soon mutate into a form that is transmitted easily from person to person .
Sanofi Pasteur -- the vaccines arm of the French group -- is the world ’s leading provider of conventional seasonal flu vaccine , supplying around 40 percent of the total market , according to the company ’s own internal estimates .
The Libertarian Party ( LP ) had , after the late , great Harry Browne ‘s campaigns , been falling further and further from it ’s original principles .
In the early portion of this decade , when the LP removed from the party platform their calls for the abolishment of the CIA and FBI , I wrote their newspaper to say I ’d not send them another dime of money until they got back to their founding principle : the non-initiation of force .
As I drifted away from the LP and politics and toward market - based action , I paid less and less attention to the LP .
I even said on the air recently on “ Free Talk Live “ , my talk show , that the only reason I was still a member is because I bought a life membership and it had n’t been worth my while to cancel it .
Well , along comes this post on the LRC blog .
I agree with the sentiments of the post , and felt this move by the LP was the last straw .
I called and revoked my membership , and felt clean and fresh afterward !
The LP is dead to me and no longer resembles the party I joined ten years ago .
After the 2000 Browne campaign , I jumped into LP activism .
I attended meetings regularly and single - handedly organized and paid for libertarian outreach at the county fair , gun shows , and gay / lesbian pridefests as well as created and tended their website .
I did and funded it all myself because of the political nature of the LP .
It was not hard to notice how bureaucratic and slow they were .
For example , they spent uncountable weeks debating over bylaws .
Plus , at the non - bylaw - reviewing regular meetings , whenever an idea was proposed there would nearly always be someone who would derail the discussion into debate on the idea or the issue .
Very little ever got done .
This was just my experience with the local LP in Florida .
( Nothing against the individuals , they are good people .
It ’s the central planning that is the major failure . )
The LP state conventions I attended were dull .
Having watched the LP national conventions on TV , I can say that while some of the speeches were excellent , the bulk of the time was spent bickering over party platform , blah blah blah .
I ’m glad I never went to one .
All of this distasteful bureaucratic , political garbage was frustrating to me , as I did n’t know what else to do to achieve liberty in my lifetime .
Since I discovered the Free State Project in the first half of the decade and especially since moving to New Hampshire , I ’ve been learning about the free market and experiencing REAL , decentralized , activism .
Sure , there are a bunch of political Free Staters ( for those of you who still believe you can change the system from the inside ) , but the most exciting and effective activism has been market - based .
There ’s a cadre of great market - based activists ( both NH natives and Free Staters ) here in Keene , NH , and that number is growing .
We ’re creating our own media ( TV , radio , print , blog ) and have begun living free .
If the Blue Light Gang interferes , we already have proven success at deterring their aggression .
As more join in withdrawing from coercive society and joining the voluntary society , we will only be more successful as the coercive gang ’s veil of legitimacy will crumble from its own inherent contradictions .
Eventually , the transition to the free market will be completed and not one vote need be cast or politician promoted .
Goodbye LP .
Their contribution to the dilution and destruction of the term Libertarian is appreciated .
“ Free Marketeer ” is so much more descriptive of my beliefs .
Thanks LP , for helping me realize that politics is never the solution to problems .
We will never be free by begging , but only by choice .
I choose liberty .
What about you ?
Will you join the Nonviolent Evolution ?
Surprise , Surprise : Bush Lied Some may view ex-White House press secretary Scott McClellan ’s new book as vindication for those who took grief – accused of “ derangement , ” “ treason ” and a bunch of less - printable things – for calling George W. Bush a liar over the past eight years .

But the more troubling point is that there has been little improvement in the Washington political / media structure that failed to call Bush out on his lies in a timely fashion .
In Iraq alone , the consequences for that dereliction of duty include more than 4,000 U.S. dead along with hundreds of thousands of slain Iraqis and possibly trillions of taxpayer dollars wasted .
Though Bush ’s White House and his Republican allies may stand out as the principal villains in this tragic story , a large share of the blame also must fall on accommodating Democrats and careerists in the Washington press corps .
They protected their political flanks and their nice salaries by playing along .
Indeed , McClellan calls the U.S. news media “ complicit enablers ” in the White House ’s “ carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval ” for invading Iraq , according to a New York Times preview of McClellan ’s book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception .
It ’s significant , too , that McClellan ’s title cites “ Washington ’s Culture of Deception ” because the problem is truly broader than just Bush and his inner circle .
The “ culture of deception ” both preceded and will surely outlast the current residents in the White House .
During the 1980s , when I was an investigative reporter for the Associated Press and Newsweek , I would sometimes ask myself what was the duty of an American journalist when you reached the conclusion that the U.S. government was lying pervasively – not just once in a while , but routinely .
That was a problem I encountered when covering the neoconservatives who entered the higher realms of government under Ronald Reagan .
At the time , the neocons were pushing a concept called “ perception management , ” a domestic covert intelligence program for manipulating how Americans perceived dangers abroad .
The neocon testing ground was Central America and the Caribbean where minor threats like leftist regimes in Nicaragua and Grenada were exaggerated into grave dangers facing the United States .
To accomplish these distortions required whipping the Washington press corps into line .
Journalists who resisted found their careers in jeopardy from a combination of right - wing attack groups and cowardly news executives who valued their social relationships and government contacts more than their journalistic responsibilities .
There was virtually no career danger – and indeed lucrative rewards – for collaborating with the Reagan administration ’s powers - that - be .
So , over the years , this corrupt way of doing business – pandering to well - connected Republicans – became Washington ’s way of life .
In my writings – dating back to my first book Fooling America in 1992 through my last one Neck Deep ( written with my sons , Sam and Nat ) in 2007 – I have tried to explain how this process gradually allowed propaganda to substitute for reality and helped bring the nation to its current fix .
Iraq Disaster However , even the Iraq disaster – in which major news organizations disgraced themselves , from the New York Times to the Washington Post to network and cable TV news – has done little to change matters .
Except in a few rare cases – like Judith Miller leaving the New York Times – journalists responsible for spreading Bush ’s disinformation have avoided significant punishment .
For instance , the Washington Post ’s editorial section , which swallowed neocon propaganda whole , has undergone almost no change .
Editorial - page editor Fred Hiatt remains in place , along with pro-invasion columnists , such as Charles Krauthammer , David Ignatius and Richard Cohen .
While news executives have lost careers over relatively minor offenses , like not catching Jayson Blair ’s fabrications regarding a Washington - area sniper mystery , there has been no purge following the far more monumental falsehoods that led to the Iraq War .
It also was n’t hard to figure out that President Bush was a brazen liar .
We often have noted that – just four months after the Iraq invasion – Bush began rewriting the history by telling reporters that Saddam Hussein was the one who “ chose ” war by barring United Nations inspectors .
“ We gave him [ Saddam Hussein ] a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he would n’t let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power , ” Bush told reporters on July 14 , 2003 .
Facing no serious challenge to this lie from the White House press corps , Bush continued repeating it in varied forms as part of his public litany for defending the invasion .
On Jan. 27 , 2004 , for example , Bush said , “ We went to the United Nations , of course , and got an overwhelming resolution – 1441 – unanimous resolution , that said to Saddam , you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs , which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs .
He chose defiance .
It was his choice to make , and he did not let us in . ”
As the months and years went by , Bush ’s lie and its constant retelling took on the color of truth .
At a press conference on May 24 , 2007 , Bush offered a short - hand version , even inviting the journalists to remember the invented history .
“ As you might remember back then , we tried the diplomatic route : [ U.N. Resolution ] 1441 was a unanimous vote in the Security Council that said disclose , disarm or face serious consequences .
So the choice was his [ Hussein ’s ] to make .
And he made a choice that has subsequently caused him to lose his life . ”
In the frequent repetition of this claim , Bush never acknowledged the fact that Hussein did comply with Resolution 1441 by declaring accurately that he had disposed of his WMD stockpiles and by permitting U.N. inspectors to examine any site of their choosing .
Learning the Lie Prominent Washington journalists eventually began repeating Bush ’s lie as their own .
In a July 2004 interview , ABC ’s veteran newsman Ted Koppel used it to explain why he – Koppel – thought the invasion of Iraq was justified .
“ It did not make logical sense that Saddam Hussein , whose armies had been defeated once before by the United States and the Coalition , would be prepared to lose control over his country if all he had to do was say , ‘ All right , U.N. , come on in , check it out , ” Koppel told Amy Goodman , host of “ Democracy Now . ”
Of course , Hussein did tell the U.N. to “ come on in , check it out . ”
In fall 2002 , Hussein ’s government allowed teams of U.N. inspectors into Iraq and gave them free rein to examine any site of their choosing .
Then , on Dec. 7 , 2002 , Iraq sent to the United Nations a 12,000 - page declaration explaining how its WMD stockpiles had been eliminated .
At the time , the Bush administration – and much of the Washington press corps – mocked those efforts as proof that the Iraqis were continuing their WMD cover - up .
The U.N. inspections continued into March 2003 when Bush decided to press ahead with war and forced the inspectors to leave .
After the invasion , U.S. weapons inspectors also found no WMD and concluded that the Iraqis had been telling the truth .
But none of that reality is part of the history that Americans are supposed to know .
The officially sanctioned U.S. account is that Saddam Hussein “ chose war ” by defying the U.N. over the WMD issue .
As recently as this year , a major U.S. news outlet was still spreading Bush ’s false history .
In January , CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes ” ran a segment with Hussein ’s FBI interrogator , George Piro , with correspondent Scott Pelley musing over the mystery of why Hussein did n’t simply stop the U.S. invasion by admitting his WMD was gone .
“ For a man who drew America into two wars and countless military engagements , we never knew what Saddam Hussein was thinking , ” Pelley said in introducing the segment on the interrogation of Hussein about his WMD stockpiles .
“ Why did he choose war with the United States ? ”
In the interview , Pelley presses Piro on the question of why Hussein was hiding the fact that his WMD was gone .
Piro said Hussein explained to him that “ most of the WMD had been destroyed by the U.N. inspectors in the ‘ 90s , and those that had n’t been destroyed by the inspectors were unilaterally destroyed by Iraq . ”
“ So , ” Pelley asked , “ why keep the secret ?
Why put your nation at risk , why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade ? ”
After Piro mentioned Hussein ’s lingering fear of neighboring Iran , Pelley felt he was close to an answer to the mystery : “ He believed that he could n’t survive without the perception that he had weapons of mass destruction ? ”
But , still , Pelley puzzled over why Hussein ’s continued in this miscalculation .
Pelley asked : “ As the U.S. marched toward war and we began massing troops on his border , why did n’t he stop it then ?
And say , ‘ Look , I have no weapons of mass destruction , ’ I mean , how could he have wanted his country to be invaded ? ”
Within the prestigious U.S. press corps , up had truly become down .
More Than Gullible McClellan ’s book may add weight to our argument that the major U.S. news media has been more than a little gullible .
In our view , there is now an ingrained bias within the Washington press corps – after three decades of fat rewards and harsh punishments – to tilt stories to the right .
The new book also adds details about how Bush intentionally led the nation into war by shading the truth and manipulating events .
McClellan writes that Bush “ managed the crisis in a way that almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option . ”
The sales campaign was laid out by Bush advisers in summer 2002 , McClellan said .
“ Top Bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the war , ” McClellan writes .
“ In the permanent campaign era , it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the President ’s advantage . ”
However , McClellan remains unwilling to use direct language in addressing Bush ’s long pattern of dishonesty .
The former press secretary lays some of the blame for Bush 's falsehoods on his “ lack of inquisitiveness ” or a tendency toward “ self - deception . ”
But the evidence is clear : Bush is liar .
If further evidence were required , there is McClellan ’s anecdote about Bush telling aides during Campaign 2000 that he could not remember whether he had used cocaine .
“ I remember thinking to myself , ‘ How can that be ? ’ ” McClellan wrote , according to the Washington Post ’s preview of the book .
It would seem to be long past the time for anyone to be making excuses for George W. Bush – or the elite U.S. press corps – not with the horrendous price paid by the Iraqi people , American soldiers and U.S. taxpayers .

( Natural News ) Police in Ozark , Alabama , Tasered and arrested an unconscious , sober man who was having a diabetic seizure on November 6 , then charged him with drunk driving and resisting arrest .
James Bludsworth , 54 , was pulling a trailer in his black Nissan truck when he began to have a diabetic seizure .
Bludsworth promptly pulled over to the side of the road , where he passed out .
After receiving a call about the truck and trailer parked on the side of the road , three police cruisers responded to the scene .
When Bludsworth failed to respond to their commands , the officers fired Tasers at his unconscious body three times .
A
Taser is a type of electroshock weapon that fires small metal darts attached to the gun by wires , then administers an electric shock that disrupts nerve and muscle function and induces severe pain .
Bludsworth was then taken to the Dale County Jail and charged with resisting arrest , drunk driving and a towing infraction .
He was not given medical attention .
After posting $ 1,000 bail and scoring 0.00 blood alcohol on a breathalyzer test , Bludsworth was released .
The towing infraction was dropped , but the criminal charges against him remain .
Ozark Deputy Police Chief Myron Williams defended the officers ' response to the situation , saying that the unconscious man was " combative . "
"
The officers were looking for a medical alert bracelet that would signify some medical condition , and he did n't have one , " Williams said .
" The officer asked [ Bludsworth ] how much had he been drinking and he said ' a whole lot . '
The officer also asked him did he need an ambulance and he said ' no .
'" One of the responding officers now says that he smelled alcohol on Bludsworth 's breath at the time .
The officers involved in the incident will not be disciplined .
Bludsworth has another court date in December , at which point his arresting officer will have the option to recommend that the charges against him be dropped .
A further batch of secret government files have been found on a train , it was reported tonight .
The Independent on Sunday newspaper said that the papers , which were handed in to it , covered the UK 's policies on fighting global terrorist funding , drugs trafficking and money laundering .
The paper said that they were discovered on a train bound for London 's Waterloo station on Wednesday .
The documents apparently include briefing notes for a meeting of the international Financial Action Task Force to be held in 11 Downing Street next week .
They contained details of how trade and banking systems could be manipulated to finance illicit weapons of mass destruction in Iran .
They also discussed methods of terrorist funding and the potential fraud of commercial websites and international internet payment systems .
A Treasury spokesman said : " We are extremely concerned about what has happened and we will be taking steps to ensure that it does n't happen in the future . "
The papers were found on the same day that another batch of secret papers relating to intelligence assessments of Iraq and al - Qaida were handed to the BBC after being left by a senior official on a train .
Government sources last night played down suggestions the two incidents were linked .
The Independent on Sunday said it had returned the documents and would not be divulging any details contained in them .
Not surprisingly , the January 2007 issue of the American Journal of Imperial Law–otherwise known as the self - styled American Journal of International Law but founded and still operated by U. S. State and War Departments ’ apparatchiks and their professorial fellow - travelers — published an article by Harvard Law School ’s recently retired Bemis Professor of International Law Detlev Vagts ( who only taught me the required course on Legal Accounting ) arguing in favor of the Pentagon ’s Kangaroo Courts System on Guantanamo despite the fact that they have been soundly condemned by every human rights organization and every human rights official and leader in the entire world as well as by the United States Supreme Court itself in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld ( 2006 ) .
I am not going to bother to recite here all the grievous deficiencies of the Gitmo Kangaroo Courts under International Law and U.S. Constitutional Law .
But suffice it to say that the Gitmo Kangaroo Courts constitute war crimes under the Laws of War , the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 , and even the U. S. Army ’s own Field Manual 27 - 10 , The Law of Land Warfare ( 1956 ) .
Field Manual 27 - 10 was drafted for the Pentagon by my Laws of War teacher the late , great Richard R. Baxter , who was generally recognized as the world ’s leading expert on that subject , which is precisely why I voluntarily chose to study International Law with him and his long - time collaborator Louis B. Sohn , and not with the bean - counter Vagts .
For the entire post - World War II generation of international law students at Harvard Law School , Louis Sohn shall always be our real Bemis Professor of International Law and never the False Pretender to that Throne known as Detlev Vagts .
Since those student days I have personally appeared pro bono publico in five U.S. military courts - martial proceedings involving warfare that were organized in accordance with the Pentagon ’s Uniform Code of Military Justice ( U.C.M.J. ) — which still does not apply to the Gitmo Kangaroo Courts despite the ruling by the U. S. Supreme Court in Hamdan that the U.C.M.J. should be applied in Guantanamo — on behalf of five U. S. military personnel who each acted as matters of courage , integrity , principle , and conscience at great risk to their freedom :
U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Jeff Paterson , the first U.S. military resister to President Bush Sr. ’s genocidal war against Iraq ; Army Captain Doctor Yolanda Huet - Vaughn , the highest ranking U.S. commissioned officer to be court - martialed for refusing to participate in President Bush Sr. ’s genocidal war against Iraq ; Captain Lawrence Rockwood , who was court - martialed by the U.S.
Army for trying to stop torture in Haiti after the Clinton administration had illegally invaded that country in 1994 ; Army Staff Sergeant Camilo Mejia , the first U.S. military resister to be court - martialed for refusing to participate in President Bush Jr. ’s war of aggression against Iraq ; and Army First Lieutenant Ehren Watada , the first U.S. commissioned officer to be court - martialed for his refusal to participate in President Bush Jr. ’s war of aggression against Iraq .
As I can attest from my direct personal involvement , each and every one of these five courts - martial under the U.C.M.J. were Stalinist show - trials produced and directed by the Pentagon that predictably and readily degenerated into travesties of justice .
These five U.C.M.J. courts - martial involving warfare each proved correct the old adage attributed to Groucho Marx that military justice is to justice as military music is to music .
By comparison , the Gitmo Kangaroo Courts will not even be run in accordance with the U.C.M.J. despite the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan that they should be .
Whenever they are up and running the Gitmo Courts will constitute Stalinist Show Trials as well as Kangaroo Courts , and their preliminary proceedings have already proven them to be Travesties of Justice .
Even worse yet , fully - functioning Stalinist Gitmo Kangaroo Courts will quickly become conveyor - belts of death for alleged and already tortured terrorist suspects along the lines of the Texas execution chamber operated by George Bush Jr. when he was the “ governor ” of that state and tortured to death 152 victims by means of lethal injection .
Gitmo will become America ’s Death Camp .
But today under the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 , executing persons detained as a result of armed conflict without a fair trial before a regularly constituted court constitutes a grave war crime .
To be sure , under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution Professor Vagts has the freedom to advocate war crimes so long as he does not participate in their commission , or incite them , or aid and abet them .
But precisely where is that line to be drawn for law professors ?
In this regard , the Harvard Law School Faculty currently has at least five professors who have advocated torture and war crimes :
Vagts himself , who supported abusing the then recently captured President of Iraq Saddam Hussein despite his being publicly acknowledged to be a Prisoner of War by the Bush Jr. administration itself and thus absolutely protected by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Convention against Torture ; the infamous Alan Dershowitz , a self - incriminated war criminal in his own right .
Dersh publicly acknowledged being a member of a Mossad Committee for approving the murder and assassination of Palestinians , which violates the Geneva Conventions and is thus a grave war crime ; the Neo - Con Con Law non-entity known as Richard Parker ;
Another one of my teachers , Waco Phil Heymann .
Previously Waco Phil had been Deputy to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno , the Butcheress of Waco .
Reno ordered the Waco Massacre , while Heymann orchestrated its cover - up and thus earned his well - deserved sobriquet of Waco Phil .
All those incinerated women and children !
The war criminal Jack Goldsmith who while working as a lawyer for the Bush Jr. administration at both the Pentagon and later its Department of In - Justice did much of the legal spade - work designing , justifying and approving the hideous human rights atrocities that the Bush Jr. administration has inflicted on everyone after 9/11 .
Goldsmith and his co-felon legal colleague from the Bush Jr. administration Professor John Yoo — now desecrating Berkeley ’s Law School where my friend and colleague the late , great Dean Frank Newman had taught Human Rights–are functionally analogous to Nazi Law Professor Carl Schmitt , who justified every hideous atrocity that Hitler and the Nazis inflicted on anyone .
Despite my best efforts to prevent it , the Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans hired the war criminal Goldsmith right out of the Bush Jr. administration knowing full well that he was up to his eyeballs in the Gitmo Kangaroo Courts , torture , war crimes , enforced disappearances , murder , kidnapping , and crimes against humanity , at a minimum .
And when Goldsmith ’s proverbial “ smoking - gun ” Department of In - Justice Memorandum was published by the Washington Post , Harvard Law School ’s Dean Elena Kagan contemptuously boasted in response about how “ proud ” she was to have hired this notorious war criminal .
Previously Kagan had also publicly bragged that the future of International Legal Studies at Harvard Law School would be in the “ good hands ” of their resident war criminal Goldsmith .
How tragically true !
The Neo-Conservative Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans deliberately set out to hire this Neo - Nazi legal architect of the Bush Jr. administration ’s bogus and nefarious “ war against terrorism ” because they fully support it together with all its essential accouterments of torture , kangaroo courts , war crimes , murder , kidnapping , enforced disappearances , crimes against humanity , and Nuremburg crimes against peace .
By contrast , after the terrorist bombing of the Murrah Federal Building by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols in alleged revenge for the Waco Massacre and Cover - up by Janet Reno and Waco Phil Heymann , to the best of my recollection I do not remember that the Neo-Conservative Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans advocated kangaroo courts , torture , war crimes , and racist profiling for America ’s White Judeo - Christian Males .
Yet after 9/11 the fundamentally White Racist Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans have no problem with inflicting torture , kangaroo courts , war crimes , and racist profiling upon Muslims / Arabs / Asians of Color , which is exactly why they hired the war criminal Goldsmith to teach such criminal practices to their own law students and thus someday turn them into racist U. S. governmental war criminals in their own right .
This is because for the most part the Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans have always been viscerally bigoted and racist against Muslims / Arabs / Asians and other People of Color since at least when I first matriculated there in September of 1971 .
The Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans are no longer fit to educate Lawyers , Members of the Bar , and Officers of the Court .
They are a sick joke and a demented fraud .
Groucho
Marx would have had a field day with them : Harvard is to Law School as Torture is to Law .
The Harvard Law School Faculty and Deans torture the Law .
Do not send your children or students to Harvard Law School where they will grow up to become racist war criminals !
Harvard Law School is a Neo -Con cesspool .
The mother of a 5 - year - old - boy and her live - in girlfriend have been arrested in connection with what authorities describe as “ unbearable physical and psychological abuse ” of the child , police said Saturday .
The mother , Starkeisha Brown , 24 , turned herself in to the Los Angeles Police Department ’s 77th Street Division station late Friday night after officers made a public plea for help in finding the women and released their pictures .
Brown was being held without bail on charges of torture .
The other woman , Krystal Matthews , 21 , was arrested Saturday by detectives when she showed up for her appointment at the county Department of Children and Family Services .
She was being held on $ 100,000 bail on charges of willful harm or injury to a child .
Police said both women have a history of violence .

The boy , who was in guarded condition at a local hospital , was rescued Monday by a stranger who found him abandoned and called authorities .
On that same day , the two women had an appointment with the Department of Children and Family Services and had brought the healthy child of a mutual friend and tried to pass him off as Brown ’s son .
Police said the women routinely beat the boy , forced him to put his hands on a hot stove , burned his body and genitals with cigarettes and often would not let him eat or drink .
At a news conference Friday , LAPD Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell said that because of the burns from the stove , the boy no longer can open his hands .

Lt. Vincent Neglia of the LAPD ’s Abused Child Unit said in a statement Saturday that the abuse was “ akin to a level of torture we hope our military personnel would never encounter . ”
Residents in the South Los Angeles neighborhood where the boy lived said Saturday that they were shocked to hear of the child ’s treatment and disgusted by the abuse allegations against the mother and girlfriend .
“ I never knew a parent could do something like this .
It was just a shock , ” said Mary Williams , 68 , who lives in an apartment complex adjacent to where neighbors said Brown and Matthews live in the 11000 block of Figueroa Street .
Williams ’ 9 - year - old grandson saw the boy often , and occasionally the two played together .

“ How could you just do this and run off and leave him ? ” she said .
“ I hurt for that baby . ”
Another neighbor said , “ If I [ had known ] anything , they would ’ve been caught a long time ago . ”
The predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood is northwest of the intersection of the 110 and 105 freeways .
The street scape is dominated by modest apartment complexes and single - story homes , auto body and machine shops , liquor stores and small motels .
Across the street from the women ’s home is Holy Rock Baptist Church and an Ultra Oil gas station .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the poverty rate in the neighborhood , in the 90061 ZIP Code , is nearly triple the national average , and about 10 % of the population are homeowners .

I heart Granholm .
When have I ever said that ?
She 's an incredible communicator who really captures the mood of the country and blue collar workers after living under the Conservative agenda for almost eight years .
In the few minutes she had on The Situation Room Monday --- Governor Granholm quickly and easily deconstructed McCain 's talking points on every economic issue Wolf brought up .
I guess after all was said and done it comes down to one word : " McSame . "
Michigan is lucky to have her .
Download Download ( h/t billw )
GRANHOLM : I 'll tell you what blue collar American wants .
They want a change in the White House .
They do n't want a third Bush term .
Here in Michigan , in small towns across our state , where we have seen jobs go on a slow boat to China , on the Internet to India , or on a fast track to Mexico , we want to make sure that we have an investment , a manufacturing policy in this country that supports our job providers so we can keep jobs here .
Bush and McCain will further the unfair trade policies that have hurt states like Michigan .
People are mad in Michigan .
We 're mad that the Bush administration has stood idly by while we have lost almost 400,000 jobs since Bush became president .
Can you imagine that , Wolf ?
Four hundred thousand jobs .
That 's our own version of Hurricane Katrina , only it 's {trickled out} over the past seven and a half years .
So we need a change in the White House .
That 's what people are mad at .
They 're mad at a White House that has not paid attention to middle America .
I can imagine it .
Michigan is not the only state that has been devastated by the Bush doctrine .
I love the way she made sure to incorporate the " trickle down " principals of Conservatism in her response to McCain 's camp .
For McCain to say that Obama is out of touch with blue collar working Americans is laughable since he has stood side by side with the conservative agenda that has been an utter failure for our country .
I will say that the White House has paid attention to the fat cats on wall street .
They certainly have made a killing while Bush has been in office .
That 's why we will constantly hear screams of " Obama is a socialist --- run for the hills , " by the Saturday morning zombie stock show guests on FOX .
Transcript via CNN :
BLITZER : Well , we 've been telling our viewers Michigan has got the highest unemployment rate in the country now .
Serious economic problems , as you well know better than anyone in your state .
Here 's what John McCain says -- as bad as it is in Michigan right now , if Obama 's president , guess what ?
It could get a whole lot worse .
Listen to McCain .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : I believe that there are stark differences between myself and Senator Obama , whether it be he wants to raise taxes , I want to lower them .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BLITZER : And he says everyone in Michigan , indeed across the country , would have higher taxes .
He says given the hard economic times , this is about the worst time to go ahead and raise everyone 's taxes .
What do you say to that charge ?
GRANHOLM : Well , I do n't know if he 's been reading the economic plan , but the Obama plan has significant middle class , working class tax cuts .
In fact , there was a national study that is a neutral study which said that average Americans , middle class Americans , would see three times as much of a tax break under Obama than they would under McCain .
I mean , the bottom line is , McCain , I 'm not sure what his education policy is .
I 'm not sure what his energy policy is .
But Barack Obama came to Michigan today , to Flint , Michigan , which is the heart of the auto industry .
The reason why Michigan 's economy is so challenged because of this massive contraction in our automotive sector .
So he came right to the heart of the auto industry .
And what he said is that he is going to invest $ 150 billion in an entire energy sector of this country , creating jobs , millions of jobs in energy .
That , for a state like Michigan , is hugely important to hear .
He had specific plans for us .
BLITZER : All right .
I guess what McCain is suggesting is that if you start raising taxes , even for wealthy Americans , families making more than $ 200,000 or $ 250,000 a year , and you start increasing capital gains taxes , and other taxes related to investments , that 's going to hurt the aggregate , the overall U.S. economy .
And it will further make it difficult for job creation and everything else you want in Michigan .
GRANHOLM : Well , the whole point that Barack Obama was making is that you have to make strategic investments in the areas that you know will grow jobs .
He said that he would eliminate capital gains taxes on those entrepreneurs , the kind of jobs we want to create .
But the very , very , very wealthiest , they can afford to contribute to the investment in our country to allow people to be able to go to college .
Every economist will tell you that the smartest economic development strategy is making sure you have a skilled work force for those employers .
And that 's exactly what Barack Obama 's plan is .
BLITZER : McCain 's really been hitting Obama hard over the past few days about those so - called " bitter " comments he made during the primary against Hillary Clinton .
Listen to this latest -- this latest statement that McCain made just today .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : I wo n't tell them that in small towns across America and in Pennsylvania , that they are bitter or angry about their economic conditions , so therefore they embrace religion and the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States .
I will never do that .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BLITZER : All right .
Do you want to respond to that ?
Because he 's suggesting that Obama is simply out of touch with blue collar working Americans .
GRANHOLM : I 'll tell you what blue collar American wants .
They want a change in the White House .
They do n't want a third Bush term .
Here in Michigan , in small towns across our state , where we have seen jobs go on a slow boat to China , on the Internet to India , or on a fast track to Mexico , we want to make sure that we have an investment , a manufacturing policy in this country that supports our job providers so we can keep jobs here .
Bush and McCain will further the unfair trade policies that have hurt states like Michigan .
People are mad in Michigan .
We 're mad that the Bush administration has stood idly by while we have lost almost 400,000 jobs since Bush became president .
Can you imagine that , Wolf ?
Four hundred thousand jobs .
That 's our own version of Hurricane Katrina , only it 's trickled out over the past seven and a half years .
So we need a change in the White House .
That 's what people are mad at .
They 're mad at a White House that has not paid attention to middle America .
BLITZER : How big of a deal is it that Senator Obama 's going to have a special guest in Michigan with him later tonight .
The former vice president of the United States , Al Gore , will be in your beautiful state to make this ringing endorsement .
GRANHOLM : Well , if you 're making that announcement , I can't confirm .
But if it were true that Al Gore was coming here , I could tell you that it is a great statement .
We in Michigan want to reinvent Michigan .
We want to rebuild a clean , green state where technology and green technology and alternative energy and renewable energy is the sector of growth for job creation to replace those lost manufacturing jobs .
And I tell you , if you look at what Al Gore has done in elevating the dialogue about climate change and in taking action , he will tell you that this is -- yes , it 's good for the planet , but it 's also good for the economy and for jobs .
And that 's where Michigan stands right there .
BLITZER : Michigan 's going to be very busy over these next few months .
A battleground state .

It has long been considered the most troublesome character in the German alphabet .
But champions of the Eszett , which resembles a bloated B with a hole , were celebrating its red letter day after receiving official status following a century - long struggle for recognition .
The Eszett , or ß , which is unique to the German alphabet and is pronounced like the letter s , has been officially accepted as a lower and upper case alphabet figure by the International Organisation of Standardisation ( ISO ) which has granted it status in its club of " special consonants found in western European languages " .
The ruling comes as something of a blow to German spelling reformists who had been keen to scrap the Eszett from the alphabet altogether , arguing that because it was the size of a capital letter it was quite literally a waste of space .
Its use has already waned over the past decade following a ruling by a government - backed commission of educational experts who deemed it should be replaced by the letters " ss " in many cases .
Since then , officially the Eszett could only be used after long vowels and dipthongs .
The issue has been thoroughly confusing for a generation of schoolchildren , their teachers and parents .
In practical terms the ISO ruling now means that in future it should be easier to find the Eszett on computer keyboards and in programmes .
But it remains to be seen how keyboard manufacturers will react .
Other vulnerable European letters have come under threat in the internet era , such as the Scandinavian vowels æ , ø and å .
However , official recognition for the Eszett should mean that it is protected , at least for the time being , and cannot be scrapped as it has been in Swiss German .
Kerstin Güthert , managing director of the Council for German Spelling Reform , said : " It 's up to the people to decide whether or not they will use it . "
Germany 's typographers , at least , are predicting its comeback and celebrating the Eszett 's new - found status .
The entire recent edition of Signa , the journal of German signographers , was dedicated to the Eszett , which was presented in grand style in all its varied forms and fonts along with the argument that it is about time the letter was seen as " more than just a pumped up B " .
DIGG THIS
The web loves nothing more than a good brawl , so people often write me to ask me to respond to a critic of LRC or the Mises Institute .
There ’s certainly no shortage of them , and they come from the left , the right , and everything in between .
My first thought on the request is that the archive speaks for itself , and a response would amount to little more than reprinting .
And yet the criticisms in themselves are interesting because often they come from people who liked one thing we said and then felt betrayed by another thing we said , so we get praise for the first thing and attacked for the second thing .
There is a response to make that covers all these critics but first let me give you a better feel for what I ’m talking about .
Let ’s say that we run an article exposing how the corporate elites are working in league with the government to make profits from war and destruction .
The left cheers .
The next day we attack the idea of a new tax on corporations or some federal antitrust action , and come to the defense of big business .
The left screams betrayal and announces that our side of the debate has sold out .
On a much lower level , the same happens concerning party politics .
We attack Republicans and Democrats cheer .
Then we attack Democrats and they scream at us for failing to back the party to the end .
The same happens on the right .
One day we attack the organized victim lobby for pushing for government privileges for blacks , or gays , or women , or for using “ multiculturalism ” as a moral imperative to curb the right of free association .
The right celebrates that we have enlisted in the culture war !
The next day we attack Christians for demanding coerced prayer in coerced school or for backing surveillance in the war on drugs .
Then the Christian right says that we have sold our souls to the Devil .
Another example of a more complicated topic concerns immigration .
Throughout modern history , the state has used immigrants as a tool to ratchet up power for itself .
This takes the form of requiring tax - funded services like public schools and medical services , or in browbeating the citizens while enforcing anti-discrimination law .
Nor are citizens under these conditions permitted to notice the rise in crime that accompanies some immigration or the demographic upheavals that people resent .
The result of immigration waves is to diminish liberty for American citizens .
At the same time , anti-immigrationist sentiment can also be used by the state to expand its power .
In the name of a crackdown , the state invades the rights of business and demands documentation of every employee .
It sends its bureaucrats all over the country and works toward a national ID card .
It makes it virtually impossible for corporations to hire people , even temporary workers , from other countries , all in the name of national security or stopping immigration .
The state is happy to whip up nativist frenzy in the name of loving the homeland in order to enhance its power .
This harms productivity and makes us all less free .
So you see the problem here .
The state uses both pro- and anti-immigration sentiment in its favor .
So to battle this problem , the libertarian will be sympathetic with one point of view in one political context and another point of view in a different context .
It really depends on what kind of rhetorical apparatus the state is using at the moment .
The groups that deserve support are those that are resisting the state .
It is not unusual to see those very groups won over by the state at a later stage of development of statism , in which case libertarian sympathies have to change .
Murray Rothbard noted this his entire life .
When he was young , the resistance league was found among the remnants of the Old Right that opposed the New Deal and wartime planning .
But then the right was won over by the warfare state , and his sympathies changed to the point that he sided with the New Left against the state .
But of course the left then gained power and its ideologues sold out , and the right went into resistance mode again .
Murray chronicled the shifts while they took place while maintaining a hard and fast adherence to principle .
Let ’s look at recent political history to see how this works .
In the 1990s , the right was the resistance .
It battled Clintonian socialism and warfare internationalism .
It resented the regime ’s tendency toward centralization and its relentless putting down of the cultural attachments of the American bourgeoisie .
The resentment was felt intensely by the middle class , which swept George Bush into power on the promise of cutting government and a less belligerent foreign policy .
But the middle class had been bamboozled yet again , and the very cultural impulses that the Clinton regime attacked were used by the Bush regime as a means of expanding its domestic and international empire .
Christianity was invoked not as a reason to resist the state , but rather to obey it in all things , since Bush claimed its wars were godly and its domestic policy was moving Christianity to the front of the political bus .
The booboisie fell for it in every way , creating the scary political machine I ’ve called Red State Fascism .
So of course the red-staters are going to feel betrayed if they expect us to be sympathetic with their political impulses regardless of whether they are fighting the state or fighting for the state .
These are completely different motives with opposite results .
Power corrupts anyone who gets it , whether that is the right or the left or anything else in between .
And the consistent libertarian must battle power no matter what its color or variety .
This is what Mises did in his life .
Rothbard too .
So too for the entire liberal tradition .
The true liberal , in pursuit of fixed principles , must never have fixed political alliances .
They must change based on the ruling rationale of the moment .
Let me state this as plainly as possible .
The enemy is the state .
There are other enemies too , but none so fearsome , destructive , dangerous , or culturally and economically debilitating .
No matter what other proximate enemy you can name — big business , unions , victim lobbies , foreign lobbies , medical cartels , religious groups , classes , city dwellers , farmers , left - wing professors , right - wing blue - collar workers , or even bankers and arms merchants — none are as horrible as the hydra known as the leviathan state .
If you understand this point — and only this point — you can understand the core of libertarian strategy .
There were tremendous advances in state theory in the twentieth century .
Start with Franz Oppenheimer ’s The State ( 1908 ) .
Read A.J. Nock ’s Our Enemy , the State ( 1935 ) .
Learn from Chodorov ’s Rise and Fall of Society ( 1959 ) .
Turn to Rothbard ’s unsurpassed masterwork For a New Liberty ( 1973 ) .
To understand the historical sweep , see Martin Van Creveld ’s Rise and Decline of the State ( 1999 ) .
Then you will understand why we do what we do .
Until then , our critics remain unknowing dupes of the very forces they should be fighting .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
Nearly five years ago , legendary bike mechanic Hal Ruzal and I walked the streets surrounding Bicycle Habitat and graded the bike locking ability of New Yorkers - producing many humorous and enlightening anecdotes .
The resulting video aired frequently on bikeTV and at many festivals , and because of it - Hal is still frequently asked by complete strangers to judge their bike locking .
I always endeavored doing another , but as with most sequels you need a new wrinkle .
This time we thought we 'd give Hal some company and invited former Recycle a Bicycle mechanic Kerri Martin ( and founder of The Bike Church in Asbury Park , NJ ) to weigh in with her expertise .
Again , bikes on the streets of SoHo provide lots of fodder for laughs and lessons to learn .
We did n't plan to but we walked the same loop and even used the same one - hour time frame .
The results ?
The grades were a little better than five years ago .
Sure , still some bad locking out there , but many more people are now sporting multiple locks and better strategies !
Good news , maybe we made a difference after all ...

Around five years ago we made a video about how to lock your bicycle and we graded people in their locking job .
And we want to see if people have learned anything between now and five years ago .
My gut feeling is that they 're just as stupid as ever .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 0:39 ]
But I have a lot of experience at Recycle a Bicycle .
We saw a lot of bike theft .
So we heard every story there .
So , are you ready ?
Let 's cruise some bikes ?
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 0:46 ]
Yeah , let 's look for some bikes .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</ cite > [ 0:47 ] OK .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 0:47 ]
Let 's find some bikes .
What do we have here ?
</blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</ cite > [ 0:49 ]
OK .
Let 's look at this bike .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 0:51 ]
Let 's see , we have a frame and the rear wheel and the front wheel locked and the seat .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 0:59 ] Wow . </ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 0:59 ]
Whoa .
A hose clamp here , very nice .
That keeps your thief honest and it prevents the quick release from opening without somebody having either a screw driver or an eight millimeter wrench here to push the hose clamp off .
And that 's a square U - lock which you can't put a bolt cutter on .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 1:19 ]
It 's on a long enough pole .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 1:21 ]
The pole is in the ground quite securely .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 1:23 ]
I would say this is an A .
They can't really get away with this bike or any of the parts .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 1:29 ]
This is good .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 1:30 ]
This is pretty good .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 1:30 ]
The bike seems secure and the thing is , when it 's locked like this , you can't ride it away .
Except for one little problem , we 've got one little problem here .
I do n't know what that problem is .
Do you know what that problem is ?
I would give this bike a C .
This is $ 50 minimum .
This is a terrible bike with a really good lock .
Why'd they lock the front wheel ?
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 1:53 ]
There 's no point in leaving slack in this chain .
You might as well just go around the front wheel or the back wheel if it 's closer .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 1:59 ]
They still come in to ... on bike TV , your lock up guy .
I get this all the time , " Rate my lock . " </ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 2:06 ]
Do they bring you out to the street and they have you look at the lock ?
Is it good Hal ?
Is it good ?
</blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 2:12 ]
So look , here we have the carcass .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 2:13 ]
Oh ! </blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 2:14 ]
The Huffy Tempest .
He meant well .
They got the best lock you can buy .
The seat is locked , but duh .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 2:25 ]
Yeah , the problem here is , I think , people themselves do n't know how to take a rear wheel off .
They think it 's all complicated with all those pesky gears and everything in the back .
So they think , " Oh , the bike thief is n't going to take it off either . "
But we 're dealing with professionals here .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 2:38 ]
To replace it costs you $ 120 .
You might as well buy another Huffy at Kmart , that costs $ 99 .
This is an F , because it 's unridable .
Now this is cute .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 2:48 ]
This is just art .
Right ?
Or is this actually ...? </blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 2:51 ]
The front wheel is locked .
The rear wheel is locked .
And the fender is locked .
I give it an A because the bike is so crappy .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 3:00 ]
And it literally has bird crap on it .
So then this bike could just be here forever , Hal. </blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 3:06 ]
It could be .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 3:07 ]
OK .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 3:08 ]
Wow . </ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 3:09 ]
We 've got two bikes here .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 3:10 ]

They bought the craptonite lock .
There 's the rear wheel , they think it 's secure , but thieves have a five millimeter Allen wrench .
You could steal this rear wheel in two seconds .
You could steal the seat , also , with the same wrench .

And that seat too , that catches the eye .

That 's a nice seat .
I think both these people got left back in seventh grade together because you bought the worst U - lock you can buy .
You could break this lock so easily .
You stick a two by four in here , wedge it up against here and you can pop this in a matter of five seconds .
We 're giving these people a group D. </ blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 3:57 ] Group D. </blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 3:58 ]
Oh !
There you got these things .
These are your anti-theft locking skewers .
Those need a hammer and a chisel to break .
Has it on the front and the back wheel .

He or she has it on the front and also has the chain , this person had a bike stolen in the past and then they wanted this nice Kona and they did everything they could to make it theft - proof .
I think we have to give this guy a little credit .

I could probably chew through this .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 4:34 ]
I just want to steal it to get the lock because it 's so cute .
I do n't know .
It 's the eyes , the eyes are watching you .

This bike gets a B .
We 'll give this one an A , a C , and a C .
He only locked his front tire .
So they got the rest of the bike .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 4:55 ]
This is an A ; seat is locked , rear wheel is locked to the frame .
The only thing is ... </ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 5:02 ]
They could cut down the tree .
</ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 5:03 ]
Yeah , but that 's ... I do n't even think thieves do that .
We have a $ 300 rear wheel that 's not locked .
We give this bike a D. </ blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 5:14 ] A D. </blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 5:15 ]
Nobody 's going to steal this thing .
You thought of your grandmother now .
She was 10 when she lost the bike ... </ blockquote > < blockquote class=" speaker_8_text " > < cite class= " speaker_8 " > Kerri:</cite > [ 5:22 ]
And she lost the key to the lock .
So do you think things have improved in five years ?
Do you think people have learned how to lock up properly ?
</ blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_7_text " > < cite class= " speaker_7 " > Hal :</ cite > [ 5:30 ]
They 're getting smarter .
After you get stuff stolen you realize you do n't want that happening again .
And they 're learning still .
Last time there were a whole mess of F's happening .

Nass , 2008
Press and blog reports are emerging this morning of an impending DDoS attack this weekend against CNN by Chinese hackers reportedly upset with the network 's coverage of the relationship between China and Tibet .
There 's some indication that CNN 's site may already be experiencing difficulties .
From The Dark Visitor , a blog that tracks " the inside world of Chinese hacker " :
Many more Chinese sites , not just hacker , starting to call for the DDOS attack on CNN .
Also they are starting to solidify their plans .
Here are the details from one posting on the Guilin University of Electronic Technology bulletin board : Attack will start on 19 April 2008 , at 8:00 pm DDOS attack on www.cnn.com
The DDOS attack is going to last over three hours
They need a large number of compromised computers to carry out the attack and are requesting everyone 's support in putting to together the number needed
There have been reports already of Internet users having difficulty accessing the CNN site .
Arbor Networks reports that it is monitoring nothing significant at the moment in terms of recent attacks directed at CNN , although there have been some .
These attacks were very small ; they barely registered , so it 's hard to say that they 're the massive onslaught that we may see this weekend .
It 's possible this is entirely unrelated - a lot of hackers try to bring down major websites like this every day .
Coincidentally , or at least apparently so , CNN recently did a detailed profile of an organization of Chinese hackers :
They operate from a bare apartment on a Chinese island .
They are intelligent 20 - somethings who seem harmless .
But they are hard - core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world 's most sensitive sites , including the Pentagon .
The leader of these Chinese hackers says there " is always a weakness " on networks that allows cyber break - ins .
The video portion of that CNN coverage can be seen here .
I 'm trying to get some reaction from CNN .
( Saturday update : CNN acknowledges attempt on Thursday . )
( Another update : Guess that was much ado about very little . )
Dear Internet Service Provider :
This letter is written in response to your notification to me of a complaint received about my web page (s ) .
The pages in question are :

My response to this complaint is as follows : ( include all that apply from list below )
Allegations of Copyright Violation / Digital Millennium Copyright Act
The claims of copyright violation should be rejected because :
> The material in question is not copyrighted , or the copyright has expired .
It is therefore in the public domain and may be reproduced by anyone .
> The complainant has provided no copyright registration information or other tangible evidence that the material in question is in fact copyrighted , and I have a good faith belief that it is not .
The allegation of copyright violation is therefore in dispute , and at present unsupported .

> My use of the material is legally protected because it falls within the " fair use " provision of the copyright regulations , as defined in 17 USC 107 .
If the complainant disagrees that this is fair use , they are free to take up the matter with me directly , in the courts .
You , the ISP , are under no obligation to settle this dispute , or to take any action to restrict my speech at the behest of this complainant .
Furthermore , siding with the complainant in a manner that interferes with my lawful use of your facilities could constitute breach of contract on your part .

Man - in - the - Middle Attacks
Last week ’s dramatic rescue of 15 hostages held by the guerrilla organization FARC was the result of months of intricate deception on the part of the Colombian government .
At the center was a classic man - in - the - middle attack .
In a man - in - the - middle attack , the attacker inserts himself between two communicating parties .
Both believe they ’re talking to each other , and the attacker can delete or modify the communications at will .
The Wall Street Journal reported how this gambit played out in Colombia :
“ The plan had a chance of working because , for months , in an operation one army officer likened to a ‘ broken telephone , ’ military intelligence had been able to convince Ms. Betancourt ’s captor , Gerardo Aguilar , a guerrilla known as ‘ Cesar , ’ that he was communicating with his top bosses in the guerrillas ’ seven - man secretariat .
Army intelligence convinced top guerrilla leaders that they were talking to Cesar .
In reality , both were talking to army intelligence . ”
This ploy worked because Cesar and his guerrilla bosses did n’t know one another well .
They did n’t recognize one anothers ’ voices , and did n’t have a friendship or shared history that could have tipped them off about the ruse .
Man - in - the - middle is defeated by context , and the FARC guerrillas did n’t have any .
And that ’s why man - in - the - middle , abbreviated MITM in the computer - security community , is such a problem online : Internet communication is often stripped of any context .
There ’s no way to recognize someone ’s face .
There ’s no way to recognize someone ’s voice .
When you receive an e-mail purporting to come from a person or organization , you have no idea who actually sent it .
When you visit a website , you have no idea if you ’re really visiting that website .
We all like to pretend that we know who we ’re communicating with — and for the most part , of course , there is n’t any attacker inserting himself into our communications — but in reality , we do n’t .
And there are lots of hacker tools that exploit this unjustified trust , and implement MITM attacks .
Even with context , it ’s still possible for MITM to fool both sides — because electronic communications are often intermittent .
Imagine that one of the FARC guerrillas became suspicious about who he was talking to .
So he asks a question about their shared history as a test : “ What did we have for dinner that time last year ? ” or something like that .
On the telephone , the attacker would n’t be able to answer quickly , so his ruse would be discovered .
But e-mail conversation is n’t synchronous .
The attacker could simply pass that question through to the other end of the communications , and when he got the answer back , he would be able to reply .
This is the way MITM attacks work against web - based financial systems .
A bank demands authentication from the user : a password , a one - time code from a token or whatever .
The attacker sitting in the middle receives the request from the bank and passes it to the user .
The user responds to the attacker , who passes that response to the bank .
Now the bank assumes it is talking to the legitimate user , and the attacker is free to send transactions directly to the bank .
This kind of attack completely bypasses any two - factor authentication mechanisms , and is becoming a more popular identity - theft tactic .
There are cryptographic solutions to MITM attacks , and there are secure web protocols that implement them .
Many of them require shared secrets , though , making them useful only in situations where people already know and trust one another .
The NSA - designed STU - III and STE secure telephones solve the MITM problem by embedding the identity of each phone together with its key .
( The NSA creates all keys and is trusted by everyone , so this works . )
When two phones talk to each other securely , they exchange keys and display the other phone ’s identity on a screen .
Because the phone is in a secure location , the user now knows who he is talking to , and if the phone displays another organization — as it would if there were a MITM attack in progress — he should hang up .
Zfone , a secure VoIP system , protects against MITM attacks with a short authentication string .
After two Zfone terminals exchange keys , both computers display a four - character string .
The users are supposed to manually verify that both strings are the same — “ my screen says 5C19 ; what does yours say ? ” — to ensure that the phones are communicating directly with each other and not with an MITM .
The AT&T TSD - 3600 worked similarly .
This sort of protection is embedded in SSL , although no one uses it .
As it is normally used , SSL provides an encrypted communications link to whoever is at the other end : bank and phishing site alike .
And the better phishing sites create valid SSL connections , so as to more effectively fool users .
But if the user wanted to , he could manually check the SSL certificate to see if it was issued to “ National Bank of Trustworthiness ” or “ Two Guys With a Computer in Nigeria . ”
No one does , though , because you have to both remember and be willing to do the work .
( The browsers could make this easier if they wanted to , but they do n’t seem to want to . )
In the real world , you can easily tell a branch of your bank from a money changer on a street corner .
But on the internet , a phishing site can be easily made to look like your bank ’s legitimate website .
Any method of telling the two apart takes work .
And that ’s the first step to fooling you with a MITM attack .
Man - in - the - middle is n’t new , and it does n’t have to be technological .
But the internet makes the attacks easier and more powerful , and that ’s not going to change anytime soon .

I thought for sure I could do 100 ...
I work out and run regularly .
I tested out at 35 .
I probably could have done more but I had the rest of my workout to do and I did n't want to waste all of my energy .
I am going to follow this though .
Might as well .
Hassan Nasrallah insisted Hezbollah had a right to defend itself
The leader of Hezbollah has said the Lebanese government 's decision to close down its private telecommunications network was a " declaration of war " .
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah warned that the move was " for the benefit of America and Israel " and vowed to " cut off the hand " that tries to dismantle it .
" We are now embarking on a totally new era , " he told a news conference .
Earlier , the army warned its unity was at risk if the ongoing political crisis and civil unrest in Beirut continued .
The capital has been largely paralysed by roadblocks set up by opposition supporters during a second day of protests which started as a strike over pay .
We have the right ... to defend ourselves , to defend our weapons , to defend our resistance and to defend our existence
Hassan Nasrallah
Leader of Hezbollah
There have also been heavy , sustained gun battles on Thursday in the Corniche al - Mazraa and Ras al - Nabaa districts of West Beirut between Sunni and Shia fighters , and the army remains out in force in parts of the city .
The Shia factions , led by Hezbollah , oppose the Western - backed government , while the Sunni and Druze factions support it .
The UN Secretary General , Ban Ki-moon , urged both sides " to cease immediately these riots and to re-open all roads in the country " .
' New era ' Lebanon 's Western - backed government declared Hezbollah 's extensive fixed - line telecommunications network covering its strongholds of south and east Lebanon , and southern Beirut , illegal on Tuesday , saying it was a threat to state security .
The main roads to the international airport are blocked by barricades
Enlarge Image
Sheikh Nasrallah said Hezbollah 's network was its most important weapon against foreign aggressors , and warned that any attempt to dismantle it would be resisted .
" This decision is first of all a declaration of war and the launching of war by the government ... against the resistance and its weapons for the benefit of America and Israel , " he said .
" Whoever declares war against us and who launches a war against us even if he 's our father or brother , or just a political opponent , we have the right to confront him to defend ourselves , to defend our weapons , to defend our resistance and to defend our existence . "
Sheikh Nasrallah said his group 's military wing , the Islamic Resistance , regarded the network as " the most important part " of its defensive measures and explained how it played a key role in its conflict with Israel in 2006 .
What happened in Lebanon is a rehearsal of what the small country is expected to witness over the coming days
Jordan 's al - Dustur newspaper
Mid-East press alarm over strike
He demanded the government therefore rescind its decision and also reinstate the head of security at Beirut international airport , Brig Gen Wafiq Shuqeir .
The government suspects him of sympathising with Hezbollah , and accused him of failing to deal with a secret camera allegedly set up by Hezbollah to monitor the movement of aircraft and VIPs .
But Sheikh Nasrallah insisted the general was not a member of any opposition group , merely a neutral member of the armed forces .
Appeal for calm
The Hezbollah leader 's remarks came after many people in Beirut awoke for the second day running to find their city largely brought to a halt by roadblocks of burning tyres and bulldozed earthworks .
The army was deployed in key thoroughfares and crossroads dividing Beirut itself from the mainly Shia southern suburbs .
But troops were not moved into densely built - up , heavily populated neighbourhoods nearby .
The protests and disruption have affected all parts of the country Many streets have been blocked off by local residents , with young men on a high state of alert , ready to defend their own neighbourhoods .
About a dozen people were injured on Wednesday , mostly by stones , officials said .
Opposition supporters continued to block the roads to Beirut 's international airport for a second day , leading to the cancellation of flights .
There were also clashes in the eastern Bekaa Valley , in which at least five people were wounded according to officials , and the main motorway leading to Syria was cut , heightening Beirut 's isolation .
The Lebanese army command later warned that the " continuation of the situation ... is a clear loss for all and harms the unity of the military institution " .
In recent years , the army has been seen as one of Lebanon 's most neutral institutions , but correspondents say the recent clashes could draw it into the conflict .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that for the moment , it seems to be a tense stand - off , with everybody waiting to see if a way can be found to break the political deadlock .
It clearly would take very little to set off a conflagration that would be very hard to stop if shooting started in earnest , and blood was shed , he says .
Lebanon is currently witnessing its deepest political crisis since the civil war and has been without a head of state for five months because of the internal power struggle .

What are these ?
I always find it interesting as to why some stories get traction in the mainstream media and why some do n’t .
In online science discussions , the fate of this years summer sea ice has been the focus of a significant betting pool , a test of expert prediction skills , and a week - by - week ( almost ) running commentary .
However , none of these efforts made it on to the Today program .
Instead , a rather casual article in the Independent showed the latest thickness data and that quoted Mark Serreze as saying that the area around the North Pole had 50/50 odds of being completely ice free this summer , has taken off across the media .
The headline on the piece “ Exclusive : no ice at the North Pole ” got the implied tense wrong , and I ’m not sure that you can talk about a forecast as evidence ( second heading ) , but still , the basis of the story is sound ( Update : the headline was subsequently changed to the more accurate “ Scientists warn that there may be no ice at North Pole this summer ” ) .
The key issue is that since last year ’s dramatic summer ice anomaly , the winter ice that formed in that newly opened water is relatively thin ( around 1 meter ) , compared to multi - year ice ( 3 meters or so ) .
This new ice formed quite close to the Pole , and with the prevailing winds and currents ( which push ice from Siberia towards Greenland ) is now over the Pole itself .
Given that only 30 % of first year ice survives the summer , the chances that there will be significant open water at the pole itself is high .
The actuality will depend on the winds and the vagaries of Arctic weather – but it certainly bears watching .
Ironically , you will be able to see what happens only if it does n’t happen ( from these web cams near the North Pole station ) .
This is very different from the notoriously over - excited story in the New York Times back in August 2000 .
In that case , the report was of the presence of some open water at the pole – which as the correction stated , is not that uncommon as ice floes and leads interact .
What is being discussed here is large expanses of almost completely ice - free water .
That would indeed be unprecedented since we ’ve been tracking it .
So why do stories about an geographically special , but climatically unimportant , single point traditionally associated with a christianized pagan gift - giving festival garner more attention than long term statistics concerning ill - defined regions of the planet where very few people live ?
I do n’t really need to answer that , do I ?
Global military contractor BAE Systems has announced that it will lead a large alliance of American academics in building an army of miniature robots to aid the US military .
The effort , known as Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology ( MAST ) , will receive $ 38 m of US Army funding .
“ Robotic platforms extend the warfighter 's senses and reach , providing operational capabilities that would otherwise be costly , impossible , or deadly to achieve , ” said Dr. Joseph Mait , MAST supremo at the US Army Research Lab .
The horde of robots scraped the pork barrel clean
The idea is that a variety of crawling or flying mini-droids will be produced , able to go into situations where human troops might fear to tread - caves , bunkers , mountains , hostile urban areas etc .
The robo - bug army would then spy out targets and intel for human commanders to act upon .
Under MAST various enabling technologies will be advanced : " small - scale aeromechanics and ambulation ; propulsion ; sensing , processing and communications ; navigation and control ; microdevices ... " and so forth , according to BAE .
“ The technologies that will be developed under MAST represent capabilities and techniques that will influence nearly all of the products that BAE Systems will develop and produce in the future , ” added Steve Scalera , MAST manager for BAE Systems .
That would seem to be a controversial statement if Scalera was talking about the worldwide parent company BAE Systems , originally based on the UK 's nationalised aviation industry as British Aerospace .
But in fact it will not be British engineers who develop MAST ; rather , this work will be done by some of BAE 's US workforce , which has burgeoned as the firm 's UK payroll has shrunk .
In 2000 , BAE used some of the money it had made in Britain and Saudi Arabia to buy up Lockheed Martin 's electronics and infosystems businesses in North America for $ 1.3bn .
It is these companies which will do the MAST work in cooperation with a raft of top US universities ; but export of such technology throughout BAE would be strictly forbidden .
There is supposed to be an internal company " firewall " which prevents valuable US military tech from moving overseas .
That firewall may soon be bypassed in the case of products which will only be used by the UK military , under the terms of a planned treaty , but anything which might get sold on to other parties ought to be subject to normal US export controls .
Since a lot of BAE products are marketed outside the UK and US , this should mean that little of the MAST technology can be used by the parent company .
Still , perhaps Scalera was referring to BAE Systems North America , now a major US arms player - which might in the not - too - distant future be the real parent company anyway . ®
The MPAA has won a jury conviction for criminal copyright infringement , opening the doors to many more cases like it in the future .
A federal jury convicted 26 - year - old Daniel Dove for both felony copyright infringement as well as conspiracy , the US Department of Justice announced on Friday .
Dove , the last remaining administrator of EliteTorrents.com who did not plead guilty , now faces up to 10 years in prison .
The case goes all the way back to 2005 , when investigators raided EliteTorrents and shut the site down with the help of the MPAA .
At the time , EliteTorrents was one of the most popular Bit Torrent trackers around and had gained notoriety for making available prerelease movies like Star Wars III : Revenge of the Sith .
Search warrants were served on 10 people in the US and the site admins immediately faced criminal charges .
Two administrators , Scott McCausland and Grant Stanley , pleaded guilty in 2006 in hopes of avoiding a jury trial .
Stanley got the first sentencing of five months in jail along with a $ 3,000 fine .
McCausland also ended up serving five months in prison before going on probation , part of which involved an odd request from his probation officer to start using Windows ( instead of Linux ) so that monitoring software could be installed on the machine .
Dove was the last holdout , refusing to plead guilty and apparently hoping that the jury would throw him a bone when he finally went to trial .
According to the DoJ , the jury was presented with evidence that Dove was in charge of a small group ( known as the " Uploaders " ) , recruiting members with high - speed Internet connections to seed illegal content to the rest of EliteTorrents ' users .
Dove apparently ran a server himself , distributing the content to the Uploaders first before they seeded it to the rest of the world at large .
Other evidence presented to the jury included " massive amounts " of software , video games , and music being made available through EliteTorrents , much of which was before they were officially available in stores .
The evidence was apparently enough to convince the jury of Dove 's involvement .
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and will be sentenced on September 9 , 2008 .
The FBI and DoJ do n't often go after file sharers as aggressively as they have in this case , but they appear willing to act when evidence collection has already been done for them .
US Attorney John Brownlee 's office acknowledged in 2006 that much of the evidence used in the case was supplied by the MPAA , showing that the recording industry can indeed convince the government to help fight its legal battles .
With legal precedent on its side from cases like this and Jammie Thomas ( even if Thomas may soon get a new trial ) , the recording industry is likely even more confident than ever before .
The MPAA and RIAA are sure to keep going , supplying new evidence to law enforcement in hopes of winning even more convictions .
Further reading :
The 2006 political season may be creating some California history : a governor and lieutenant governor candidate running for election as a team .
Not just a team in name -- the Republican ticket -- but in actual operation : coordinated messages , ads and schedules , including joint campaigning in conservative areas .
The governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately in California .
And although gubernatorial candidates often give lip service to cooperation , they have always ditched the “ running mate ” and sprinted off by themselves with their big bucks and own game plan .
But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state Sen. Tom McClintock ( R - Thousand Oaks ) already have been teaming up .
Schwarzenegger has been taking McClintock with him to fundraisers and offering him access to deep - pocket contributors .
In return , McClintock has been trying to provide the centrist governor with some credibility among conservatives , who regard the senator as their straight - talking hero .
Advertisement
McClintock has no major opposition for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination .
Three candidates are competing for the Democratic nomination : Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , Sen. Liz Figueroa of Fremont and Sen. Jackie Speier of Hillsborough .
The Schwarzenegger - McClintock pairing seems remarkable because the two Republicans could n’t be more opposite , personally and philosophically .
McClintock , 49 , is a trim , 6 - foot - 1 bookworm who loves to quote the Federalist Papers .
He ’s an articulate writer ( mostly opinion pieces ) and orator who wo n’t try to fuzz up an issue .
And , unlike Schwarzenegger , he ’s a career politician , first elected to the Legislature at age 26 as a “ taxpayer advocate . ”
Schwarzenegger takes credit for cutting the car tax , but it was McClintock who first made the steep levy a California issue in the late 1990s .
He crusaded for its elimination , pressuring Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature to gradually reduce the tax .
When Gov. Gray Davis ran out of money to balance the budget , he restored the tax to its high level , was smacked by Schwarzenegger and recalled .
Advertisement
So McClintock ’s influence on California politics has been felt , despite his being a maverick who does n’t always play ball in a party relegated to the legislative minority .
“ My role has always been to move the debate , ” he says .
There ’s plenty for McClintock to debate with Schwarzenegger -- especially borrowing .
This wo n’t be like a presidential ticket , with the running mate parroting every word of the presidential candidate .

“ I ’ll be among his strongest supporters when we agree and a voice of disagreement when we don’t , ” McClintock says .
“ And there are disagreements , clearly . ”
McClintock adamantly opposed Schwarzenegger ’s $ 15 - billion budget - balancing bond in 2004 .
And he argued against the governor ’s $ 68 - billion infrastructure bond package that recently failed to pass the Legislature .
The guy is nothing but consistent .
Both at a Republican state convention last month , where he was pitching the governor to conservatives , and in a Senate floor debate March 10 , when railing against Schwarzenegger - style borrowing , McClintock used virtually the same words :
“ Despite record levels of borrowing , we have nothing to show for it .
And despite record levels of spending , we ca n’t even scrape together enough money to build a decent road system , or educate our kids , or protect our families from predators . ”

He says that “ bonds should only be used for projects that will be around a generation from now when our children are still paying off the debt ....
Our generation has squandered long - term bonds to pay for day - to - day operating expenses ....
Our children are going to have their own potholes to fill . ”
Further , he adds , “ state bonds should be used only for projects that benefit the entire state ” -- and not provide pork for local parks , as Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is advocating .
So far , Schwarzenegger ’s strategists do n’t mind McClintock ’s independence and candor .
It keeps the senator credible and interesting , they say , and helps broaden the governor ’s base .
U.S. Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) played that role for President Bush in 2004 , the Schwarzenegger camp notes .

“ There ’s a McCain effect about him , ” says Rob Stutzman , a former Schwarzenegger advisor who ’s now a private consultant .
“ He ’s the honest politician people always are looking for .
“ I have an unproven theory :
In a race like lieutenant governor , where the public ’s hip to the fact that the job does n’t do anything , there ’s a real potential for people who do n’t agree with Tom ’s ideology -- like on abortion -- to give an honest politician their vote . ”
McClintock opposes abortion rights and most gun control , but seldom talks about either .
Stutzman ’s theory is challenged by Republican Tony Quinn , editor of the Target Book , which analyzes political races .

“ I ’ll believe McClintock can get elected statewide in California when you convince me Teddy Kennedy can get elected in Texas , ” Quinn says .
“ He speaks his mind .
So does Ted Kennedy .
“ McClintock has a chance to get elected if Arnold wins big and Democrats totally collapse . ”
McClintock ran twice for state controller , in 1994 and 2002 , and lost narrowly each time .
He made his biggest splash running for governor in the 2003 recall , garnering just 13.5 % of the vote but earning kudos for knowledge and frankness .
It ’s still seven months until November .
By then , Schwarzenegger and McClintock may not even be speaking .
That would be the norm for California .

Regardless , lieutenant governor is shaping up as one of the most intriguing state races this year .
And the winner will be an instant candidate for governor .

Obama attacks US Supreme Court decision barring death penalty for child rape
By Patrick Martin
26 June 2008
In an action that combines cynical political opportunism and outright reaction , Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate , has publicly denounced Wednesday ’s decision by the US Supreme Court outlawing the execution of people convicted of child rape .
The 5 - 4 majority , comprised of the four court liberals and conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote the decision , held that the death penalty could only be applied for crimes in which the victim was killed .
The court noted that only 6 states out of 50 permitted capital punishment for child rape , and held that this demonstrated a social consensus against such executions .
Commenting on the decision , Obama declared his support for the death penalty , both in principle and in the specific cases under consideration by the high court .
“ I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , ” he told a news conference in Chicago .
“ I think that the rape of a small child , six or eight years old , is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow , limited , well - defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable , that that does not violate our Constitution . ”
The Democratic presidential candidate argued that the high court had gone too far in restricting the powers of the states .
If the court had “ said we want to constrain the abilities of states to do this to make sure that it ’s done in a careful and appropriate way , that would have been one thing .
But it basically had a blanket prohibition and I disagree with that decision . ”
This line of argument dovetails with the dissenting opinion of Justice Samuel Alito , signed by the other three arch - reactionaries on the court , Chief Justice John Roberts , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , which was based largely on states ’ rights .
Alito wrote : “ The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave .
It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty .
The court provides no cogent explanation why this legislative judgment should be overridden . ”
Obama ’s line - up with the four most right - wing justices is in stark contrast to his response last week when an identical 5 - 4 majority ruled against the Bush administration and upheld the habeas corpus rights of prisoners held at Guantánamo in the name of the “ war on terror . ”
Obama supported the majority , while his Republican opponent sided with the conservative minority .
On the death penalty case , Obama and McCain came down on the same side .
During his years in the Illinois legislature Obama supported the death penalty , seeking only to limit it to the most heinous cases and to reduce the number of cases where innocent people were prosecuted , convicted and sent to death row .
In his most recent book , The Audacity of Hope , he wrote , “ I believe there are some crimes — mass murder , the rape and murder of a child — so heinous , so beyond the pale , that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment . ”
Obama ’s statement Wednesday goes considerably beyond this , and must reflect his political calculations about the upcoming presidential election , and beyond .
Press commentary presented Obama ’s statement as a deft political move that avoided a repetition of the supposedly disastrous stand taken by the Democratic presidential candidate 20 years ago , Michael Dukakis .
During a debate with Republican George H.W. Bush , Dukakis was asked whether he would maintain his opposition to the death penalty even if his wife Kitty were raped and murdered .
Dukakis said that he would , and came under ferocious attack from the Republican Party and the media as a result .
A nearer example for Obama , however , is the notorious conduct of Bill Clinton during the 1992 Democratic primary campaign , when he rushed back to Arkansas from the campaign trail to sign the death warrant for a mentally retarded black man , Ricky Lee Rector , who was subsequently executed .
Clinton ’s display of cold - bloodedness was an important episode in demonstrating to the American ruling elite that he would stop at nothing to defend their interests .
Obama faces somewhat similar circumstances as Clinton did in 1992 — he enters the general election campaign with a lead in the polls , and seeks to assuage doubts in decisive sections of the ruling class about his ruthlessness and determination .
Since he is not in an executive position like Clinton , who was governor of Arkansas when he first ran for president , Obama can demonstrate his willingness to shed blood only indirectly , by attacking the Supreme Court death penalty decision .
Wednesday ’s decision was the first Supreme Court ruling in more than 30 years on whether a crime other than murder can be grounds for capital punishment .
In its 1977 decision in Coker v. Georgia , the court ruled the death penalty for rape unconstitutional in the case of a 16 - year - old victim , but left open the possibility that the death penalty could be applied in cases where the victim was younger .
Louisiana became the first state to adopt such a death penalty provision in 1995 , and two men have been convicted and sentenced to death .
Both these sentences were set aside in the latest decision , Kennedy v. Louisiana .
Five other states — Texas , Georgia , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Montana — have enacted similar laws , but no one has yet been convicted or sentenced under them .
The Supreme Court majority cited both constitutional and practical reasons for overturning the Louisiana law .
The opinion written by Justice Kennedy declared , “ The constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments mandates that the State ’s power to punish be exercised within the limits of civilized standards ....
The incongruity between the crime of child rape and the harshness of the death penalty poses risks of overpunishment and counsels against a constitutional ruling that the death penalty can be expanded to include this offense . ”
Among the other concerns Kennedy cited were that extending the death penalty “ may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim , ” that such cases would involve “ the special risks of unreliable testimony ” from child victims , and that the sheer number of reported child rapes — 5,702 in 2005 alone — would overwhelm the court system if the death penalty were at issue .
The Louisiana case demonstrates many of these problems .
The man facing the death penalty , Patrick Kennedy , was convicted of raping his stepdaughter when she was eight years old .
The child originally said that she had been assaulted by two neighborhood teenagers , but changed her story six years after the event and identified her stepfather as the perpetrator .
Kennedy maintains his innocence .
Obama ’s rush to embrace the right - wing minority on the Supreme Court is a clear demonstration of his political trajectory .
Having become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — and given the overwhelming popular hostility to the Bush administration and the Republican Party , in a strong position to win the White House — he is moving rapidly to the right , seeking to demonstrate his reliability and fitness to govern from the standpoint of the financial aristocracy that really rules America .
In this context , the most pernicious role is played by those who bolster illusions in the “ progressive ” character of Obama and Democratic Party , even as their right - wing orientation is openly displayed .
This is the stance taken by the Nation , the weekly liberal magazine whose web site has published a grotesquely distorted defense of Obama ’s death penalty comments .
The magazine ’s Washington correspondent , John Nichols , writes :
“ It ought to come as no surprise that , while McCain rushed to exploit the Supreme Court decision for political purposes , Obama was circumspect .
He recognizes that the raw emotions associated with cases of this kind do not lend themselves to reasoned debate .
And , while a Feingold might recognize this as a teaching moment , Obama is a more cautious player .
But , on matters such as this , there is something to be said for a cautious response . ”
No matter how far to the right Obama goes , liberal apologists like the Nation will find words to justify and excuse him .
That is a measure of their own prostration before the American ruling class .

IT MAKES a spectacular sight .
To stop a fleeing car , a pursuing policeman nudges the front of his own car against the rear corner of a fugitive vehicle .
Then , by turning into the pursued car , the officer forces it into a jolting tailspin that brings it screeching to a halt .
This manoeuvre , known as the pursuit - intervention technique , was developed in California in the 1970s .
But it has dangerous repercussions , says Eddie Wren , a former traffic - control officer in Britain who is now the head of Advanced Drivers of America , a school for professional drivers in Williamsville , New York .
Injuries are common and spun cars , unless rapidly boxed in by patrol vehicles , can zoom off again .
Furthermore , the manoeuvre may be becoming less effective as new traction - control systems become more widely deployed .
At the same time , “ run-flat ” tyres are making another common method of stopping a vehicle — placing a strip of spikes across its path — less effective .
Even cars with ordinary tyres are not always incapacitated by the spikes .
Some career along on their wheel - rims at up to 160 kph ( 100 m ph ) , says Geoffrey Alpert , an expert in vehicle - pursuit litigation at the University of South Carolina , in Columbia .
The result is a lot of desperate high - speed chases , one in four of which result in someone getting injured , and causing 400 deaths a year in America alone .
One way to avoid the need for chases would be to track felonious vehicles electronically , instead of running after them .
StarChase , a company based in Virginia Beach , Virginia , has developed a way to do just that .
A pneumatic cannon is mounted on the pursuit car .
With the help of a guiding laser , it shoots a satellite - based tracking device , smothered in epoxy goo , onto the target vehicle , allowing the police to track the suspect without endangering the public .
The Los Angeles Police Department plans to deploy the system this year .
From the police 's point of view , however , it would be better if they could actually stop a runaway car by satellite , not just track it .
General Motors plans to allow them to do just that .
From September its OnStar service , which provides navigation and emergency services to drivers , will include a system called Stolen Vehicle Slowdown .
Police who believe a car to be stolen can ask an OnStar operator to disable its accelerator , while leaving the steering and brakes in working order .
Some people worry that hackers might take over the system .
But Chet Huber , OnStar 's boss , reckons that the benefits outweigh the risks .
Military systems could also find a civilian role .
Ron Madrid , an expert on non-lethal warfare , says that a new laser - warning system has proved particularly effective in reducing casualties at checkpoints in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The device , known as an “ optical distractor ” , floods the windscreen of a vehicle with a blinding green light .
It is often coupled with special loudspeakers that are able to project verbal instructions to halt into noisy vehicles from over 100 metres away .
Non-toxic , slippery chemicals , designed to prevent the wheels of a vehicle from gaining traction , are also in development , as are spiked nets which can be laid flat on roads to entangle wheels .
But one of the American army 's main areas of research is into devices that can shoot enough electromagnetic energy into a vehicle to shut off its engine .
According to Andy Mazzara , the director of the Institute for Non-Lethal Defence Technologies at Pennsylvania State University , prototypes of such devices use a laser to create an ionised channel of air through which an electromagnetic pulse is directed .
That pulse is capable of burning out the electronics in a car , including its engine - management system , without harming the occupants .
Its deployment is still a few years away .
But when it comes , runaway drivers will get a zapping they will never forget .

Coast to Coast AM with George Noory
In what is likely the first arrest for possession of salvia divinorum anywhere in the nation -- and definitely a first in North Dakota -- a Bismarck man now faces years in prison after he bought a few ounces of leaves on eBay .
Kenneth Rau , a bottling plant worker with an interest in herbalism , altered states , and religion and spirituality , was arrested by Bismarck police on April 9 when they searched his home looking for his adult son , who was on probation for drug charges .
Kenneth Rau
Police found a marijuana pipe , eight ounces of salvia leaf , a quantity of amanita muscaria mushrooms , and a number of other herbal products .
Rau now faces multiple charges , said Burleigh County States Attorney Cynthia Feland .
" He is being charged with possession of salvia with intent to deliver , as well as possession of psilocybin with intent , and possession of marijuana , " she said .
Although Rau told the Chronicle he thought he would be charged with a school zone violation as well , which would have made his intent offenses Class A felonies punishable by up to 20 years in prison , that is not the case , said Feland .
" He is not being charged with a school zone violation , " she affirmed .
( The psilocybin charges could go up in smoke .
The amanita muscaria mushrooms that he possessed are not controlled substances under federal law and , while hallucinogenic , do not contain psilocybin .
The active ingredient in amanita muscaria mushrooms is muscimole . )
Rau was being charged with possession with intent because of the weight of the leaves , she said .
" We look at the typical use quantity , " she said , " and it is similar to marijuana , with a typical use dose of .25 grams to .5 grams , and he had significantly more than that , " she said .
salvia leaves ( courtesy erowid.org )
Salvia divinorum , a member of the Mexican mint family , has been used by Mazatec shamans for hundreds of years .
Smoking or chewing the leaves , or more commonly , concentrated extracts , can produce intense , albeit short - lived hallucinogenic experiences .
While the plant has become notorious through YouTube videos of young people smoking it and behaving strangely , it is also of interest to " psychonauts , " or people attempting to explore consciousness through herbal means .
Researchers say that while salvia 's effects on consciousness may be disquieting , the plant has not been shown to be toxic to humans , its effects are so potent it is unlikely to be used repeatedly , and its active property , salvinorin A , could assist in the development of medicines for mood disorders .
There are hazards to messing with hallucinogens , one expert was quick to point out .
" It 's an hallucinogen , and while its hallucinogenic actions are different from those induced by LSD and other hallucinogens , it has the liabilities that hallucinogens do , " Bryan Roth , a professor of pharmacology at University of North Carolina 's School of Medicine , the man who isolated salvinorin A , told Drug War Chronicle last month .
" When people take it , they are disoriented .
If you do n't know where you are and you 're driving a car , that would be a bad experience . "
Still , said Roth , while it may make you freak out , it is n't going to kill you .
" There is no evidence of any overt toxicity , there are no reports in the medical literature that anyone has died from it .
The caveat is that there have been no formal studies done on humans , but the animal data suggests that it does n't kill animals given massive doses , and that 's usually -- but not always -- predictive for human pharmacology . "
The DEA considers salvia a drug of interest , but has yet to move to place it under the Controlled Substances Act .
A DEA spokesman told the Chronicle recently that the plant is being reviewed to see if it meets the criteria for inclusion on the list of controlled substances .
But driven by little more than the YouTube videos and the story of one Delaware youth whose parents blamed his suicide on salvia , state legislators have not waited for the DEA 's measured considerations to act .
Since Delaware became the first state to ban salvia , a handful of others , including North Dakota , followed suit .
Moves are currently afoot in a number of other states to join the club .
salvia ( and criminal defense ) ads on web version of ND news station report on Rau 's bust
Salvia became illegal in North Dakota on August 1 , after a bill sponsored by three Republican lawmakers , state Sens. Dave Oelke and Randel Christmann and state Rep. Brenda
Heller sailed through the legislature earlier this year .
None of the three legislators responded to Chronicle requests for comment this week .
After Rau was arrested earlier this month , Bismarck police warned that it could be only the beginning in the fight against the member of the mint family .
" It sure looks like there could be a market , based on the amount he had " , Lt. Bob Hass told reporters .
" This is the first we 've seen of it . "
Hass did not return Chronicle calls for comment this week .
While salvia information web sites like Salvia .
Net do place a single dose of salvia leaf at between .25 gram and one gram , similar to County Attorney Feland 's estimate , intent to deliver still seems a stretch .
" I bought eight ounces of leaf on eBay by bidding $ 32 for it , " said Rau .
" Now they 're charging me with possession with intent .
That 's silly .
Nobody wants leaves .
Everyone is buying those 10X and 20X and 30X extracts . "
[ Ed : Not to mention that on eBay one buys what is being offered a sale , not half or a tenth or twentieth of it . ]
Rau was also not impressed by the prosecutor 's dosage estimates .
" This is a clear ploy to exaggerate the number of saleable units , " he complained .
" These drug warriors have long used this ploy to make dealers out of everyone .
Accepting those figures , an ounce of Salvia Divinorum would give 120 doses and make anyone holding an ounce of it a dealer .
This is ridiculous since an ounce is clearly the standard saleable unit for leaf .
Applying the prosecutor 's standard marijuana dosage and saleable quantity would be the amount that would fit in the end of a pinch hitter .
This standard would make anyone holding even an eighth ounce of marijuana a dealer . "
Rau also scoffed at the notion that anyone is going to be buying fractions of an ounce of salvia leaf .
" You can buy an ounce online for as little as $ 10 , " he pointed out .
" Who is going to split that up into smaller quantities ?
Hell , you would probably end up spending more on baggies that you did on the leaf , " he said .
" This is ridiculous legislative overreaching , " said Rau of the new law .
" They only based it on those wacky YouTube videos , and even on those , you see people trying to abuse the stuff as much as possible and ham it up , and it still does n't hurt them .
And why jump from selling it in stores to making it a felony , " he asked , " do n't they do misdemeanors anymore ?
I did n't even know it was illegal here , and with their first prosecution they go for the max . "
The local TV station 's web site has inadvertently supported Rau 's point .
At the time of this writing , an online version of the news report about Rau 's arrest was still pulling up salvia ads by Google .
Rau emailed the link to Drug War Chronicle , proving that the salvia ads are showing up on computers in North Dakota .
A mild - mannered 46 - year - old , Rau 's interest in salvia derived from a broader interest in herbalism , religion and spirituality , as well as efforts to deal with his own inner demons .
" I read that salvia facilitates lucid dreaming , so I tried chewing some leaves before bed time , and it was interesting because I would see faces and remember names I had long forgotten . "
He also tried salvia as a cure for depression .
" I have some childhood issues to deal with .
They had me on Paxil , " he said .
" They want you to take their pharmaceuticals , but if you want to take an herbal remedy , they want to throw you in prison .
Are they going to save me from myself by throwing me in prison for years ? "
Now , Rau is fighting for his freedom , but there are n't many resources in North Dakota , and he does n't even have a lawyer yet .
" The ACLU does n't even list anyone in the state , " he said .
" I 've emailed the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project , but I have n't heard back from them yet . "
Still , he said , his arrest has motivated him .
" Maybe this is an opportunity for me to join the fight , " he said .
" I 've never been a drug user , never been arrested .
I started experimenting with this stuff because I thought it was legal .
I did n't want to get into trouble , but now they 're treating me just like some meth dealer . "
LAS VEGAS , NV — Federal Reserve Chairman Ben “ I Got Your Inflation Right Here ” Bernanke has been asked to stay away from the International Federation of Sump Pump Installers Convention currently being held in Las Vegas , Nevada , even though he is on the schedule as the keynote speaker .
“ Dat bum is giving us real bailout experts a bad name , ” explained event chairman LeRoy “ Bugs ” Razkler , owner of What ’s Sump , Doc? , the leading installer of sump pumps in the Midwest .
Razkler was referring to the bailout of the federal mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , a plan supported by Bernanke .
“ Do n’t forget dem Bears in New York he bailed out , ” said Razkler , probably meaning Bear Sterns , also a beneficiary of Bernanke ’s aid .
“ Why did n’t he bail out da bears in Chicago ?
Now dat ’s a team dat ’s drowning . ”
Since the Bear Sterns bailout , quarterly earnings in the sump pump industry – which is responsible for bailing out water - filled basements nationwide – have dropped 50 % .
“ Now everybody thinks we only help banks , rich people and Bernanke ’s friends , ” said the federation ’s president Steve Stills , owner of “ There ’s Sumpin ’ Happenin ’ Here , ” the largest sump installer in California .
“ Nobody wants to be associated with bailouts anymore , even when the water is up to the first floor . ”
Many in the industry have begun referring to themselves as “ Excess Liquid Extraction Engineers , ” but they complain that it ’s causing them to get a lot of calls for liposuctions .
The Fed chairman ’s office had no comment on the convention ’s snub .
Bernanke has been replaced as the main speaker by Curt “ Flood ” Smitley , a housing developer known for building homes in flood zones .
Curt ’s talk is entitled , “ How To Pass Inspection When You ’re Up To Your Neck In Violations . ”
Spike in Foreclosures Goes Beyond Subprime
Some people -- the usual suspects -- have claimed that foreclosures are primarily a sub - prime phenomenon .
That might have been mostly true much earlier in the cycle of credit and housing problems .
Sub - prime was the canary in the coal mine , with the financially weakest people most at risk of mortgage delinquency , default and foreclosure .
Today , however , foreclosures are moving up the socio-economic ladder :

Comments
The large brown block in central Maine is Penobscot County , which would be the Bangor metropolitan area ( although most of it is very rural ) .
The increase in foreclosure there is undoubtedly linked to the enormous jump in heating oil prices this past year .
The local utility , Bangor Hydro , reported in April that 50 percent of its residential customers were delinquent in their electricity bills .
This is because Maine law prohibits electricity shut - offs during the winter and customers were paying their heating oil bills and letting the electricity bill go unpaid until spring .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The top U.S. communications regulator said on Tuesday that an investigation of how Comcast Corp manages its network had raised further concerns about tactics the company has used to restrict Internet users who share movies and other material .
Comcast CEO Brian Roberts speaks at his keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevada January 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
Testifying before Senate lawmakers , U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin said Comcast had used a “ blunt ” technique to impose broad restrictions on peer - to - peer file - sharing .
“ Contrary to some claims , it does not appear that this technique was used only to occasionally delay traffic at particular nodes suffering from network congestion at that time , ” Martin said in prepared remarks before the Senate Commerce Committee .
Martin also disputed the claim by Comcast that the FCC does not have the legal authority to enforce its open - Internet policy .
He told the committee that the agency does not need any new laws or regulations to take action .
“ I do not believe any additional regulations are needed at this time .
But I also believe that the commission has a responsibility to enforce the ( open - Internet ) principles that it has already adopted , ” Martin said .
The FCC is looking into complaints from consumer groups that cable operator Comcast violated those principles by unreasonably hindering some file - sharing services , such as BitTorrent , that distribute TV shows and movies .
Comcast issued a statement on Tuesday reiterating that it believes its network management practices were a “ reasonable choice ” and saying that it was switching to a new technique by the end of the year .
DISCLOSE MORE
Martin has previously expressed concern about some Comcast network practices , specifically that the company did not disclose more to customers and application developers about the way it manages traffic on its network .
Subsequently last month , Comcast announced it would change the way it manages its network and cooperate with BitTorrent and other critics to resolve the dispute .
Comcast also said it would partner with a second file - sharing company and help create a “ bill of rights ” for consumers and Internet service providers .
Comcast , which has more than 13 million broadband subscribers , has denied impairing some applications and has said it merely managed the system to deal with network congestion for the good of all users .
In his prepared testimony for Tuesday ’s hearing , Martin said that “ based on the testimony we have so far , some users were not able to upload anything they wanted and were unable to fully use certain file - sharing software from peer - to - peer networks . ”
Martin said the equipment Comcast used to delay traffic “ is typically deployed over a wider geographic or system area and would therefore have impacted numerous nodes within a system simultaneously . ”
“ It appears that this equipment blocks the uploads of at least a large portion of subscribers in that part of the network , regardless of the actual levels of congestion at that particular time , ” Martin said in his testimony .
The dispute over so - called network neutrality pits open - Internet advocates against some service providers such as Comcast , which say they need to take reasonable steps to manage traffic on their networks .
The head of the cable industry ’s chief trade group also testified at the hearing , telling lawmakers that concerns of network neutrality advocates are “ misplaced . ”
Kyle McSlarrow , head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , said companies should be allowed to manage their networks as they see fit to alleviate congestion and combat illegal file - sharing .
McSlarrow said putting every network management technique up for scrutiny “ would severely hamper the ability of network providers to ensure high - quality and reliable Internet access for their subscribers . ”
JCPS will extend NTI into October , but in - person classes could soon return .
Here 's what to know
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Batten down the hatches : hurricane season starts on June 1 .
It 's expected to be a rough one , threatening to upend refineries and disrupt pipelines in the southern United States .
And that could send gas prices , already nearly 20 % above what they were last year , soaring even higher .
That 's what happened three years ago when the Gulf Coast was battered by two hurricanes - Katrina and Rita - in the span of a few weeks .
" With the market the way it is now , a move in crude because of a hurricane could really be exacerbated , " said MF Global energy analyst Don Luke .
Peter Beutel , oil analyst at Cameron Hanover Beutel , said if a Katrina - like hurricane were to hit in July , gas prices could go as high as $ 5 or even $ 6 .
" The last thing this market needs at this time is a hurricane , because we can't afford to lose any of our refining capacity at this point , " said Beutel .
" If anything bullish happens with the market in this state , it would make it go absolutely crazy . "
Like any disruption to supply , when a hurricane takes out drilling platforms and refineries , supply and demand principles lead to a jump in crude oil gasoline prices .
But even before the start to hurricane season , speculative traders have started to send oil and gas prices higher in anticipation of a hit to supplies .
" We 're already seeing a hurricane premium on gas of about five to 10 cents per gallon , " said Alaron Trading energy analyst Phil Flynn .
" Especially since Katrina , we 've seen traders build that into prices . "
The last huge gas spike caused by a hurricane happened in the late summer of 2005 , when Katrina and Rita brought many Americans their first glimpse at $ 3 a gallon for regular gas .
The destruction from Hurricane Katrina alone led gasoline prices to jump 46 cents , or 17 % , in just one week to a national average of $ 3.11 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Though we may never again see two Category 5 hurricanes enter the Gulf of Mexico in the span of only a few weeks , it may not take a similar occurrence to see a similar boost in gas prices again .
Oil prices have soared through the roof on seemingly any kind of bad news recently , so analysts admit that this hurricane season 's effect on gas prices is difficult to predict .
On the other hand , if no hurricane hits this season , Beutel said gas prices may fall off a bit .
But with hurricane season ending Nov. 30 , we 'll have to wait until December to find out .
" That would have some downward pressure on prices , but who knows where we 'll be at that point - we could be a dollar higher or lower than where we are now , " he said .
The perfect storm
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) released its tropical storm forecast Thursday morning , saying there is a 65 % chance of a stronger - than - average hurricane season and only a 10 % chance that it will be weaker than normal .
The outlook indicates a 60 % to 70 % chance of 12 to 16 named storms , with six to nine becoming hurricanes and two to five turning into major hurricanes .
But it does n't take a strongly active hurricane season to cause major disruption to oil drilling and gasoline production in the Gulf .
" The makeup of a storm can have all the difference , " said Flynn .
" Slow moving storms have a tendency to churn up underground pipelines , so you do n't need a category five to do a lot of damage . "
Andy Radford , policy adviser for oil industry trade group American Petroleum Institute ( API ) , said the average hurricane halts oil drilling production for over a week .
Rig workers are forced to evacuate two to three days before the storm hits , and as soon as it's safe to return , they have to check for damage and restart production .
" When the offshore oil pumps get shut down , it takes a lot to get them back on , " said Radford .
He said those big storms in 2004 and 2005 did considerable damage to oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico , severely cutting into supply to gasoline refineries on the shore .
Though slow - moving , weak tropical storms over the Gulf of Mexico can halt oil drilling , powerful hurricanes that hit land can knock out refineries .
That 's because about 40 % of U.S. refining capacity is located on the Gulf Coast , namely in oft - hit states like Texas and Louisiana .
After Katrina and Rita , 30 % of Gulf Coast refineries were shut down or operating with reductions .
" Because refining of crude oil into gasoline and other oil products is critical to meeting our nation 's daily energy needs , disruptions in these operations can have an immediate impact on the nation 's gasoline supply and petrochemicals , " said Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSA ) spokeswoman Robin Lebovitz .
And even though NOAA predicted a high number of strong , named storms for the 2008 season , no one can tell whether or not they will make landfall .
" You can have a very active season but none will make landfall , or a very inactive season but they all hit land , " said NOAA spokesman Dennis Feltgen .
" There 's no way to predict if they will hit yet , because that science just does n't exist . "
It 's rare for a refinery to be totally knocked out by a hurricane , but many are susceptible to wind and water damage that can limit supply to and from the facilities .
Similar to offshore drilling platforms , refineries are sometimes shut down for more than a week before they can return to full operability , according to API Refining Issues Manager Cindy Schild .
Part of the reason Katrina and Rita led to such a spike in gas prices was that there were n't enough functional facilities to make up for the lost output .
Although capacity at many U.S. oil refineries has been expanded , there has n't been a new refinery built in the United States in three decades .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - Civic leader Scott Nelson says he is as worried as anyone about global warming , but that does not make him happy to be one of the first North Americans to pay a carbon tax to curb climate change .
Nelson , the mayor of Williams Lake , British Columbia , says record high energy prices mean that the levy , for all its good intentions , could not come at a worse time for residents in his community , a small lumber and ranching town about 525 km ( 340 miles ) north of Vancouver .
“ The last thing they need now is a tax on top of these soaring prices to add insult to injury , ” said Nelson , predicting that a taxpayer revolt will eventually scuttle the new tax , which takes effect on July 1 .
Carbon taxes already exist in Europe .
But the tax on fossil fuels will make the Pacific province of British Columbia the first North American jurisdiction to bring in a broad - based levy designed to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that are blamed for global warming .
Quebec has a limited carbon tax that applies to energy firms .
The British Columbia government unveiled the tax in February , calling it a key element in a pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 33 percent by 2020 .
The tax applies to nearly all fossil fuels , including gasoline and home heating fuel , starting at C$ 10 per tonne of carbon emissions in 2008 and increasing by C$ 5 a tonne annually for the next four years .
For drivers , that will mean an additional 2.41 Canadian cents on a liter of gasoline ( about 9.13 cents per U.S. gallon ) , starting Tuesday .
The current gas price in Vancouver , British Columbia ’s biggest city , is around C$ 1.40 a liter .
The government says the tax is designed to reduce carbon use , and not generate new revenue .
It is cutting other taxes to offset the carbon tax take , and mailing a one - time C$ 100 rebate out to each British Columbia resident this week .
But critics say it is nothing more than a new gasoline tax that unfairly targets the poor and rural residents who have no choice but to travel long distances in a province that is the size of Germany and France combined .
The opposition left - leaning New Democratic Party has launched an “ axe the tax ” campaign .
The party says it would aim carbon taxes only at businesses and major industrial emitters not at individual consumers .
ENVIRONMENTALIST
SAY STAY THE COURSE
Environmentalists , who have scrambled in recent days to defend the tax amid mounting criticism , acknowledge it is coming at a difficult time , but they want the province to stick with its plan as an example for others .
“ I think reversing it would be a huge setback for effective government action on this issue , certainly in Canada and perhaps in all of North America , ” said Matthew Bramley of the Pembina Institute , an environmental research group .
Canada ’s federal Liberal Party is seeking a national carbon tax , but the plan has been panned by Prime Minister Stephen Harper , whose Conservative government has launched attack ads against it .
Environmental issues and the Liberals carbon tax plan are expected to be key issues in the next federal election .
Supporters of British Columbia ’s plan deny that the new tax will hurt the economy or unfairly target the poor .
They say not dealing with the issue will cost the province far more in the long run as it grapples with the impact of climate change .
“ I ’m just amazed at how much misinformation that is being spread right now , ” said Mark Jaccard , who has been advising the province on its climate change policies .
The provincial government estimates the tax will reduce carbon emissions by about 3 million tonnes a year , or the equivalent of the emissions from about 787,000 cars , as people reduce their use of carbon to save money .
But Nelson says rising energy prices are already doing what the taxes is intended to do by forcing people to cut energy use , and the carbon levy was an idea ahead of its time .

NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc set plans on Tuesday to hold its annual shareholder meeting on August 1 in the heart of Silicon Valley , setting the stage for a showdown with activist investor Carl Icahn , who is mounting a proxy fight for control of the company .

Yahoo set plans on Tuesday to hold its annual shareholder meeting on August 1 , setting the stage for a showdown with Icahn , who is mounting a proxy fight for control of the company .
REUTERS / Files
Earlier , The Wall Street Journal reported that Icahn , a billionaire investor , would seek to remove Jerry Yang as Yahoo chief executive , citing the company ’s failure , so far , to reach a merger or partnership deal with Microsoft Corp .
Icahn has proposed an alternate slate of directors for Yahoo ’s board , but had not directly targeted Yang over the breakdown in talks early this month for a $ 47.5 billion deal .
“ It ’s no longer a mystery to me why Microsoft ’s offer is n’t around , ” the Journal quoted Icahn as saying .
“ How can Yahoo keep saying they ’re willing to negotiate and sell the company on the one hand , while at the same time they ’re completely sabotaging the process without telling anyone ? ”
Yahoo fired back in a statement : “ Yahoo ’s board of directors , including Jerry Yang , has been crystal clear that it would consider any proposal by Microsoft that was in the best interests of its shareholders . ”
The Sunnyvale , California - based company said Yahoo had been in extensive talks with Microsoft for the last several months , culminating in Microsoft ’s decision not to pursue a deal .
“ Mr. Icahn ’s assertions ignore this clear factual record . ”
Microsoft said it had no comment on Icahn ’s actions .
The two companies are in contact with each other but have nothing to announce at this time , a Microsoft spokesman said .
Yahoo said in a regulatory filing that it had rescheduled its meeting for August 1 from its originally date of July 3 .
The annual meeting will take place at The Fairmont hotel in downtown San Jose , which features a 1,000 person ballroom .
Icahn cited details from court documents related to a shareholder suit that were unsealed on Monday .
The documents showed how Yahoo had taken steps to rebuff a Microsoft takeover bid months before the software maker made its offer public on February 1 .
The lawsuit argued that Yahoo had taken aggressive steps to block a deal , including the adoption of a costly plan to retain employees , leading up to a breakdown in negotiations .
Last week , News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch dismissed Icahn ’s role in the Microsoft - Yahoo tangle as a distraction .
Speaking at “ D : All Things Digital ” conference in Southern California , he said Icahn was “ not serious . ”
“ Look , he wants to make himself a few hundred million dollars , ” Murdoch said .
“ For Microsoft it is helpful noise .
If I were Yahoo , I would n’t worry about it . ”
Murdoch said his own interest in doing a deal , either with Yahoo or Microsoft , involving his MySpace unit had waned after talks over the past year with both on various partnerships .
He said he was “ mystified ” by Yahoo ’s response to Microsoft ’s offer but said he thought Microsoft would eventually reach a deal with Yahoo .
The Journal said Yahoo ’s board was due to meet on Tuesday .
Icahn was not immediately available to comment .
Yahoo shares were off 12 cents at $ 26.28 , down less than 1 percent on the day , in extended trade shortly after the Nasdaq close .
Using the company 's own records of millions of numbers dialed , the dates and the durations , the internal - security unit had hunted for possible matches between news reporters and Telekom directors .
Both public prosecutors and a German law firm have been assigned to investigate the suspected breach three years ago of German data - retention laws .
Bonn - based Telekom said it had purged the security department last year to ensure it operated within the law .
The scandal was first reported Saturday morning by German newsweekly Der Spiegel in advance of its Monday issue .
Following US practice
CEO Obermann said the firm was taking the allegations " very seriously "
Telekom , one of the biggest companies on the German stock market , remains one - third in federal ownership .
Its affairs are closely followed by the German news media , which have often reported leaks from authoritative sources .
Der Spiegel said the corporate security division had suspected senior executives or supervisory board members might be to blame .
Telekom said calls were not actually tapped , but the billing data had been illegally accessed in 2005 and " according to new claims " in 2006 , too .
" We 're taking this very seriously .
We have reported it to the public prosecutor , " chief executive Rene Obermann said .
In recent years German companies whose shares are traded in the United States have adopted the US practice of investigating and publicizing criminal actions within their own bureaucracies .
A lot of talk has been thrown around that the movie The Golden Compass did poorly at the box office was because a bunch of trend - following Christian mothers did n’t take their kids to see the movie .
Christian fundamentalists congratulated each other on the terrible financial failure of the movie .
While I think boycotters might have made a dent , I do n’t think that ’s why the movie did poorly .
It did poorly because it totally sucked .
When I first saw ads for the movie , I was totally psyched .
I remember reading the books and becoming engrossed with the series when I was a kid .
When I heard there was a boycott , I rolled my eyes and resolved to see it multiple times to help free speech balance out .
I ’ve never been so disappointed by a movie .
Compass was too short and too fragmented .
The movie should have had more time to be developed or should have had less material that needed developing .
It was impossible to get involved with any of the sideline characters we should have loved .
The ship captain ’s speech fell flat , the battle between polar bears did n’t leave me at the edge of my seat , and all the extra allies were confusingly uninteresting .
I did n’t care about Lyra ’s friend , the witches , the gypsies , not even the balloonist or the polar bears really .
I tried , I truly did .
Lord of the Rings knew the secret of creating an involving world : lengthy movies and trimming unnecessary plot threads and characters .
Even Peter Jackson knew to cut out Tom Bombadil .
All the threads left no room for anything that was n’t plot development .
“ Twists ” were unsurprising and half the plot - furthering conveniences felt like a score of dei ex machinis ( I ’ve never had to use the plural for deus ex machina before ) .
The gypsies swooping in to save her , that her mom ’s only non-manipulative sentence was about the polar bear king wanting a DÃ¦mon , the balloonist happening to strike a friendship with Lyra , the witches , finding the Gobbler list in the trash ( and correctly interpreting it ) added up to a movie that barely felt real .
Not only that , but it was so scrubbed clean of “ anti- Christian ” sentiments that the crux of the movie was crippled .
The connection between “ dust ” and “ sin ” was edited out so there was no clear explanation why The Magistrate disliked dust .
They just had an unexplained beef against dust .
The whole thing was poorly constructed .
The best part of the movie was the glass and steampunk scenery .
I could n’t bring myself to see it again in theatres .
A lot of religious leaders are trying to claim a victory for fundamentalist boycotting , but this simply was n’t the case .
It was a poorly made movie that did n’t live up to its enormous potential .
That ’s why it did n’t do well .
If fundamentalists were behind Compass ’ performance , then why did n’t Harry Potter crash and burn or just be an average movie ?
Because Harry Potter was well made .
It ’s too bad The Golden Compass was n’t .
Justice Scalia , speaking at a time when gay marriage , public education , and the war on terror are creating cases that test the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment , chose the banquet of a large group of Orthodox Jews here to declare that the Constitution should not be read to " banish the Almighty from the public forum . "
Click Image to Enlarge Alex Wong / Getty Justice Scalia pauses as he addresses a Northern Virginia Technology Council ( NVTC ) breakfast in December , 2006 at McLean , Virginia .
In a speech delivered last night from a dais on which he was surrounded by venerable , bearded rabbis dressed in black and wearing elegant hats , Justice Scalia drew a sharp distinction between America and Europe .
But he decried what he saw as the Supreme Court 's prevailing , if recent , jurisprudence that holds that government " cannot favor religion over nonreligion . "
" That rule does not , of course , represent the American tradition , " Justice Scalia said .
From the banquet hall at the Midtown Hilton , Justice Scalia spoke on the occasion of the annual dinner of the Agudath Israel of America .
In attendance were hundreds of fervently Orthodox Jews .
The police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , was present on the dais , too , seated three places away from the justice .
Members of the audience appeared so pleased to meet the justice that , during a smaller reception beforehand , a bodyguard from the U.S. Marshals Service called on people to allow Justice Scalia more space , as a crowd four people deep quickly enveloped him .
Before his speech , Justice Scalia tucked into a plate of salmon over noodles , even as a veteran Supreme Court advocate and Harvard Law classmate of his , Nathan Lewin , introduced the justice in a speech recorded in Fez , Morocco , and played across several screens throughout the banquet hall .
The transmission of the speech was marred , making sections unintelligible and prompting Justice Scalia , who rarely turns down an opportunity for a quip , to exclaim that Mr. Lewin was " an easy act to follow . "
The justice did n't make any radical departures from positions he has taken on the high bench , echoing language in his dissent in a 2005 case involving the displays of the Ten Commandments that two counties in Kentucky had installed in their courthouses .
But his remarks appeared intended to inspirit and encourage the largest grass roots organization of fervently religious Jews in America , an organization that is engaged in the constitutional debate in the country on such issues as gay marriage , parochial schools , and civil rights for religious individuals .
Justice Scalia began speech last night , as he did his dissent in the Kentucky case , McCreary County v ACLU , by recalling President Bush 's valediction in a speech delivered shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 : " God bless America . "
Such a statement , Justice Scalia said , would be " absolutely forbidden " in many countries in Europe .
Justice Scalia was in Rome at the time of the attacks , attending a conference of judges and lawyers .
Speaking last night , Justice Scalia cautioned the audience against being " so quick to believe " that the Jeffersonian principle of separation between church and state is represented by the " type of separation found in Europe . "
Justice Scalia noted approvingly that in America the Supreme Court has upheld tax exemptions for houses of worship as well as the constitutionality of allowing ministers to open legislative hearings with a prayer .
He lauded a 1952 opinion by Justice Douglas declaring : " We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being . "
That opinion upheld a New York City public school policy of releasing students from class to allow them to attend religious schooling elsewhere .
Justice Scalia , who is Catholic and grew up in Elmhurst , Queens , had received religious instruction under that policy .
In his opinion in the Kentucky case involving the Ten Commandments , which Justice Scalia did not directly cite last night , the justice encouraged his colleagues to draw a distinction between " the acknowledgment of a single Creator and the establishment of a religion . "
Noting that Islam , Judaism , and Christianity all believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God , Justice Scalia had written that displaying the Ten Commandments in a courthouse " cannot be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint . "
Instead , Justice Scalia argued in that dissent , it was akin to " publicly honoring God , " which he believes acceptable under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment , which states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion .
In his jurisprudence , Justice Scalia has sought to limit the number of Establishment Clause cases that the Supreme Court hears .
In a decision last year , Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas called on the court to overturn a precedent that allows any taxpayer to go to court to challenge a government program that is alleged to promote religion .
The U.S. Constitution famously protects against unreasonable search and seizure , but the Washington State Constitution is far more narrow , requiring a warrant in all but a handful of exceptions to conduct any search , reasonable or not .
For that reason , the state Supreme Court threw out Jason Eisfeldt ’s conviction for operating a marijuana - growing operation at a house in Lacey .
In August 2003 , Eisfeldt called in a repairman to fix a diesel spill on his living - room floor .
Michael Piper arrived , and in the process of cleaning up , went into the attached garage to open the door and vent the fumes .
The garage had a foam sealant around it , which Piper broke .
Once inside , he found a garbage bag filled with pot .
Piper then called the cops , let them into the house , and showed them the bag .
The officers then obtained a warrant , allowing them to search the rest of the house , where they unearthed a home - grow operation and subsequently arrested Eisfeldt .
In the Supreme Court decision , the nine justices agreed that the cops never should have been allowed in the house in the first place .
In the majority opinion , Justice Richard Sanders points out that even if the initial search was reasonable , the cops ’ failure to seek a warrant before going into the garage was a violation of the state constitution .
Additionally , the search of an Olympia home based on a warrant obtained from the search of Eisfeldt ’s home was ruled unconstitutional due to the “ poison tree ” doctrine .
Because the first search was illegal , any search warrants obtained from the first search are also unlawful .
The Safer Internet programme educates children about net dangers
The money will be spent over four years on educational efforts and ways to protect children from inappropriate content and cyber bullying .
It will also research the ways that children use the net on computers and other devices such as mobile phones .
The broad - based project will build on the Safer Internet Programme the EU began in 2000 .
Action plan
" As more and more European children and adolescents use online technologies at home or at school , they , their parents and their teachers need to be informed about the opportunities and risks they face , " said Jose Barroso , EC president in a statement .
The original Safer Internet Programme produced materials for schools and youth groups and co-ordinated the annual Safer Internet Day .
The extended project , which will run from 2009 - 2013 , will continue this work but add some more concrete objectives .
These will include the creation of national contact points to report illegal content and attempts at grooming ; giving support to groups to which parents and children can turn for advice about safe net use , and the establishment of a forum where best practice can be shared and debated .
In a separate development , net experts at Harvard University will spend 12 months studying how children can avoid unwanted attention when using the web .
Run by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard the Internet Safety Technical Task Force will aim to research and recommend practices that sites can adopt to make themselves safer places for children .
The impetus for the task force came out of an agreement social network site MySpace reached with every US state attorney general , except Texas , in early January .
Esther ( not her real name ) , 28 , a professional living and working in Zimbabwe 's capital , Harare , is writing a regular diary on the challenges of leading a normal life .
Zimbabwe is suffering from an acute economic crisis .
The country has the world 's highest rate of annual inflation and just one in five has an official job .
I watched excerpts of President Robert Mugabe 's speech at the United Nations food summit in Rome .
We all know he hates ' Britain and its allies ' with a passion , but I really did not expect him to launch such an attack at a forum called to discuss soaring food prices .
It was a bit embarrassing to watch to be honest .
But then again what could he do ?
It is his first such public appearance since losing parliamentary , council , senatorial and presidential elections .
He had to save face somehow , and that was his way of doing it .
Back home , college students at a certain teachers ' college have been asked to bring their own food supplies to stock up the institution 's kitchen .
Campaign jingles are back , but only for Zanu -PF
I saw a list from a student sent to their guardian - specific quantities of maize meal , sugar , salt and cooking oil , all of which are almost exclusively available on the black market .
One does not hear people talking politics that much in public these days , I guess we have all seen the pictures of victims of violence from the rural areas , and no - one wants to end up like that .
No ordinary person that is - broadcasting your political views has once again become the preserve of activists .
Campaign jingles are back on air , only this time Zanu - PF ones only .
Rumour has it the government has declared that no opposition MDC campaign material will be broadcast in state media - print or electronic .
I am not sure where people heard this , but it certainly seems true .
The jingles I have heard on radio are all for the ruling party and I have seen a number of Mugabe 's posters in the state newspaper , but none of MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
For the 29 March election , I remember marvelling at the fact that state media were broadcasting MDC material .
Maybe they think that had a lot to do with the opposition victory .
The atmosphere is different from last time - there is no excitement .
Maybe it is just that we are not talking about how we are going to vote .
Or maybe it is because the official inflation rate is running at 165,000 % ( unofficially it 's been estimated at 1.7 m % ) and we can all feel it .
Read Esther 's previous diary Esther answers your questions Q :
If the MDC wins the re-run of the elections , will the ruling Zanu - PF accept the results ?
What is your comment Esther ?
Chrispin , Lusaka , Zambia A : Will they have a choice ?
The first lady has already declared that there is no way Mugabe will leave office for Tsvangirai , but that 's what Smith said of Mugabe .
If we vote a person out of power , that 's it .
He can not be more important than the votes of millions of Zimbabweans .
I am not naive , I know he does not want to leave office , and the army chiefs do not want him to , but I still think they have no choice but to allow the will of the people to prevail .
Q : I really sympathize with the people of Zimbabwe .
I cannot imagine spending billons of ' dollars ' on a loaf of bread .
I would like to know the state of Zimbabwe 's educational sector at the moment .
Vincent , Agba , Nigeria A : Our education system has suffered greatly from the economic situation .
Teachers are just not motivated to work .
So many kids have to attend ' extra lessons ' - tutorials with these same teachers outside of school hours where the teacher can charge what he / she feels is adequate compensation .
To compound this , teachers in rural areas have borne the brunt of post- election violence , and fled their homes , and thus their schools .
Q : Esther , I am a Zimbo living outside the country , my questions are : 1 . Do you think if Simba Makoni had not joined the race Morgan would have won ?
Or Simba or no Simba ZEC was going to be forced to release engineered results .
2 . Why do n't people boycott the Mbare Msika ( large vegetable market ) stalls , so that they also can feel the pinch of Bob 's rule .
Tendai , Eldorado , South Africa A : 1 . Simba Makoni only got about 8 % of the vote .
That might have taken Morgan Tsvangirai to over 51 % but then again maybe they would have voted for Mugabe , who knows ?
The results were a bit difficult to engineer , with results outside polling stations .
I believe the whole ZEC delay was about " How do we admit ZANU - PF lost ? " for lose they did .
2 . Well , people are struggling to make ends meet , and you know how cheap everything is at Mbare Msika .
Q : Esther , you are doing a very excellent job in updating us about Zimbabwe .
What do you think will happen to Zimbabwe if Mugabe wins again ( God forbid ) ?
The situation in Zimbabwe is also worrying me as it used to be the pearl of southern Africa .
We used to flood there every weekend from Botswana for Nandos which was cheaper and very tasty !
I also want to know if Zimbabweans are going to accept the results and move on ?
Primrose , Manama , Bahrain A : Zimbabwe as we know it , will be no more .
The only thing that is keeping it going now is the hope offered by June 27 .
A few weeks ago I was talking about the USD hitting 450 million ZWD , today we are talking 1 billion ZWD .
We have a 50 billion dollar note in circulation .
This administration has failed us .
If they are allowed to stay , they will decimate us .
So they have laid a stage where the only acceptable result is one which ushers in change .
That is the only way we can move on .
Q : Esther , I visited your country 25 years ago and was overwhelmed by the beauty of the country and its people .
I hope to return someday soon .
Once Mugabe has been defeated in the run off election do you see a future for whites in the new Zimbabwe ?
Will the defeated Zanu - PF use whites as a wedge and fear issue to cause problems down the road ?
Andrew , Malibu , California , USA A : Race was never an issue until ZANU made it one just because commercial farmers showed support for the newly founded MDC in 2000 .
So I do think oppurtunities will exist for any displaced Zimbawean who wants to come and help rebuild the new Zimbabwe .
Q : Esther , is there any situation imaginable where Zimbabwean society will rise up in mass action to overthrow the current government ?
Why is this not happening ?
Is the opposition divided or badly organized ?
Are people too scared or is the situation not that bad ?
Wouter , Amsterdam A : The only uprising I can see happening is one led by the foot soldiers and the police .
We all know they are on standby to quash any uprisings , and they will be none until people know they will not be massacred on the streets .
Things are that bad , but not bad enough to allow people to cast aside their fear of the security forces .
Q : Esther , thank you for your diary and the insight that it gives into life in the country .
A parishioner of ours has told us that a Zimbabwean lady that we had helped recently with funding for a project in Zimbabwe has made contact stating that Chinese troops are in the country supporting the Mugabe regime and intimidating people .
Are you aware of any evidence that supports this statement as if true it is a worrying escalation ?
Steve , Bordon , UK A : I know we have top ranking Chinese officers in our army , but I have not heard of them being involved in beatings in the rural areas .
I think the fact of their involvement would have really stood out in the reports coming in from the rural areas .
Q : Esther , your entries are so poignant and resonate deeply with me .
As a senior in high school embarking on to college next fall , I feel completely powerless when I read world news of the desperate situations in places like Burma and Zimbabwe .
I am not sure what I can do as a teenage girl right now , but putting a face on the situation in Zimbabwe has only further inspired me to follow a major in International Relations and a career with some place like Amnesty International , Oxfam or Human Rights Watch .
Thank you for so bravely telling your story .
I will work my hardest throughout my life to help change the world in a positive way .
Kristin Hoppe , Lakewood , Colorado USA A : And I am moved that this weekly email should move you so .
Thank you .

It was later upgraded extensively by Dan Balis .

Jeff Friedman and Andrew Zwerin were high school sweethearts on Long Island .
After college and graduate school , they returned to New York to Rockville Centre .
When they adopted Joshua , now 4 , Friedman quit his job as a lawyer to be a stay - at - home dad .
Despite deep roots in New York , they will fly to Los Angeles this month to plan what Friedman , 40 , says will be " a traditional Jewish wedding " under a chuppa , or canopy , at a cousin 's home on Oct. 11 .
" We 've waited 23 years , " says Zwerin , 39 .
" We 're not about to shortcut the pomp and circumstances . "
More than 12,000 same - sex couples from New York are expected to marry in California within the next three years , says a report today by UCLA 's Williams Institute , which studies sexual orientation issues .
Unlike a projected 55,000 gay couples from other states whose marriages will be mostly symbolic , New Yorkers expect to have legal standing on matters such as inheritance and taxes .
That 's because after California 's Supreme Court last month overturned a ban on same - sex marriage , New York Gov. David Paterson instructed state agencies to recognize all marriages , including those of gay couples , legally performed in other jurisdictions .
Those include Canada , Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , South Africa and nearby Massachusetts , the first state to legalize same - sex marriage — but only for residents and those from states where it is n't illegal .
Gay rights advocates are unsure whether New York 's unique situation will allow residents to marry in Massachusetts , but California looks clear — at least until November , when Californians will vote on whether to amend the state constitution to outlaw same - sex marriage .
" If it sounds weird , it is weird .
That 's the limbo people are living in , " says Alan Van Capelle , executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda , a New York gay rights group .
" This is an important remedy but not a permanent solution to the lack of marriage equality . "
County clerks in California will begin issuing same - sex marriage licenses to residents and non-residents at 5 p.m. next Monday .
Inga Sarda - Sorensen says she and her partner , Jennie Talley , 54 , were so " absolutely thrilled " by the California decision that they asked their Episcopal minister to officiate at a September wedding near Thousand Oaks , where Talley 's family lives .
The couple , who in 2004 were rejected for a marriage license in Manhattan , said they would have married without their home state 's recognition but now that they have it , " that even further solidified our decision , " said Sarda - Sorensen , 43 , a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
Friedman says he and Zwerin " always considered ourselves married . "
They thought about moving to Massachusetts when its top court decided in 2004 that gays have a right to marry but decided to stay near their aging parents .
They might have gone to Canada like thousands of other New York couples since gay marriage became legal there in 2003 , " but it felt kind of strange to have to leave the country to secure our rights , " says Zwerin , an information - technology manager .
Unless the governor 's directive falls to a legal challenge filed last week by the Arizona - based Alliance Defense Fund , a conservative Christian group , more than 1,300 New York statutes and regulations will soon treat partners in gay unions the same as heterosexual spouses .
For Steve Foster , the change means he can add his partner of seven years , Russell Saray , as a co-owner of his Manhattan apartment without paying huge fees to his mortgage company .
" If something happens to me , there will be no question about … inheritance rights , " says Foster , 60 , a foundation executive .
The couple plan to wed at the Marin County Courthouse on June 18 .
Others are waiting until June 30 , when New York state agencies report to Paterson on how they will implement the changes , Van Capelle says .
" A lot of New Yorkers want to hear what exactly they 're getting before they book their trips , " he says .
Some wonder what their marriage license will be worth if Californians vote down same - sex unions .
" If something happens that the legality is changed later on , then we 'll deal with that later , " says William Walker , a Brooklyn legal assistant considering San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park for an August wedding to Jeffrey Dreiblatt .
Richard Burns , executive director of the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York 's Greenwich Village , notes that Paterson 's order applies only to executive agencies under his authority , not the courts .
Among the unresolved legal questions :
If a couple decides to divorce , could they do it in a New York court ?
Or would they have to split in California , which requires couples to live in the state for six months before filing for divorce ?
For Dan Whitman , 35 , and Robert Bartley , 45 , of Manhattan , a California marriage license is n't about commitment .
They vowed that to one another in a ceremony in Florida nearly a decade ago .
It 's not about romance .
Whitman says nothing will match when he proposed to Bartley on a Hudson River pier at sunset .
" This is about rights , about having legal protection , " says Whitman , who will wed in a quick ceremony in Los Angeles later this month during a business trip .
" We do n't need another anniversary to celebrate . "

As gas prices hit record high amounts and continue to rise , US citizens are finally turning to public transportation for daily commutes and vacations .
Multiple sources are reporting a surge in the use of public transportation .
As scores of people jump on the “ bus ” public transit officials nationwide are continuously determining how to accommodate their new riders .
The American Public Transportation Authority reports 35 % more travelers will use public transportation this summer .
They provide this list of the country ’s top ten summer city destinations and their expected use of public transportation :
New York City ( 53 percent – up 5 percent )
Washington , DC ( 47 percent – up 1 percent )
Boston ( 48 percent – up 5 percent )
San Francisco ( 40 percent – remained constant )
Philadelphia ( 38 percent – up 4 percent )
Chicago ( 35 percent – up 4 percent )
Seattle ( 32 percent – up 2 percent )
Las Vegas ( 30 percent – up 4 percent )
Los Angeles ( 31 percent – up 5 percent )
Atlanta ( 25 percent – up 3 percent )
Needless to say in a country where each household owns an average of 2.28 vehicles , this surge in use of public transportation is coming with growing pains .
The increase in gas prices is effecting public transportation providers , which will be reflected in the expected increase in fares .
Many companies are finding it necessary to increase their fleets and routes .
The cost of expanding their operations coupled with the high fuel prices are a concern .
Some companies that provide public transportation are making cut backs while others are pressing forward .
Overall , it seems those involved in the public transit industry are looking at this increased need for their services as positive .
One of the benefits of living in a free capitalist society is the ability to choose where we spend our money .
As Americans we know , money talks !
Bus , train , subway or bike ….as a society we are joining together and saying no to the rising cost of fuel .
There is excitement in the air ( and less CO2 ) as we join together this summer either by choice or forced compliance .
I welcome the change !

Scott McClellan ’s critics in Washington have speculated about his motives for writing a book bashing President Bush , but back in the former White House spokesman ’s home state of Texas , some chalk it up to something very simple : his gene pool .
Bush defenders and impartial observers point in particular to Mr. McClellan ’s mother , Carole Keeton Strayhorn , as having set a precedent for turning on former allies , while others say that his family tree had strong liberal leanings .
They also said his decision will make it hard to do what all Texans do : return home .
“ Scott ’s going to be something of a man without a country if he comes back , ” said Paul Burka , senior executive editor at Texas Monthly magazine .
“ I do n’t think the Republicans would be much enamored with him , ” Mr. Burka said .
“ I just do n’t see him having much of an immediate future in politics . ”
The thrice - married Mrs. Strayhorn has switched from Democrat to Republican to independent during her more than 30 years in politics , which culminated with two terms as Texas comptroller and an unsuccessful run for governor in 2006 .
During her second term as comptroller , Mrs. Strayhorn frequently attacked members of her own Republican party , including Gov. Rick Perry and leaders in the legislature .
Many regarded these moves as a tactic to increase her own name recognition and lay the groundwork for her 2006 gubernatorial run .
Ray Sullivan , a political consultant in Austin who was Mr. McClellan ’s predecessor as deputy spokesman in the Bush governor ’s office during the late 1990s , said he is troubled by doubts about Mr. McClellan ’s motives for writing his book .
“ If you know Scott , you like to think that his motivation is honest and straightforward , but it ’s easy to envision a very crass motivation , ” Mr. Sullivan said .
Mr. McClellan , 40 , spoke publicly for the first time today since his book became available Tuesday night at a few select D.C. bookstores and was obtained by several newspapers , including The Washington Times .
On NBC ’s “ Today Show , ” Mr. McClellan was asked whether he was “ just trying to make a buck , ” a notion he rejected .
“ I have a higher loyalty than my loyalty necessarily to my past work , ” Mr. McClellan said .
“ That ’s a loyalty to the truth , and it ’s a loyalty to the values I was raised on . ”
But some Texas Republicans wonder whether those values were n’t always a little left - leaning .
Mrs. Strayhorn grew up as the daughter of Page Keeton , the legendary dean of the University of Texas ’ law school and tort law expert , and was a loyal Democrat .
In 1984 , she served as Travis County campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale .
Two years later , she switched her affiliation to Republican and ran for Congress against Democrat J.J. Pickle , but lost .
“ I wonder if it ’s just the basic bias showing that Scott grew up with and may not even know he has , ” said Bill Crocker , an Austin lawyer and longtime Republican activist .
Mrs. Strayhorn did not answer phone calls placed to her home and did not respond to inquiries made through a social networking site .
Mr. McClellan ’s status back home had already been under attack .
Some of his former White House colleagues who have returned to Texas from Washington have been speaking ill of him for some time , Mr. Burka said .
“ You ’ve heard from a lot of Bushies who have come back to town that Scott was not that good , ” Mr. Burka said .
“ I just do n’t think they thought he did much for Bush .
He was n’t that strong about it . ”
“ And if you ’re not loyal , then you ’re out .
Totally out . ”
Mr. Sullivan , who used to work for Karl Rove , yesterday articulated some of the reasons that Mr. McClellan may be viewed as something of a pariah in his hometown .
“ It ’s important to remember that Scott was working for his mother when Karen Hughes and Karl Rove and George W. Bush scooped him up and gave him incredible opportunities , ” Mr. Sullivan said .
“ So his career was essentially made by the Bush team , and it ’s surprising , disappointing , that he would apparently turn his back on those friends and colleagues . ”
In the first of several TV interviews yesterday , Mr. McClellan defended the timing of his dissent , which comes after he left the White House , and said his book has a larger message about the culture of Washington that he hopes will change .
He said he came to his dissenting views on the Iraq war and the White House “ propaganda campaign ” to sell the war only after leaving the White House .

The business of blogging is changing .
A movement that arguably spawned social media and widespread user generated content is no longer ignoring the web 2.0 changes that have followed its rise .
Open and sharing have replaced closed and walled , and a new generation that knows nothing other than cross - network platform agnostic networking expects that the sites they visit will embrace 2.0 , not ignore it .
I ’ve already covered a number of aspects relating to Blogging 2.0 ( the user | professional blogging | advertising ) but a recurring theme I ’ve seen , both through emails received , comment threads and discussions elsewhere , is that people perhaps do n’t yet know the best ways to embrace the new paradigm of blogging .
Here ’s what I ’d recommend for blog owners .
Please note that the focus is on a blog owners viewpoint while looking at blogging 2.0 in terms of promotion and value adding for a site , so my apologies in advance if the traffic implications and marketing angles upset anyone as I ’m not exploring the end user benefits here .
Ultimately these recommendations are great for readers / end users as well , and as I ’ve argued previously , blogging 2.0 can be a win/ win for everyone involved .
Comments
Locally hosted walled comment services on blogs are dying .
Users are expecting common standards , enhanced layout and unified tracking when visiting blogs .
Services such as Disqus and Sezwho deliver this functionality .
There are a number of advantages : these services filter spam , offer user profiles and centralized tracking services , and enhance the comment layout on your blog .
They ’re all great benefits , but the number one reason you should make the switch : using these services increases the number of comments you get on your blog .
Likewise not using them may drive conversations elsewhere .
I know personally I ’m far more likely to comment on a blog running Disqus now than one without , and it ’s a common thing I hear now .
Think of it in these terms : a Disqus user is already logged in so does n’t have to enter personal details to make a comment , ie : the barrier to entry for commenting is lower .
They can also track responses from a common page so are more likely to make repeat comments on a post than would otherwise be the case .
The tried and failed argument against these sorts of services is you lose control of your comments and that the search engines ca n’t see them .
This simply is n’t the case .
Sezwho hosts the comments locally .
Disqus does host the comments on a central server but if you use the API wordpress plugin they can be seen on your site by search engines .
Further you can pull your comments out of Disqus at any time and import them back into WordPress .
All up if you ’re still thinking about it , you have a lot to gain by trying one of these services , and very little ( if anything ) to lose .
Twitter
Everyone accepts RSS , but are you offering your latest blog posts via Twitter ?
There are two options , you can post your latest posts to Twitter using your personal account ( and I do for my personal blogs ) or you can set up a dedicated account for your site that allows people who are interested to subscribe to receive the latest updates ( which is what I do for The Inquisitr ) .
If you ’re not producing a lot of content you can do this manually , or there ’s a Twitter plugin for WordPress that will do it all for you .
Take it as a given that you should also be engaging on Twitter as well , as opposed to simply spamming it with your links .
Most people will happily accept the occasional link via a personal account , but over do it and you ’ll lose followers .
Some times it ’s best to keep things separate and give people a choice .
FriendFeed
FriendFeed has become a little controversial in some blogging circles with accusations that the site steals conversations from blogs .
But I simply ask in return : if this is the case , would n’t the same be true of Digg or Reddit , who also have conversations around links to stories on external sites ?
Whether you love FriendFeed or hate it , there is one certainty : you ca n’t stop conversations from occurring there .
You can chose to ignore it , but others are n’t , and if numbers are you goal in blogging , your rivals may well be embracing FriendFeed and benefiting from it .
Like Twitter , participation yourself is important , however the lines between self promotion and conversation are blurred as FriendFeed pulls data in from across various services , including your blog .
Still , this function is only ever as good as people following you , so being an active and good member ( like Twitter ) will increase the number of people following you , and potentially the traffic you get from the site .
I ’ve found that FriendFeed is constantly in the Top 10 referrers list for The Inquisitr for example .
The other way you can embrace FriendFeed is by incorporating FriendFeed actions on your site as I have here at The Inquisitr ( if you ’re on the full post page you ’ll see FriendFeed at the bottom about 15 minutes after this goes live ) .
Glenn Slaven ’s excellent FriendFeed Comments WordPress Plugin is highly recommended .
The conversation is going to take place with or without you , why not embrace it and make it part of your site as well ?
Widgets
Did you know we have widgets for The Inquisitr and they did n’t cost us a cent ?
The Inquisitr widget to the right was designed in SproutBuilder , arguably the most friendly online widget building platforms there is .
If you can write a Word document , you can use this .
The idea with widgets is similar to Twitter and FriendFeed above : you want to give your users as many subscription opportunities as possible ( remember Blogging 2.0 is ultimately all about the user ) .
Widgets like this one can be embedded in iGoogle and Netvibes , used on social networking profiles and if your readers are really included can be embedded on their site as well .
I ’d recommend giving SproutBuilder a shot , and also take a look at WidgetBox as well .
LAS VEGAS -- Oakland Raiders wide receiver Javon Walker was found unconscious on a Las Vegas street Monday after apparently being the victim of a robbery .
Police spokesman Bill Cassell said in a statement that Walker was taken to a hospital with " significant injuries " after being found early Monday on a street off the Las Vegas Strip .
Cassell said Walker remained in fair condition at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center .
A Raiders spokesman said the team was " in the process of gathering information " and had no further comment .
NFL.com Video
Javon Walker 72 - yard rush for touchdown .
Walker signed a six - year , $ 55 million deal with the Raiders after being released by the Denver Broncos in February .
Walker injured his right knee for the second time in his career last season and was limited to eight games and 26 catches in 2007 .
Walker was a first - round draft pick by the Green Bay Packers in 2001 and had a breakout season in 2004 with 89 catches for 1,382 yards and 12 touchdowns .
He tore a ligament in his right knee the next season and played only one game .

McCain explained his remark , but it could be very damaging when taken out of context .
Dems pound McCain for new Iraq quote
The Obama campaign and Democratic leaders accused Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) of being confused and heartless after he told NBC’s “ Today ” show Wednesday that it ’s “ not too important ” when U.S. troops return from Iraq .
Sen . John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) said on a quickly organized Obama conference call that McCain ’s comment was “ unbelievably out of touch with the needs and concerns of most Americans , ” saying that to families of troops in harm ’s way , “ To them , it 's the most important thing in the world . ”

Kerry claimed “ an enormous , fundamental flaw in his candidacy for the presidency , which supposedly has hung on his strength as commander in chief and his understanding of foreign policy . ”
Susan Rice , an Obama foreign - policy adviser , accused McCain of “ a real disturbing , even disconcerting , pattern of confusing the basic facts and reality that pertain to Iraq . ”
The “ Today ” show statement , which McCain went on to explain , is damaging because Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) has pledged to immediately begin withdrawing combat troops .
McCain , trying to mitigate the fallout from his January remarks that U.S. troops might be in Iraq for 100 years , predicted last month that “ most ” troops would be home by the end of his first term .
Trying to take the offense , McCain ’s campaign posted a YouTube clip of the exchange .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said : “ The Obama campaign is embarking on a false attack on John McCain to hide their own candidate ’s willingness to disregard facts on the ground in pursuit of withdrawal no matter what the costs .
John McCain was asked if he had a ‘ better estimate ’ for a timeline for withdrawal .
“ As John McCain has always said , that is not as important as conditions on the ground and the recommendations of commanders in the field .
Any reasonable person who reads the full transcript would see this and reject the Obama campaign ’s attempt to manipulate , twist and distort the truth . ”
The exchange that has Democrats licking their chops began when co-host Matt Lauer asked about the surge strategy in Iraq : “ If it 's working Senator , do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq ? ”
McCain replied : “ No , but that 's not too important .
What ’s important is the casualties in Iraq , Americans are in South Korea , Americans are in Japan , American troops are in Germany .
That ’s all fine .
American casualties and the ability to withdraw ; we will be able to withdraw .
General [ David ]
Petraeus is going to tell us in July when he thinks we are .
“ But the key to it is that we do n't want any more Americans in harm 's way .
That way , they will be safe , and serve our country and come home with honor and victory , not in defeat , which is what Senator Obama 's proposal would have done .
I ’m proud of them .
And they 're doing a great job .
And we are succeeding and it's fascinating that Senator Obama still does n't realize that . ”
Kerry , saying McCain is “ really having a debate with himself ” on Iraq , said the “ Today ” show comment was part of a “ policy for staying in Iraq ” and “ underscores … the broad array of contradictions in John McCain ’s statements about Iraq . ”
“ It is really becoming more crystal clear to a lot of Iraq that John McCain simply does n’t understand it – that he confuses who Iran is training , he confuses what the makeup of al - Qaeda is , he confuses the history … of what has happened between Sunni and Shia and how deep that current runs , ” Kerry said .
Rice criticized “ real confusion and lack of understanding of the situation in Iraq and , indeed , the larger region , that John McCain evidenced yet again in his comments on the ‘ Today ’ show . ”
Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) was first out of the gate with a statement , calling McCain ’s comment “ a crystal clear indicator that he just does n’t get the grave national - security consequences of staying the course . …
We need a smart change in strategy to make America more secure , not a commitment to indefinitely keep our troops in an intractable civil war . ”
House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) said McCain had “ displayed a fundamental misunderstanding about the situation in Iraq , our strained military , and American troops and their families . ”

Bush Halts Solar Plants Citing Environmental Concern Posted by Pile ( 10875 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Environment ]
Faced with a surge in the number of proposed solar power plants , the federal government has placed a moratorium on new solar projects on public land until it studies their environmental impact , which is expected to take about two years .
The Bureau of Land Management says an extensive environmental study is needed to determine how large solar plants might affect millions of acres it oversees in six Western states — Arizona , California , Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico and Utah .
But the decision to freeze new solar proposals temporarily , reached late last month , has caused widespread concern in the alternative - energy industry , as fledgling solar companies must wait to see if they can realize their hopes of harnessing power from swaths of sun-baked public land , just as the demand for viable alternative energy is accelerating .
“ It does n’t make any sense , ” said Holly Gordon , vice president for legislative and regulatory affairs for Ausra , a solar thermal energy company in Palo Alto , Calif .
“ The Bureau of Land Management land has some of the best solar resources in the world .
This could completely stunt the growth of the industry . ”
Much of the 119 million surface acres of federally administered land in the West is ideal for solar energy , particularly in Arizona , Nevada and Southern California , where sunlight drenches vast , flat desert tracts .
Galvanized by the national demand for clean energy development , solar companies have filed more than 130 proposals with the Bureau of Land Management since 2005 .
They center on the companies ’ desires to lease public land to build solar plants and then sell the energy to utilities .
According to the bureau , the applications , which cover more than one million acres , are for projects that have the potential to power more than 20 million homes .
All involve two types of solar plants , concentrating and photovoltaic .
Concentrating solar plants use mirrors to direct sunlight toward a synthetic fluid , which powers a steam turbine that produces electricity .
Photovoltaic plants use solar panels to convert sunlight into electric energy .
Much progress has been made in the development of both types of solar technology in the last few years .
Photovoltaic solar projects grew by 48 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 .
Eleven concentrating solar plants are operational in the United States , and 20 are in various stages of planning or permitting , according to the Solar Energy Industries Association .

What ’s the Crock Pot ?
Just a simmering bowl of lentils and herbs , with a dash of DMing observations .
Do n’t be afraid to dip in your ladle and stir , or throw in something from your own spice rack .
Death - proofed PCs
Everything I ’d heard about Fourth Edition D&D was how hard it was to kill first - level characters — they ’re resilient , they ’re loaded with offensive capabilities and they ’ve got a batch of hit points .
If that ’s true , they ’re probably Troy - proof .
It ’s unlikely I ’ll kill a single PC when I take a turn behind the DM screen for a crack at the new game .
Well , that ’s what I told myself .
My hobgoblin longbow is awesome
I see no reason why a second hobgoblin archer should gain a + 2 attack bonus on an identical target if his fellow archer scores a hit — but that ’s the rule .
To all the PCs I skewered this way , I ’m sorry .
To Kill a Marking Bird
I kind of like this marking ability , but for the life of me I ca n’t keep the marked opponents clear from the unmarked ones — and we ’re using minis !
( That ’s because I love minis ! )
First thing Wizards of the Coast needs to do is produce a game aid — some kind of disk or chit — that lets me indicate which minis are marked .
And they need to do it fast .
( Otherwise , I may be forced to house rule marking to games rule oblivion . )
I want to avoid conversations like :
PC : This one ’s the one I marked with my paladin ’s Divine Challenge .
DM : You mean that one over there .
PC : No , no , this one over here .
DM : I could ’ve sworn you said that other one , instead .
PC : No , I was clearly pointing at this one .
DM : Whatever …. he ’s marked .
And he will attack the wizard .
PC : For attacking someone else , he takes damage .
That should be enough to kill him .
DM : You ’re right .
He ’s dead .
And that means this entire exchange was for nothing .
Who ’s turn is it next ?
Spending Your XP budget
I built every encounter according to Encounter Components formula on pages 56 - 57 in the DMG .
No more Challenge Ratings , just figure out the XP for a typical encounter appropriate to five PCs of that level and plug in the monsters until you reach your target .
Easy as pie .
In fact , this system makes designing encounters go very quick .
So what happens when the PCs forge ahead , and the monsters from the first encounter sorta get rolled into the batch of monsters lined up for the second encounter ?
You get a giant melee on the first floor of the watchtower against which first - level characters are clearly overmatched .
It was a slaughter , plainly put .
The hobgoblin soldier , his goblin minions and the goblin sharpshooters proved to be too much .
Heck , the hobgoblin archers from the first encounter really did n’t even enter the fray — and the minions were too busy fighting over the dead tiefling ’s backpack like some strange “ Dora The Explorer ” episode ( Backpack ! Backpack ! ) to be a factor , either .
Total Party Kill .
Right out of the gate .
And I played fair , darnit !
Clearly some adjustments are in order .
Here ’s a scary story that might make you think twice about cell phone security :
In California , a man recently lost over $ 1 million from his life savings due to a SIM card swapping scheme .
The entire hack only took a single night !
Phone hacking is more common than you might think , especially as smartphones continue to grow in popularity and sophistication .
So how do you know if you ’re the victim of a similar crime ?
Keep reading to learn about five telltale signs that you ’re the victim of phone hacking .
1. Strange Outgoing Texts or Calls
If you notice odd performance from your phone , the first thing you ’ll want to do is check your phone and text log .
Look for any incongruencies , especially in the outgoing call log .
Pay close attention to the first three digits of any unrecognized phone numbers , as these denote a caller ’s location .
Is the call to somewhere strange , or even overseas ?
If so , someone might have access to your phone .
2. Blocked Access to Phone Functions
Imagine unlocking your phone one day only to see a pop-up telling you that access to your phone is now blocked .
To regain access to your device , you ’ll have to pay a fee .
This is an example of a cyberattack called ransomware , and it ’s the digital equivalent of kidnapping .
What ’s more , paying the fee is rarely the end of things .
The criminal could still access your phone at any time , demanding even more money .
The best thing to do if you ’re the victim of ransomware is to contact the FBI ’s special cybercrime division .

3. Your Battery Life Is Decreased
During periods of heavy usage , your phone ’s battery life drains significantly .
While this is often explained by YouTube binge sessions or music playback , sudden changes can be cause for alarm .
Hop into your phone ’s settings menu and view your most recent usage report .
If you do n’t recognize some of the activity or there seem to be programs running in the background , contact your carrier as soon as possible .
4. Your Camera Turns Itself On
You ’ve probably heard how some of the world ’s leading tech giants put a piece of tape over their webcams .
While that ’s not necessary for your smartphone , it does bring up a good point .
Anyone with access to your phone can gain access to your camera roll — or your camera itself , and take any manner of photos or videos .
Periodically go through your camera roll to look for photos you do n’t recognize .
5. New Apps Appeared by Themselves
Manufacturers preload apps onto smartphones all the time .
Bloatware , as it ’s called , is an annoyance , but it ’s unharmful .
However , you should n’t confuse bloatware with shadow programs that are n’t registered with your carrier .
Again , go into your phone ’s activity log and peruse through the programs running in the background .
Phone Hacking Can Happen : Stay Safe
Phone hacking is only going to become more common as smartphone usage continues to grow .
Make sure you ’re keeping yourself safe by knowing about these five warning signs .

Since we started writing down the history of our race , man has frequently come up with revolting methods of killing for punishment .
This is a list of the most revolting methods of execution from history .
Thankfully most of them are no longer used .
10 Brazen Bull
The Brazen Bull was invented by Perilaus of Athens ( a Brass worker ) in the 6th Century BC and offered to Phalaris , Tyrant of Agrigentum , as a gift .
It was a large brass bull that was completely hollow inside with a door on the side large enough for a man to enter .
Once the man was inside the bull , a fire would be lit beneath it in order to roast him to death .
In the head of the bull , Perilaus put a series of tubes and stops that were designed to amplify the screams of the victim and make them sound like the roar of a bull .
Interestingly , Perilaus was the first person to feel the pain of the Brazen Bull .
After Perilaus said to Phalaris : “ [ his screams ] will come to you through the pipes as the tenderest , most pathetic , most melodious of bellowings ” , Phalaris was so disgusted that he tricked Perilaus in to entering the bull .
Lucian recounts the tale :
‘ His words revolted me .
I loathed the thought of such ingenious cruelty , and resolved to punish the artificer in kind .
“ If this is anything more than an empty boast , Perilaus , ” I said to him , “ if your art can really produce this effect , get inside yourself , and pretend to roar ; and we will see whether the pipes will make such music as you describe . ”
He consented ; and when he was inside I closed the aperture , and ordered a fire to be kindled .
“ Receive , ” I cried , “ the due reward of your wondrous art : let the music - master be the first to play . ”
Phalaris I:12
Perilaus was removed from the Bull before he died and Phalaris had him thrown off a cliff .
The Brazen Bull became one of the most common methods of execution in Ancient Greece .
9 Hanging Drawing and Quartering
Advertisement
Hanging drawing and quartering was the common form of punishment in England for the crime of treason which was considered the worst crime you could commit .
The punishment was only applied to men – women found guilty of treason were burnt at the stake .
Unbelievably , this punishment remained in law until 1814 .
The first stage of the execution was to be tied to a wooden frame and dragged behind a horse to the place of your death .
Following that , the criminal would be hanged until they were nearly dead .
The criminal would then be removed from the noose and laid on a table .
The executioner would then disembowel and emasculate the victim , and burn the entrails in front of his eyes .
He would still be alive at this point .
The person would then be beheaded and their body cut in to quarters .
Samuel Pepys , in his famous diary , was an eyewitness at one of these executions :
To my Lord ’s in the morning , where I met with Captain Cuttance , but my Lord not being up I went out to Charing Cross , to see Major - general Harrison hanged , drawn , and quartered ; which was done there , he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition .
He was presently cut down , and his head and heart shown to the people , at which there was great shouts of joy .
It is said , that he said that he was sure to come shortly at the right hand of Christ to judge them that now had judged him ; and that his wife do expect his coming again .
Thus it was my chance to see the King beheaded at White Hall , and to see the first blood shed in revenge for the blood of the King at Charing Cross .
The normal practice was to send the five parts of the body to various areas where they would be put on display on a gibbet as a warning to others .
8 Burning
Burning at the Stake was normally done in one of two ways .
In the first , the victim would be lead to the center of a wall of sticks and straw and tied to the stake , after which the space between the criminal and the wall would be filled with wood – concealing the person .
It is believed that this is the manner in which St Joan of Arc was burnt .
The other method was to pile sticks and straw up to the level of the calves only .
When performed by a skilled executioner , the person would burn in this sequence : calves , thighs and hands , torso and forearms , breasts , upper chest , face ; and then finally death .
Needless to say this would have been excruciating .
If a large number of people were to be burnt at the same time , death could occur through carbon monoxide poisoning before the fire reached you .
If the fire was small , you could die of shock , blood loss , or heatstroke .
In later versions of burning at the stake , the criminal would be hanged until dead and then burnt symbolically .
This method of execution was used to burn witches in most parts of Europe , but it was not used in England for that purpose .
7 Ling Chi
Ling Chi – execution by slow cutting – was practiced in China until it was outlawed in 1905 .
In the execution , the criminal is slowly cut in the arms , legs , and chest , until finally they are beheaded or stabbed in the heart .
Many western accounts of the execution method are largely exaggerated , with some claiming that the execution could take days to perform .
One modern eyewitness report from Journalist and Politician Henry Norman , describes an execution thus :
The criminal is fastened to a rough cross , and the executioner , armed with a sharp knife , begins by grasping handfuls from the fleshy parts of the body , such as the thighs and the breasts , and slicing them off .
After this he removes the joints and the excrescences of the body one by one - the nose and ears , fingers and toes .
Then the limbs are cut off piecemeal at the wrists and the ankles , the elbows and knees , the shoulders and hips .
Finally , the victim is stabbed to the heart and his head cut off .
You can see a particularly revolting image of a criminal who has been executed by this method here and another here .
6 Breaking Wheel
The breaking wheel was also known as the Catherine Wheel and it was a mediaeval execution device .
The criminal would be attached to a cart wheel and his arms and legs stretched out along the spokes .
The wheel would be made to turn while a heavy metal bar or hammer would deliver bone breaking blows to various parts of the body between the spokes .
If a merciful execution had been ordered , after a large number of bones were shattered , fatal blows would be delivered .
In cases where mercy was not offered , the criminal would remain on the wheel until they died – this could sometimes take days and the person would die of shock and dehydration .
After the shattering was complete , the limbs of the person would be woven between the spokes and the wheel would be hoisted to the top of a pole for birds to eat the , sometimes still living , body .
In France , a special grace was sometimes offered in which the criminal would be strangled to death before the blows were delivered , or after only two or three .

5 Boiling
In execution by boiling , the condemned is stripped naked and either placed in a vat of boiling liquid , or in a vat of cold liquid which was then heated to boiling .
The liquid could be oil , acid , tar , water , or molten lead .
During the reign of King Henry VIII it was a punishment especially reserved for poisoners .
“ The preamble of the statute of Henry VIII ( which made poisoning treason ) in 1531 recites that one Richard Roose ( or Coke ) , a cook , by putting poison in some food intended for the household of the bishop of Rochester and for the poor of the parish of Lambeth , killed a man and woman .
He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to be boiled to death without benefit of clergy .
He was publicly boiled at Smithfield .
In the same year a maid - servant for poisoning her mistress was boiled at King ’s Lynn . ” [ Encyclopedia Britannica , 1911 ]
The “ Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London ” ( published by the Camden Society ) has an account of a case at Smithfield , in which a man was fastened to a chain and let down into boiling water several times until he was dead .
In modern days , Idi Amin has been accused of using this method of execution on his enemies .
4 Flaying
Execution by Flaying is when the skin of the criminal is removed from their body with the use of a very sharp knife .
Attempts are made to keep the skin intact .
This is a very ancient method of execution .
The apostle Bartholomew was flayed and crucified upside down .
His skin and bones are kept in a Cathedral in Sicily .
There are accounts of Assyrians flaying the skin from a captured enemy or rebellious ruler and nailing it to the wall of his city , as warning to all who would defy their power .
The Aztecs of Mexico flayed victims of ritual human sacrifice , generally after death .
While this method of execution is not lawful in any country , in 2000 , government troops in Myanma ( Burma ) allegedly flayed all of the males of a Karenni village .
3 Necklacing
Necklacing is a type of execution in which a rubber tyre is filled with gasoline , forced over the arms and chest of the victim , and set alight .
It was a common practice in South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s anti-apartheid struggle .
Necklacing sentences were sometimes handed down against alleged criminals by “ people ’s courts ” established in black townships as a means of circumventing the apartheid judicial system .
Necklacing was also used to punish members of the black community who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid regime .
These included black policemen , town councilors and others , as well as their relatives and associates .
The practice was frequently carried out in the name of the African National Congress ( ANC ) , and was even endorsed by Winnie Mandela , then - wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela and a senior member of the ANC , although the ANC officially condemned the practice .
[ Wikipedia ]
Necklacing has also occured in Brazil , and Haiti , and at least one person was killed by this method in Nigeria during muslim protests over the Muhammad Cartoons .
2 Scaphism
Scaphism is an Ancient Persian method of execution .
According to Wikipedia , a naked person would be firmly fastened within a back - to - back pair of narrow rowboats ( or in some variations a hollowed out tree trunk ) , the head , hands , and feet protruding from this improvised container .
The condemned was forced to ingest milk and honey to the point of developing severe diarrhea , and more honey would be rubbed on his body so as to attract insects to the exposed appendages .
They would then be left to float on a stagnant pond ( or alternately , simply exposed to the sun somewhere ) .
The defenseless individual ’s feces accumulated within the container , attracting more insects , which would eat and breed within his or her exposed ( and increasingly gangrenous ) flesh .
Death , when it eventually occurred , was probably due to a combination of dehydration , starvation and septic shock .
Plutarch writes that it took Mithridates 17 days to die by this method of execution .
Native American Indians also used a similar method of execution where they would tie the victim to a tree , smear him and leave him to the ants .
Because he was not previously force - fed , he would generally starve in a few days .
1 Sawing
In Execution by sawing , the criminal would be hung upside - down and a large saw would be used to cut their body in half , starting with the groin , all the way to the head .
Because the person was hanging upside - down , the brain received sufficient blood to keep them alive until the saw finally reached the main blood vessels in the abdomen .
In the Asian version of this execution , the victim would stand upright and the sawing would begin at the top of the head .
Some traditions state that the Prophet Isaiah was executed by the saw .
It is believed that Saint Paul is making reference to this in his Epistle to the Hebrews 11:37 :
They were stoned , they were cut asunder , they were tempted , they were put to death by the sword , they wandered about in sheepskins , in goatskins , being in want , distressed , afflicted .
This method of execution was used in the Middle East , Europe , and parts of Asia .
It was also used in the Roman Empire and was considered to be the favorite punishment dished out by Emperor Caligula .
A man whose wife died as a result of an NHS blunder has lost his right to remain in Britain , in what a coroner described yesterday as an " extraordinary " decision .
Arnel Cabrera , 39 , came to Britain from the Philippines in 2003 to join his wife , Mayra , a theatre nurse , who worked at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon .
But a year later , Mrs Cabrera died at the same hospital after she was given an epidural during the birth of the couple 's child which was mistakenly injected into her arm .
The baby survived .

An inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing and found the NHS trust had been guilty of gross negligence .
Now the Home Office has told Mr Cabrera he has failed in his bid to remain in the UK .
David Masters , the Wiltshire coroner who presided over the inquest , said yesterday : " This is extraordinary .
In view of the verdict reached at the inquest I find it difficult to appreciate how the Home Office has reached this decision . "
In its letter of refusal , the Home Office said Mr Cabrera had " not established a family life with his son in the United Kingdom " .
It added : " As his son remains in the Philippines there are no insurmountable obstacles to his family life being continued overseas . "
Alex Rook , the solicitor who handled Mr Cabrera 's immigration case , said : " This is an absolutely dreadful decision .
If Arnel 's wife had not been killed , the family would be living happily here .
I will be writing to the relevant Home Office ministers asking them to reconsider their decision . "
He added : " His wife is killed by one part of the Government [ the NHS ] , then Arnel is told by another part of the Government that he has to leave . "
Mr Rook said Mr Cabrera had taken his son , Zac , to the Philippines to be looked after by family until the inquest and related legal proceedings had concluded in the UK , but it was always his intention to build a future in Britain .
Mr Cabrera 's personal injury lawyer , Seamus Edney , also reacted with disgust .
" I am staggered by this decision and embarrassed on behalf of our government , " he said .
" Arnel was permitted to reside in Britain on the basis that his wife was working – but when she is unlawfully killed by gross negligence by the NHS , he is told he is no longer welcome . "
In a statement issued before Mr Cabrera lost his right to remain in the UK , he said he hoped the Government would show him " compassion " .
He added : " I have been unable to return to the Philippines during this difficult period and I desperately miss my young son , Zachary . "
A spokesman for the Home Office said : " All applications for leave to enter or remain in the UK are carefully considered on their individual merits . "
PARIS  Christian Dior , the French fashion brand , has become the latest global company to learn a hard lesson about the danger of offending Chinese pride .
Facing the possibility of a boycott of its products , the luxury company said on Thursday that it had dropped the American actress Sharon Stone from its advertising in China after she suggested last week that the recent earthquakes in Sichuan Province were karmic retribution for Beijing ’s treatment of Tibet .
“ They had no choice ” but to drop her from China , said Tom Bernardin , the chairman and chief executive of the advertising agency Leo Burnett Worldwide .
“ Obviously , she crossed the line . ”
Ms. Stone said last week during the Cannes Film Festival : “ I ’m not happy about the way the Chinese are treating the Tibetans because I do n’t think anyone should be unkind to anyone else .
And then the earthquake and all this stuff happened , and then I thought , is that karma ?
When you ’re not nice that the bad things happen to you ? ”
Second hot - button post ot the day , and the last one .
I 've been promising a post about masturbation for a couple of days .
This is especially important because what I 'm about to write is at least partially in contrast to what I wrote just seven months ago .
I have reread that post several times , and my own views have ( as they sometimes do ) evolved .
There were some things I was n't ready to write back in August 2005 that I am ready to write now .
What I wrote then was largely based on what I was comfortable teaching ; I did n't touch much ( sorry ) on how it is that I seek to live my own life .
Now , I 'm ready to do that .
First off , I 'm not writing to titillate or to offend .
I 'm trying to balance several things together here as I write : my feminism , my faith , and my ever - evolving understanding of human psychology and sexuality .
But in the end , this post is going to be written from a spiritual perspective , one that will be sharply at odds with conventional feminist thought .
Below this post on Monday , my reader and student " Mermade " asked :
Is it possible to masturbate without lust involved ?
My boyfriend , who has struggled with porn and masturbation , says that it is impossible to masturbate without using some sort of lustful stimulation ( except in the cases of children , which is an entirely different topic ) .
Anyway , we know lusting creates many problems , problems which I have personally witnessed and been VERY hurt by .
Therefore , if it is impossible to masturbate without hurtful lustful thoughts , should masturbation itself be endorsed as healthy if it cannot be done without damaging thoughts ?
I have always wondered how feminism views women masturbating to porn depicting naked men ( Playgirl , etc . )
I am firmly against the sex industry and I wholeheartedly agree that men must give up their lust after women in order to be pro-feminist .
However , I have scarcely heard about how people feel regarding women lusting and masturbating after men and whether or not feminism sees that as wrong .
Granted , the porn industry is mostly aimed at men's interest .
However , many women lust after porn as well , and I do n't believe that 's right either .
( That kind of fits in with " me too " feminism ) .
I would like to hear yours and other people 's thoughts on that .
It 's at this point that a great many of my secular readers , particularly feminist progressives , will start to get annoyed .
( I almost said " hackles up " , but caught myself in time . )
In the secular feminist world in which I was marinated for years and years as a child , a college student , and a periodic activist , no one ever expressed any negative feelings about masturbation .
And this always struck me as odd , frankly .
I 've written a lot about pornography and the sex industry , and I 've critiqued them using both a Christian and a feminist perspective .
I readily concede that feminism is divided on the ills of pornography ; some feminists see all porn as problematic , while others prefer to draw distinctions between porn that demeans and objectifies women and erotic imagery in which women 's pleasure matters , and in which women are active agents .
But here 's what got me when I was in college , and what I could never fully understand when I was in discussion with my fellow anti-porn feminists : why is it wrong for men to purchase , view , and masturbate to pornography , but not wrong for those same men to masturbate to demeaning fantasies of women in their heads ?
If we are n't just objecting to the industry of porn , but also to the way in which men and women objectify each other , should n't we consider also consider the ethics of masturbation " ?
That 's what I intend to do here .
Mermade asks some serious questions , the sort that generally only get asked in religious circles ( where the healthiness of masturbation is not taken for granted , as it is in the secular world ) .
Her first question is critical :
Is it possible to masturbate without lust ( or lustful fantasies ) ?
I suppose it 's possible , but I do n't think most people do .
If there are folks who masturbate to orgasm while balancing their checkbooks , or while contemplating the Sensenbrenner immigration bill , I suppose that they 'll write in to refute me , but I am fairly certain most people , men and women , use sexual fantasy as a key part of their masturbatory routines .
I can hear the chorus now : Sure , Hugo , everyone fantasizes !
It 's natural and healthy , though !
Are you seriously going to question whether or not it 's acceptable to masturbate ?
Do you want to give all of your students a massive guilt complex ?
Well , hold on a bit , folks .
I 'm not denying that sexual fantasy is a powerful part of most of our lives , and a part of our lives that most secular voices insist we ought not even try and control .
In the secular world , ethics is about our actions , not the substance of our thoughts .
Fantasy , therefore , is nearly universally regarded as harmless ; as long as we do n't act on all of our fantasies ( particularly when they involve boundary violations of one sort or another ) , we 're told to enjoy our private reveries ( with or without masturbation . )
But if there 's one overwhelming thing that most of the world 's great spiritual traditions agree on , it 's this : our thoughts do matter .
In the Abrahamic religious tradition , the tenth commandment is " Thou Shalt Not Covet . "
To " covet " is to long for , desire , lust after , envy , etc .
This commandment comes after earlier commandments about theft and adultery .
To borrow language from our Buddhist friends ,
It 's clear that God is calling His people not only to right action , but also to right thought .
Jesus continues the theme in Matthew 5:28 : But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
It 's difficult to look at Scripture and continue to insist that masturbatory fantasy is harmless !
Fleeting thoughts are impossible to control .
But it 's one thing to have a fleeting thought , and another to " entertain " the thought for any length of time .
To paraphrase the famous line from Martin Luther , " I can't stop the birds from flying over my head , but I can stop them from building nests in my hair . "
Fantasy and lust -- for anyone other than my wife -- is letting the birds build a nest on my head .
And I am convinced that that fantasy life is at odds with my spiritual and physical commitments .
I remember , several years ago , meeting two very different men who helped develop my views on masturbation .
One was a Dominican brother who was studying at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley ; the other was a very advanced yoga practitioner I met when I was in grad school at UCLA .
I became good friends with both , though I never ended up becoming either a Dominican or a yogi ( hey , there 's still time ! )
The Dominican was just a few years older than me ; the yoga teacher was in his forties .
And at different times , in different ways , the subject of masturbation came up .
Both men , despite their disparate religious traditions , were celibate in the truest sense -- they not only did n't have sex with other people , they did n't have sex with themselves .
The Dominican told me he had n't masturbated since he was 17 ; the yogi had gone more than a decade without ejaculating .
( There is a school in yogistic thought that is big on sperm re-absorption and celibacy , but I can't remember which one it is . )
As you might suspect , I had a hard time believing either man !
At first I though they were lying .
Then , choosing to believe them , I began to suspect they were stark raving nuts .
I argued with my Dominican friend , pointing out that God says nothing about masturbation in the Bible ; I argued with my yogi friend , saying that it simply was n't healthy to go that long without orgasm .
Both men were patient with me ( they 'd heard this sort of thing before ) .
My Dominican friend emphasized what I emphasized above -- our obligation to honor God with our minds as well as our actions ; my yoga friend emphasized the extraordinary physical and psychic benefits of restriction and self - control .
I was n't convinced by either man , though I 've never forgotten what they shared with me .
I 've come to the following conviction in my own life : for me , as a Christian man on a radical spiritual journey , masturbation falls short of the mark .
All of my sexual energy ( in thoughts as well as behavior ) goes towards my wife .
Now , that 's easy for someone in a relationship to say , of course .
I have n't posted on this before for that reason !
First of all , it 's an intensely private subject .
Second of all , I know that my words in a public forum such as this have considerable power .
My goal is not to shame anyone .
Please know , I do n't tell the teenagers that I work with in my youth group not to masturbate ; when the topic comes up in my courses on gender , I never make the suggestion that I think that masturbation " falls short of the mark . "
This is a private conviction that I 've arrived at -- and yet , it 's such a vital part of so many people 's lives and it's so intimately connected to other issues that we discuss on this blog -- that I felt compelled to address it here .
More recently , I 've met several young men and women in a variety of spiritual traditions who have chosen not to masturbate as well as refrain from sex outside of marriage .
I 've seen young celibate men ( at their stereotypical sexual peak ) choose to channel all of their sexual energy into other aspects of their lives ; some are Kabbalists and some are Catholics but all are convinced that is indeed humanly possible to live without masturbation .
As one young man I know who studies Kabbalah put it , " I believe that the purpose of sex is n't necessarily procreation -- I believe it 's sharing .
Sex is only truly appropriate and sacred when it is an act of sharing light and joy with another human being .
Masturbation is all about me , and my goal is to think less about me and more about the world I am called to serve .
It 's very difficult to restrict , but it is n't impossible . "
Do I think masturbation is a sin ?
No .
Do I think folks ought to be ashamed of masturbating , or of sexual fantasies ?
Of course not .
But have I seen very real benefits in my own life and in the lives of others from giving it up ?
You bet .
At nearly forty , I still have a strong and vibrant libido , thanks -- but today , all of it is directed towards one other human being , and that human being is not myself .
On my spiritual journey , I 've come to the point where I find tremendous liberation not in following my impulses but in sublimating them .
( I 'm just the latest in a very long line of men and women who have come to that same conclusion , of course . )
In the end , I chose to let go of masturbation and sexual fantasy because they were at odds with my vision of what it meant to live a life of servanthood and discipleship .
I believe today that everything I do and say is an ethical issue .
How I spend money , how I eat , how I vote , how I share my time , how I love , how I think , how I fantasize , how I use sexuality .
It 's easier , of course , to live up to these commitments as a married man -- but I have a large number of friends of a wide variety of ages who have made the same decision , and many of them are single .
They are not bitter and angry ; indeed , though their lives are not without struggle , they seem more joyous and energetic than many of their peers who have not made the same decision .
I am convinced that good people can disagree strongly about this issue .
I am convinced that one can masturbate and be psychologically healthy .
But from time to time , folks like Mermade have asked me what my true feelings were about masturbation and fantasy .
And at long last , I feel comfortable and confident enough to offer my true answer in a public forum .

Personal Survival Kits are designed to be placed in a shirt or coat pocket so that no matter if the big primary survival kit is lost , as long as you make it out in one piece you have some basic survival gear at hand .
This is in addition to the do n't leave home without it gear listed below that is carried in pant pockets .
There is admittedly some redundancy , but only in areas of grave importance , like fire starting .
These three kits differ primarily in size , and therefore the amount of equipment in each .
The large kit fits in a coat or jacket pocket or an oversize shirt pocket .
The small kit will fit in most shirt pockets .
The mini - kit will fit in almost any pocket .
The shiny tinned tobacco container of the small and mini kits , which I have polished to a virtual mirror finish , serves as a pair of signaling mirrors .
This does n't preclude carrying a small lightweight signal mirror in a pocket or on a lanyard around the neck , but it is n't essential to include one in the kit , taking up valuable room .

This is a list of the survival gear packed into the equipment pockets of my Switlik " Helicopter Crew Life Vest " and on my belt for use during overwater flights in case of ditching ( see Ditching ( for pilots ) .
All items in vest storage pockets are secured to the vest with poly line lanyards , so they wo n't be lost .
Following that is my Over Water / Ocean Survival
Kit that is packed into a yellow Underwater Kinetics ( UKE ) waterproof " Kinetics Case " which will float , open or closed .
It has a 6 ft. poly line with clip attached to it for securing to survivors or a raft .
This kit is assembled when needed ( rarely , not a lot of ocean or big lakes in the desert ) , using , in large part , components from my other kits .
( NOTE :
This is based on aviation requirements which are weight and volume limited and assume a reasonably short rescue interval .
Marine requirements are much more comprehensive for many items and also require inclusion of additional items not included here .
See the ETS aticle on Abandon Ship Bags for more information . )
Many items would be useful while in a life raft or floating in a life vest , others are strictly for land use if a crash occurs enroute to or from the over water portion of the flight or upon making landfall after a ditching .
A few items are strictly for use on the water .
This kit would serve as a supplement to , or replacement for , the basic , generally inadequate , survival equipment pack included in most aviation life rafts ( see Aviation Life Raft Reviews - Survival Equipment and Supplies ) .
All contents in the kit are vacuum packed or placed inside 4 mil ziplock style plastic bags .
Some items have been selected for their resistance to damage by sea water .

TOP EXPORTERS TO IRAQ TOP EXPORTERS TO IRAQ January through April ( in millions ) : United States : $ 737 Turkey : $ 648 China : $ 358 Thailand : $ 110 South Korea : $ 102 Source : Global Trade Information Services WASHINGTON  European and Asian companies are beating their American rivals into Iraq now that security has improved the investment climate , Iraq and U.S. officials say .
" It 's starting to turn … and the people who are getting in on the ground floor are not American , " said Paul Brinkley , the Pentagon official who is leading U.S. efforts to help Iraq rebuild its economy .
" It 's ironic . "
Foreign companies , including U.S. investors , have committed to deals worth about $ 500 million so far this year and Brinkley expects at least $ 1 billion in foreign investment by the end of the year .
So far , Romanian consortium and a Lebanese company have signed revenue - sharing deals with Iraqi state - owned cement factories .
Each group will invest about $ 150 million .
China has also aggressively pursued the Iraqi market , selling machinery to the government and electronic products to consumers .
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , in Washington on an official visit , said Monday that larger U.S. firms were waiting for more security before entering the market .
Zebari noted that Turkish and Russian companies were already active in Iraq .
" They take risks , " he told USA TODAY in an interview .
" No pain , no gain . "
Many of the companies active in Iraq now are from countries , including France , Russia and Turkey , that did not send combat troops to back the U.S. - led invasion .
Some U.S. and Iraqi officials say American companies risk losing an early opportunity to establish long - term strategic ties with Iraq .
" My question is , ' Where are you guys in terms of investment , in terms of economic engagement ? ' " said Naufel al - Hassan , Iraq 's commercial counselor in Washington .
" Iraqis need your support .
Why let someone else do that ? "
There are no reliable historic numbers , but the deals this year are among the first major investment opportunities outside U.S. - funded reconstruction projects and they signal new confidence in Iraq 's economy .
The activity by non-U.S. companies is not a cause for concern , said Charles Reis , the U.S. counselor for economic transition in Iraq .
" This is a normalization of Iraq 's relationship with the rest of the world , " he said .
Large U.S. companies won the bulk of the $ 20 billion worth of reconstruction contracts funded by the military .
Now , however , opportunities are riskier and require more local understanding .
That has favored non-U.S. investors who have had prewar experience in Iraq , said Timothy Mills , president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Iraq .
American companies may also be reluctant to invest in Iraq because the war has generated so much controversy at home , Brinkley said .
The private investments that come from the USA are generally individual or institutional investors — not American corporations , Brinkley said .
U.S. investors , for example , are part of a $ 120 million deal to build a hotel in the heavily fortified Green Zone , where U.S. and Iraqi government offices are located .
Americans lead other nations in the number of exports to Iraq , but other nations have ramped up trade .
China doubled the number of exports to Iraq this year .
China is now Iraq 's third - largest trade partner behind the USA and Turkey , according to Global Trade Information Services , a firm that tracks trade statistics .

Polish researchers have revealed the many ways you can hide messages within the bit stream of Voip phone calls .
If secret policemen did n't like Skype and its IP telephony cousins before , they 'll really hate it now .
Burying hidden message in internet phone calls represents the latest evolution of steganography .
Steganographic techniques for hiding messages have been around for as long as cryptography and have evolved with technology .
Steganography once included messages hidden in wax tablets by the ancient Greeks and invisible ink and microdots on paper .
Now it involves concealing messages within digitally transmitted images or sound files .
The advantage of steganography over simply scrambling messages using cryptographic techniques is that potential eavesdroppers do n't know what to listen to .
Subtle changes to images , the content of spam messages or a little extra noise in voice over IP communications are hard to detect and impossible to decipher without knowing that a message is there and applying appropriate unbundling and deciphering software .
The possibility of dropping hidden messages within the lowest bits of noisy sound files is not new in itself .
Wojciech Mazurczyk and Krzysztof Szczypiorski , security researchers at Warsaw University of Technology , Poland , have extended this work to show how steganography techniques might be used to create a covert communications channel within VoIP streams .
In particular the researchers have developed two new techniques that exploit the fact that VoIP systems tolerate packet loss and have built - in redundancy .
One approach exploits unused fields in the RTCP ( Real - Time Control Protocol ) and RTP ( Real - Time Transport Protocol ) protocols to transmit hidden messages .
Another technique used delayed audio packets to hide covert communications .
Mazurczyk and Szczypiorski's paper also goes through many other possible techniques for VoIP steganography .
In an experiment the researchers were able to covertly transmit more than 1.3 Mbits of data in one direction during a VoIP call lasting nine minutes , the average time for such calls .
Mazurczyk and Szczypiorski found that protocol steganography was by far the quickest way to transmit covert messages .
Law enforcement officials have expressed frustration about the difficulty of deciphering VoIP messages made by suspected terrorists using Skype .
Leaked documents suggest German cops have commissioned the development of software to intercept Skype VoIP communications and SSL transmissions .
This difficulties exist because of the cryptography natively employed by Skype without even considering the complicating factor of steganography .
Mazurczyk and Szczypiorski's paper on Steganography of VoIP Streams can be found here ( pdf ) .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Among the nightmares lurking around the corner for the already battered housing and credit markets would be a meltdown at mortgage financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Although few are predicting an imminent need for a bailout just yet , credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's recently placed an estimated price tag on this worst case scenario -- $ 420 billion to $ 1.1 trillion of taxpayer 's money .
This dwarfs how much it cost to help banks during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's and early 1990's .
That cost taxpayers about $ 250 billion in today 's dollars .
S&P added that saving Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) might cost so much that the federal government 's AAA credit rating , the top possible rating , might even be at risk .
If that was lost , then all federal government borrowing would become more expensive .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both help the mortgage market function by purchasing pools of loans and packaging them into securities .
So it is crucial for the mortgage industry for the two agencies to continue functioning smoothly .
The two companies are known as government - sponsored entities because they have Congressional charters , which implies that the federal government is behind them .
Fannie did not comment about the S&P report .
According to a statement from Freddie , the firm said the S&P report was just " a scenario analysis , not a prediction " and added that " Freddie Mac remains a well capitalized company . "
Victoria Wagner , a S&P credit analyst who worked on the report , said S&P is n't predicting that Fannie and Freddie would necessarily need a bailout at this time .
But she and other analysts are concerned about the impact more problems could have on the mortgage market since the two companies have become increasingly important to the health of the industry .
Both companies are forecast to report more losses this year due to declining home prices and rising mortgage defaults .
Risks increasing
Wagner pointed out that at the end of January , 82 % of all mortgages in the U.S. were backed by one of the firms , up from only 46 % in the second quarter of 2007 .
Fannie and Freddie primarily back so - called conforming loans , those made to borrowers with good credit and large down payments .
But even limited exposure to subprime loans has n't stopped them from running up huge losses as home prices tumbled and foreclosures soared .
And Fannie and Freddie 's role in the mortgage and real estate markets is likely to grow , as Congress recently allowed them to back larger mortgages , up to $ 729,750 , up from the previous limit of $ 417,000 .
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , which regulates both firms , also recently lowered the capital requirements for Fannie and Freddie in an effort to pump $ 200 billion more into the credit markets .
The new loan limits will increase the risks and losses for Fannie and Freddie , said Wagner and other experts .
The high priced markets where homeowners and buyers need larger loans are now the ones seeing steep home price declines .
And the default rates on larger loans are greater than the smaller loans that had previously been the core of their business .
" I do n't think the message is a bailout is necessary or imminent , " Wagner said .
" But they 're facing this increased role at a time that their own credit performance is suffering from the rifts in the housing and mortgage markets .
They 're both projecting much higher losses than we 've seen in some time . "
Some see bailout as more likely
But other experts expect that declining home values will force more borrowers who have a Fannie - or Freddie - backed loan to stop making payments in the coming months , rather than continuing to make payments on a home now worth less than their loan balance .
Rising job losses may also make it difficult for other borrowers who formerly had good credit to stay current on their mortgage payments .
" The real fundamental problem is real estate prices have been falling and they might fall substantially more , " said Robert Shiller , a Yale University economist who argued for years that a bubble was forming in real estate prices .
" OFHEO and Fannie and Freddie never considered the possibility of a massive real estate correction . "
Some economists suggest that if investors start to see problems in the performance of loans backed by Fannie and Freddie , they 'll dump them .
And that would force the federal government to step in .
" I would say there 's at least a 50 - 50 chance of some sort of bailout .
I 'm not saying it will necessarily cost $ 1 trillion , but they 'll need some kind of help , and it very well could happen this year , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research
Investors are signaling growing concern as well .
The yield premium for securities backed by Freddie and Fannie compared to the yield on Treasury bills has grown to about 2.25 percentage points from 1.7 percentage points at the beginning of the year .
That 's a sign that the investors see a greater risk of Fannie and Freddie running into bigger problems .
And OFHEO , in its annual report this week , said that while Fannie and Freddie have made progress clearing up accounting problems that had dogged both firms , they remain " a significant supervisory risk . "
The agency added that since current home price declines are without precedent , the firms will have a difficult time correctly pricing the risk of the mortgages they 're backing .
But Jaret Seiberg , financial services analyst for policy research firm Stanford Group , said Fannie and Freddie ultimately should be able to weather the storm though simply because there is no question that the government would bail them out .
So there should n't be a crisis of confidence about their future in the way that there was for investment bank Bear Stearns before the Fed stepped in and agreed to back $ 29 billion in potential losses so JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) could buy Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) .
" What has allowed Fannie and Freddie to continue to operate when the private mortgage - backed security market dried up is their implicit government guarantee , " said Seiberg .
This week 's Directions Symposium topic is mobile Linux , so drop into the Symposium to discuss this post with Intel engineers who are contributing free software to projects like moblin.org .
The relationship of mutual benefit that exists between mobile device makers and the open source development community on which they increasingly depend presents a unique paradox .
Specifically , advancing the development of free software sometimes necessitates compromises that limit software freedom , particularly when it comes to providing open - source support for technologies like DRM .
Nokia open source director Ari Jaaksi shared some of his thoughts about this paradox at the Handsets World Conference in Berlin last week , where he argued in favor of finding a stronger middle - ground through communication .
Jaaksi notes that there are some important lessons that Nokia has learned from the open source community , such as the value of working upstream .
Companies that are accustomed to proprietary development often tend to fork an open source project internally and then do a public code drop later in order to meet licensing obligations when they release a product .
Working directly upstream with other contributors , he says , can prevent fragmentation and accelerate development .
Although he believes that companies need to adapt to and learn from the open source approach , he also thinks that the open source community should be more understanding of the challenges faced by companies and the reasons behind some their restrictive business practices .
" We want to educate open - source developers .
There are certain business rules [ developers ] need to obey , such as DRM , IPR [ intellectual property rights ] , SIM locks and subsidized business models , " Jaaksi said , according to BusinessWeek .
" Why do we need closed vehicles ?
We do .
Some of these things harm the industry but they 're here [ as things stand ] .
These are touchy , emotional issues but this dialogue is very much needed .
As an industry , we plan to use open - source technologies but we are not yet ready to play by the rules ; but this needs to work the other way round too . "
He later clarified his position in a blog entry , in which he says that building a mutual understanding could lead to the discovery of less invasive or restrictive alternatives to current industry practices .
" I think it would benefit everybody if people developing open source code would understand WHY certain things are made the way they are , " he wrote .
" Maybe there are other reasons than stupidity and an evil mind ?
Trying to understand and learn would benefit both open source projects and corporate to come up with better solutions . "
In the long run , that kind of collaboration could potentially have a more positive impact than principled free software absolutism .
Refusing to compromise could deter adoption , whereas accommodating some of the dubious practices of companies that want to use open source would increase adoption rates , accelerate development , and gradually enlighten companies about the advantages of open technology .
On the other hand , developer accommodation of practices that are antithetical to open source principles might not sufficiently encourage companies to evolve in ways that are consistent with open source principles .
In many ways , this debate mirrors the controversy over the use of proprietary graphics drivers on the Linux desktop and proprietary technologies like Flash on the Internet .
Another point that is missing from this debate is the part that is played by end users .
Regardless of how Nokia and open source software developers view restrictive business practices , it is pressure from the consumer that will eventually make such practices untenable .
Regular users are increasingly fighting back as they become aware of the hidden costs built into locks and DRM .
These mechanisms are easily circumventable , and they cease to stay relevant when they are repeatedly cracked .
Exclusive Sun Microsystems looks poised to lead the " mainstream " multi- core race for at least a couple more years .
By late 2009 , the server maker should deliver a third major revision of its Niagara processor which will have 16 cores and an astonishing 16 threads per core , The Register has learned .
Today , Sun sells an eight - core " Niagara " chip that can handle eight software threads per core .
Customers can fit two of these UltraSPARC T2 + chips , as they 're officially called , into a server , providing up to 128 threads in a 1U system .
Soon enough , Sun will also sell a four - socket system code - named Botaka .
We 've confirmed that Sun is looking to push the UltraSPARC
Tx line to even greater heights with a 16 - core , 16 - thread per core eight - socket server .
So , each socket is chewing through an insane 256 threads .
And the eight - socket box will do 2,048 threads .
That 16 - core chip is the third major Niagara revision and is code - named KT .
It 's due to tape out in six months or so , as we hear it .
The new Niagara sounds an awful lot like Sun 's other 2009 chip - Rock .
Rock does , in fact , have 16 cores as well , but they 're beefier cores with better single thread performance .
Sun is claiming that Rock can do two or four threads per core , depending on whether or not you turn on its Scout pre-fetching technology .
The UltraSPARC
Tx line has turned into the shining star of Sun's SPARC server business , pulling in more than $ 1bn in sales per year .
The problem , however , seems to be that the UltraSPARC
Tx boxes eat up sales of other low - end systems , which has led to a steady decrease in shipments at Sun , while revenue has been flat to falling .

Fellow geeks , get ready to start hard - core lusting about what I ’m going to show you .
Meet “ The Emperor ” :
Yes , I know , the thing looks like some kind of imperial control station coming right out of a Star Wars movie , but if you look closely , you ’ll notice it ’s been designed to look like a scorpion ’s tail .
The geek in me refuses to admit the resemblance , though !
The Emperor features three widescreen monitors , THX Dolby surround sound , air filtering , light therapy , a Web cam , battery backup and many other things to help you fantasize about being a tyrannical army commander controlling a galaxy takeover .
NovelQuest , the company behind the device , will release full specs and price on July 24 .

Scarlett Johansson , the famous Hollywood actress who is best known for her amazing looks as well as her appearance in Lost in Translation , has decided to make an attempt at becoming a musician .
The full album is currently available exclusively for imeem users .
If you are n’t a member you can currently listen to 30 second clips .
If you do n’t know what imeem is , it is one of the leading social music sites on the web .
I had the opportunity to listen to Johansson ’s new album titled , “ Anywhere I Lay My Head ” and was n’t that impressed .
The music appears to be over produced , possibly a result of Johansson ’s less than magnificent voice .
I ’m not a professional music critic though so take my opinion with a grain of salt .
You can listen to her single “ Falling Down ” in the video player below .
Call me dense but I could n’t figure out what the point of her video was .
I ’m assuming that she ’s going through hard times in her life but all of the video clips are of her getting dolled up for the camera .
Then again there are obvious moments of her appearing sad but the video does n’t clearly illustrate the cause of her depression .
My guess is that the cause is from her breaking up with an ex .
Perhaps someone with a little more celebrity gossip knowledge can chime in here .
Update
In the post I described imeem as one of the “ leading social music sites on the web . ”
In reality , the company would prefer to be described as a “ social networking site . ”
According to their PR team , they are the third largest social network on the web with over 24 million active users each month .
An impressive number to say the least .

IMF Warns on Global Inflation
By Krishna Guha , Javier Blas ,
Chris Giles , and Ralph Atkins
Financial Times , London
Thursday , May 8 , 2008
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f30215fc-1d3d-11dd-82ae-000077b07658.html
Global inflation has re-emerged as a major threat to the world economy , the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday in a stark warning that marked an abrupt change of tone from its emphasis on the risks to growth .
John Lipsky , IMF deputy managing director , said " inflation concerns have resurfaced after years of quiescence " due to soaring energy and food prices .
Mr Lipsky said global growth was slowing but headline inflation was " accelerating . "
The IMF warning came as crude oil prices hit a record of almost $ 124 a barrel , up 99 per cent in the past 12 months , and customers scrambled to take out insurance against prices rising above $ 200 a barrel .
In an indication the commodities boom may not be the bubble imagined , Mr Lipsky said the forces pushing prices up " appear to be fundamental in nature " -- and these were being amplified by lower US interest rates and the dollar 's decline .
He was " optimistic " that there would not be a repeat of the early 1970s , when increasing energy prices ushered in a period of rising inflation expectations and accelerating inflation , but he said this risk " cannot be discarded out of hand . "
Mr Lipsky said policymakers must respond aggressively to any sign of rising inflation expectations " lest the impressive gains in global stability attained in recent years be sacrificed . "
The IMF 's inflation warning was reinforced by European central bankers , as the European Central Bank and Bank of England left interest rates unchanged despite increasing signs of economic weakness .
The eurozone was " experiencing a rather protracted period of high annual rates of inflation , " Jean - Claude Trichet , ECB president said .
It was " imperative " that the households and companies did not think inflation rates were normal and raise prices and wages accordingly .
The Bank of England rejected calls from representatives of the increasingly sickly housing market for lower interest rates , maintaining its rate at 5 per cent .
The monetary policy committee felt the increasing tension between rising inflation and lower growth did not allow it to cut rates twice in successive months .
The majority on the MPC are cautious cutting interest rates aggressively as inflation is moving increasingly above the bank 's 2 per cent target would send the wrong signal about its determination not to allow higher inflation to become ingrained again in British society .
The switch in emphasis from the IMF from growth to inflation follows the latest surge in the price of oil .
Mr Lipsky suggested part of this could be due to monetary policy and exchange rates .
He said IMF research suggests low interest rates effect commodity prices " above and beyond the traditional effect of increased demand " while the decline in the dollar since 2002 was responsible for about $ 25 of the increase in the oil price .
The IMF warned food prices would stay high for the foreseeable future .

[ In Ernest Adams ' latest Gamasutra column , he digs into difficulty levels in games , interestingly suggesting that player - set difficulty can , in many cases , be preferable to dynamic difficulty settings . ]
I just finished reading a book called Interactive Storytelling , by Andrew Glassner .
While the first couple of hundred pages contain useful introductions to both storytelling and game design ( for the novice , anyway ) , the book has some serious flaws and I can't really recommend it .
But along the way , Glassner digresses into a variety of other subjects , and one of them is settable difficulty levels .
He 's against them .
He thinks they ought to be banned .
This really pulled me up short when I read it .
My opinion is exactly the opposite : settable difficulty levels should be mandatory in most game genres .
In fact , I regard the lack of a difficulty setting as a Twinkie Denial Condition , except for a few kinds of games where they are n't suitable .
Since I feel so strongly about this , I was especially interested in Glassner 's objections to them .
I 'll take a look at , and respond to , his points before I go on to talk about his preferred alternative , dynamic difficulty adjustment ( also known as adaptive difficulty ) .
These are Glassner 's complaints about settable difficulty levels .
The player has to decide too early .
Games usually ask the player to choose a difficulty level right at the beginning , and at that point the player does n't actually know how hard the game is going to be because he has n't played it yet .
My response :
This is n't really an argument against difficulty settings .
A game could easily give the player an optional training level at medium difficulty , and then allow the player to decide if he wants the rest of the game to be easier , harder , or about the same .
But even without that , many players can make an educated guess about how well they 'll play based on their experience playing similar games ( I know I 'm lousy at platformers ) , or they may choose a difficulty setting for other reasons .
I always start every game on easy mode , because I 'm very busy and I want to see as much of the game as I can in as little time as possible .
On the other hand , hardcore players carrying a heavy testosterone load routinely put every game on its hardest setting ; that 's how you get bragging rights .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Crime groups operating as “ mobsters without borders ” have gained significant footholds in global markets and provide logistic support to terrorists , the United States said on Wednesday .
A power line pylon is seen in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
Launching a campaign against such international criminals , Attorney General Michael Mukasey said they were more adaptable and sophisticated than La Cosa Nostra and other syndicates the U.S. government set out to defeat half a century ago .
“ These international criminals pose real national security threats to this country , ” Mukasey said in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank .
He cited recent cases , many with links to the former Soviet bloc .
“ They touch all sectors of our economy , dealing in everything from cigarettes to oil ; clothing to pharmaceuticals , ” Mukasey said .
A department assessment of the organized crime threat found such groups “ control significant positions in the global energy and strategic materials markets , ” Mukasey said .
“ They are expanding their holdings in these sectors , which corrupts the normal functioning of these markets and may have a destabilizing effect on U.S. geopolitical interests . ”
He cited Semion Mogilevich , indicted by the United States in 2003 and arrested in Russia this January , who was suspected of exerting influence over “ large parts ” of the natural gas industry in the former Soviet Union .
MONEY LAUNDERING
The groups launder billions of dollars through U.S. financial institutions , and invest profits in publicly traded companies .
They also “ exploit the Internet , ” by running scams on eBay , flooding in - boxes with e-mail spam and laundering money through “ virtual worlds ” such as Second Life , Mukasey said .
Suspected arms traffickers such as Viktor Bout , a Russian national arrested in Thailand in March , provide support to terrorists , officials said .
But they said there are no signs of close ties between organized crime and the “ core al Qaeda ” organization .
Deputy FBI Director John Pistole said the groups ’ abilities to operate across national boundaries made them “ mobsters without borders . ”
To lead the fight , Mukasey said he had revived an Organized Crime Council of senior law enforcement officials across government , 15 years after it had gone dormant after winning major battles against U.S. organized crime .
The first task is to identify and target the global crime groups and their the leaders , Mukasey said .
The department will give more information to the State Department to help it deny visas to known criminals , and to the Treasury Department so it could impose sanctions against money laundering .
It will also increase cooperation with foreign countries -- training and assisting crime fighters .
But officials said they did not anticipate using anti-terrorist surveillance measures such as the controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or seeking new authorities from Congress .

In his testimony , he was especially pessimistic about any easing of energy prices , dismissing suggestions that they were being driven by speculation in futures markets .
Instead , he said high energy costs reflected the markets ’ recognition that demand was outstripping supplies .
“ Over the past several years , the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades , leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil , ” Mr. Bernanke said .
“ On the supply side , despite sharp increases in prices , the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years . ”
President Bush ’s remarks , and Mr. Bernanke ’s testimony , came at an unusually turbulent time in financial markets , since it followed on the heels of the Fed ’s announcement that it would temporarily open its discount window to the two troubled mortgage giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The actions to stabilize Fannie and Freddie occurred over the weekend as the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , also called for Congress to approve emergency legislation giving the federal government power to inject billions of federal funds through investments and loans .
The actions announced Sunday echoed similar actions in mid-March , when the Fed moved to avert a financial collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns by offering an emergency loan to facilitate its sale to JPMorgan Chase .
At the same time , the Fed set up emergency lending facilities for major investment banks hit by the credit crunch .
“ These steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains , ” Mr. Bernanke said .
But despite the “ positive effects ” of the Fed ’s actions , he said that the problems of unstable markets continued because of “ declining house prices , a softening labor market and rising prices of oil , food and some other commodities . ”
After Mr. Bernanke ’s testimony , Mr. Paulson and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Christopher Cox , took center stage .
One - legged war veteran saves mother and baby from thugs ... only to be arrested for carrying a truncheon
Stephen Beerling was arrested and held for 12 hours after coming to the aid of a mother and baby in distress
A one - legged Royal Navy veteran was arrested after he rescued his neighbour from being harassed by two men .
Stephen Beerling , 52 , dialled 999 and raced to help the women and her baby after hearing screams during the night .
But he was arrested when officers spotted a retractable truncheon he had picked up in case he had to protect himself .
Mr Beerling , a Liberal Democrat councillor , was arrested , locked up for 12 hours and charged with possessing an offensive weapon .
He told of his ordeal yesterday after learning the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to drop the charge against him .
Mr Beerling , of Maidstone , Kent , said : ' I am relieved , but very disappointed it even came to this .
I do n't blame the police but maybe they should have used their noggin .
Perhaps they were a little inexperienced .
The blame lies with the CPS - I just cannot understand why they wanted to press charges . '
Mr Beerling said the drama began at 2.30 am on March 19 when he was woken by screams from his next door neighbour and her baby , and the sound of men shouting .
He called police and strapped on the false leg he has worn since his leg was amputated in March 2004 while he was still serving with the Royal Navy .
Aware he was probably outnumbered , he picked up the telescopic truncheon and put it in his back pocket .
Mr Beerling then hurried downstairs and went outside where he said his neighbour was being harassed by two men .
He tried to calm the men down while he waited for police .
Officers later arrested both suspects and charged them with affray .
But then they also arrested him when they saw the truncheon .
Mr Beerling was taken to Maidstone police station , kept in a cell overnight and charged .
His case was due at crown court this week but on Wednesday the CPS decided to drop the charge .
The former sailor said : ' When they tried to open the truncheon , it was all rusted up .
I 've had it for years and it 's just been in a drawer .
' It could be classed as an offensive weapon if it was taken out in public and used with intent .
I had n't even taken it out of my pocket .
' But I would n't think twice about stepping in to help people again .
I could not have stood by and let it go .
' The most important thing for right - thinking people is to stand up to criminals who blight our society . '
Kent Police and Senior Crown Prosecutor Janet Garnon - Williams said in a statement : ' A decision has been taken jointly to discontinue the case as there is not a realistic prospect of conviction . '
A police spokesman said the two men arrested with Mr Beerling were charged with affray , but the cases were later dropped .
One was charged with possession of cannabis and fined £ 100 by Maidstone magistrates .
Laura Werkheiser knew she would have to make many sacrifices to live in Manhattan .
Foremost among them was shopping for clothes .
Anticipating , rightly , that her Manhattan digs would be cramped and her budget stretched , Ms. Werkheiser , 26 , shipped 18 boxes of her clothes to her parents ’ house in Omaha before moving here from San Francisco .
The boxes sit in her parents ’ basement .
When she feels she needs to freshen up her look , Ms. Werkheiser has her mother ship her several outfits from what she dryly refers to as the “ Nebraska boutique . ”
“ If I shop , ” said Ms. Werkheiser , “ I ca n’t have a social life and I ca n’t eat . ”
Having one ’s mother mail rotating boxes of old clothing is just one of the myriad ways that young newcomers to the city of a certain income  that is , those who are neither investment bankers nor being floated by their parents  manage to live the kind of lives they want in New York .
Every year around this time , tens of thousands of postcollegiate people in their 20s flood the city despite its soaring expenses .
They are high on ambition , meager of budget and endlessly creative when it comes to making ends meet .
Some tactics have long been chronicled : sharing tiny apartments with strangers .
Sharing those apartments with eight strangers .
Eating cheap lunches and skipping dinners  not just to save money , but so that drinks pack more of a punch and fewer need be consumed .

As a developer who was raised on procedural and object oriented programming languages like C , C++ and Java it took me a while to figure out what people were raving about when it comes to the benefits of functional programming techniques .
I always thought closures and higher order functions were words used by snobby kids from MIT and grad students to show how overeducated they were as opposed to programming tools I 'd ever find useful .
This thinking was additionally fueled by articles like Joel Spolsky 's Can Your Programming Language Do This ?
which not only came off as snobby but also cemented the impression that higher order functions like map ( ) and reduce ( ) are for people solving " big " problems like the folks at Google who are trying to categorize the entire World Wide Web not people like me who write desktop feed readers in their free time .
All of this changed when I started learning Python .
With Python I started writing programs that threw around lambda functions and used list comprehensions to map , reduce and filter without even thinking twice about it .
Afterwards when I 'd go back to programming in C# 2.0 I 'd marvel at how much more code it took to get things done .
There were tasks which I could perform in a line of Python code that took four , five sometimes up to ten lines of C# code .
I began to miss Python sorely .
Then I installed Visual Studio 2008 and got to use the Language Integrated Query ( LINQ ) features of C# 3.0 and was blown away .
The C# folks had not only brought over functional programming constructs like lambda expressions ( aka anonymous methods ) but also had added the 3 core functions ( map , reduce and filter ) to all lists , collections and other implementers of the IEnumerable interface .
So what are map , reduce and filter ?
They are higher order functions [ which means they take functions as input ] that operate on lists of objects .
Here are their definitions from the Python documentation along with links to their C# 3.0 equivalents .
Function name in Python Description from Python Documentation C# 3.0 Equivalent map Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results .
Enumerable .
Select reduce ( aka fold or accumulate )
Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable , from left to right , so as to reduce the iterable to a single value .
For example , reduce ( lambda x , y : x+y , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) calculates ( ( ( ( 1+2 ) + 3 ) + 4) +5 ) .
The left argument , x , is the accumulated value and the right argument , y , is the update value from the iterable .
If the optional initializer is present , it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation , and serves as a default when the iterable is empty .
Enumerable .
Aggregate filter Construct a list from those elements of iterable for which function returns true .
iterable may be either a sequence , a container which supports iteration , or an iterator .
Enumerable .
Where
With these three building blocks , you could replace the majority of the procedural for loops in your application with a single line of code .
C# 3.0 does n't just stop there .
There are also a number of other useful higher order functions available on all enumerable / collection objects .
In the next version of RSS Bandit , we will support synchronizing your subscription state from Google Reader , NewsGator Online and the Common Feed List provided by the Windows RSS platform .
This means that when the user hits [ Update All Feeds ] to refresh their subscriptions we need to ( i ) aggregate the unread item count across the different feed sources and store it ( ii ) ask each feed source to kick off its update process and ( iii ) on completion of the update determine if there are new items by recalculating the unread count across all feed sources and see if it differs from the value we got in the first step .
Here 's what the UpdateAllFeeds ( ) method looks like
public void UpdateAllFeeds ( bool force_download )
{
List < SubscriptionRootNode > rootNodes = this . GetAllSubscriptionRootNodes ( ) ;
if ( rootNodes != null )
{
if ( _timerRefreshFeeds .
Enabled )
_timerRefreshFeeds . Stop ( ) ;
_lastUnreadFeedItemCountBeforeRefresh = rootNodes .
Sum(n => n . UnreadCount ) ;
FeedSources .
Sources .
ForEach(s => s . RefreshFeeds ( force ) ) ;
}
}
In the UpdateAllFeeds ( ) method we use Enumerable .
Sum which is a specialized reduce ( ) function to calclulate the unread count of each of the different subscription sources .
Then we use a ForEach extension method to effectively loop through each feed source and call its RefreshFeeds ( ) method .
That would have been two for loops in older versions of C# or Java .
We also perform more complicated reduce or fold operations which go outside the norm of just accumulating some numeric value in RSS Bandit .
When a user subscribes to a new feed , we populate a drop down list with the list of categories from the user 's subscriptions so the user can decide which category to place the feed in .
With multiple feed sources , we need to populate the drop down with the list of categories used in Google Reader , NewsGator , the Windows Common Feed List as well as those within RSS Bandit while taking care to eliminate duplicates .
The GetCategories ( ) method shown below does the bulk of that work in a single line of code via Enumerable .
Aggregate
public IEnumerable < string > GetCategories ( ) { // list containing default category used for bootstrapping the Aggregate function var c = new List < string > ( ) ; c . Add( DefaultCategory ) ; IEnumerable < string > all_categories = c ; // get a list of the distinct categories used across all feed sources all_categories = FeedSources .
Sources .
Aggregate ( all_categories , ( list , s ) => list .
Union(s .
Source . GetCategories ( ) .
Keys , StringComparer . InvariantCultureIgnoreCase ) ) ; return all_categories ; }
The first step is to set up a list with the default category ( " Unclassified " ) and then use Aggregate ( ) to go through each source and perform a union of the current list of categories with the list of categories from that feed source .
The categories are compared in a case insensitive manner to remove duplicates from the union .
If there are no categories defined in any of the feed sources then only the default category ends up being returned .
When a user is viewing their Google Reader feeds in RSS Bandit , any action the user takes in the application is reflected on the Web .
So each time a user marks an item as read , renames a feed title , subscribes or unsubscribes from a feed , a Web request is made behind the scenes to update the user 's state on the Web via Google Reader 's REST API .
Instead of making the Web requests synchronously and possibly tying up the UI I instead add each Web request intended for the Google Reader API to a queue of pending operations .
Since the operations may sit in the queue for a few seconds or minutes in the worst case , we can optimize network usage by removing events from the queue if they end up being redundant .
For example .
the DeleteFeedFromGoogleReader ( ) method removes every pending operation related to a particular feed if an unsubscribe event is enqueued .
After all , there is no point in making Web requests to mark the feed as read or rename it , if the next request from the user is to unsubscribe from the feed .
The method uses a filter operation , Enumerable .
Where , to determine the events to remove as shown below
public void DeleteFeedFromGoogleReader ( string googleUserID , string feedUrl ) { var delete
Op = new PendingGoogleReaderOperation ( GoogleReaderOperation .
DeleteFeed , new object [ ] { feedUrl} , googleUserID ) ; lock ( pendingGoogleReaderOperations ) { // remove all pending operations related to the feed since it is going to be unsubscribed IEnumerable < PendingGoogleReaderOperation > ops2remove = pendingGoogleReaderOperations .
Where ( op => op .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , appearing in a taped interview Sunday on " Meet the Press , " defended GOP presidential candidate John McCain as " the real deal on the environment " within days of taking a shot at the Arizona senator 's call for lifting the federal ban on offshore oil drilling as blowing smoke .
" I 'm very proud of him .
I 'm 100 percent behind him , " he told Tom Brokaw in an interview done Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley .
Last week , Schwarzenegger had reiterated his opposition to lifting the federal moratorium on offshore drilling after McCain called for dropping the 30 - year - old ban .
Schwarzenegger acknowledged that he does n't support everything McCain has proposed , just as he is n't always in accord with his wife , Maria Shriver , a Democrat who has endorsed Illinois Sen. Barack Obama .
" That ( McCain and I ) do n't agree on everything , it 's clear .
Nor do I agree with my wife , " he said .
But " he 's terrific with the environment , " and with a President McCain , " we would have for the first time a really strong energy agenda and a way of fighting global warming . "
He said McCain has stood by him and " supported me on every step of the way " on issues like solar energy , greenhouse gases and many other environmental issues .
" He 's the real deal on the environment . "
Schwarzenegger 's warm words and defense of McCain on environmental issues appeared at odds with his comments Friday at a climate change meeting in Florida , where he jabbed at McCain 's environmental plans .
Citing a list of proposals , including ending the ban on offshore oil drilling , nuclear power and biofuels - McCain supports them all - he told the audience , " Anyone who tells you that this will bring down our gas prices immediately or anytime soon is blowing smoke . "
Brokaw questioned Schwarzenegger about the presidential race and Maria Shriver 's support of Obama .
" That 's great that she has her own opinion about this , " Schwarzenegger said .
" I feel very passionate about the person that I endorsed , which is McCain .
It makes it an interesting discussion at night at home when we have dinner . "
He joked that frequently when Obama does something positive , " she pulls out the cutout of Obama " and puts it " right next to my breakfast table . "
The governor said " one day ... I got up , because I had had it . "
He said he railed around the house , saying , " McCain is the man .
He 's the best man .
Maria is absolutely wrong about that Obama fellow . "
" I was absolutely lucky that Maria was out for dinner , " he said .
Brokaw noted that Shriver 's cousin , Caroline Kennedy , is assisting Obama in his search for a running mate .
" Can you believe that ? " Schwarzenegger replied .
But he added , " she 's working very hard at this , she 's taking it very seriously . "
Schwarzenegger said Tim Russert , the " Meet the Press " host who died recently and whom Shriver had called her best friend , told him if he ever chose to run for president he would help .
" When I ran for governor , he called me and said , ' If you make that , if you win , then I will take care of the rest , ' " Schwarzenegger recalled .
" I said what are you talking about ?
And he said , ' I will get you to run for president .
I will make sure that we change the Constitution . '
It never happened .
But anyway , I miss him very much . "
" Well , I ca n't make the same promise , " said Brokaw .
The governor said he supported the California Supreme Court 's decision to approve same - sex marriage .
" I think it 's good that California is leading in this way .
I personally believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman , " but said he does n't want to force his beliefs on others .
He said any additional time spent on the matter is a waste of time .
This assumption -- that far offshore facilities are beyond the reach of militants -- must now be reconsidered .
The week 's most successful attack , shutting in 225,000 barrels per day , came against Shell 's Bonga facility .
At 120 km offshore , the Bonga attack demonstrated a new militant capability in the offshore environment .
As Nigeria is one of the few states with the geological potential to significantly increase oil production and exports , the Bonga attack may prove to be an extremely important development .
Overnight on June 19th , MEND militants struck Shell ’s offshore Bonga facility , resulting in Shell declaring force majeure for deliveries of 225,000 barrels per day in June and July .
Then , on June 20th , militants destroyed a key Chevron pipeline near Escravos , Nigeria , forcing Chevron to shut - in and declare force majeure on 120,000 barrels per day of production .
This article will analyze the significance of the Bonga attack in light of Nigeria 's efforts to grow its offshore oil production .
What is at Stake ?
The Bonga attack is particularly troubling because of the nature of oil production in Nigeria .
A February , 2006 Citigroup report noted that " clearly most of the ( oil production ) growth near - term looks to be in the Nigerian deepwater and as such should be less subject to current disruptions . "
While offshore production currently only accounts for 16 % of Nigeria ’s oil production , it is expected to account for 90 % of future growth .
MEND has already demonstrated its capability to shut in large portions of Nigeria ’s onshore oil production , and now it is threatening to re-attack offshore facilities , urging expatriate workers to abandon them immediately .
Nigeria ’s onshore production is already mature , and government hopes of raising total production to 4 million barrels per day are entirely dependent on the success of the offshore sector .
If MEND can continue to interrupt offshore production , the prospects for any increase in production from Nigeria look dim .
The situation in Nigeria is critical as Nigeria is one of the few states with the potential to significantly increase both production and exports .
According to the megaprojects list on WikiPedia , Nigeria expects 345,000 bpd of offshore production to come online in 2008 ( Agbami field , Oso field ) ; 220,000 bpd in 2009 ( Akpo field , Oyo field ) ; 220,000 bpd in 2010 ( Bonga North , Bonga Ullage fields ) ; 285,000 bpd in 2011 ( Bosi , Ukot , Usan fields ) ; 250,000 pbd in 2012 ( Bonga SW , Nsiko fields ) ; and 150,000 bpd in 2013 ( Egina field ) .
That ’s 1.25 million barrels per day of new offshore production planned in the next 6 years .
None of it was previously considered vulnerable to attack .
Now it all appears to be within the demonstrated reach of MEND .
How Vulnerable are Offshore Facilities ?
Offshore facilities are highly complex and vulnerable feats of engineering .
While they are generally engineered to withstand extreme natural environments , they may not be well fortified against intentional attack .
We do not know the extent of fortifications , as the specific security considerations and plans for each platform are not publicly available .
It makes sense , however , that to the extent the threat from MEND was considered to be non-existent at the time that all scheduled Nigerian megaprojects entered development , fortification against attack was not a significant design criteria .
There are spectacular examples in the past of the vulnerability of offshore facilities .
The most famous is the Piper Alpha platform explosion in the North Sea , which resulted in 167 deaths and one of the largest insured financial losses in history .
While I am not an expert in seizure or defense of offshore facilities , I do have some qualifications in the area : I participated in planning of the 2003 GOPLATS operation that successfully seized Iraq 's southern offshore oil platforms .
For obvious reasons , I wo n't dissect the vulnerabilities of offshore facilities here , but I will offer my opinion that exploitation of the vulnerabilities are within the reach of a group like MEND .
While MEND 's attack on Bonga was far short of a textbook attack on an offshore facility , it is probably not beyond MEND 's near - term capability to inflict significant , lasting damage to Nigeria 's offshore facilities .
The Piper Alpha platform on fire in the North Sea , 1988 .
Can MEND inflict this level of damage ?
MEND : Potential for Innovation & Improved Capabilities
The Bonga attack highlights the recent development 's in MEND 's offshore capabilities , and demonstrates the group 's ability to continue to improve its tactics in the near term .
Comments as early as 2006 noted that MEND ’s offshore capabilities are continuously improving , and that facilities as far as 50 - 60 km offshore may be at risk .
Bonga is twice that far offshore , at 120 km .
I predicted a year ago that MEND would increasingly focus on Nigeria ’s offshore facilities for two reasons : 1 ) to differentiate their ideologically - grounded struggle from the privateers and criminal bunkering that is also interrupting Nigerian production ; and 2 ) as a result of the innovation that naturally results from their decentralized structure .
While this most recent attack showcases MEND ’s ability to operate in the deepwater environment , it also shows MEND 's potential to greatly increase the impact of future offshore attacks .
MEND ’s press release stated that their goal was to gain access to and destroy the facility 's main control room , but that they were unable to do so .
MEND 's limited success , however , most likely identified to the group the specific capabilities , training , and equipment it will need to better succeed in the future .
This process of tactical improvement forms a larger cycle of innovation ( an OODA Loop ) .
The recent attack highlights three significant and separate advances by MEND : targeting , naval equipment , and training .
By attacking far - offshore infrastructure that was previously considered beyond its reach , and by selecting projects that are key to the Nigerian government ’s revenue plans , MEND has accurately identified a very high return on investment target .
This demonstrates an advancement in their ability to pursue “ effects - based targeting ” — that is , the ability to carefully select targets that produce the desired ultimate ( here , political ) effect .
For MEND , the desired effect is to force the Nigerian government to better meet the needs of the Niger Delta peoples .
Previous tactics of kidnapping and attacking pipelines were imperfect choices for several reasons : they spawned criminal activity within the Delta , they increased pollution in the already polluted Delta region , and they did not effectively compel the desired action on the part of the Nigerian government .
While it is yet to be seen if the current targeting choices will be more successful , in my opinion they represent an advancement in skill .
The Bonga attack also demonstrates a significant advance in MEND ’s ability to operate far offshore .
While MEND has always been noted for its riverine naval capability , its success 120 km offshore suggests an improvement in naval equipment .
No information is available on what types of watercraft were used by MEND in the recent Bonga attack , but at a minimum MEND has established that its boats have 120 km range .
Additionally , the Bonga attack required a fairly advanced set of navigation skills .
Standing in a rigid inflatable boat , at 1.7 meters above the water , the visible horizon is only 5 km away .
Even if Shell ’s Bonga facility flares at 100 m above the surface , the flare is still below the horizon at 40 km .
Reports that the attack commenced at 1 a.m. suggest that MEND has developed fairly advanced offshore and nighttime navigation skills , that Nigeria ’s naval presence in the region is not currently capable of protecting offshore facilities , and that all major Nigerian offshore facilities are within MEND ’s reach .
Finally , it is important to discuss the potential tactical race between offshore defenses and militant offensive capability .
This is a situation of competing OODA loops -- whichever side can innovate and learn from past experiences most quickly will prevail .
Here , MEND enjoys two significant advantages over offshore operators .
First , the decentralized nature of MEND allows it to try many different approaches , accepting failure of the vast majority of attempts .
MEND can try 50 different ways to attack an offshore facility -- only one needs to succeed to inflict massive losses that provides a high ROI on its investment .
Oil companies , on the other hand , have one opportunity to get their defenses right or they risk losing a multi-billion dollar facility .
While oil companies do have the opportunity to learn from past militant mistakes , they do n't have the luxury of learning from successful militant tactics without great cost .
Second , oil platforms are fixed assets .
While MEND can choose the specific target , time of attack , mode of attack , and staging area at will , oil companies must defend all fixed position at all times , and as a result permanently cede the initiative to their opponents .
Any armchair general will recognize that this is an unenviable situation that heavily favors MEND .
Conclusion : Geopolitical Feedback Loops in Action
The recent attacks in Nigeria should be viewed as a product of geopolitical feedback loops .
I ’ve written previously about these feedback loops in operation in Nigeria , and will begin to reassess and update them in upcoming posts .
These phenomena significantly undermine Nigeria ’s ability to deliver on their potential to increase oil production and exports .
While it may be tempting to view these geopolitical feedback loops as separate from the geological phenomenon of Peak Oil , it is more accurate to view the geopolitical factors as a direct result of geological peaking — - but for geological factors , disruptions in Nigeria would simply cause oil exploration and production to move to other , equally fertile grounds .
Instead , the geological reality that there are very few “ geologically fertile grounds for increasing oil supply ” forces companies to accept the high costs of doing business in Nigeria .
MEND has made it clear that its recent choice of target was not chance .
It stated in its press release that " The location for today 's attack was deliberately chosen to remove any notion that off - shore oil exploration is far from our reach . "
Rebels followed up the Bonga attack by announcing a unilateral truce June 22nd to " give peace and dialog another chance . "
This suggests we will have at least a short break before the next offshore attack .
Unfortunately , it will also allow MEND time to integrate lessons learned from the Bonga attack and to prepare for the next wave of operations .
This break is also an important political step for MEND to maintain its image as legitimate and principled freedom fighters in the eyes of the Delta peoples , and not merely a group of criminal thugs .
It should not be viewed as a sign of either weakness or abandoning plans to conduct further offshore attacks .
This reading of the " truce " is supported by the concurrent strike by Nigerian oil workers that named Shell as an " enemy of the Nigerian people . "
Assuming that the Nigerian government wo n't meet MEND 's minimum demands , we are likely to find out within a few months just how much offshore capability MEND has ...

According to an interesting article published in the latest issue of Newsweek Magazine , thanks to the dramatic fall of gas prices , sales of trucks and SUVs have recently begun to rise , while sales of hybrids have become a bit stale .
While this certainly is interesting news , it does n’t compare to another statistic discovered by Newsweek : nearly 1 out of every 4 ( 24.2 % ) households that owned a hybrid car also owned an SUV .
This statistic just absolutely blew my mind .
Â
One would assume that if you were environmentally friendly enough to own a Toyota Prius or Honda Insight , that would probably preclude you from owning a Ford Explorer or Chevy Suburban .
Â
Apparently that ’s not the case .
While I can understand the increase in sales of SUVs and small trucks , thanks to lower gas prices as well as unheard of manufacturer and dealer incentives , it still seems hard to fathom that hybrid sales are proportionately decreasing .
Â
Considering up until recently there were long waiting lists for popular hybrid vehicles , it just does n’t seem logical .
In regards to the one out of four hybrid owners also owning an SUV , this sounds to me like some people were buying hybrid cars just because it was the “ in thing ” to do , just like several years ago everyone had to own an SUV .
Al Gore gave a speech last week " challenging " America to run " on 100 % zero - carbon electricity in 10 years " -- though that 's just the first step on his road to " ending our reliance on carbon - based fuels . "
Serious people understand this is absurd .
Maybe other people will start drawing the same conclusion about the man proposing it .
The former vice president has also recently disavowed any intention of returning to politics .
This is wise .
As America 's leading peddler of both doom and salvation , Mr. Gore has moved beyond the constraints ...

Detroit Lions coach Rod Marinelli thought the only problems he might have going into Thursday morning 's first practice of training camp was the absence of his top two unsigned draft picks -- Gosder Cherilus and Jordon Dizon .
As it turns out , the Lions definitely will be without another rookie -- seventh - round draft pick Caleb Campbell .
The Lions were informed Wednesday that the Army 's policy of allowing cadets to play professional sports was recently superseded by a subsequent Department of Defense policy .
As a result , Campbell must report back to West Point for further orders .
Marinelli talked to Campbell on Wednesday and said , " Obviously , he 's disappointed . '' " Caleb is no longer eligible to play for the Detroit Lions .
Nobody likes surprises , but you 've just got to salute and move on , '' Marinelli said at his news conference today .
" We checked ( with West Point ) as recently as last week and we were assured everything was fine .
But that 's the deal and we 'll move on .
I feel bad for the player .
He 's a heckuva guy and he 's going to follow orders and do what he 's supposed to do . ''

Kowalski : Lions ' no Super Bowl contenders

• Lions agree to terms with seven draft picks
While the Lions had agreed to contract terms with Campbell on a three - year deal , the Lions opted not to have him sign the contract .
Lions chief operating officer Tom Lewand said the decision was made to give the team " maximum flexibility . ''
( Campbell would not have been paid any portion of the contract until he made the final 53 - man roster . )
The Lions retain Campbell 's rights until the draft next year and can sign him at any point up until then .
If he 's not selected by a team in the 2009 draft , Campbell becomes a free agent .
Under the current rules , Campbell would be eligible to play pro sports after fulfilling two years of active duty .
While the situation has yet to be addressed by the league , both Marinelli and Lewand said they did n't believe they would be granted a compensatory pick next season because of the Army 's reversal in policy .
Marinelli said he had no idea the Army ( or Department of Defense ) might eventually change the policy .
" When you go to the ( scouting ) combine , who goes there ?
Draft - eligible players .
When you go there , you evaluate the players who are there .
They were draft - eligible players , '' Marinelli said .
" Obviously , he 's disappointed , but I know what he 's about .
He got his orders and he 's ready to report and go . ''
In town , waiting
While Cherilus and Dizon are believed to be in town , ready to report as soon as their contracts get worked out , it appears they 're going to miss the first team meeting of the season ( 6:20 p.m. ) .
The Lions have their first practice at 8:35 Thursday morning .
It 's still possible that the players could be signed at some point tonight , take their physical early in the morning and be on the field for the first practice .
Lewand said talks are going well , but did not indicate that either signing was imminent .
Palestinians mourned as 14 people were killed in Thursday 's violence An Israeli air strike on a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip has killed three Hamas militants following a day of violence in the territory .
Earlier seven people , including a baby , were killed in a blast that destroyed the home of a Palestinian militant .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , initially blamed the explosion on an Israeli air attack .
Israel denied any involvement .
Hamas said later it was investigating the incident , which prompted militants to fire dozens of rockets into Israel .
A 59 - year - old woman is said to have been seriously wounded in the barrage .
Cairo talks
The air strike on the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza killed three Hamas gunmen as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel .
Other suspected Palestinian militants killed on Thursday included : two who were spotted planting explosives near the border fence at the Erez crossing point ;
one who was killed in an air strike near Khan Younis in southern Gaza ;
one who died in a gun battle with Israeli troops in the northern Beit Lahiya area .
Egypt is currently trying to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas .
Israel said on Wednesday that it would support Egypt 's efforts but instructed the army to prepare for possible military action in Gaza if they failed .
Senior defence official Amos Gilad travelled to Cairo on Thursday for talks with Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman .
Speculation
The blast at the house of senior Hamas bomb - maker Ahmed Hamouda shook the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza .

Advertisement Israel usually confirms its air strikes in Gaza and its denial and the Hamas enquiry raised speculation the explosion may have been caused by militants mishandling explosives .
A Hamas statement said the seven dead included a senior aide to the Hamas interior minister .
Mr Hamouda was not inside the house at the time of the explosion , Hamas said .
Neighbours brought digging equipment to search for survivors and three people covered in blood were carried away on stretchers .
Witnesses spoke of a " huge explosion " which totally destroyed the building .
" There are people still buried under the rubble , " said neighbour Majid Abu Samra .
" I evacuated two women who were covered in dust and blood in my car . "
Shortly afterwards , Hamas said it had fired a barrage of 50 mortar shells and rockets toward southern Israel .

What are these ?
Songbirds in cities are damaging their health , exposing themselves to predators and weakening their gene pool by trying to be heard above the din of urban life .
New research shows that male birds trying to compete with traffic and city sounds are singing louder and at increasingly higher frequencies , which could harm their vocal cords and hearing .
As a result their songs are becoming more chaotic and less diverse , which makes them less attractive to female birds and damages their mating opportunities .
Some birds , including robins , are choosing to sing at night instead of during the day .
This not only makes them more vulnerable to attack but , because the birds need to be awake in daylight hours to feed , creates stress and exhaustion .
' The difference between urban and rural birdsong is becoming so great that the two groups could now be unable to communicate , leading to inbreeding and a weakened gene pool , ' said Dr Sue Anne Zollinger , of the University of St Andrews , who has studied the impact of environmental noise on birds ' song learning and development .
A group sharing a small gene pool , said Zollinger , was less likely to be able to adapt quickly to new diseases or environmental pressures , putting them at risk of being wiped out .
Birds sing to warn of danger , attract a mate and mark out their territory .
Another study of the dawn chorus of nightingales found that birds in Berlin sang up to 14 decibels louder than their counterparts in the forest .
The highest volume occurred on weekday mornings .
A further group found that great tits in European cities sang at a higher frequency than birds in the country , so that they could be heard above the rumble of cars , lorries and industry .
' By trying to sing over the sound of the city , birds are risking vocal injury because they 're using more pressure to sing loudly , while also singing at higher frequencies to try to counteract the low rumble of traffic noise , ' said Zollinger .
' All this effort puts the same strain on a bird 's vocal cords as when a human tries to shout to be heard in a noisy pub - except the birds are doing it all day , every day , ' she said .
Singing under such pressure means birds have less control over the sound they produce .
' Their songs may lose quality and become more rough - sounding , ' said Zollinger .
' This could have serious implications on how fit and attractive they 're perceived to be by females .
Even when they manage to mate , however , their female offspring will prefer males who sing in the same lower - quality way , which will eventually lead to complete isolation between different groups and inbreeding . '
Henrik Brumm , from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany , agreed .
' This is a hot topic and one we are only just beginning to understand , ' he said .
' There are many different strategies that birds deploy to counter the noise of the urban environment .
These strategies could lead to us seeing a completely separate urban species of bird which can't breed with its country cousin . '
He feared some birds might not be flexible enough to cope with urban clamour .
Research has linked noise pollution to a drop in the number of orioles , cuckoos , great reed warblers and house sparrows .
Andre Farrar , spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , said the birds most at risk of genetic separation are those most talented at adapting their song : starlings , song thrushes , nightingales , robins and marsh warblers .
' Birds with richer and more complex songs do better in the mating game and are able to defend their territory more successfully , ' he said .
' If birds start simplifying their songs so they can be heard against background noise , they might find themselves attacked by other birds who think they 're sick .
This could have serious implications for conservation . '
Mark Constantine , author of The Sound Approach to Birding and founder of the Sound Approach database , the fourth - largest natural sound archive in the world , said : ' Birdsong is used as an indicator of quality of life and has been proved to reduce our blood pressure .
When we live in the centre of large , urban areas , we get more stressed and it's extremely good to have birdsong around us .
The impact on humans of birdsong is massive .
It harms us , as well as the birds , if their songs become simpler , shriller and louder . '
A nine - year - old girl whose parents named her Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii was put into court guardianship in New Zealand so that her name could be changed .
A family court judge , Rob Murfitt , gave the order after hearing that the child was embarrassed about her name and had refused to reveal it to friends .
" She told people her name was K because she feared being mocked and teased , " the child 's lawyer , Colleen MacLeod , told the court .
The judge criticised parents who give their offspring bizarre names , saying it exposed children to ridicule among their peers .
" The court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment that this child 's parents have shown in choosing this name .
It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap , unnecessarily , " he said .
He said the child had a better insight about the situation than her parents , who had apparently not given any thought to the implications of their actions .
The judge criticised the growing trend of parents choosing out - of - the - ordinary names for their children .
In his written ruling , he said names such as Stallion , Yeah Detroit , Fish and Chips , Twisty Poi , Keenan Got Lucy and Sex Fruit were prohibited by registration officials .
Others that were permitted included twins called Benson and Hedges , other children called Midnight Chardonnay , Number 16 Bus Shelter and , the judge added , " tragically , Violence " .
Another mother tried to use text language for her child 's name , he said .
The ruling was handed down in February but only came to light in law reports issued today .
The girl , who had been at the centre of a custody battle , has since changed her name , but it was not revealed in order to protect her privacy .
Brian Clarke , the registrar general of births , deaths and marriages , said New Zealand law did not allow names that would cause offense to a reasonable person .
He said officials were usually successful in dissuading parents from giving their children embarrassing names .

Followup to : What Would You Do Without Morality ? , Something to Protect
Once , discussing " horrible job interview questions " to ask candidates for a Friendly AI project , I suggested the following :
Would you kill babies if it was inherently the right thing to do ?
Yes [ ] No [ ]
If " no " , under what circumstances would you not do the right thing to do ?
___________
If " yes " , how inherently right would it have to be , for how many babies ?
___________
Yesterday I asked , " What would you do without morality ? "
There were numerous objections to the question , as well there should have been .
Nonetheless there is more than one kind of person who can benefit from being asked this question .
Let 's say someone gravely declares , of some moral dilemma —say , a young man in Vichy France who must choose between caring for his mother and fighting for the Resistance — that there is no moral answer ; both options are wrong and blamable ; whoever faces the dilemma has had poor moral luck .
Fine , let 's suppose this is the case : then when you cannot be innocent , justified , or praiseworthy , what will you choose anyway ?
Many interesting answers were given to my question , " What would you do without morality ? " .
But one kind of answer was notable by its absence :
No one said , " I would ask what kind of behavior pattern was likely to maximize my inclusive genetic fitness , and execute that . "
Some misguided folk , not understanding evolutionary psychology , think that this must logically be the sum of morality .
But if there is no morality , there 's no reason to do such a thing — if it 's not " moral " , why bother ?
You can probably see yourself pulling children off train tracks , even if it were not justified .
But maximizing inclusive genetic fitness ?
If this is n't moral , why bother ?
Who does it help ?
It would n't even be much fun , all those egg or sperm donations .
And this is something you could say of most philosophies that have morality as a great light in the sky that shines from outside people .
( To paraphrase Terry Pratchett . )
If you believe that the meaning of life is to play non -zero - sum games because this is a trend built into the very universe itself ...
Well , you might want to follow the corresponding ritual of reasoning about " the global trend of the universe " and implementing the result , so long as you believe it to be moral .
But if you suppose that the light is switched off , so that the global trends of the universe are no longer moral , then why bother caring about " the global trend of the universe " in your decisions ?
If it 's not right , that is .
Whereas if there were a child stuck on the train tracks , you 'd probably drag the kid off even if there were no moral justification for doing so .
In 1966 , the Israeli psychologist Georges Tamarin presented , to 1,066 schoolchildren ages 8 - 14 , the Biblical story of Joshua 's battle in Jericho :
" Then they utterly destroyed all in the city , both men and women , young and old , oxen , sheep , and asses , with the edge of the sword ...
And they burned the city with fire , and all within it ; only the silver and gold , and the vessels of bronze and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD . "
After being presented with the Joshua story , the children were asked :
" Do you think Joshua and the Israelites acted rightly or not ? "
66 % of the children approved , 8 % partially disapproved , and 26 % totally disapproved of Joshua 's actions .
A control group of 168 children was presented with an isomorphic story about " General Lin " and a " Chinese Kingdom 3,000 years ago " .
7 % of this group approved , 18 % partially disapproved , and 75 % completely disapproved of General Lin .
" What a horrible thing it is , teaching religion to children , " you say , " giving them an off - switch for their morality that can be flipped just by saying the word ' God ' . "
Indeed one of the saddest aspects of the whole religious fiasco is just how little it takes to flip people 's moral off - switches .
As Hobbes once said , " I do n't know what 's worse , the fact that everyone 's got a price , or the fact that their price is so low . "
You can give people a book , and tell them God wrote it , and that 's enough to switch off their moralities ;
God does n't even have to tell them in person .
But are you sure you do n't have a similar off - switch yourself ?
They flip so easily — you might not even notice it happening .
Leon Kass ( of the President 's Council on Bioethics ) is glad to murder people so long as it's " natural " , for example .
He would n't pull out a gun and shoot you , but he wants you to die of old age and he'd be happy to pass legislation to ensure it .
And one of the non-obvious possibilities for such an off - switch , is " morality " .
If you do happen to think that there is a source of morality beyond human beings ... and I hear from quite a lot of people who are happy to rhapsodize on how Their - Favorite - Morality is built into the very fabric of the universe ... then what if that morality tells you to kill people ?
If you believe that there is any kind of stone tablet in the fabric of the universe , in the nature of reality , in the structure of logic — anywhere you care to put it — then what if you get a chance to read that stone tablet , and it turns out to say " Pain Is Good " ?
What then ?
Maybe you should hope that morality is n't written into the structure of the universe .
What if the structure of the universe says to do something horrible ?
And if an external objective morality does say that the universe should occupy some horrifying state ... let 's not even ask what you 're going to do about that .
No , instead I ask :
What would you have wished for the external objective morality to be instead ?
What 's the best news you could have gotten , reading that stone tablet ?
Go ahead .
Indulge your fantasy .
Would you want the stone tablet to say people should die of old age , or that people should live as long as they wanted ?
If you could write the stone tablet yourself , what would it say ?
Maybe you should just do that ?
I mean ... if an external objective morality tells you to kill people , why should you even listen ?
There is a courage that goes beyond even an atheist sacrificing their life and their hope of immortality .
It is the courage of a theist who goes against what they believe to be the Will of God , choosing eternal damnation and defying even morality in order to rescue a slave , or speak out against hell , or kill a murderer ...
You do n't get a chance to reveal that virtue without making fundamental mistakes about how the universe works , so it is not something to which a rationalist should aspire .
But it warms my heart that humans are capable of it .
I have previously spoken of how , to achieve rationality , it is necessary to have some purpose so desperately important to you as to be more important than " rationality " , so that you will not choose " rationality " over success .
To learn the Way , you must be able to unlearn the Way ; so you must be able to give up the Way ; so there must be something dearer to you than the Way .
This is so in questions of truth , and in questions of strategy , and also in questions of morality .
The " moral void " of which this post is titled , is not the terrifying abyss of utter meaningless .
Which for a bottomless pit is surprisingly shallow ; what are you supposed to do about it besides wearing black makeup ?
No .
The void I 'm talking about is a virtue which is nameless .

Growing plants in space will be far from easy
More details
Scientists with the European Space Agency ( Esa ) say the day when flowers bloom on the Moon has come closer .
An Esa - linked team has shown that marigolds can grow in crushed rock very like the lunar surface , with no need for plant food .
Some see growing plants on the Moon as a step towards human habitation .
But the concept is not an official aim of Esa , and one of the agency 's senior officials has dismissed the idea as " science fiction " .
The new research was presented at the European Geosciences Union ( EGU ) meeting in Vienna , the largest annual European gathering of scientists studying the Earth , its climate and its neighbours in space .
Bernard Foing , a senior scientist with the European Space Research and Technology Centre ( Estec ) in the Netherlands , believes growing plants on the Moon would be a useful tool to learn how life adapts to lunar conditions , and as a practical aid to establishing manned bases .
" We would bring a system of water circulation and recovery , which is also the type of system that in any case you want to develop when you are going to manufacture a primitive sort of life support system , " he told BBC News .
" So it is also a kind of `technological breadboard ' for maintaining a simple life form in an extreme environment . "
Microbe power
In principle , putting self - contained pieces of kit with seeds and nutrients on the Moon and giving them a supply of water and an artificial atmosphere would be little different from growing them on space stations , which has been done several times ; although outside Earth 's protective magnetic field they would be subject to higher levels of radiation .
Esa has made no firm plans yet to explore the lunar surface
The new step , taken in the experiments reported at the EGU , is to remove the need for bringing nutrients and soil from Earth .
A team led by Natasha Kozyrovska and Iryna Zaetz from the National Academy of Sciences in Kiev planted marigolds in crushed anorthosite , a type of rock found on Earth which is very similar to much of the lunar surface .
In neat anorthosite , the plants fared very badly .
But adding different types of bacteria made them thrive ; the bacteria appeared to draw elements from the rock that the plants needed , such as potassium .
Dr Foing , who presented the study at the EGU meeting , said there was no reason in principle why the same idea could not bear fruit on the Moon itself .
Tools could crush lunar rock and add bacteria and seeds .
But , he added , scientists could look to go further , by selecting plants or bacteria that are especially well adapted to lunar conditions , or even by genetically engineering new strains .
Descent of man ?
The last decade has seen a revival of interest in Moon exploration after years of neglect .
It is conceivable humans may one day live on the Moon Europe 's Smart 1 probe with its innovative ion engine ended its mission in 2006 with a deliberate crash onto the lunar surface .
China 's Chang'e 1 and Japan 's Kaguya ( or Selene ) orbiters both began operations last year , while India 's Chandrayaan 1 is due for launch within months .
The US , meanwhile , is committed to putting human feet back on lunar soil by 2020 .
But Esa is not yet sure about further Moon missions ; a decision on whether to proceed with a concept called Moon Next , which would probably deploy a roving vehicle in about 2015 , will be taken later this year .
Even if that gets the go - ahead , some Esa officials at the EGU meeting suggested that planting marigolds ( or tulips or cabbages ) would be unlikely to be part of the strategy : " it is science fiction , " one observed .
But as director of the International Lunar Exploration Working Group ( ILEWG ) , which looks for exciting and innovative ways to study our nearest cosmic neighbour , Bernard Foing believes that Europe or one of the other players will eventually decide to plant the seeds of Earth where previously humanity has merely planted flags .
" We are considering whether we could do this on some precursor robotic mission , even before we consider putting people on the Moon , " he said .
" It is viable within the timeframe of Moon Next . "

Iraq has begun the process of opening up its oil industry to foreign investment in an effort to boost output of the country 's key income earner .
Iraq is seeking external help to boost output from six key oil fields and has attracted interest from leading US , Asian and European producers .
Oil production is currently at its highest since the 2003 invasion .
But political wrangling has so far prevented agreement over who should agree deals and how income is shared .
Political problems Iraq has reserves of about 115 billion barrels , the world 's third largest , and the development of its oil facilities is essential to help to fund the country 's long - term reconstruction .
But huge investment is needed to modernise its infrastructure and Iraq 's Parliament has so far failed to agree a legal basis for who should agree contracts and how the country 's oil should be shared among different groups .
It is not possible for Iraq , which has large oil reserves , to stay at the current level of production
Hussain al - Shahristani , Iraq oil minister
The challenge of Iraqi oil
The authorities in Baghdad have long been at odds over the issue with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan regional government in the north of the country .
Production currently totals 2.5 million barrels a day and Iraq hopes to increase output to 2.9 million barrels by the end of 2009 .
Iraq confirmed on Monday that it was seeking foreign investment to develop six of its most important oil fields - Rumaila , Kirkuk , Zubair , West Qurna , Bai Hassan and Maysan .
It has identified 35 foreign firms which are qualified to tender for the contracts , to be awarded next summer .
Amid concerns about foreign firms reaping huge financial rewards , Baghdad said the successful firms would have to have an Iraqi partner and give 25 % of the value of contracts to locally owned firms .
Significance
The BBC's Nicholas Witchell in Baghdad said the move was highly significant since it paved the way for large foreign firms to re-enter a market they have been effectively barred from since Saddam Hussein nationalised Iraq 's main oil company in 1972 .
" It is not possible for Iraq , which has large oil reserves , to stay at the current level of production , " said oil minister Hussain al - Shahristani .
" Iraq should be the second or third source of oil exportation . "
Iraq 's courting of foreign investment is at an early stage but has already attracted controversy due to claims that some contracts might be awarded without competitive bids .
Reports suggested that officials were hoping to announce short - term service agreements - an interim measure pending political agreement over a national oil law - with Exxon Mobil , Shell , Total and BP on Monday .
The AFP news agency said Iraqi officials were unwilling to share revenue from oil sales with the firms , as reportedly sought by them , preferring instead to pay them consultancy fees .
However , negotiations over contract terms are believed to be continuing .
The reduction in violence in much of the country over the past year has helped the oil sector achieve greater stability .
On Saturday , Iraq announced it was setting up a third state - owned oil business to expand production from the Maysan region in the south east of the country .
With oil prices at record levels and , according to many experts , set to rise further , the prospect of increased output from Iraq will provide some comfort amid growing worries about whether global supplies can meet long - term demand for oil .
Officials hope the presence of multinational oil firms in Iraq will stimulate more foreign investment in Iraq , our correspondent added .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
The House of Representatives has voted to send an impeachment resolution against President Bush to committee – where it 's likely to die .
Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced the 35 articles of impeachment this week .
Most of the resolution focuses on the Iraq war but also charges the president with illegally detaining both U.S. citizens and foreign captives , condoning torture and mishandling the response to Hurricane Katrina .
But Congress does n't want to hear it .
They voted largely along party lines – 255 to 166 – to send the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee .
This is exactly what happened to Kucinich 's impeachment articles against Vice President Cheney last year .
Congress sent that resolution to this same committee in November .
So far , no action has been taken .
Congress continues to refuse to exercise its constitutional responsibility of oversight of the executive branch of government .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi long ago made it known that impeachment is " off the table . "
This is a joke .
We have a president who has abused the power of his office over and over again .
It 's what got the Democrats elected to the majority in Congress in 2006 .
Now it 's election time again , and every member of the House is up for re-election in November .
The Democrats are probably worried what it will look like to many voters if they spend time on impeachment .
Which is why Republicans voted yesterday to bring Kucinich 's resolution up for debate immediately – to make the Democrats look silly for focusing on this instead of gas prices , the economy , etc .
Here ’s my question to you :
What does it mean when Congress refuses to even consider 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Bruce from St. Paul , Minnesota writes :
If this happened in a family , Ms. Pelosi would be called an enabler and sent to family counseling .
This has been the greatest abuse of power since Reagan did n't sell weapons to Iran , give money to the Contras , or remember anything about it .
To ignore it for political expediency only makes Congress an accomplice .
It sends a message that abuse of privilege and government corruption are just business as usual .
We deserve better .
Allison from San Diego writes :
I would n't mind seeing the Democrats debating impeachment and it would n't seem like a waste of time to me , even at this late date .
Seems to me it would be better to make a statement that we will not allow another inept president to run this country and our Constitution into the ground .
B. writes :
Congress abrogated its constitutional role as the third branch of government shortly after 9/11 by giving Bush a free pass and refusing to act as a proper check and balance to the power of the presidency .
The Democrats had a chance to put Congress back in play when they gained a majority but they let the opportunity slip away .
Impeachment would expose Congress ’ voluntary impotence and shortcomings at a time when they are focused on winning the upcoming election .
Cindy writes :
Because Bush is a lame duck anyway .
The damage is done , spending time discussing things in the past takes away time spent on the future …
I think history will not look kindly on the Bush administration .
The almost - impeachment of Nixon is remembered more than the actual impeachment of Clinton .
Basically , Bush is already sunk in history , with or without actual impeachment .
Robert writes :
Jack ,
As long as Bush is in office , the Democrats have the presidential election locked up .
It 's kind of sad really .
But it 's the political reality .
James from Florida writes :
Dear Jack ,
Please do n’t let McCain veto our beers .
ECONOMIC CALENDAR ECONOMIC CALENDAR
Click here to see what economic reports are coming up WASHINGTON 
Any spike in prices begs the question :
When will it end ?
Unfortunately , for millions of cash - strapped consumers , the cost of putting a meal on the table or a beer on the bar is likely to remain high for years , economists say .
Typically , food price swings go through cycles that can last a few years .
That was the case in the 1970s , when food prices were pushed up by high energy costs , decreased supplies and regional droughts .
But those forces were fairly elastic , and prices contracted again .
From the mid-1970s until recently , food prices on average fell dramatically .
This spike is different .
" Some of the reasons are rooted in the new world economy , " said Edward McLaughlin , an expert on food retailing at Cornell University .
Those reasons include the use of grains for fuel and the developing world 's increasing demand for a higher - protein diet , which also cuts into grain supplies .
Add those factors to more typical trends , like soaring energy costs , and it's clear the latest jump in prices has unique twists for consumers the world over , economists say .
Perhaps most worrisome , some leading causes of the recent price increases show no signs of receding , prompting some economists to warn of " the end of cheap food . "
The Agriculture Department expects U.S. food prices to rise beyond inflation for the next few years .
" The question now is the rate of the increase , " said Ephriam Leibtag , an economist with the department 's Economic Research Service .
Overall , food prices in this country have gone up almost 5 % during the past year , the highest annual increase in almost 20 years , according to the Labor Department .
Some staples have risen well beyond that .
Egg prices have shot up more than 30 % , dairy prices have jumped 12 % and the price of baked goods has risen 9 % .
In 2008 , the consumer price index for all food is projected to increase 4 % to 5 % as retailers pass on higher energy and commodity costs to consumers .
That 's almost twice the inflation rate of about 2.6 % .
Despite the recent price hikes , Americans spend less of their income on food now — about 9 % — than they have historically .
In the 1950s , they spent about 21 % on food , according to The Economist magazine .
But that does n't mean much to shoppers trying to keep pantries stocked .
" The prices just inch up every week without stop , " Joanne Krebble said while shopping at the Brookville Market in Washington .
" It 's everywhere you look . "
If meat still seems like a relative bargain , it wo n't be for long , economists say .
Meat prices overall have n't changed much recently but probably will by year 's end .
As more corn is used to make ethanol , animal feed costs rise .
And consumers , each of whom eats almost 200 pounds of meat , poultry and fish per year , are starting to see that at the checkout .
The price for chickens , which mature much more quickly than cows or pigs and reflect higher feed prices sooner , have increased 4.6 % in the past year , according to the Agriculture Department .
" Look to late 2008 or early 2009 for noticeable increases in the price for protein , " said Bill Lapp , president of the research firm Advanced Economic Solutions in Omaha Corn growers have come under fire for selling food for fuel .
Rick Tolman , CEO of the National Corn Growers Association , says such criticism is unfair .
" The increase in food prices has many causes — higher corn prices is one of the minor reasons , " he said .
" Higher fuel prices and rising world demand for food are the primary reasons . "
Tolman said higher fuel prices have three times the impact of higher corn prices .
He noted that in 2003 , corn was $ 2.50 a bushel and a barrel of oil was $ 11 .
Today corn is $ 5.65 a bushel and oil has soared to well over $ 120 a barrel .
Tolman said corn growers are working hard to keep production in line with demand for both food and fuel .
" Corn is in the midst of a tremendous boom in technology , " he said .
" Corn yields in the U.S. have doubled over the last 40 years and are on track to double again in the next 20 . "

ISLAMABAD , June 2 ( Reuters ) -
At least three people were killed in a blast outside the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital on Monday , a Reuters witness said .
“ I have seen three bodies , ” Reuters correspondent Kamran Haider .
One body was just inside the gate and two were outside , he said .
The blast damaged a wall of the mission and a gate and left a crater on the road , Haider said .
“ It appears to have been a car bomb , ” he said .

[ IFP does not endorse any federal candidate only encourages accountability of all politicans ]
From Sullivan for Congress — ( June 11 , New York ) Adam Sullivan , candidate for Congress challenging Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the Democratic primary in New York ’s Eighth Congressional District , voiced his support for the Articles of Impeachment introduced by Congressman Dennis Kucinich against George W. Bush .
Mr. Sullivan , who is mounting a well - organized challenge to the incumbent , stated , “ The residents of the 8th Congressional District have demanded action against the Bush agenda for years , and have been disappointed by the House and Senate , no matter which Party held the majority . ” 
Sullivan continued : “ I support Mr. Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment and full accountability for this reckless and criminal administration .
Furthermore , I challenge the members of the House to fulfill their Oaths of Office immediately –to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
The thirty - five separate articles include complaints about the illegal war in Iraq , as well as charges that the President spied “ on American Citizens , Without a Court - Ordered Warrant , in Violation of the Law and the Fourth Amendment . ” 
The Articles go on to accuse the President of “ Direct[ing ] Telecommunications Companies to Create an Illegal and Unconstitutional Database of the Private Telephone Numbers and Emails of American Citizens , ”  and also “ Tamper[ing ] with Free and Fair Elections . ”
Mr. Sullivan noted that Rep. Nadler - who has stated publicly that the President and Vice President have in all likelihood committed impeachable offenses and who holds the position of Chair of the House Judiciary Subcomittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties -has been the biggest obstacle to changing these policies .
Mr. Sullivan added , “ By taking impeachment off the table , Rep. Nadler and others in Congress have revealed how out of touch they are with their constituents .
These representatives are defiling the Constitution by giving President Bush and Vice President Cheney a pass on war crimes . ”
“ I will use my seat in Congress to address the crimes of the Bush Administration , to mend our badly battered Constitution , and to restore the tradition of government of the people , by the people and for the people . ” 
The PalmSecure scans the veins in the user 's palm , which are as distinctive as fingerprints .
Forget fingerprint scanners , which have replaced password access on some high - end laptops .
Forget iris scanners , especially their creepy use portrayed in the 2002 Tom Cruise movie , " Minority Report . "
No , the future of biometrics ( automated identification using body parts ) involves scanning palms .
At least , that 's the message from Fujitsu Computer Products of America , which recently unveiled palm - scanning technology for the U.S. market that 's already in widespread use in Asia .
Hiroko Naito , Fujitsu 's business development manager , said that the firm 's PalmSecure technology uses near - infrared scanning to identify people by the pattern of veins in their palms , which are as distinctive as fingerprints .
" It 's a contactless device — you just hold your hand over the sensor , so it 's hygienic and easy to use , " Naito said .
" We have heard so many times from customers that the reason they were hesitant about biometrics is that it could be intrusive . "
Will they be used ?
Scanning systems , offered by third parties using Fujitsu components and software , should retail for less than $ 1,000 , she said .
Geoffrey Turner , senior analyst at Forrester Research , said that fingerprint scanners are already deeply entrenched in the U.S. market , and that the scanners used by fingerprint systems are much smaller than palm scanners , making them more attractive for desktop use .
( Fujitsu , however , has come out with a palm scanner built into a mouse . )
" The chief reason for the development of the palm scanner is that in Japan fingerprints are associated with criminality , so there is a strong cultural aversion to using fingerprint scanners , " Turner said .
" And there is the question of hygiene , since people will be touching something .
To make an impact here , palm scanning will have to overcome the strong head start that fingerprint swipes have . "
More body parts
Naito said that one of the major advantages that PalmSecure has over fingerprint scanners is that a significant percentage of the population — as high as 8 percent — cannot use them because of damaged or missing fingers .
" Anyone can use our system , " she said .
" If they have lost their hand they can do some other part of the body . "
Turner shrugged .
" If you do n't have even one finger left you really can't use a keyboard , " he noted .
Fewer body parts
Speaking of amputations , the removal of body parts in order to fool a security scanner is a plot staple of grittier science - fiction movies , but Naito said that fooling a security system with an amputated body part should not be possible with palm scanning — or least , she did n't think so .
" As soon as the hand loses blood pressure the veins start changing shape , so it should not work , " she said .
" But ethically we have not been able to test that , because it would involve cutting off someone 's hand for the before - and - after test . "
However , the system has been tested with corpses and found to not work , since the system must detect blood flowing through the veins ( just how is a secret ) before it will issue an authorization .
This technology also prevents the system from being fooled with color photographs , Naito said .
If you 're a Canadian and you care about the future of culture , art , free speech and the Internet , you need to do something about the Canadian version of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that Industry Minister Jim Prentice introduced yesterday .
This bill was prepared without any consultation with Canadian stakeholders : there was no input from industry , libraries , education , artists ' groups , Canadian record labels , technology developers or citizens ' groups .
Instead , the bill was written to specs handed down by the US trade rep and ambassador ( who kept on telling the press about the " assurances " they 'd had from the Minister on the bill 's features ) .
The bill makes it flatly illegal to break any kind of digital lock , or to violate terms in one of those absurd end - user license agreements that make you promise to agree to let the record industry kick your teeth in and drink all your beer , just for the dubious privilege of paying for a song at iTunes or watching a video on Viacom 's website .
This amounts to private law : under Prentice 's plan , Parliament would get out of the business of making copyright law , simply enforcing whatever copyright law the entertainment industry itself dreamed up .
This is even worse than the approach the US DMCA took ten years ago , and look where that 's got them .
Tens of thousands of Americans have been sued , key innovative technology companies have been destroyed , computer scientists have been jailed , and what did it get them ?
Certainly not an end to infringement — file - sharing is up in every country in the world .
And for all the money the record industry has harvested from tech startups and music fans , not one dime has been paid to an artist .
Here 's your chance to tell your Member of Parliament what you think .

I figured I would share a little piece of wisdom that I picked up at the bar this past weekend .
I only wish that I could take the credit for such a revolutionary idea , one that I predict will turn the people rating system industry on its axis .
So we ’ve all been there , guys and gals .
You ’re standing there at the bar , and all of the sudden a member of the opposite sex walks in that you have never met .
Immediately you turn to your group of friends , and what do you do ?
Only the most completely superficial thing known to mankind : reduce that person ’s aggregate self - worth to a number between 1 - 10 .
Now we all know the inherent problems with the traditional 1 - 10 rating system .
Sure it ’s simple , but how do you come up with one number to describe the intricate differences between various people ?
Surely not all 7’s or 8 ’s or 9’s are created equal .
While some people utilize the decimal system to help with this problem , it just is n’t enough .
Now let me introduce you to the area code system .
Okay , here is how it works .
Every human being on the planet can be adequately described using a three - digit number ( i.e. area code ) .
The first digit denotes the rating of how attractive the face is ( 0 - 9 ) .
The second digit describes whether you would sleep with that person or not ( 0 =no , 1 =yes ) .
And finally , the third digit describes how attractive the person ’s body is ( 0 - 9 ) .
It ’s a discrete and yet simple way to judge others in public without actually meeting them .
Lets put this brand new rating system into practice , ladies and gentlemen , using celebrities that we are all familiar with :
Area Code Rating : 518
Rationale : Let ’s be real , the huge nose and that mole just are n’t helping out her face ’s cause .
But her body is admittedly nice , and I ’m pretty sure I could talk other girls into riding the tricycle with me and SJP just because she was on Sex and the City .
Area Code Rating : 813
Rationale : First of all , it ’s been long enough , I ’m allowed to make fun of her .
Secondly , in her playmate days , Anna Nicole Smith was hands down a 919 .
But anyone who watched the Anna Nicole Show knew she eventually ballooned to walrus proportions .
I gave her a second digit “ 1 ” for the fact that if she was still alive she would be a great hookup for painkillers .
Area Code Rating : 919
Rationale :
She is the hottest girl on the planet .
This is essentially the same person as goldenlocks [ Editor ’s Note – goldenlocks was a guest author on this site who is no longer with us .
He was a dude with long , blonde hair ] except female , attractive , down - to - earth , and not heading to rehab anytime soon .
Please note that a 919 is “ Kate Hudson hot . ”
Please only reserve this rating for girls that truly deserve it .
So yeah , that swamp donkey sitting in the corner of the bar that you think is “ kinda sorta cute ” at closing time after too many pints ?
NOT a 919 .
Area Code Rating : 000
Rationale : Ummm , I think we all understand the area code rating system by now .
Guest - workers coming to Moscow feed on dogs , cats and pigeons
A family residing in the city of Poltava , Ukraine , has been sentenced to up to six months in prison for killing 15 cats and using their meat for food .
Some witnesses on the case said that the family was also selling the meat for cakes .
Guest - workers coming to Moscow feed on dogs , cats and pigeons
Investigators determined that the family couple had been catching and killing cats in their neighborhood for years .
The slaughterers had killed and eaten 15 felines in total , or at least that was what 51 - year - old Nikolai Penkovsky and his wife said .
Witnesses said that the couple was selling the cat meat to various outlets dealing with sales of meat dumplings , cakes and pancakes .

The cat eaters were arrested in December 2007 , but were later released in their own custody .
Bones and feline skins were found in the perpetrators ’ apartment .
In Russia , incidents of cruelty towards animals occur on a regular basis .
A 25 - year - old citizen of Vietnam was arrested last week in Moscow for killing 50 pigeons .
The man had a handcart with him , in which he was carrying the bodies of 50 pigeons , a bird net and some grain .
The young man testified that he had killed all the birds for food .
A 41 - year - old man from the Kaliningrad region of Russia killed and ate a bullterrier last week .
The man caught and strangled the dog with the help of a rope .
When he brought the dog home , he boiled the dead animal and ate it .
A chain of Chinese restaurants has been recently closed in Moscow .
The restaurants were selling the meat of slaughtered mongrel dogs as beef .
Eye - witnesses said that they saw employees of one of the restaurants in the back entrance carrying sacks with something moving and squeaking inside .
Psychologists acknowledge that it is hard to describe such people as adequate individuals .
“ When a person has a choice of either buying food at a grocery store or killing an animal for food and when he or she chooses the second option , it testifies to aggressive conduct .
They used to eat dogs and cats during war times , when people had to do that to survive .
Nowadays , such people need psychological help .
A human being willing to slaughter a pet can vent their aggression on other people , ” a psychologist said .
Indeed , over 85 percent of serial killers , including cannibals , used to torture animals before they started killing people .

" Axis of evil " was a term coined by United States President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address on January 29 , 2002 in order to describe governments that he accused of helping terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction .
Bush named Iraq , Iran , and North Korea in his speech .
Of course , they were n’t an axis , that is they were n’t an alliance , at all ; in fact two of them , Iraq and Iran , had fought a bloody war with the United States supporting Iraq .
Anyhow , it looks like the " axis " is down to one .
The first to go was Iraq , with the United States - led invasion on March 20 , 2003 by a multinational coalition composed of U.S. and U.K. troops supported by smaller contingents from Australia , Denmark , Poland , and other nations .
At the start of the war , U.S. officials argued that Iraq and its alleged possession and further pursuit of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) posed an imminent threat to the security and interests of the United States , Europe and the other nations of the Middle East .
Also Iraq was linked with terrorism .
However the links to terrorism were found to be false , and weapons inspectors found no evidence of WMD .
And then North Korea .
The Agreed Framework signed by the United States and North Korea on October 21 , 1994 in Geneva agreed that :
North Korea would freeze its existing nuclear program and agree to enhanced International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards .
Both sides would cooperate to replace the D.P.R.K.’s graphite - moderated reactors for related facilities with light - water ( LWR ) power plants .
Both countries would move toward full normalization of political and economic relations .
Both sides will work together for peace and security on a nuclear - free Korean peninsula .
And that both sides would work to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime .
Then along came Bush .
South Korea was told in March 2001 that President Bush and Secretary Powell would not continue the talks with North Korea representatives on their nuclear program that were begun the year before by President Clinton and Secretary Albright .
Next , Bush called the DPRK a part of the axis of evil in his 2002 State of the Union Address .
So , thanks to Bush , North Korea got to work .
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee February 4 , 2003 that the administration received a National Intelligence Estimate in June 2002 stating that North Korea had engaged in at least [ a research and development ] project for highly enriched uranium .
He also stated that intelligence received the next month , however , indicated that North Korea was acquiring many more [ centrifuges ] than was originally thought ,  adding that a September 2002 intelligence memorandum said that North Korea had embarked on a production program . 
A November 2002 CIA report to Congress says North Korea is constructing a [ uranium - enrichment ] plant that could produce enough weapons - grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons a year when fully operational .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony that the uranium - enrichment program could produce fissile material in probably months and not years . 
This was followed by years of disengagement with North Korea and its nuclear program .
In 2003 North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and it subsequently acted belligerently , reactivating its nuclear power facilities and firing a land - to - ship missile into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan .
It also conducted an underground nuclear explosive test on October 16 , 2006 .
Then came a shocker .
On June 26th the Bush administration asked Congress " to de-list North Korea from America ’s " terrorist watch list , and suspended sanctions on North Korea that are tied to the " Trading with Enemies Act . "
This puts US - North Korea relations on a whole new track .
Chalk it up as a success for Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian & Pacific Affairs Christopher Hill , who has been attacked by former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton for the last year .
President Bush : " North Korea pledged to declare its nuclear activity .
With today ’s declaration , North Korea has begun describing its plutonium - related activities .
It ’s also provided other documents related to its nuclear programs going back to 1986 .
It has promised access to the reactor core and waste facilities at Yongbyon , as well as personnel related to its nuclear program .
All this information will be essential to verifying that North Korea is ending its nuclear programs and activities .
" The six - party talks are based on a principle of ‘ action for action . ’
So in keeping with the existing six - party agreements , the United States is responding to North Korea ’s actions with two actions of our own :
" First , I ’m issuing a proclamation that lifts the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act with respect to North Korea .
" And secondly , I am notifying Congress of my intent to rescind North Korea ’s designation as a state sponsor of terror . . . Multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully solve the nuclear issue with North Korea .
" They said they ’re going to destroy parts of their plant in Yongbyon .
That ’s a very positive step — after all , it ’s the plant that made plutonium .
" Now , as I mentioned in my statement , there ’s a lot more verification that needs to be done .
I mentioned our concerns about [ uranium ] enrichment .
We expect the North Korean regime to be forthcoming about their programs . "
Catch the new Bush :
" North Korea has begun describing its plutonium - related activities . "
" They said they ’re going to destroy parts of their [ plutonium ] plant in Yongbyon . "
" I mentioned our concerns about [ uranium ] enrichment . "
" We expect the North Korean regime to be forthcoming about their programs . "
So it looks like two down .
But what about the third and last " Axis " member , Iran ?
Do they get the attack like Iraq , or do they get the concern and expectations like North Korea ?
( Hint : They ’ve got oil and gas , like Iraq , and North Korea does n’t . )
Iran has been subjected to a series of United Nations sanctions for its refusal to cease enriching uranium , as North Korea is doing , and the United States refuses to talk to Iran .
This is despite the fact that Iran , a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Pact signatory , is in full compliance with the NPT which states : " Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty . "
In other words , Iran , like any NPT signatory , is not only allowed but encouraged to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
Iran is in full compliance with the NPT .
In February of this year , the UN International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated :
" The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran .
Iran has provided the Agency with access to declared nuclear material and has provided the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with declared nuclear material and activities . "
And again in May :
" The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . "
Despite these affirmations Iran has been threatened with attack by Israel .
Iran has said that it would react violently if attacked .
As a result , UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon criticized — Iran .
Talk about the double standards at the United Nations , reports Kaveh L Afrasiabi of Asia Times .
Whereas UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has repeatedly condemned Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad ’s rhetoric against Israel , expressing " shock and dismay , " he has remained ominously , and inexcusably , silent about the blatant Israeli threats of military attacks on Iran , thus undermining the world ’s confidence in his ability to steer the global community clear of yet another major war in the Middle East caldron .
Afrasiabi continues : Having turned a blind eye to Iran ’s formal protest at the UN regarding Israel ’s explicit threats , Ban may need to revisit his own statement of June 7 , 2007 , " The secretary general points out that all members have undertaken to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state . "
In light of new media disclosures about Israel ’s advanced plans to launch a major air offensive against Iran ’s nuclear installations , bound to inflict serious civilian casualties and trigger the volatile region into a " fireball , " to paraphrase the reaction of the head of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Mohammad ElBaradei , who has stated categorically that he would resign immediately if Iran is attacked , Ban is borderline on the verge of skirting his official obligation by refusing to issue a stern statement on this serious matter of war and peace .
And what ’s the US up to ?
Until recently , writes Sarah Van Gelder at Huffington Post , the power struggle within the Bush administration over whether to attack Iran seemed to be going badly for the hawks .
Their disastrous record in Iraq coupled with flimsy arguments for attacking Iran meant they were gaining little support .
But now it appears congressional Democrats may be riding to the rescue of those pushing for war .
Bills have been introduced in both houses that would impose strict inspections on all cargo inbound to Iran .
Imposing " stringent inspection requirements " would amount to a naval blockade , many believe , and thus constitute an act of war .
At the very least , it would be perceived by Iranians of all political persuasions as a hostile act , further marginalizing moderate voices , unifying the country behind the most belligerent leaders , and bolstering the argument of those within Iran who are pushing for the rapid development of nuclear weapons as a defense against U.S. attack .
Why are 96 House Democrats ( along with 111 House Republicans ) co-sponsoring this resolution ?
Are n’t these the Democrats who rode into majorities in both houses on public revulsion against war in the Middle East ?
According to a recent story on CBS News , the answer seems to be a " full - court press " by the government of Israel and the American - Israeli lobby AIPAC .
CBS ran the story Tuesday as Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen was on his way to the Middle East to confer with Israeli government officials .
" Israelis are uncertain about what would be the policies of the next [ U.S. ] administration vis–vis Iran , " CBS consultant Michael Oren says in the report .
Hence the rush to war ?
It sure looks like war , if these bills become law and the UN falls in line .
H. Con. Res 362 ( introduced by Democrat Gary Ackerman ) and S.Res.580 ( by Democrat Evan Bayh ) are identical bills which have as their goal " preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability , through all appropriate economic , political , and diplomatic means , is vital to the national security interests of the United States and must be dealt with urgently … . "
The bill :
" demands that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , inter alia , prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program ; "
So the US is concerned about North Korea ’s uranium enrichment and , thanks to the Democrats , ready to go to war over Iran’s .
As Edward Abbey said : " As war and government prove , insanity is the most contagious of diseases . "

Here ’s a conundrum for you .
What is the momentum of light in a transparent dielectric medium ?
If the answer does n’t trip off your tongue , that might be because nobody else knows either .
Amazingly , there are two lines of thought :
In 1908 , the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski guessed that the momentum was equal to nE / c ( where n is the refractive index , and E and c are the energy and speed of light in a vacuum ) .
A year later , his contemporary Max Abraham suggested that the momentum is equal to E/nc .
A century since then and we ’re none the wiser .
An embarrassing state of affairs for theoretical physics , would n’t you agree ?
Today Weilong
She and pals from Sun Yat - Sen University in Guangzhou , China , announce that they have the answer .
And they got it by measuring the recoil on the end face of a nanometre - sized fibre exerted by outgoing light .
( This is n’t the well known pressure caused by specular reflection but something a little more subtle . )
The experiment is impressive because it is designed in such a way that if Minkowski were correct the fibre should be pushed in one direction and in the other if Abraham were correct .
So the result is the first to unambiguously favour one theorist over the other .
And the winner is … drum roll … Abraham .
It ’s about time .

As people in the United States and around the world commemorate the memory of John Lennon on the anniversary of his 1981 murder , Dec. 8 , Cuba honors the musician as a messenger of peace .
HAVANA ( Granma ) – From the roof of the Central Museum of Decorative Arts , Beatles fan musicians flooded the dawn of this city with songs of the legendary band on the 30th anniversary of the assassination of John Lennon , reports AIN .
Mostly fans , the eight performers at the concert raided the English group ’s memorable discography with Let It Be and Do n’t let me down , to close with Imagine , the theme created by Lennon that has transcended to become a call for world peace .
The idea of playing from a high point of the city was inspired by the last live performance of the Beatles , January 30 , 1969 from the roof of the Apple label , in London , said Wilfredo Rodriguez , one of those involved in the tribute .
Guillermo Párez , a specialist of the Provincial Heritage Centre , told AIN that the first Saturday of each month , at that institution , there is a meeting or Peña dedicated to one of the most successful and acclaimed rock bands in the history of popular music .
The gathering is attended by a public loyal to the musical legacy of John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , in an area where the anthologies and less known works of the group predominate , he said .
Every December 8th the group from the Peña de los Beatles pays special tribute to Lennon , who was killed at the hands of a fanatic in 1980 at the entrance to the Dakota building in New York .
On December 8 , 2000 a statue of John Lennon by Cuban sculptor José Villa was dedicated in a park in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana .
The statute was unveiled by President Fidel Castro Ruz and singer Silvio Rodriguez .
We reprint here the speech given by Ricardo Alarcon Quesada , President of the Cuban National Assembly .
Dear John , you were always among us
Ricardo Alarcon Quesada
Compañeras y compañeros :
Here , in front of the excellent work of art of José Villa , we return to listen to what some said twenty years ago today : “ About this man you can believe anything except that he is dead . ”
Nostalgia does not bring us together .
We are not inaugurating a monument to the past , nor a site to commemorate something that disappeared .
This place will always be a testimonial to struggle , a summoning to humanism .
It will also be a permanent homage to a generation that wanted to transform the world , and to the rebellious , innovative spirit of the artist who helped forge that generation and at the same time is one of its most authentic symbols .
The sixties were much more than a period in a century that is ending .
Before anything else , they were a attitude toward life , that profoundly affected the culture , the society and politics , and crossed all borders .
Their renewing impulse rose up , victorious , overwhelming the decade , but it had been born before that time and has not stopped even up to today .
To these years we turn our sights with the tenderness of first love , with the loyalty that guards all combatants for their earliest and most distant battle .
Some still denigrate them , with obstinate antagonism , those who know that to kill history they must first tear out its most luminous and hopeful moment .
This is how it is , and has always been in favor of or against “ the sixties . ”
In that time old imperial colonies fell , people previously ignored arose and their art , their literature , their ideas started to penetrate the opulent nations .
The Third World was born and tricontinental solidarity , and some discovered that there , in the rich north , existed another Third World that also awakened .
In the United States , a century after the Civil War , black people fought for the right to be treated as persons and with them marched many white students .
In Europe the young people repudiated imperial violence and identified themselves with the condemned of the earth .
Nobody spoke yet of globalization but , for everyone , the Earth got smaller , the whole world became closer .
Then , finally liberated , appeared Cuba , truly discovered in 1959 as an inseparable part , fully pledged to liberty , life and truth .
Victory seemed immediate .
To obtain it , people strived without rest .
In mountains and cities , with stones and fists , with weapons snatched from the oppressors and also with speeches , poems and songs .
They tried to assault the sky , to conquer , in a single act , all justice , for the black and the woman , for the worker and the poor , for the sick , the ignorant , and the marginalized .
They believed they could arrive at a horizon of peace between nations and equality among men .
It was more than anything the rebellion of the youth .
Before their impetus fell dogmas and fetishes , they broke the molds of Pharisee and banality , they turned back the dull mediocrity of an unjust and false society that reduces man to merchandise and converts everything into false gold .
Years afterward , and affirming the continuity of the movement , Lennon described it with these words : “ The Sixties saw a revolution among the youth … a complete revolution in the mode of thinking .
The young people took it up first , and the following generation afterwards .
The Beatles were a part of the revolution .
We were all in that boat in the sixties .
Our generation – a boat that went to discover the New World .
And the Beatles were the lookouts on that boat .
We were a part of it . ”
Tumultuous was the passage from that memorable concert in 1963 when Lennon asked the people who occupied the most expensive theater seats to , instead of applauding , just rattle their jewels , to six Novembers later when he returned the Order of the British Empire in protest of the aggression in Vietnam and the colonialist intervention in Africa .
The refusal to perform before an exclusively white public in Florida , in 1966 ; the refusal to perform in the South Africa of apartheid ; the denunciation of racism in the United States when he arrived there to participate in concerts that had been boycotted by the Ku Klux Klan ; the calls for peace in the Middle East ; the support for young people who deserted the Yankee aggressor army and the constant support to the Vietnamese resistance and the struggle of the Irish people ; the incessant search for new forms of expression , without ever abandoning the roots and authentic language of the people ; the repudiation of the bourgeois system , its codes and merchandizing mechanisms ; the creation of a corporation to combat them and defend artistic liberty , an entity to which was attributed , even , a certain communist inspiration .
The personal contribution of John Lennon stood out singularly and endured beyond the dissolution of the group .
His songs form a most complete inventory of the collective struggle of the young people for peace , revolution , popular power , the emancipation of the working class and of women , the rights of indigenous peoples and racial equality as well as the liberation of Angela Davis and John Sinclair and other political prisoners , the denunciation of the massacre at Attica and the situation in North American prisons , in an interminable list .
Beyond the music , in interviews and public statements , he openly expressed his identification with the socialist ideal .
Lennon was the object of intense and obstinate persecution by the Yankee [ U.S. government ] authorities .
The FBI , the CIA and the Immigration Service , instigated directly by Richard Nixon , the trickiest tenant the White House has ever had , spied on him and harassed him and strived to expel him from the United States .
In spite of what their laws say and the countless measures carried out during a quarter of a century , these agencies still maintain in secret the documents proving the tenacious harassment they unleashed against him .
The little that they have revealed shows that in just one year , between 1971 and 1972 , the secret informants of their spies accumulated 300 pages and a file that weighs 26 pounds .
With no other weapons than his talent and the solidarity of lots of North Americans , he was forced to confront for several years the powerful Empire led by the most sordid and arrogant political machine .
This chapter will remain in history as an example of moral force and the force of ideas , and from it Lennon emerged as a paradigm of the entirely free and creative intellectual , precisely engaged with his time .
Dear John ,
It was more than a few who said , twenty years ago , that the 8th of December was the end of an era .
Many feared it among the millions who offered you ten minutes of silence and the multitude that on the 14th congregated in Central Park in New York to express a pain that time does not placate .
It was Yoko who then advised : “ the message should not end . ”
And little Sean , knew how to express the greater truth :
He imagined you bigger , after death , “ because now you are everywhere . ”
You were always among us .
Now , in addition , we offer you this bench where you can rest and this park to receive your compañeros and friends .
Your message could not disappear because love had , and still has , many battles to fight .
Because you had the privilege to hear it in millions of voices that became yours and continued raising it up like a hymn .
Was n’t it a yellow submarine that surfaced that afternoon in 1966 in the port of New York and marched at the front of thousands of young people who condemned the war ?
How many hundreds of thousands demanded that peace be given a chance , and were in solidarity with the people of Vietnam , there in Washington , in front of the monument , that unforgettable November 15th in 1969 ?
On that day , did n’t your art reach its highest realization ?
How many times did it not multiply from Berkeley to New England and from one continent to another , that generation that believed that love could prevail over war ?
John , I am sure that you remember the martyrs of Kent State University who wanted to follow you , to also be working class heroes .
It is known that it was your verses that were their only shield in front of the bullets of Nixon .
There were more , many more , that met to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Imagine , in 1991 , when others said that the story had already ended .
Some believe that you appeared in a window of the Dakota .
All of us , you too , were happy .
We saw , astonished , the faces of old comrades , confounded to be among countless young people who had not even been born when you , over there in Liverpool , intoned ballads of love with proletarian words and we here defied the monster .
Our boat will continue sailing .
Nothing will stop it .
It is driven by “ a wind that never dies . ”
They will call us dreamers but our ranks will grow .
We will defend the vanquished dream and struggle to make real all dreams .
Neither storms nor pirates will hold us back .
We will sail on until we reach the new world that we will know how to build .
We will meet again , tonight , at the concert .
We will go on together , always .

US congressional probe charges
Utah mine officials lied to federal agency before Crandall Canyon disaster
By Samuel Davidson
13 May 2008
US Congressional investigators are calling for a criminal probe of the general manager and other senior staff at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah where nine miners were killed last August .
The request to the US Attorney General follows allegations that management lied and hid information from federal mine safety officials that could have prevented the disaster .
According to the Congressional investigation , whose results were made available last week , company officials failed to properly inform the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) of a previous roof collapse in March of 2007 , and downplayed the damage caused by that collapse when they applied for permission to continue extracting coal from another section of the mine .
In a letter sent to the US Attorney General from Congressman George Miller of California , Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor , which is conducting the investigation , Miller charged that company officials “ willfully concealed or covered a material fact or made materially false representation , ” to MSHA .
However , Miller — a top congressional Democrat — makes no charges against the mine ’s owner Robert Murray , who has close connections to the Bush administration .
Nor are there any allegations against MSHA itself , which has been stacked with former mine officials and other pro-company types by the White House , and whose actions in the Crandall Canyon disaster at a minimum criminally negligent .
On August 6 , a pillar or series of pillars burst apart causing a cave - in of the mine so powerful that it registered 3.9 on the Richter scale .
Six coal miners whose bodies have never been recovered were killed .
It is not know if the six men were killed outright by the collapse or died from injuries or starvation .
Ten days later , three more miners who were working to reach the six trapped men were killed when a 1,500 foot section of tunnel they were working in collapsed .
The death of the nine miners was completely avoidable .
At the time of the disaster , Genwal Resources Inc , the company that was operating the mine , was conducting a very dangerous practice known as retreat mining .
This method involves removing the massive coal pillars that support the mine ’s roof and allowing the collapse of sections of the mine as workers move backwards towards the entrance .
The company was mining an area known as the Main West section of the mine .
That section of the mine had been mined until 2001 , when it was considered mined out using traditional mining methods .
With the price of coal soaring , companies have found it very profitable to try to extract every last bit of coal they can .
The Main West section of the mine had two sets of coal pillars that ran the length of the area on either side and provided the main support for the roof called the North and South barriers .
In addition to mining these pillars , the report said , the company also skimmed coal off the floor — a practice that weakened the pillars and made them more likely to burst apart .
The company began retreat mining of the North barrier until a collapse in that section of the mine on March 10 , 2007 forced them to stop .
Just over two months later , on May 16 , 2007 , the company applied to MSHA officials to mine the pillars out of the South barrier .
MSHA approved the request the following month , less than 10 weeks before the disaster .
Congressional investigators are charging that Genwal General Manager Laine Adair and other mining officials lied to MSHA officials about the extent of the March 2007 collapse .
Allyn Davis , the MSHA supervisor for District 9 , which covers Crandall Canyon Mine , told investigators that Adair downplayed the damaged caused by that roof collapse .
“ The photos that I saw and the description I got from Laine Adair do n’t match . ”
Prior to the disaster , miners , including one of the six men killed from the initial collapse , told family members of the danger of working in the mine .
They reported that sections of the mine floor had been “ heaving ” or buckling up from the intense pressure placed upon it .
They had reported that mine management knew about the problem , but continued operations anyway .
Miller ’s letter and the report make no mention of why Davis took Adair ’s word for the extent of the damage , and why MSHA did n’t conduct its own onsite investigation to determine the damage caused by the March 10 collapse before approving mining of the South Barrier .
Last month , the Department of Labor ’s own internal investigating wing was much more critical of MSHA , calling the federal agency ’s handling of the Crandall Canyon mine “ negligent . ”
Miller ’s report actually upholds as legitimate the practice of retreat mining , although it proposes a few added precautions .
The report makes no mention of the close relations between Robert Murray , the Bush administration and officials at the Department of Labor , which oversees MSHA .
Murray and Murray Energy were both big contributors to Bush ’s presidential campaigns , and the mine owner often boasted when dealing with MSHA inspectors that he was friends with the husband of their boss — Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao .
Both Adair and Murray , along with several other company officials , refused to testify before the investigation on the grounds that they might incriminate themselves .
Immediately following the August 6 , 2007 disaster , Murray traveled to Utah were he claimed an earthquake caused the mine to collapse even before an investigation began .
This allegation was similar to that of the owners of the Sago mine in West Virginia , who claimed lightning had caused the underground explosion that killed 12 miners in January 2006 .
Murray has a long history of operating dangerous mines .
In March another mine owned by a different subsidiary of Murray Energy , the Tower mine , also in Utah , was forced to close after safety inspectors fined the mine $ 420,000 for flagrant safety violations , including repeatedly allowing the buildup of explosive coal dust .
As in previous investigations and the state and federal mine safety hearings that followed Sago and other disasters , it is certain that the Democrats and Republicans will not implement any measures that impede the profit interests of the mine owners .
This can only mean that the lives and limbs of miners will continue to be sacrificed .

Here is a line of thinking that I have heard several times recently – oil prices have increased so rapidly recently that the market has become overheated and will pop like a bubble .
Comparisons to Dutch tulips , Dot Com stocks , and housing prices abound on TV , on the radio , on the web , and around water coolers .
There is one major difference that causes me some grave concern – oil , unlike all of those other investment manias that exploded , is a commodity with visible , experienced hands on the controls .
The reason that I am concerned is that I believe that high oil prices are hurting nearly everyone and the pain will increase as time goes on .
The hands on the controls , however , are feeling no pain .
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) is an internationally recognized cartel established in September , 1960 that holds well publicized meetings on a regular basis to discuss production allocations that are specifically designed to maintain a market price that members agree best meets their internal and external needs .
Many of the country representatives to that meeting have spent lengthy careers thinking deeply about oil prices and how best to manage them to benefit the people who send them to the meetings and pay their generous salaries .
Oil market controllers have experienced a number of ups and downs and worked diligently to master the many price influencing tools at their disposal .
Those tools may be a bit blunt , but they can be effective if wielded with skill by experienced manipulators .
OPEC supplies about 40 % of the total world ’s oil and has an impact that is disproportionate even against that large total .
Its decision are closely watched and often widely respected by large suppliers that are not members .
All oil suppliers recognize that they have a very special commodity that responds to even tiny differences between daily supply and daily demand .
During the decades that I have been interested in energy as a study topic , I have heard or read hundreds of reports in oil industry trade publications that indicate the respect given to OPEC as a disciplined cartel that does all suppliers a service by keeping prices at profitable levels .
Though traders can store oil , the volume of daily consumption is so vast that even a 1 % over supply situation can fill up storage areas in just a matter of months while a 1 % deficit can result in significant shortages in some locations .
Like a hot air balloon , there is a potential for a disastrous crash with an inexperienced or poorly coordinated crew , but there is also the potential for a very pleasant ride for those who know what they are doing .
Unfortunately , the basket under an oil fed hot air balloon is not very large and the number of people who benefit from an oil price balloon that never comes back to earth will be rather small .
I see few prospects , however , that those of us left on earth will be invited to share in the benefits of the ride any time soon .
It is way too much fun for the people in the basket to collect massive quantities of money from the rest of us who seemingly have no means of forcing that balloon to return to earth .
Recently , an oil minister from an OPEC member told the world that his country saw no reason to increase supplies since demand destruction was already working to put supply and demand into balance and a Russian oil and gas executive gleefully predicted that oil prices would reach $ 250 per barrel in 2009 .
At my own water cooler , the objection that I get to my line of thinking is that oil prices experienced a collapse during the mid 1980s and remained low for about 15 years .
They tell me that proves that a period of high prices will almost inevitably be followed by a period of low prices caused by the combination of new supplies encouraged by high prices and reduced demand caused by a reaction to the high prices .
Their interpretation of oil price history is that the conservation efforts install a long term change in consumer habits .
Apparently they think that OPEC recognizes this and will reduce prices in time to avoid a long term loss of market share .
The difficulty that I have in accepting this interpretation is that low energy prices through the 1980s and 1990s were driven not by a reduction in demand , but by a relentless increase in the available supply of useful energy .
Most of the new supply came into the market from sources outside of OPEC .
Total energy use did not fall after the oil shocks of the 1970s , but the annual rate of increase slowed .
Total supply actually increased substantially as new production areas like the North Slope of Alaska and the North Sea came on line at the same time as new nuclear power plants added the energy equivalent of 12 million barrels of oil per day to the world supply .
Today there are no major production areas that are beginning operation and there are not any massive new nuclear plant programs with plants ready to connect to the grid .
The time delays required under current laws are going to make it difficult to change supply rapidly enough to make much difference for at least a few years .
We are in for a long slog of high prices – unless the world ’s political leadership takes action to enable massive new supplies to reach the market more quickly than is currently predicted .
Jawboning might just work , but it is a long shot .
It just might be that the balloon will remain aloft for a long time without popping or even leaking very much .

Ten Health Care Myths
Abandoning The Public Interest
By Ulli Diemer
The date : Saturday , May 13 , 2000 .
The weather : warm , sunny with cloudy periods .
The time : 3:15 pm in the Central European Time Zone , 9:15 am in North America ’s Eastern Time Zone .
Time to play outside if you ’re a child .
Time to relax if you ’re an adult , do some housework , have a cup of coffee or a nice cold glass of water .
Time , if you live in the small Canadian town of Walkerton , Ontario , to walk down Durham Street to join your neighbours and look at the surging Saugeen River , which has flooded its banks after unusually heavy rains the previous day and night .
The local park , a couple of adjacent streets , and several unlucky cars , are underwater , but , since everyone is safe , the property damage does n’t seem too tragic .
Time , if you live on the Tollensstraat in the Dutch town of Enschede , to stop what you ’re doing and watch the fire engines race by , headed for the paper factory down the street where , it seems , a fire has broken out .
Time , just enough time , to grab the children and run back into the house when two explosions at the burning factory rattle windows and send debris hurtling skyward .
Five short minutes later , time runs out .
The supposed paper factory is actually S.E. Fireworks , and at 3:30 pm , 100 tonnes of explosives ignite in a third and devastating explosion .
In the Tollensstraat , not one house is left standing .
In the surrounding working - class neighbourhood of Mekkelholt , 400 houses are utterly destroyed and another 1,000 are damaged .
At least 20 people lie dead , more than 900 others are injured .
In the days that follow , disbelief and shock give way to anger and a demand for answers .
S. E. Fireworks , it turns out , has been operating for years in open violation of the most basic safety procedures , yet government inspectors routinely rubber - stamped operating permits , while local authorities and emergency services were not even informed that a fireworks company had been allowed to set up operations in the middle of a residential neighbourhood .
The Dutch government , it appears , has been criminally negligent .
At that same moment , several thousand kilometres away in Walkerton , the day is tranquil and seemingly ordinary .
But invisibly , below the surface , something has changed , and though its citizens do n’t know it yet , Walkerton will never be the same .
Water contaminated with cattle manure has entered the poorly sealed wells from which Walkerton draws its water , passed through an inadequately maintained water treatment plant in which the chlorination system is malfunctioning , and is now being pumped into every home .
Within days , seven people are dead and another 2,000 , almost half the town ’s population , have been taken violently ill .
In Walkerton too , in the days and weeks that follow , there is anger and a demand for answers .
Residents learn that the Ontario provincial government , responsible for drinking water safety in the province , has deliberately dismantled vital parts of the public health infrastructure in the name of cutting " red tape " .
The government , it turns out , has knowingly ignored repeated warnings from its own experts and agencies that its ill - considered cutbacks in environmental and health protection are jeopardizing public health .
Committed to a " free market " agenda of " downsizing government " , it has laid the groundwork for a disaster by cutting inspection staff , shutting down testing labs , and eliminating reporting and enforcement procedures .
The Enschede and Walkerton tragedies are ominous portents -- deadly instances of a frightening trend in the advanced industrial nations .
Governments are abdicating or " downsizing " even those regulatory and protective functions essential for ensuring public safety , or abandoning them to unaccountable private interests .
The results can be tragic .
In November 1999 , in the Italian city of Foggia , more than 50 people die when a five - storey apartment building in a working - class neighbourhood suddenly collapses in the middle of the night .
Investigators believe shoddy workmanship , coupled with a failure to enforce building standards , is to blame .
Subsequent inspections reveal severe structural flaws in other buildings constructed at the same time .
Residents are hurriedly evacuated .
In Turkey , the death toll in the August 1999 earthquake is far higher than it need have been because many buildings supposedly constructed to withstand an earthquake turn out to have been built in violation of building standards .
Civic officials are revealed to have colluded with contractors to certify substandard buildings .
There is outrage , but to little effect .
A year later , no one has been charged , and some of the contractors whose shoddy buildings collapsed win contracts to build replacements .
In Belgium , huge quantities of food , including chickens , eggs , dairy products , pork , beef , and baked goods , are discovered to be contaminated with dioxin and PCBs in the summer of 1999 .
The chemicals had been mixed with animal fat , the fat then put into feed for livestock -- a still - routine practice in modern farming , despite the public furor over mad cow disease , linked to cattle fed on meat byproducts .
Upon learning of the contamination , Belgian authorities keep it secret for four weeks before informing the public .
An official accounts for the delay by explaining the government wanted to conduct additional tests to confirm the results before subjecting producers to the hardship of having to destroy their products .
Later in the summer , Belgium moves to raise permissible levels of dioxins in food , arguing that previous standards were too stringent and therefore too onerous for producers .
The tactic of lowering health standards rather than make potentially expensive changes to meet them is popular with industry lobby groups .
And increasingly governments are choosing to accommodate industry demands , even if it exposes the public to greater risks .
In the United States , new legislation regulating pesticides was revealed -- after it was passed -- to have been written by an industry lobby group working behind the scenes .
The new law , an almost word - for - word copy of the lobby group ’s submission to friendly legislators , makes it more difficult for regulators to restrict existing pesticides , and makes it easier for companies to bring new chemicals to market .
Whereas before it was necessary to provide evidence that a pesticide was safe for use , the new legislation reverses the onus of proof .
A new pesticide can now be put on the market unless government regulators can provide conclusive evidence it is not safe .
Since pesticide - linked illnesses can take years to become evident , the dangers of this approach are clear .
It is becoming increasingly clear that we are witnessing a drastic rolling back of the systems and structures which Western societies developed over the past century or more to safeguard public health and safety .
A new generation of politicians and business leaders , permeated with free - market ideology , is jettisoning , with little thought or understanding of the consequences , the apparatus previous generations built , piece by piece , to mitigate the most dangerous aspects of industrial civilization .
What we are losing as a result are not only specific protective and regulatory mechanisms , important as they are , but the understanding of why they exist , why they were created in the first place .
The hard - won experiences of the past , the disasters that our ancestors learned from at great cost , are disappearing down the memory hole .
Allen Kennedy , in The End of Shareholder Value , argues that large corporations have undergone a major change in the last two decades , largely abandoning traditional strategies of long - term corporate growth in favour of maximizing immediate returns .
Executives whose main form of remuneration is now their stock option , not their salary , and whose shareholders are also looking for quick and large gains on the stock market , are now concerned above all with maximizing revenues in the very short term .
To that end , even the corporation ’s own long - term interests are commonly sacrificed .
Kennedy cites examples of large companies selling off assets and slashing research and development in order to make stock prices go up .
The model for getting rich is now the high - tech start - up , whose Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs ) put fortunes into the pockets of their founders , although the company may never produce a profit or even bring a product to market .
Kennedy quotes one top CEO , who brushes aside questions about the short - sightedness of his approach with the comment " Why ... should I care ?
I ’ll be long gone before anyone finds out . "
At the same time , governments , infused with the same free - market ideology , have made it an article of faith that the private sector is the most efficient provider of most products and services , and that , if a service absolutely has to be provided by the public sector , it should be modelled on the private sector model or provided in partnership with the private sector .
Social - democratic and " third way " politicians share this unquestioning faith in the private sector and its ways with their conservative rivals .
The result , all too often , is that responsibility for ensuring public safety is left in the hands of companies who are in a grave conflict of interest : the less they spend on infrastructure , maintenance , safety equipment , and staff , the higher their profits .
The potential cost of this conflict of interest was revealed by the inquiry into the Paddington train disaster in England , in which 31 people died when a train went through a red signal .
Thames
Trains , the privatized company which owned the fatal train , had made a decision the previous year not to equip its entire fleet with automatic train protection ( ATP ) systems which stop trains that pass through red signals and which could have prevented the crash .
The decision was taken despite the occurrence of a similar rail crash in Southall in 1997 , and despite repeated incidents in which trains were passing through red lights , narrowly avoiding collisions .
Thames
Trains considered the £ 5.26 million cost of the system too expensive -- yet the company paid a £ 4.23 million dividend to shareholders in the year it decided not to proceed with ATP , and another £ 3.25 million dividend the following year .
Another dramatic warning of where this approach can lead struck Auckland , New Zealand , in early 1998 .
The main cables supplying electrical power to downtown Auckland failed , and the central business district was left totally without power .
Efforts to get the system running again failed : it took 66 days for power to be restored .
Normal life ground to a halt : residential and office buildings had to be evacuated .
A subsequent enquiry showed that the privatized power company had neglected basic infrastructure and slashed maintenance staff .
Under public ownership the electrical utility had maintained additional cables to serve as standbys in case of a failure in the main cables .
The privatized company had eliminated this backup capacity as a needless cost .
The same narrow logic came to light in the Ford Pinto exploding fuel tank scandal of the 1970s .
Internal Ford documents showed that Ford executives had cold - bloodedly weighed the costs of recalling cars and fixing fuel tanks ( $ 11 per vehicle ) against the costs of settling lawsuits from individuals killed or injured in a fuel tank explosion ( an affordable average of $ 67,000 US for a burn injury , $ 200,000 US for a death ) and concluded it would be cheaper to settle the insurance claims and let the fuel tanks go on exploding .
Investigators are now questioning whether similar calculations may have played a role in the failure to deal energetically with the tread separation problems reported on Ford Explorers with Firestone tires .
More than 150 deaths in various countries have been linked to tread separations on these tires .
According to exposes by investigative journalists , Ford and Firestone failed to inform regulatory authorities in the United States that a problem existed , even though they had already ordered the recall of problem tires in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela , and were engaged in settling lawsuits from victims and families of those killed or injured in the crashes .
As a condition of settling lawsuits with victims , Ford and Firestone demanded that evidence revealed during the cases be kept confidential .
Had the defect become public knowledge earlier , there is no doubt lives would have been saved .
" Those who cannot remember the past , " said George Santayana , " are condemned to repeat it . "
Industrial societies learned , over the course of decades , that private interests can not be trusted to safeguard the public interest when it conflicts with their self - interest .
It was a hard lesson , learned at the cost of many lives , but the result was that gradually , piece by piece , country by country , a public infrastructure of regulations and agencies and procedures was brought into being to protect public health and safety .
That infrastructure is now being undermined , not only from without , but from within government itself .
We may be forced to relearn the bitter lessons that our ancestors learned , to our cost .

Graffiti artist Slick puts finishing touches on Roger Waters ' inflatable pig backstage at Coachella .
There 's a $ 10,000 reward for the return of the pig , which was released during Roger Waters ' performance .
UPDATE : Roger Waters ' lost pig was found in two pieces Tuesday , according to KESQ.com .
INDIO , California – Concert promoters are offering a $ 10,000 reward and four lifetime passes to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival for the safe return of a giant inflatable pig that 's gone missing .
The spray - painted pig balloon was released during Roger Waters ' performance Sunday at the festival .
The school - bus - size prop emerged during " Pigs , " a song from Pink Floyd 's 1977 album Animals .
" A pig got loose last night , " said Bill Fold , one of the festival ' sproducers , on Monday .

Sick of hearing it .
Next time I hear someone yelping about “ real manhood ” I ’m about half ready to pull out my trusty two - by - four and commence to opening up a size - ten can of whoopass .
Bloody twits would n’t know a real man if they got their ankles chewed to the bone by one .
Have you ever noticed , gents , how when someone starts talking about how “ A real man would ” it ’s generally followed by you giving something ?
Rights , money , surrendering your career , your integrity , or your soul ?
Belly up to the bar , men , it ’s time to shed some more of that expendable Y - chromosome blood .
Bend over .
Here it comes again .
Bah .
Okay , let ’s talk about the “ Real Man . ”
The real man of myth keeps those rugged good looks , square jaw , and five O’clock shadow .
He grays gracefully , has those solid abs , and dresses to the nines .
He never , ever , smells of sweat .
He of course does this without being a “ Metrosexual .
” The real man is ambition and has purpose , but somehow always finds a way to put his family first .
But he keeps his well - paying job and moves ahead despite an insistence on going home early , passing on overtime ( mandatory or not ) , and not working weekends .
Even if it is in a job he hates , and is killing him by inches , the Real Man keeps a stiff upper lip and puts his nose to the grindstone because they Need The Money .
He never does anything risky like change careers , apply for the job he always wanted to do , or go into business for himself .
To do that would be Selfish and put his needs ahead of the Good Of The Family .
Things might become tight for a while , and that might stress her out .
The real man ’s woman does n’t have to work , does so only if she wants to , and keeps her money .
His money is “ ours ” and her money is “ hers .
” Even if the missus does n’t work , the real man comes home and commences with the housework , working side by side with his wife until it is all done .
He never forgets to throw his socks straight into the hamper , and if you would go into the bathroom you would swear he sat to pee .
Mrs. Realman is not a baby machine !
She has her 2.2 children , and the decision to have any more or less is hers , and hers alone , because it ’s her body .
The real man knows his place to stand by and support her , whatever her decision .
And if she leaves him , he sucks it up , because he obviously failed to be a real man .
As penance he pays any child support she requests , and butts out of “ interfering ” with her choices on how to raise the children , backing her to the hilt .
And if it turns out that Mr. Realman is not the father of the children , he sucks it up there too , even if Mrs. Exrealman takes up with the children ’s natural father , and his child support and alimony is supporting both of them .
The real man is sensitive .
After a hard day of brokering deals , being responsible for millions of dollars of goods and / or equipment , he lets
Her talk first , because the neighborhood gossip and the same soap opera she talks with her girlfriends all the time is much more important than anything he might have to say .
His day , after all , is only that of the draft horse putting a roof over the family ’s head and paying the bills .
The real man is a sexual dynamo .
He is ready at a moments notice to service his real woman ’s needs .
He is not premature .
He is never impotent .
He ’s not too tired , or stressed .
Even if the real woman has become so fat that they can only have sex in one or two positions , he ’s like a rutting goat , as he sees her inner beauty only .
Look at another woman ?
Perish the thought !
He of course understands that she likes to look , but would never regard that as disrespect because it ’s different .
Ever sensitive though , he never allows her to feel pressured into sex , because his needs , being mere male needs , are selfish , animal , and base .
When that promotion is offered which means almost a doubling of salary , Mr. Realman is careful about it !
Mrs. Realman might not want to move , because she ’d be away from friends who she feuds with on and off , and a mother she never goes to see but talks on the phone with for two hours a night even though they live a few scant blocks away .
Somehow he finds away to land that extra green without making Mrs. Realman leave her comfort zone .
The real man never expresses annoyance , irritation , or God Forbid , anger .
Such things disturb and scare the missus because he ’s so big and strong and might hurt her .
As a woman , her kind has been the victim of men for millennia , and even though she ’s always been treated like a princess by all the men in her life , he does n’t want to become an Insensitive Boor™ .
When something upsets Mrs. Realman , Mr. Realman dashes for the phone booth , changes into his tights and cape , and Does Something .
Since making a mess or engaging in a confrontation would upset Mrs. Realman further , and give Mrs. Noseybitch next door fodder for the gossip - mill , Mr. Realman uses his He - Man Super Powers with Mountain Fresh Scent™ to make everything right .
Huzzah !
Once more he saves the day !
Our Real Man is the paragon of Chivalry .
He is always deferential to the Woman because , well , because she ’s the woman .
He does this even when , nay , especially when she is wrong , and does n’t let a snarl of “ I can open my own door , I ’m not helpless ! ” deter him from doing it the next time , because she might change her mind , or that occasion might be “ different .
” Despite a hundred and two degree temperature and spitting blood , the Real Man does n’t complain , and still does the dishes because his missus has a cut on her finger and it stings .
To complain would be whining and the Real Man is NEVER a whiner !
Despite a case of the trots that leaves him running to the john every ten minutes , he gets up and makes his own tea and crackers because , as we all know , men are such babies .
He always asks for directions , even when he knows the route , because Mrs. Realman is out of her comfort zone , off the route she takes , and they are therefore lost .
The Real Man never turns off Oprah , but pulls up a seat and watches it with his missus , manfully choking back a tear .
He has that delicate balance down to a science , of getting those red rimmed eyes and the faintest hint of a lip quiver , but never actually cries about anything .
That would be sissified .
He also never watches sports or news which might bore or upset the missus .
Ever the romantic , the Real man always manages to Find A Way to bring the missus a dozen long stemmed roses because He Loves Her .
He does this spontaneously , but no less than once every two weeks .
Even if the flower shop is half an hour out of the way , he still manages to go there without leaving early and Losing His Job but never gets home late and makes her worry .
Despite bills being tight , new glasses for the son , new braces for the daughter , the variable rate going up on the mortgage , utility rates rising , and repairing the engine on Her Car , he manages to find the sixty to a hundred simoleans to do this .
A Real Man understands that traditionally women have been silenced , and therefore refrains for even mentioning something which might challenge her dearly held opinions , because such things are obviously personal attacks on her .
Whatever she says , it is met with a smile and a grave nod , as if it were an utterance by God .
Daily he exercises from his portfolio of He - Man Super Powers with Mountain Fresh Scent ™ the abilities of telepathy to know what is wrong with her ( Because if he loved her he ’d know ! ) and clairvoyance to omnisciently know every petty chore that needs to be done , and does them without asking .
After all , she constantly beams these things to him so he ’s been told a hundred times .
Honestly .
Men !
Any idiot can see that the blender he never uses is leaking !
And finally , when the feces has hit the fan , he proudly straps on his gun and dons his uniform to go be splattered on the landscape of some god - forsaken beach , desert , or jungle somewhere , to save civilization from the Baby Eating Foreign Devils .
He ’s the first to run into a burning building to haul out kittens , brave the dangers of the highway accident , and right all wrongs with manful use of his He - Man Super Powers with Mountain Fresh Scent™ .
And for all this , the Real woman does ….( sound of crickets ) Anyone ?
Hello ?
Beuller ?
Beuller ?
Cleans the house ?
No , that ’d be to turn her into a drudge .
Makes dinner ?
No , that ’s patriarchal and oppressive .
Bears his children ?
No , she ’s not a brood mare .
Manages the household finance ?
Oh , what was I thinking ?
Does she have to do everything ?
Shops ?
No , because if she has to go to the store , he ’s coming too .
Unless of course she ’s spending her hard earned money ( or her half of his ) for something nice for her because she never has anything for herself .
But that ’s different .
Hey , I know !
She ’s pleasant and loving and … no , wait .
She ’d have to repress her true self , and that ’s * HIS * job .
Gives up her career to – wait , that ’s not right either .
She stays loyal and faithful to him ?
No , there I go again .
Expecting women to just trudge along in the old “ Stand By Your Man ” routine even when he does n’t meet her needs and she feels unfulfilled , and is n’t swooning with romantic feelings 24 - 7 ?
Hmph .
I must remember though , that men stray because they are pigs , and women stray because men are pigs .
Takes care of the kids ?
Well , duh !
That ’s * ALWAYS * been the chore of women , EVERYONE knows that NO MAN has EVER changed a diaper , took kids to school , doctor ’s appointments , practices , sleepovers .
Jeez , might as well have married a babysitter !
Keep herself fit , sexy , and attractive ?
YOU ANIMAL !
Even if she does , she does it for herself , and not for you , you sex - obsessed PIG !!!
Refrains from correcting or berating him in pub – EXCUSE ME ?!?!
Are we living in a fascist state now where she ’s got to watch her mouth , and play June Cleaver to his Ward all the time ?
Well , it does n’t matter .
The Real Man does all this without expecting anything for it , because that ’s what a real man would do .
So , guys , join up today !
Become a Real Man™ and dedicate yourself to serving femininity , because otherwise you ’ll be a Meninist™ , and you do n’t want to get stuck with that label , do you ?
WHOTTA DEAL !!!!
Hm .
How ’s this again ?
On second thought , maybe the next time some whiney female pundit asks “ Where are the Real Men at ? ” I ’ll answer “ Hanging out with the Real Women .
And if they are n’t hanging out with you , you obviously are n’t one of those , are ya , toots ? ”
These new jeans may be a turning point in the evolution of pants .
It goes like this : first , baggy jeans came into style .
People bought big pants and let them sag .
Then , baggy pants slowly went out of style , and tight pants came into fashion .
But still — people missed their baggy pants .
Fast forward to this moment in time : a company called Soulful Commandoe has introduced jeans that are both tight and baggy at once .
This breakthrough was apparently achieved through the addition of several vertical inches of fabric in the waist area , as well as the inclusion of some gratuitous suspenders .
Truly a development that will go down in fashion history .

SHIFANG , China ( Reuters ) - China struggled on Friday to bury the dead and offer relief to those left injured , homeless and without food and water by the earthquake that may have killed more than 50,000 people .
From the heart of the disaster zone in the southwestern province of Sichuan , where the 7.9 magnitude quake struck on Monday , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao urged rescuers on , but hopes were fading for those still trapped under rubble .
“ Saving lives is still our top priority as long as hope of survival still exists , ” the official Xinhua news agency quoted Wen as saying .
About 20,000 are confirmed dead from the quake and at least another 25,000 remain buried .
In the Sichuan town of Yingxiu , where bodies were lined up along the river bank , a Communist Party official warned that epidemics could break out if bodies were not soon buried .
“ We are in urgent need of body bags , ” the official , Bai Licheng , told Xinhua .
“ Air - dropped food and drinking water are limited and far from meeting the demand , ” he added .
The Ministry of Health issued a notice ordering bodies to be cleaned where they were found and buried as soon as possible , far from water sources and downwind from populated areas .
More than 3,000 soldiers were racing the clock to search for survivors in Yingxiu , a township of about 6,600 people .
Bai said bodies were still trapped in the debris and blocked roads meant that heavy lifting gear could not get through .
China has mobilized 130,000 army and paramilitary troops to the disaster area , but the quake buckled roads and triggered mountain landslides , meaning that relief supplies and rescuers have struggled to reach the worst - hit areas .
EQUIPMENT AIRDROPPED
In the Sichuan city of Shifang , a small hospital struggled to cope with injured patients , who were being treated in any space available -- including a under a covered car park at the back of the building and under tents on the pavement .

Doctors and nurses rushed around , checking dressings , changing saline drips and administering to the wounded .
“ We ’ve seen nobody come here from the government , ” said one woman , tending to her injured son .
“ They ’re trying to help , but they ’ve been so busy , ” added a young man standing next to her .
“ In Mianzhu alone there ’s thousands dead , ” he said , referring to a nearby area .

In the epicenter , Wenchuan , Chinese air forces succeeded for the first time on Thursday in airdropping rescue equipment , Xinhua said , citing military sources .
Such airdrops had earlier been stymied by heavy rain and cloud cover .
The first foreign rescue team , a group from about 60 people from Japan , also reached Sichuan on Friday .
China has accepted further offers of rescue teams from Russia , South Korea and Singapore , the Foreign Ministry said .
The disaster was the deadliest since a 1976 earthquake hit the northeastern Chinese city of Tangshan , killing up to 300,000 people .
Pressed by the demands of the " global war on terrorism , " the United States is violating an international protocol that forbids the recruitment of children under the age of 18 for military service , according to a new report [ . pdf ] released Tuesday by a major civil rights group that charged that recruitment practices target children as young as 11 years old .
The 46 - page report , " Soldiers of Misfortune , " which was prepared by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) for submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child , also found that the U.S. military disproportionately targets poor and minority public school students .
Military recruiters , according to the report , use " exaggerated promises of financial rewards for enlistment , [ which ] undermines the voluntariness of their enlistment . "
In some cases documented by the report , recruiters used coercion , deception , and even sexual abuse in order to gain recruits .
Perpetrators of such practices are only very rarely punished , the report found .
" The United States military ’s procedures for recruiting students plainly violate internationally accepted standards and fail to protect youth from abusive and aggressive recruitment tactics , " said Jennifer Turner of the ACLU Human Rights Project .
The increased aggressiveness of military recruiters is due in major part , according to the report , to the increased pressure to meet enlistment quotas caused by ongoing U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to which nearly 200,000 soldiers and Marines are currently deployed .
The pressure created by current military commitments has not only translated into enhanced recruitment efforts among children under 18 .
The armed forces have also lowered their standards for minimum - intelligence tests , made it easier to enlist individuals with criminal records , and increased re-enlistment bonuses for soldiers who might otherwise be tempted to leave the service .
The report , which also detailed Washington ’s failure to protect foreign child soldiers being held by U.S. forces at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and elsewhere around the world as part of its submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child , assesses Washington ’s compliance with the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict .
The Protocol , which is attached to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is designed to protect the rights of children under 18 who may be recruited by the military and deployed to war .
Among other provisions , the Protocol sets an absolute minimum age for recruitment of 16 and requires that all recruitment activities directed at children under 18 be carried out with the consent of the child ’s parents or guardian , that any such recruitment be genuinely volunteer , and the military fully inform the child of the duties involved in military service and require reliable proof of age before enlistment .
While the United States is one of only two countries  the other being Somalia  to have never ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child , the U.S. Senate ratified the Protocol in 2002 , making it binding under U.S. , as well as international , law .
Unlike most other industrialized countries that set their minimum recruitment age at 18 , the Senate decided on 17 as the absolute minimum for the United States .
According to the ACLU report , however , the U.S. armed services " regularly target children under 17 for military recruitment , heavily recruiting on high school campuses , in school lunchrooms , and in classes . "
The army ’s own Recruiting Program Handbook , for example , instructs its more than 10,600 recruiters to approach high school students as early as possible , and explicitly before their senior year , which , for most students , starts at age 17 .
" Remember , first to contact , first to contract that does n’t just mean seniors or grads , " according to an excerpt quoted in the report .
" If you wait until they ’re seniors , it ’s probably too late . "
Once recruiters are inside their assigned high schools , the Army ’s Recruiting Command instructs them to " effectively penetrate the school market " and be " so helpful and so much a part of the school scene that you are in constant demand , " with the goal of " school ownership that can only lead to a greater number of Army enlistments . "
That includes volunteering to serve as coaches for high school sports teams , involvement with the local Boy Scouts , attending as many school functions and assemblies , and even " eating lunch in the school cafeteria several times each month . "
The report documents a number of specific cases , mostly in New York and California  the two most populous states with the largest number of minority high school students  in which recruiters clearly followed these instructions .
In a survey of nearly 1,000 children , aged 14 to 17 , enrolled in New York City high schools , the ACLU New York affiliate found that more than one five respondents  equally distributed among the different grades  reported the use of class time by military recruiters , and 35 percent said military recruiters had access to multiple locations in their schools where they could meet students .
The report also noted that the Pentagon ’s central recruitment database systematically collected information on 16 - year - olds and , in some cases even 15 - year - olds , including their name , home address and telephones , e-mail addresses , grade point averages , height and weight information , and racial and ethnic data obtained from a variety of public and private sources .
The explicit purpose of the database is to assist the military in its " direct marketing recruiting efforts . "
As the result of a 2006 ACLU lawsuit , the Pentagon agreed to stop collecting data about students younger than 16 .
But recruitment efforts even dip below 15 - year - olds , according to the report , which found that the Pentagon ’s Reserve Officer Training Corps ( JROTC ) , which operate at more than 3,000 junior high schools , middle schools , and high schools across the country , target children as young as 14 for recruitment .
The report cited recent studies that found that enrollment in some JROTC programs was involuntary .
JROTC " cadets , " of whom there were nearly 300,000 in 2005 , receive military uniforms and conduct military drills and marches , handle real and wooden rifles , and learn military history , according to the report , which noted that the program is explicitly designed to " enhance recruiting efforts . "
African American and Latin students make up 54 percent of JROTC programs .
JROTC also oversees the Middle School Cadet Corps ( MSCC ) , in which children ages 11 to 14 can participate , according to the report .
Florida , Texas , and Chicago schools offer military - run after - school MSCC programs in which children take part in drills with wooden rifles and military chants , learn first - aid , civics , military history , and , in some cases , wear uniforms to school for inspection once a week .
The Army also uses an online video game , called " America ’s Army , " to attract potential recruits as young as 13 , train them to use weapons , and engage in virtual combat and other military missions .
Launched in 2002 , the video game had attracted 7.5 million registered users by September 2006 .
" Military recruitment tools aimed at youth under 18 , including Pentagon - produced video games , military training , corps , and databases of students ’ personal information , have no place in America ’s schools , " said Turner .

NEW BRUNSWICK , N.J. - A consortium spearheaded by Rutgers has been awarded $ 42.5 million over five years to create one of two academic groups that will form the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine ( AFIRM ) .
The Rutgers - led collaboration will be headed by Joachim Kohn , Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology in Rutgers ' School of Arts and Sciences , and George Muschler , an orthopedic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic , Rutgers ' principal partner in this undertaking .
A second consortium will be managed by Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh with another $ 42.5 million in funding .
The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command ( USAMRMC ) , in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research , the National Institutes of Health , the Air Force Office of the Surgeon General and the Department of Veterans Affairs will fund the two consortia .
The use of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) in Iraq and Afghanistan has caused a marked increase in severe blast trauma , now responsible for approximately 75 percent of all injuries , according to the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma .
Better body armor , quicker evacuation from the battlefield and advanced medical care have made it possible for injured soldiers to survive in greater numbers than in the past .
They face the challenge of overcoming severe limb , head , face and burn injuries that can take years to treat and usually result in significant lifelong impairment .
The new institute is a strong national effort to address the unprecedented challenges of caring for men and women returning from Afghanistan and Iraq with multiple traumatic injuries .
" Our foremost goal is to alleviate the human suffering associated with debilitating blast injuries and to enable our injured people to return to productive lives , " Kohn said .
AFIRM will develop new products and therapies for the repair of battlefield injuries through the use of regenerative medicine .
This innovative approach employs biological therapy , including stem cells and growth factors ; tissue and biomaterials engineering ; and transplants to enable the body to repair , replace , restore and regenerate damaged tissues and organs .
The institute also will dramatically accelerate the rate at which promising biomaterials as well as cell - based and combined regenerative medicine technologies will be converted into new therapies to restore lost tissue and lost function .
These products and therapies also will serve civilian trauma and burn patients .
Biomaterials will play a crucial role in developing new therapies for regenerating tissue and healing large wounds .
The Rutgers team , with its strength in biomaterials science , has embarked on creating new methods to identify unique biomaterials compositions tailored to support the growth of new nerves , blood vessels , skin , bone or muscle .
The team has pioneered the approach of creating libraries of hundreds of new biomaterials allowing the researchers to discover the best choices for specific medical indications .
Once identified , the new biomaterials will be distributed to other AFIRM team members for the development of new clinical applications .
The Rutgers approach is based on using experimental screening assays in combination with computational modeling .
The Rutgers group will work closely with its Massachusetts Institute of Technology partners who are developing complementary methods of screening large biomaterials libraries for specific properties .
Rutgers research and management activities associated with the institute will receive approximately $ 1.7 million per year , supplemented over the first two years by $ 400,000 from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology to be matched with another $ 400,000 by the university .
" The Rutgers community welcomes the opportunity to take a leadership role in this important pursuit , " said Rutgers President Richard L. McCormick .
" What we do here will produce a durable and adaptable resource for the development and advancement of regenerative therapies for injured military personnel as well as civilian victims of trauma . "
" The Cleveland Clinic with Rutgers , and our entire AFIRM team , is deeply committed to offering new recovery options for the brave men and women who have served our country , " Muschler said .
" Our mission , through combined effort , is to translate opportunities that are now available in regenerative biology , as rapidly as possible , into practical tools that can be used on the front lines or here at home . "
The Rutgers - led component of the institute will be based on a highly integrated , open network of dedicated partners comprising 15 premier academic institutions and more than 20 leading companies .
In addition to the Rutgers and the Wake Forest - based groups , there will be a third component .
The U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research in San Antonio , Texas , will work with the two academic consortia to provide guidance on military medical needs and hosting trials of new therapies .
" New Jersey is the ideal center for the AFIRM research and development effort .
We are the home of the global pharmaceutical industry , have a strong concentration of medical device companies and are one of the first states to promote and fund a broad spectrum of stem cell research initiatives , " New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine wrote in a letter .
" The conception of AFIRM as a partnership between military and civilian academic institutions is a groundbreaking idea for which I commend the USAMRMC . "
Most of the partners in the Rutgers - led consortium have been professional colleagues for years with longstanding collaborations .
The open network approach ensures that the most qualified experts and performance sites , irrespective of their institutional affiliation or geographic location , will be within reach .
An executive committee headed by Kohn and Muschler will direct the research programs of the geographically dispersed network of leading academic research scientists and clinicians , industrial scientists and business managers , and military medical experts .
###
The core academic partners are : the New Jersey Center for Biomaterials at Rutgers University , the National Center for Regenerative Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic , Case Western Reserve University , University Hospitals Case Medical Center , Carnegie Mellon University , Stony Brook University , Dartmouth College , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School , the Mayo Clinic , Northwestern University , University of Cincinnati , University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey , University of Pennsylvania , University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University .
These core partners are supported by a large number of industrial collaborators and participating health care companies that have expressed an interest in the commercialization of new products and therapies emerging from institute 's research program .
Established in 1766 , Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey , is America 's eighth oldest institution of higher learning and one of the nation 's premier public research universities .
Serving more than 50,000 students on campuses in Camden , Newark and New Brunswick , Rutgers offers more than 280 bachelor 's , master 's , doctoral and professional degree programs .
The university is home to 27 degree - granting schools and colleges , and more than 150 specialized centers and institutes .
That visit was the beginning of a more aggressive effort by the administration to pressure Pakistan ’s government into stepping up its fight .
The decision last year to draw up the Pentagon order authorizing for a Special Operations campaign in the tribal areas was part of that effort .
But the fact that the order remains unsigned reflects the infighting that persists .
Administration lawyers and State Department officials are concerned about any new authorities that would allow military missions to be launched without the approval of the American ambassador in Islamabad .
With Qaeda operatives now described in intelligence reports as deeply entrenched in the tribal areas and immersed in the civilian population , there is also a view among some military and C.I.A. officials that the opportunity for decisive American action against the militants may have been lost .
Pakistani military officials , meanwhile , express growing frustration with the American pressure , and point out that Pakistan has lost more than 1,000 members of its security forces in the tribal areas since 2001 , nearly double the number of Americans killed in Afghanistan .
Some architects of America ’s efforts in Pakistan defend the Bush administration ’s record in the tribal areas , and vigorously deny that Washington took its eye off the terrorist threat as it focused on Iraq policy .
Some also question whether Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri , Al Qaeda ’s top two leaders , are really still able to orchestrate large - scale attacks .
“ I do wonder if it ’s in fact the case that Al Qaeda has really reconstituted itself to a pre-9/11 capability , and in fact I would say I seriously doubt that , ” said Mr. Crocker , the American ambassador to Pakistan between 2004 and 2006 and currently the ambassador to Iraq .
“ Their top - level leadership is still out there , but they ’re not communicating and they ’re not moving around .
I think they ’re symbolic more than operationally effective , ” Mr. Crocker said .
But while Mr. Bush vowed early on that Mr. bin Laden would be captured “ dead or alive , ” the moment in late 2001 when Mr. bin Laden and his followers escaped at Tora Bora was almost certainly the last time the Qaeda leader was in American sights , current and former intelligence officials say .
Leading terrorism experts have warned that it is only a matter of time before a major terrorist attack planned in the mountains of Pakistan is carried out on American soil .

Upcoming JEC hearing on costs of US drug policy
According to this webpage at FAMM , later this week " Senator Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) will convene a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee ( JEC ) to examine the economic consequences of the United States ' drug policy . "
Here are more details :
The hearing , entitled “ U.S. Drug Policy : At What Cost ? ” will be held Thursday , June 19 .
The panel will discuss the illegal drug economy in the United States , assess the costs of U.S. policy responses to combatting drug use and address the need for policy reforms .
The hearing is also likely to address , to some extent , mandatory minimums and sentencing issues .
This page at Stop the Drug War lists expected witnesses , though I cannot yet find any official notice of the scheduled hearing .
As noted in prior posts linked below , last year Senator Webb convened a JEC hearing on the costs of mass incarceration .
It is principally for this reason that I have been excited by the prospect of Senator Webb being on a presidential ticket .

Webb would be a great choice .
He 's Obamas intellectual equal and an innovative thinker .
It would be so good to say good - by to polemics .

Our drug policy began with the perjured testimony of Harry Anslinger before Congress .
It 's based on perjury , no reason to believe it wo n't be perpetuated through perjury .
After all , drugs are bad , mmmmmkay .
And what 's a little perjury to save TPC ?
TPC always comes first .
If we have to lie to show drugs are bad , then we 'll do it - otherwise facts might get in the way of showing drugs are bad .
And then TPC will be endangered .

SPRINGFIELD , Mo.  Senator John McCain said Wednesday that he wanted 45 new nuclear reactors to be built in the United States by 2030 , a goal that he called “ as difficult as it is necessary . ”
In his third straight day of campaign speechmaking about energy and $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline , the presumptive Republican nominee told the crowd at a town hall - style meeting at Missouri State University that he saw nuclear power as a clean , safe alternative to conventional sources of energy that emit greenhouse gases .
He said his ultimate goal was 100 new nuclear plants .
Mr. McCain has long promoted nuclear reactors , but Wednesday was the first time that he specified the number of plants he envisioned .
Currently , there are 104 reactors in the country supplying some 20 percent of the electricity consumed .
No new nuclear power plant has been built in the United States since the 1970s .
“ China , Russia and India are all planning to build more than a hundred new power plants among them in the coming decades , ” Mr. McCain said in this pocket of Missouri that is reliably Republican .
“ Across Europe , there are 197 reactors in operation , and nations including France and Belgium derive more than half their electricity from nuclear power .
And if all of these nations can find a way to carry out great goals in energy policy , then I assure you that the United States is more than equal to the challenge . ”
An issue with how the Service Pack 3 update handles AMD chips will cause some Windows XP computers to continuously reboot .
Microsoft says it is investigating , and provided removal instructions for those having problems .
The issues come in two forms :
The first affects some systems with AMD chips and OEM XP images , while the other seems to affect certain AMD motherboards .
Microsoft is looking into the problem and said it will advise when it has a solution .
There is a chance that the first issue could occur on some Intel machines as well .
This is due to the same image being used on that machine , which is actually more the manufacturer 's error than it is Microsoft's .
Advertisement
At the heart is likely the power management system file , intelppm.sys .
Some of these OEM images may be shipping with both the AMD version , amdk8.sys , alongside the Intel file -- which Microsoft says is an unsupported configuration .
Some users experienced similar problems when SP2 was released , so this could be the problem .
If the user sees a stop error code of 0x0000007e , this first issue is likely the reason why the computer does not boot properly .
The second issue will only occur on systems with certain AMD motherboards .
This error manifests itself with an error code of STOP : 0x000000A5 .
It is unknown how to fix this problem other than by installing a USB storage device , or even possibly removing a USB mouse and replacing it with a PS / 2 port compatible version .
If that is not enough , Microsoft MVP Jesper Johansson reports that there seems to be a third , less common problem with SP3 computers , this time on Intel .
Some may receive a 0x00000024 stop error , which he believes may be due to an issue with either the NTFS file system being corrupted , or a faulty video driver .
Johansson has listed several solutions to these problems on his blog .
Another option may be to remove the service pack altogether , an issue upon which Microsoft has posted an advisory .
NEW YORK–As the United States continues its long manhunt for Osama bin Laden , victims of Sept. 11 are in the midst of their own bin Laden pursuit : for his family 's vast fortune .
Victims and survivors of the 2001 attack and insurance companies say the bin Laden family failed to cut off ties with their infamous relative after learning he was devising terrorism plots and should be held liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages .
Lawyers for the victims and survivors argued Thursday that the family members are getting off easy in defending against the claims that they turned a blind eye to his evil ways after learning of his terroristic leanings in 1993 .
The lawyers asked a judge in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to let them seek more information to prove their claim .
Their lawsuit targets the Saudi Binladin Group , along with numerous banks , charities and individuals worldwide , alleging that they provided material support and assistance to Al Qaeda before Sept. 11 .
The Saudi Binladin Group is a construction and engineering company that has expansive holdings in the Middle East .
Osama bin Laden once owned a small stake in the company .
The victims and survivors suffered a setback last month when U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas turned down many of the requests for more information about the financial ties between bin Laden and his family , saying , in essence , that the plaintiffs had become petty in their requests .
Lawyers for the Saudi Binladin Group have said in court papers that bin Laden 's 2 per cent shares in the company and another firm , the Mohammad Binladin Co. , were sold in June 1993 and put into a trust .
The judge issued his findings on May 21 , giving the Saudi Binladin Group one month to produce documents that would show the receipt and subsequent disposition of any dividends , distributions or similar payments arising out of bin Laden 's shares of the company between 1993 and 2000 .
But he said he believed discovery in the case " must have boundaries , " especially given the lengthy amount of time it had taken the case to proceed .
Further requests would likely be denied unless there are " truly exceptional circumstances , " he wrote .
" Simply put , we are reaching the end of the line . ''
The lawyers for Sept. 11 victims cited a 1997 interview in which bin Laden briefly discussed nine visits by his family , including his mother , an uncle and several brothers .
The lawyers said the interview showed that the relationship between bin Laden and his family was cordial , " implying that representatives of his family remained sympathetic to his situation and mission after 1993 . ''
In their own court papers , lawyers for the Saudi Binladin Group had accused the plaintiffs of " wishful thinking " and " wild speculation . ''
The lawyers said the Saudi Binladin Group had helped the United States , building the air base from which U.S. forces operated during the first Gulf War .
The Sept. 11 commission also concluded that the Sudanese government seized bin Laden assets when he left the Sudan in 1996 .
As to his shares or the proceeds of them , the lawyers wrote : ``Osama bin Laden never received any buyout payment and has never had access to these funds . ''
The buzz at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston this May was a debate about Goldman Sachs analysts ’ forecast that oil would reach $ 200 within the next two years .
Matt Simmons , founder of energy investment - banking firm Simmons & Co. International Inc. and a known peakist ( i.e. is a leader among the “ Peak Oil ” theorists ) , added at OTC that oil could go to $ 300 .
“ Do we really believe this … ? ” asks James DiGeorgia , author of The Global War for Oil .
“ And , if so , why ?
And , how can investors profit from the rise in oil ( prices ) ? "
Well , he says , “ Goldman Sachs is dead wrong in its energy - research report that stated that the rise in prices is n’t motivated by speculators or the weak dollar .
" Specifically , volume in the oil ETF USO is about 17 million shares the last few days and would mean a total value traded is about $ 1.7 billion — 17 million shares traded times $ 102 USO current price .
The net asset value of USO is about $ 650 million .
This means the ETF traded ownership 1.5 times during one day — this is speculation , not investing . ”
He does expect oil prices to grow , however .
Here are some reasons : --
“ Increased demand from investors and speculators . ” --
“ The summer - vacation season starts soon and energy demand normally picks up . ” --
“ The hurricane season will also start soon .
Oil prices will continue to be firm once news of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico begins . ” --
“ Nigeria : Terrorist attacks , political problems and strikes have been issues for this important producer now and for the past few years . ” --
“ Venezuela : Last week , there was talk that the U.S. may impose sanctions on Venezuela because of U.S. intelligence reports that Chavez helped Colombian rebels .
This news sparked the energy markets on Friday . ” --
“ High short interest : Speculators have been shorting oil , causing short squeezes , buying to cover their short positions . ” --
“ New highs :
When prices hit new highs , it 's very easy for prices to continue to make new highs because of the lack of supply , and because of resistance and sellers . ” -- “ OPEC : In the past , OPEC has expressed concerns about high oil prices .
Their main concern was the impact high oil prices would have on the world economy and the demand for energy .
Lately , the news out of OPEC is that they will not increase production because , according to it , the current high prices are due to speculation .
There is speculation that , even if OPEC wanted to increase production , it is at maximum production capacity and can't . ”

As the credit crisis teeters on the verge of full - blown catastrophe , the hunt for the culprit (s ) begins .
Quickly working his way to the top of the blame table is Alan Greenspan , former Chairman of the Board of Governors at the US Federal Reserve Bank .
During his tenure and even into retirement , Dr. Greenspan received near - universal praise for presiding over the Fed during a record period of economic growth and price stability .
In fact , he coined the term Goldilocks economy to describe the optimal economic situation in which growth is maximized and inflation is kept to a minimum .
Recently , public opinion has begun to turn on Dr. Greenspan for his perceived role in the current economic crisis .
The extended period of easy money over which he presided , combined with his laissez - faire approach to regulation have been identified as two chief causes behind the inflation and subsequent collapse of the housing bubble .
In the interest of truth ( to preserve his legacy , say cynics ) , Dr. Greenspan has embarked on a media tour , defending his policies and his ideology .
Ultimately , the onerous task of sorting out the causes of the credit crunch will be left to economic historians , but that does n’t prevent us from scrutinizing the facts and coming to our own conclusions here in the present .
Low Interest Rates : Precipitated by the bursting of the technology bubble and exacerbated by the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the US economy slid into a recession that lasted for two years .
The Fed , under the leadership of Dr. Greenspan , moved quickly to slash its bechmark Federal Funds Rate to 1 % , the lowest level in nearly 50 years .
At the time , Dr. Greenspan was acclaimed by economists for mitigating business cycle volatility and returning the economy back into a period of rapid growth .
In hindsight , however , this period of easy money may have enabled the run-up in housing prices that caused the current housing crisis .
According to a paper published by the European Central Bank , the Fed kept rates too low for too long .
According to the paper , there exists a theoretical natural rate of interest , which " keeps output at its potential and inflation stable , once any shocks to the economy have played out . "
Witness the connection to Dr. Greenspan ’s pursuit of the Goldilocks economy !
The ECB used a sequential monte carlo algorithm to simulate the post - 9/11 deteriorating economic conditions and the Fed ’s subsequent response .
Ultimately , it determined that 1 % was below the natural cost of capital , and households were able to borrow at rates which failed to properly account for their creditworthiness - or lack thereof .
It is ironic that the Fed ’s response to the 2001 recession ( which , itself was caused by the collapse of an asset bubble ) was to facilitate another asset bubble – this time in housing – which , in turn , may precipitate yet another recession .
Weak Dollar :
The excessive easing of monetary policy from 2001 to 2003 yielded an unintended consequence : a weakening of the US Dollar .
The Euro was already gaining acceptance , and a rising interest rate differential provided the necessary impetus for the Euro to surpass the Dollar , once and for all .
As a result , oil prices , which are denominated in Dollars , have risen as the Dollar as fallen .
A weaker Dollar has also made foreign imports more expensive for a nation that imports $ 800 Billion more than it exports .
As a result , inflation is slowly creeping up ; at 4 % , it is certainly past the Fed ’s comfort zone and is preventing the Fed from adequately responding to the current crisis .
In the words of one analyst , " the Fed took a gamble on inflation to ward off what was perceived as a deflationary threat in 2001 - 02 .
The inflationary consequences of that gamble are now here , with the petrodollar monetary merry - go - round fueled by the weaker dollar . "
Even Dr. Greenspan believes that it ’s " absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the dollar as reserve currency , or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency . "
Loose Regulation : Many critics charge that in addition to low interest rates , loose regulation represents one of the smoking guns behind ( the Fed under ) Dr. Greenspan ’s culpability .
The former Chairman is well known for his laissez - faire approach to government regulation , his commitment to which comes across as doctrinaire and ideological .
He has insisted that a loose regulatory framework is essential to a dynamic and growing economy , and has argued that " counterparty surveillance " is much more effective than government regulation .
With regard to the housing crisis , the Fed ’s regulatory failings fall under two subheadings : predatory lending and inadequate collateral .
On the first point , the 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act " gave the Fed authority to monitor abuses and step in , if necessary , to restrict or stop lenders and their practices . "
Unfortunately , the Fed largely failed to take advantage of its newfound power .
Credit rating agencies , charged with certifying that the repackaged mortgages were indeed investment - grade , were shocked to discover that some of the mortgage applications lacked even basic contact information for borrowers .
In other cases , the borrower ’s income was n’t confirmed , such that it would be impossible for the counterparties – the loan officers that Dr. Greenspan insisted were most capable of regulating the system – to evaluate whether a particular mortgage was appropriate for a given borrower .
Thus , over $ 250 Billion of worthless mortgages have already been written down ( declared worthless ) since the start of the credit crunch .
If lenders had been properly regulated from the start , then perhaps most of these mortgages never would have been extended .
The second point applies to the inability of the financial system to absorb the shock from the unexpectedly high default rate on subprime loans .
This failure to anticipate can be traced back to 1998 , if not earlier , when the Federal Reserve spearheaded a bailout of Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) , a large hedge fund which lost nearly $ 5 Billion trading complex securities .
Some would say that this created a moral hazard situation , whereby banks became comfortable taking larger risks because of the foreknowledge that they would be bailed out if their bets went sour .
Sure enough , the current credit crunch was fueled by even riskier practices in the financial sector , whereby mortgages were repackaged into increasingly esoteric securities , held off - balance sheet for tax purposes .
In sum , " there was nothing done to head off more such failures …
The result a decade later has been the need for another , even more dramatic , bailout . "
Thus , the Fed found itself orchestrating an 11th hour sale of Bear Stearns , a near - bankrupt investment bank , to JP Morgan .
While this was the only debacle that required the Fed ’s assistance , most large investment banks have accepted large cash infusions , due to the Fed ’s low collateral requirements .
Dr. Greenspan ’s response to these accusations has been uninspiring , arguing that the Fed probably could have done more , but not enough to avert the credit crunch .
He has clung to the notion that the markets can police themselves more effectively then the government could ever hope to .
According to Naked Capitalism , " the biggest problem with Dr. Greenspan ’s posture is that he fails to accept the rationale for regulation .
Banking is an industry that can create enormous externalities , namely , financial panics , asset bubbles ( which suck investment out of more productive uses ) and busts .
Even a mere nasty credit contraction exacts a toll on the real economy . "
It is no wonder that the government ’s official response to the current crisis has been to cut out , rather than impose more , regulations .
Indifference to Asset Bubbles : During the height of the dot - com stock market bubble , Dr. Greenspan famously cautioned against " irrational exuberance . "
For an encore , why then did he willingly enable another bubble to form ?
Under Dr. Greenspan , the Fed became famous for its asymmetric response to asset bubbles , whereby the bursting of a bubble was softened by rate cuts , but the bubbles ’ inflation was not dealt with through countervailing rate hikes .
In this way , investors were encouraged to take larger risks , knowing that if / when the bubble (s ) did burst , the Fed would ease monetary policy to cushion the fall .
Dr. Greenspan was unbending in his defense of this policy , arguing that the Fed ’s job is to deal with economic growth and inflation , rather than to influence asset prices .
It is not as though Dr. Greenspan was unaware that a bubble was forming .
In testifying before the US Congress in 2005 , he , himself , commented that " signs of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels . "
Even the IMF delicately offered that " some ‘ leaning against the wind ’ may also prove useful to limit the risk of a buildup of housing market and financial imbalances . "
In Dr. Greenspan ’s defense , it is not clear that a more " symmetric " response to the inflation of the housing bubble would have produced a different outcome .
This is because short - term rates , which the Fed controls , have slowly become disentangled from long - term rates ( which the Fed does not control ) , such that the Fed cannot effectively set the risk premium that is built into mortgage rates .
Greenspeak : Dr. Greenspan was famous for his abstruse way of communicating with investors , policymakers , and the news media , which has been nicknamed " Greenspeak . "
For example , the testimony listed above also included the following nugget of wisdom : " to the extent that some households may be employing these instruments to purchase a home that would otherwise be unaffordable , their use is beginning to add to the pressures in the marketplace . "
Dr. Greenspan claimed the ambiguity was deliberate , as it allowed him the flexibility necessary to zig and zag when conducting monetary policy for the world ’s most dynamic economy .
On one occasion , he poked fun at himself , suggesting to policymakers that " if I say something which you understand fully … I probably made a mistake . "
In hindsight , however , perhaps a little more clarity would have behooved the Chairman in communicated the long - term risks inherent in the housing bubble .
ARM Recommendation :
In a 2004 speech which has since reverberated around cyberspace , Dr. Greenspan offered the following piece of advice : " American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage . "
He also intimated that borrowers would benefit by using adjustable rate mortgages instead of fixed rate mortgages , although in the same breath , warned that this benefit would not inure to homeowners in a rising interest rate environment .
This comment speaks to one of the key trends underlying the housing bubble : the proliferation of esoteric mortgage products .
Adjustable - rate mortgages became especially problematic as the Fed began tightening in 2005 , and many investors were unable to adjust to rising interest payments .
When housing prices reversed course and began to decline , many investors were shocked to discover that their mortgages had also reversed , such that their equity was now negative .
Dr. Greenspan ’s de facto endorsement of complex mortgages products , such as those of the " interest only " and " pick a payment " variety , paved the way for the the millions of defaults on subprime mortgages that ensued .
Dr. Greenspan ’s ideology has been a recurrent theme throughout this article .
Those familiar with the former Chairman ’s background should recall that he was an early admirer of Ayn Rand , a prominent novelist , whose works read like expositions on free - market economics .
In addition , Dr. Greenspan was appointed by a Republican president , Ronald Reagan .
Some degree of bias is to be expected , even accepted , and the fact that Dr. Greenspan was a staunch defender of free - market principles need not have precluded him from managing an institution which is supposed to be apolitical .
Unfortunately , the story painted above suggests that Dr. Greenspan allowed his ideology to infuse his job .
Ironically , the man famous for ambiguous " Greenspeak " was often deliberately unambiguous when opining on taxes , regulation , and other issues of policy .
Two years removed from his position , Dr. Greenspan has argued dogmatically that increased regulation and an earlier tightening of monetary policy would not have prevented the housing bubble .
According to an interview with the Wall Street Journal , " Mr. Greenspan says he does n’t regret a single decision .
In his view , many critics are ignoring evidence in his favor and failing to assess the process by which he made decisions . "
He insists that his comments on ARMs were taken out of context and that the people most qualified to police mortgage lenders are …. mortgage lenders , themselves .
Suffice it to say that if he is ultimately found guilty on the charge of inciting the current housing bubble , Dr. Greenspan will probably lodge an appeal .
Montgomery was banned from athletics US sprinter Tim Montgomery has been jailed for 46 months for his part in a multi-million dollar bank fraud and money - laundering plot .
The ex-100 m world record holder and Olympic relay champion pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges over a bogus cheque scam in April 2007 .
His former partner - the sprinter Marion Jones - was also implicated in the crime .
Montgomery sought leniency , saying his fall from grace was punishment enough .
Being a track star does not somehow disable someone from saying no
Judge Kenneth Karas
" I stood at the top of the mountain and heard the cheers from the people , " he said .
" In jail , my status is gone .
I am just as human as everyone else . "
' Tough day '
But New York Judge Kenneth Karas gave Montgomery the maximum sentence available , urging him to think about the impact of his activities on his children .
" Being a track star does not somehow disable someone from saying no , " he said , quoted by the Associated Press news agency .
" I know this is a tough day for you .
Think about those kids - that 's what 's going to help you say no next time . "
Prosecutors say Montgomery had a hand in depositing bogus cheques worth $ 1.7 m .
His former partner Marion Jones - also once a darling of the sports world - is already serving a prison sentence for lying about her knowledge of the fraud affair and her use of performance - enhancing drugs .
Montgomery , 33 , was banned from athletics three years ago after he was found to have used steroids .
That ban also saw him stripped of his 100 m world record title which he won in 2002 .
But the BBC's Matthew Price in New York says the sentencing does not spell the end of the controversy surrounding him .
In July he faces charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin .

Melanoma can be fatal Scientists claim they have cured advanced skin cancer for the first time using the patient 's own cells cloned outside the body .
The 52 - year - old man involved was free of melanoma two years after treatment .
US researchers , reports the New England Journal of Medicine , took cancer - fighting immune cells , made five billion copies , then put them all back .
Scientists in the UK warned that further trials would need to be done to prove how well the treatment worked .
This is another interesting demonstration of the huge power of the immune system to fight some types of cancer
Spokesman
Cancer Research UK
The body 's immune system plays a significant role in the battle against cancer , and doctors have been looking for ways to boost this tumour - killing response .
The 52 - year - old man had advanced melanoma which had spread to the lungs and lymph nodes .
Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle concentrated on a type of immune system cell called a CD4 +
T cell .

From a sample of the man 's white blood cells , they were able to select CD4 +
T cells which had been specifically primed to attack a chemical found on the surface of melanoma cells .
These were then multiplied in the laboratory , and put back in their billions to see if they could mount an effective attack on the tumours .
Two months later , scans showed the tumours had disappeared , and after two years , the man remained disease - free .
The new cells persisted in the body for months after the treatment .
' Immune power '
While claiming this as a world first , the study authors pointed out that their technique applied only to a patient with a particular type of immune system and tumour type , and could work for only a small percentage of people with advanced skin cancer .
Patients will live with their cancer , and die with their cancer , but not of their cancer - it will be like diabetes today
Professor Karol Sikora
Imperial College London Dr Cassian
Yee , who led the project , said : " For this patient we were successful , but we would need to confirm the effectiveness of therapy in a larger study . "
Professor Karol Sikora , a cancer expert at Imperial College in London , described the research as " pretty exciting " with potentially wide application .
He said the researchers had focused on melanoma because the disease was well understood compared with other cancers , but other cancers could potentially be targeted .
He said : " I think we will be able to harness the power of the immune system .
Eventually we will learn how to control cancer , in other words we will suppress it .
" Patients will live with their cancer , and die with their cancer , but not of their cancer - it will be like diabetes today . "
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK also said more research would be needed , adding : " This is another interesting demonstration of the huge power of the immune system to fight some types of cancer .
" Although the technique is complex and difficult to use for all but a few patients , the principle that someone 's own immune cells can be expanded and made to work in this way is very encouraging for the work that ourselves and others are carrying out in this field . "

Pakistan May Turn Over U.S. ' Spies ' to Iran Iran says Jundullah militants , led by Abdel Malik Regi , are " spies " for the CIA .
May 23 , 2008  --
In another sign of growing tensions with the United States , Pakistan is threatening to turn over to Iran six members of a tribal militant group Iran claims are " spies " for the CIA .
The group , Jundullah , operates in Baluchistan on both sides of the border between Iran and Pakistan and has carried out a number of violent attacks on Iranian army facilities and officers inside the country .
The CIA has denied any direct ties with the group , but U.S. officials tell ABC News U.S. intelligence officers frequently meet and advise Jundullah leaders , and current and former intelligence officers are working to prevent the men from being sent to Iran .
The six Jundullah members were taken into custody by Pakistani authorities last week , and the Iranian Mehr News Agency reported Pakistan would soon extradite the men to Iran , where they would likely be put on trial as spies and face execution .
Officials said the group 's leader , Abdel Malik Regi , was not among those arrested by Pakistan .
U.S. intelligence officials say they are aware of the developments with the Jundullah members and are said to be trying to block the extradition .
In addition to causing turmoil in Iran , the officials say the group has been helpful in tracking al Qaeda figures trying to move through the Baluchistan region to Iran .
" The new Pakistan leaders have said they are going to do it , but they are saying a lot of things and trying to make a lot of deals , " said one U.S. official .
" If they are seeking stability inside the country , why would they want to inflame people in this region ? " the official asked .
Iranian officials claimed this week that the U.S. had " a hand " in an April 12 bomb attack at a mosque in Shiraz that killed 14 people , according to Mehr News Agency , quoting Iranian Intelligence Minister Gholam - Hossein Mohseni Ejei .
" The U.S. is behind many events in Iran and the region with the aim of bringing insecurity , " the intelligence minister reportedly said .
" We have proper documentations in this regard , " the minister told the news agency 's reporters .
A senior U.S. official said Iran 's claims " are nonsense , ludicrous . "
The capture of the Jundullah members is seen by intelligence sources in the region as another indication that Pakistan 's new government is distancing itself from the U.S. and U.S. intelligence operations in the country .
Other such steps by Pakistan in recent days include an accord between Pakistan 's government and militant tribal leaders in the country 's Swat Valley region where Taliban figures are believed to be hiding .
Increasingly , U.S. sources say , Pakistan is effectively handcuffing U.S. ground efforts against al Qaeda in the border region and emboldening the Taliban .

New Zealand ’s Northern Advocate reports that a US $ 402 million ( NZ $ 600 m ) proposal to generate electricity with 200 tidal - powered turbines submerged at the entrance to the Kaipara Harbour could get under way next year .
The harbour is one of the largest in the world .
It ’s a broad shallow harbour covering an area of over three hundred square miles and has more than two thousand miles of shoreline .
It has a two and a half mile wide entrance to the Tasman Sea halfway along its length .
Although officially called a harbour , the Kaipara is rarely used for shipping , owing to the treacherous tides and bars at its mouth .
For this reason , no large settlements lie close to its shores , although small communities dot its coastline .
Crest Energy has applied to the Northland Regional Council for resource consent to set the 22 m - tall turbines on the seafloor along about 8 km of the 30 m deep main channel at the harbour entrance .
The tidal energy is expected to get the turbines generating 200 megawatts of power - enough for 250,000 homes .
The turbines , shielded from fish , would sit on heavy concrete pylons and be at least 5 m from the surface at low tide .
Leisure craft and barges could pass over them , but would be restricted from anchoring in the turbine area .
Two 30 km - long cables 125 mm in diameter would feed electricity into the national grid .
Crest Energy claims the size and commercial scale of the Kaipara project would make it the largest of its kind in the world .
If the project gets the green light , possibly around the middle of next year , the company plans to raise about $ 50 million to begin building turbines .

It ’s not working , much to the displeasure of the Boston cops .
“ Boston police officials , surprised by intense opposition from residents , have significantly scaled back and delayed the start of a program that would allow officers to go into people ’s homes and search for guns without a warrant , ” reports the Boston Globe .
“ The program , dubbed Safe Homes , was supposed to start in December , but has been delayed at least three times because of misgivings in the community .
March 1 was the latest missed start date . ”
It should be dubbed homes outside the purview of the Fourth Amendment .
But thankfully some residents and community groups have a handle on the scheme , designed to get people accustomed to surrendering their liberty .
“ One community group has been circulating a petition against the plan .
Police officials trying to assuage residents ’ fears have been drowned out by criticism at some meetings with residents and elected officials . ”
“ Police would ask parents or legal guardians for permission to search homes where juveniles ages 17 and under are believed to be holding illegal guns , ” the Globe continues .
“ Police would only enter homes into which they have been invited and , once inside , would only search the rooms of the juveniles . ”
Bostonians are not buying it , though .
It is not so much the flimsy rules about what is to be searched .
It is rather the very idea of allowing police to enter without justification coupled with a search warrant issued by a judge .
Meanwhile , in the District of Criminals , the cops are having difficulty with an anti-Fourth Amendment scheme of their own .
“ D.C. police are going door - to - door Monday in one of the city ’s crime - plagued neighborhoods , asking residents for permission to search their homes for guns and other illegal contraband , ” reports ABC News 7 .
“ The program , called the Safe Homes Initiative , will offer homeowners and renters limited amnesty for possessing any contraband found by police . ”
Notice the identical name with the striking difference that the district scheme will snoop out “ other illegal contraband ” as well .
Of course , this could be almost anything in your home , epsecially considering the fact police departments now strive to hire cops with the IQ average of a dullard , unable to tell rosemary from marijunana and table salt from cocaine .
In an effort to soften people up — in other words , brainwash those least able to resist , the kids — the D.C. police “ department initiated its program by distributing literature at police stations and Boys and Girls Clubs to gauge public interest .
It plans to begin the searches in two weeks . ”
“ Police spokeswoman Traci Hughes said the Safe Home program attempts to reach parents or guardians who think or know their children have guns and will offer amnesty for certain gun- and drug- possession charges , ” reports the Washington Times .
For “ certain gun - and drug - possession charges , ” in short for none , as the point will be to show off the program ’s smashing success and the number of criminals apprehended .
In response , the ACLU dispatched workers to hand out window signs .
“ To the Police : NO CONSENT TO SEARCH OUR HOME , ” the signs declare .
Of course , this will surely anger the police and the government , under orders to induce compliance and obedience in the masses , beginning with the children at their Boys and Girls Clubs .
As Orwell knew , subserviance to the state begins with the little ones .
“ D.C. Council member Marion Barry said the plan violates the Fourth Amendment , which bars illegal search and seizure .
He also said it infringes on parental responsibility . ”
It looks like our rulers will have to go back to the drawing table on this one .
Or they may be obliged to engineer another 9/11 or Katrina event to break down the will of the people , most who simply want to be left alone without police intervention and the intrusions of the state .

The Vim / Cscope tutorial
Cscope is a very handy tool , but it 's even better when you do n't ever have to leave the comfort of your favorite editor ( i.e. Vim ) to use it .
Fortunately , Cscope support has been built into Vim .
This tutorial introduces you both to Vim 's built - in Cscope support , and to a set of maps that make searching more convenient .
It is assumed you know the basics of using a vi-style editor , but you do n't need any particular knowledge about Vim ( where Vim - specific features -- like multiple windows -- are used , a working knowledge of the features is briefly introduced ) .
You also do n't need to know anything about Cscope : the basics are introduced as we go along .
In a nutshell , Vim's Cscope support is very similar to Vim 's ctags features , in case you 've used those .
But since Cscope has more search types than ctags , there are a few differences .
This is a hands - on tutorial , so open up a shell , and follow these steps :
Get and install Cscope if you do n't have it already on your machine .
Ideally , you will also have Vim 6.x , but you can get most of the functionality with later versions of Vim 5 ( vertical splits do n't work , but horizontal splits will work if you modify the maps as described in the file 's comments ) .
Note :
If your version of Vim was n't compiled with ' - - enable - cscope ' , you will need to reconfigure and recompile Vim with that flag .
Most Vim binaries that ship with Linux distributions have the Cscope plugin enabled .
Download the cscope_maps.vim file , and arrange for it to be read by Vim at startup time .
If you are using Vim 6.x , stick the file in your $ HOME /. vim / plugin directory ( or in any other ' plugin ' subdirectory in your ' runtimepath ' ) .
If you are using Vim 5.x , you can either cut and paste the entire contents of the cscope_maps file into your $ HOME /. vimrc file , or stick a " source cscope_maps.vim " line into your .vimrc file .
Go into a directory with some C code in it , and enter ' cscope - R ' ( the ' - R ' makes Cscope parse all subdirectories , not just the current directory ) .
Since we are n't passing the ' - b ' flag ( which tells Cscope to just build the database , then exit ) , you will also find yourself inside Cscope 's curses - based GUI .
Try a couple of searches ( hint : you use the arrow keys to move around between search types , and ' tab ' to switch between the search types and your search results ) .
Hit the number at the far left of a search result , and Cscope will open Vim right to that location .
( unless you 've set your EDITOR environment variable to something besides Vim ) .
Exit Vim , and you 'll be right back in the Cscope GUI where you left off .
Nifty .
Alas , the Cscope interface has one big problem : you need to exit Vim each time you want to do a new search .
That 's where the Vim plugin comes in .
Hit CTRL - D to exit Cscope .
Start up Vim .
If you want , you can start it with a C symbol ( ex : ' vim -t main ' ) , and you should hop right to the definition of that symbol in your code .
Put the cursor over a C symbol that is used in several places in your program .
Type " CTRL - \ s " ( Control - backslash , then just 's ' ) in quick succession , and you should see a menu at the bottom of your Vim window showing you all the uses of the symbol in the program .
Select one of them and hit enter , and you 'll jump to that use .
As with ctags , you can hit " CTRL - t " to jump back to your original location before the search ( and you can nest searches and CTRL -t will unwind them one at a time ) .
Mnemonic : the '\ ' key is right next to the ' ] ' key , which is used for ctags searches .
Try the same search , but this time via " CTRL - spacebar s " .
This time , your Vim window will split in two horizontally , and the Cscope search result will be put in the new window .
[ if you 've never used multiple Vim windows before : move between windows via ' CTRL - W w' ( or CTRL - W arrow key , or CTRL - W h/ j / k/l for left / up / down / right ) , close a window via ' CTRL - W c' ( or good old ' : q ' ) , make the current window the only one via ' CTRL - W o' , split a window into two via ' CTRL - W s' ( or ' CTRL - W v' for a vertical split ) , open a file in a new window via ' : spl[it ] filename ' ]
Mnemonic : there 's now a big , spacebar - like bar across the middle of your screen separating your Vim windows .
Now try the same search via " CTRL - spacebar CTRL - spacebar s " ( just hold down the CTRL key and tap the spacebar twice ) .
If you have trouble hitting the keys fast enough for this to work , go into the cscope_maps.vim script and change Vim 's timeout settings as described in the comments [ actually , I generally recommend that you turn off Vim's timeouts ] .
This time your Vim window will be split vertically ( note : this does n't work with Vim 5.x , as vertical splits are new with Vim 6.0 ) .
Up to now we 've only been using the keystroke maps from ' cscope_maps.vim ' , which all do a search for the term that happens to be under your cursor in Vim .
To do Cscope searches the old - fashioned way ( using Vim's built - in Cscope support ) , enter " : cscope find symbol foo " ( or , more tersely , " : cs f s foo " ) .
To do the horizontal split version , use " : scscope " ( or just " : scs " ) instead ( Vim 6.x only ) .
While it 's easier to use the maps if the word you want to search for is under your cursor , the command line interface lets you go to any symbol you type in , so you 'll definitely want to use it at times .
So far we 've only been doing one kind of search : 's ' , for ' find all uses of symbol X ' .
Try doing one of Cscope 's other searches by using a different letter : ' g ' finds the global definition (s ) of a symbol , ' c ' finds all calls to a function , 'f ' opens the filename under the cursor ( note : since Cscope by default parses all C header files it finds in /usr / include , you can open up most standard include files with this ) .
Those are the ones I use most frequently , but there are others ( look in the cscope_maps.vim file for all of them , and / or read the Cscope man page ) .
Although Cscope was originally intended only for use with C code , it 's actually a very flexible tool that works well with languages like C++ and Java .
You can think of it as a generic ' grep ' database , with the ability to recognize certain additional constructs like function calls and variable definitions .
By default Cscope only parses C , lex , and yacc files ( .c , .h , .l , .y ) in the current directory ( and subdirectories , if you pass the - R flag ) , and there 's currently no way to change that list of file extensions ( yes , we ought to change that ) .
So instead you have to make a list of the files that you want to parse , and call it ' cscope. files ' ( you can call it anything you want if you invoke ' cscope - i foofile ' ) .
An easy ( and very flexible ) way to do this is via the trusty Unix ' find ' command : find .
- name '*. java ' > cscope.files
Now run ' cscope - b ' to rebuild the database ( the - b just builds the database without launching the Cscope GUI ) , and you 'll be able to browse all the symbols in your Java files .
Apparently there are folks out there using Cscope to browse and edit large volumes of documentation files , which shows how flexible Cscope 's parser is .
For larger projects , you may additionally need to use the -q flag , and / or use a more sophisticated ' find ' command .
See our tutorial on using Cscope with large projects for more info .
Try setting the $ CSCOPE_DB environment variable to point to a Cscope database you create , so you wo n't always need to launch Vim in the same directory as the database .
This is particularly useful for projects where code is split into multiple subdirectories .
Note : for this to work , you should build the database with absolute pathnames : cd to / , and do find / my / project / dir - name '*. c ' -o - name '*.h' > /foo/cscope.files
Then run Cscope in the same directory as the cscope. files file ( or use ' cscope - i / foo/cscope.files ' ) , then set and export the $ CSCOPE_DB variable , pointing it to the cscope. out file that results ) : cd / foo cscope -b CSCOPE_DB=/foo/cscope.out ; export CSCOPE_DB
( The last command above is for Bourne / Korn / Bash shells : I 've forgotten how to export variables in csh - based shells , since I avoid them like the plague ) .
You should now be able to run ' vim -t foo ' in any directory on your machine and have Vim jump right to the definition of ' foo ' .
I tend to write little shell scripts ( that just define and export CSCOPE_DB ) for all my different projects , which lets me switch between them with a simple ' source projectA ' command .
BUG : in versions of Cscope prior to 15.4 , there is a silly bug that may cause Vim to freeze when you do this unless you call your database something other than the default ' cscope.out ' : use '- f foo ' in your Cscope invocation to name your database ' foo.out ' instead , and you 'll be OK .
That 's it !
Use " : help cscope " ( in Vim ) and / or " man cscope " ( from your shell ) if you 've got questions , and to learn the fine points .
Enough already with the encomiums to Tim Russert , whose untimely death has sparked a veritable chorus of eulogies depicting him as the epitome of objectivity and the greatest of journalists .
This is all coming , quite naturally , from his fellow journalists and intellectual gatekeepers , who share his prejudices , his politics , and  alas !
 his shortcomings .
It ’s time for a little Russert revisionism .
As Bill Moyers pointed out in Buying the War , his trenchant PBS documentary on how the War Party successfully sold us on the invasion of Iraq , Russert ’s show was a favored venue for the administration to publicize stories they had planted in the media .
Administration officials would get booked on Meet the Press and point to their phony reports as " proof " of Saddam ’s WMDs .
Remember back when Vice President Dick Cheney was going around making speeches in which he asserted that " we now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons , " that this was not in doubt , and he knew it for a fact ?
Few were skeptical , and the New York Times came out with yet another Judy Miller " scoop " that seemed to confirm Cheney ’s claim .
Citing anonymous U.S. government officials , the Times averred that the Iraqis were engaged in a global effort to gather the means to make nuclear weapons according to a design that specifically included aluminum tubes .
" And there , " says Moyers , " on Meet the Press that same morning was Vice President Cheney " citing Scooter Libby ’s best buddy .
Clearly trying to create the impression that Saddam Hussein already had nuclear weapons , or that he was well on his way to acquiring them , the vice president ticked off three elements essential to the construction of a nuclear device : technical expertise , a viable design , and fissile material .
According to Cheney , the Iraqis had all three  and Russert just sat there , not challenging Cheney but actually cueing him :
Cheney : " The third thing you need is fissile material , weapons - grade material .
Now , in the case of a nuclear weapon , that means either plutonium or highly enriched uranium .
And what we ’ve seen recently that has raised our level of concern to the current state of unrest , if you will , if I can put it in those terms , is that he now is trying , through his illicit procurement network , to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to enrich uranium to make the bombs . "
Russert : " Aluminum tubes . "
Cheney : " Specifically aluminum tubes .
There ’s a story in the New York Times this morning  this is  I do n’t  and I want to attribute the Times .
I do n’t want to talk about , obviously , specific intelligence sources , but it ’s now public that , in fact , he has been seeking to acquire , and we have been able to intercept and prevent him from acquiring through this particular channel , the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge . "
There were plenty of scientists in our very own Department of Energy who were warning the administration that this aluminum tube scenario was based on highly dubious " evidence , " but Russert , the alleged reporter , was too busy kissing Cheney ’s butt to go out and find them .
There were plenty of national security bureaucrats of one sort or another who strongly doubted the narrative Russert was allowing Cheney to present , unchallenged , on the most - watched political television show on the airwaves , but Russert did n’t know about them , and doubtless did n’t want to know about them at the time .
In retrospect , however , Russert realized , at least to some extent , how badly he ’d been used : :
Moyers : " Critics point to September 8 , 2002 , and to your show in particular , as the classic case of how the press and the government became inseparable .
Someone in the administration plants a dramatic story in the New York Times .
And then the vice president comes on your show and points to the New York Times .
It ’s a circular , self - confirming leak . "
Russert : " I do n’t know how Judith Miller and Michael Gordon reported that story , who their sources were .
It was a front - page story of the New York Times .
When Secretary Rice and Vice President Cheney and others came up that Sunday morning on all the Sunday shows , they did exactly that .
My concern was , is that there were concerns expressed by other government officials .
And to this day , I wish my phone had rung , or I had access to them . "
As Moyers pointed out in his scathing documentary , some journalists  not a lot , but a few of the really good ones  " did n’t wait for the phone to ring . "
Russert wanted to believe , as did the reporters and pundits who constitute the " mainstream " media , not only because this was the bipartisan consensus at the time , but also because of the incestuous relationship that often exists between journalists and the individuals whose doings they cover .
The former are dependent on the latter for their bread and butter : if they do n’t toe the line and deliver the right cues at the right moment , then they might not get that " scoop , " and  worse  they could soon find themselves frozen out of the information pipeline that runs through Washington like an underground sewer .
Okay , so Russert was an enabler of the neocons , who allowed his vastly influential program to function as the War Party ’s sounding board , but then again , so many were duped that it seems vindictive to emphasize this point so soon after his tragic death .
Right ?
Wrong .
It was n’t just his sycophancy in the presence of power that motivates my little exercise in Russert revisionism  it ’s what was clearly his vehement hostility to anyone who challenged the status quo in any way and sought to provide an antidote to the Dick Cheneys of this world .
Example number one : his disgraceful interview with GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul , the Texas congressman who made opposition to the war and our foreign policy of " preemptive " imperialism the linchpin of his remarkable campaign .
In what has got to be one of the worst examples of high - handed hectoring and attempted intellectual intimidation I ’ve seen in my lifetime , Russert tore into Paul the way he should have lit into Cheney , impugning his integrity , spending half the interview on the arcane subject of the Civil War  which Paul had never made a speech about , and obviously was n’t even a minor issue in the campaign .
When Paul raised the issue of U.S. intervention in the Middle East as fueling al - Qaeda ’s jihad and support for bin Laden , Russert fell back on that old neocon canard : " So you see a moral equivalency between the West and Islamic fascism . "
When Paul pointed out that Bush was intent on invading Iraq just as soon as he got into office , and his war moves had little to do with 9/11 , Russert ’s response was open hostility :
" You mentioned September 11th ; a former aide of yours , Eric Dondero said this .
‘ When September 11th happened , he just completely changed , ’ talking about you .
‘ One of the first things he said was not how awful the tragedy was , it was , " Now we ’re going to get big government . " ’
Was that your reaction ? "
How pathetic : Russert could n’t be bothered to get on the phone and talk to even one of many CIA employees who were trying to counter the administration ’s line of BS about Saddam ’s alleged WMD , but he went and dug up the demented Dondero , a fool who has made a career out of gunning for the Good Doctor ever since he was fired from Paul ’s staff .
Now that ‘s American journalism at its best .
Oh yes , Russert did his research , all right , but he only utilized it to the War Party ’s advantage .
He sucked up to power and was little more than a stenographer for high government officials whose confidence he coveted .
He was , in short , a great journalist , at least by today ’s standards , and that ’s why the media blowhards are turning his death into a celebration of themselves .
Because they ’re virtually all the same  shameless , sycophantic suck - ups who will do anything to advance their careers and could care less about where it takes the country .
The sad state of American journalism is why Antiwar.com was founded : it ’s why we continue to provide you with the real news about vital issues of foreign policy , war and peace , and the myriad deceptions of our rulers .
The " mainstream , " which is defined by its subservience to the powers that be , has simply abdicated its responsibilities , the execution of which are so vital to a free society .
Few journalists exemplified this abdication more clearly and consistently than the late ringmaster of Meet the Press .
Ally Ashwell with her son Owen ( Pic courtesy Blackpool Gazette ) A Tyneside woman who gave birth during a friend 's hen night in Blackpool said she did not know she was pregnant .
Ally Ashwell , from Newcastle , was touring the seaside town 's pubs and clubs in a bumble - bee outfit , when she began to feel unwell .
She returned to her hotel room , where the shocked 30 - year - old found herself delivering her own baby .
The fragile 2lb boy - named Owen - is being cared for in the intensive care unit of Blackpool Victoria Hospital .
A shortage of available special care baby beds in Newcastle has meant Ms Ashwell remaining in Lancashire for three weeks since the birth .
It is hoped she will be able to travel to Tyneside soon .
' Little fighter ' A spokesman for the Blackpool Victoria Hospital said : " It is very unusual for a baby to be born in this situation , I think Owen has surprised us all by the progress he has made .
" At 26 weeks , the chance for survival is probably about 50 to 60 per cent and the fact he was born outside hospital will have reduced that survival rate .
" So it 's a tribute to the paramedics for their work and to him for being a little fighter . "
A spokesman for Newcastle 's Royal Victoria Infirmary added : " We would always make it a priority to repatriate local babies who are unexpectedly born elsewhere .
" However we are the largest neonatal intensive care unit in the region and have to give priority to emergencies and to babies who are very sick and in need of specialist care that only we can provide .
" We sympathise with the family for this unfortunate delay and as soon as a bed becomes available this baby will be first priority . "

What are these ?
Let me explain .
Let ’s look at Lake Lanier .
The lake level is about 9 feet below normal ; indeed it is about 5 feet below the previous record low level for this time of year .
The lake is the principal water supply for Atlanta , and if the lake continues to drop , the drought will first disrupt power generation and then increasingly impact the economy of this great city .
Part of the reason for these low levels is that the region has experienced explosive growth and is putting more demands on the water supply .
But part of the reason is also that the Southeast has suffered severe droughts on and off over the past decade .
Ordinarily , this would not be much cause for worry .
Drought is a regular feature of life , and droughts always end .
But some droughts linger a while , so scientists tell us .
There are other disquieting signs .
At the same time drought is afflicting parts of the Southeast , it is also been affecting the Southwest , northern Mexico , parts of Spain , and Greece .
In the southern hemisphere , Australia is still suffering the worst drought in its history , New Zealand has suffered cuts in hydroelectric power because of lack of water , and Chile is in its worst drought in 50 years .
In fact an entire swath around the world in subtropical and Mediterranean latitudes has been in various stages of drought since the late 1990s .
The impacts of this drought extend far beyond the question of watering lawns and keeping golf fairways green .
For instance , one significant contributing factor to soaring wheat prices has been the ongoing drought in Australia , which is one of the world ’s breadbaskets .
A factor putting upwards pressure on copper prices has been the drought in Chile , which has reduced hydroelectric power generation and imposed limits on mine operations in one of the world ’s largest copper producing regions .
So questions arise :
Is there a connection between these dots of drought around the world ?
Is this some regularly occurring phenomenon that will break of its own accord and soon be forgotten ?
Or does this have something to do with global warming ?
It turns out that a number of scientists have been asking the same questions .
One of these is Richard Seager , an oceanographer at Columbia University ’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory .
Dr. Seager and his colleagues wondered how a warming world might affect precipitation patterns .
Last year they published the results of their research in Science Magazine , the nation ’s most distinguished scientific journal .
In their study they took 19 climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the international group that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace prize with Al Gore , -- and ran those models from the late 19th century to the present to see whether they would reproduce the precipitation patterns we ’ve seen over the past 125 years .
They focused on the subtropics and Mediterranean regions of the world – a band of latitude that includes the drought - stricken regions I ticked off .
The models accurately reproduced precipitation patterns as evident from the historical record .
So far so good .
They then ran the climate models forward to see what might lie ahead .
What they discovered is that a drying began around 1998 in those latitudes that , if the models are accurate , will likely deepen over the next several decades to drier than Dust Bowl levels before stabilizing as deep drought sometime in the next century .
They used the phrase “ perpetual drought ” to describe conditions in the Southwest and elsewhere if their analysis bears up .
Seager proposes two factors as likely factors that could produce this perpetual drought .
One is that a warming globe tends to make dry areas drier and wet areas wetter , and secondly , that warming will tend to shift the atmospheric circulation that distributes moisture further away from the equator and towards the poles .
Evaporation from the topics will still fall as rain in the mid-latitudes , it will just fall further north in the case of the United States .
We will only know in retrospect whether Seager is right , but can we afford to wait and see ?
I ’m not going to burden you with statistics today , nor am I going to lay out the science of climate change .
Twenty years after the world first mobilized to address this threat , the case should be familiar .
Rather , I ’m going to explain why I am going to make the threat of human - caused climate change a central issue in my presidential campaign .
Drought is just one of the impacts of climate change , and while we will only definitively know in retrospect whether the droughts I mentioned are connected by coincidence or linked to global warming , we do know is that the global food system rests on a knife edge .
Global food stocks are near all - time lows , and protracted drought threatens to topple this delicate balance between demand and supply .
( And , as we 've seen in the midwest in recent days , too much rain can threaten that balance as well . )
We also know that an extraordinary scientific consensus holds that human emissions of greenhouse gasses from the use of fossil fuels are already affecting climate .
While understanding whether these droughts represent one of these impacts on climate is an important question for science , it is an absolutely crucial question for governments around the world .
These droughts may represent a warning that we do n’t have the luxury of time to ponder whether climate change is a threat .
Even now there are food riots around the world because of scarcity and high prices .
If Seager and his colleagues are correct these scarcities are likely to worsen , and if these droughts are harbingers of a rapidly changing climate then a host of other miseries will soon be unfolding as well .
Notice I said , “ may represent a warning … ” That ’s the fix we are in .
From melting sea ice and permafrost , to daffodils growing in New York ’s Central Park in January , climate is changing more rapidly than our ability to understand the changes .
No one will ring a bell when greenhouse gasses push the climate system past some tipping point .
At the moment we do n’t even know what the tipping points are .
In this respect we are all like the fugitive holed up
In a hotel room wondering whether every knock at the door
Is the FBI , or , In our case , whether every megastorm or protracted drought
Is a sign that major climate change is upon us .
And , with climate already changing , we are going to have to take precautions with less than perfect information .
As we debate whether we have enough information to act , it ’s important to keep in mind that nature does n’t give points for good intentions , and that we ca n’t expect climate to meet us half way .
The geophysics and chemistry that govern climate are indifferent to our conveniences and needs .
And yet even today , we act as though nature is going to wait while we figure things out .
As societies and individuals we have a long history of taking precautions amid uncertainty , notably during the Cold War when we had less than perfect knowledge about the intent of the Soviets and the nature of the threat .
At the individual level , we do this every time we buy fire insurance for our house .
As the Stanford University climate scientist Steve Schneider points out , we do n’t demand certainty that our house is going to burn down before buying insurance .
This brings us to all the ballyhoo about the costs of dealing with climate change .
You hear figures thrown around that if we impose limits on emissions of carbon dioxide that it will ruin the American economy , that it ’s going to cost the U.S. hundreds of billions , even trillions of dollars in economic damage .
Really ?
Let ’s think about this .
About fifteen years ago , Al Gore tried to muster support for a gas tax to discourage wasteful use of fossil fuels and thereby help limit greenhouse gasses .
When Gore was pushing for this , a barrel of crude oil traded between the high teens and low twenties in dollars .
Gas was selling for a bit more than a buck a gallon back then .
Under withering criticism he scaled back his proposal to 25 cents a gallon , and even that did n’t get through .
No one has seriously proposed a gas tax since .
Now let ’s put this in perspective .
Then as now the U.S. had some of the lowest gasoline prices in the world .
More to the point , almost all the countries that had lower gas prices than us were net exporters of oil .
Back then we imported about 44 % of the oil we used .
So even though we were massively dependent on foreign oil , we kept prices low and effectively encouraged wasteful use of oil .
Oh , and we did this even though U.S. oil production had been declining for well over a decade .
The result of our bargain basement pricing of oil was that both American automobile manufacturers and consumers assumed that cheap gasoline was an American right , and the roads were flooded with gas guzzling SUVs .
And so in 2008 we still rank among the lowest gas prices in the world -- even at $ 3.80 for a gallon of regular .
Only now , our consumption of oil has risen by 20 % , our domestic production has fallen by 11.5 % , and we import over 60 % of our oil .
Worse , the amount of oil exported by oil producing nations has actually been declining the last couple of years , meaning that we ( and booming China and India ) are now competing for a pool of exports that has begun to shrink .
There are those who argue that the world is fast approaching a plateau in the amount of oil we can get from wells each year , that global production is approaching a “ peak , ” and that it will level off and decline as depletion of existing wells matches and then exceeds oil from new finds .
This is a vigorous debate , with others arguing that there is plenty of oil underground and that the only impediments to increasing production are so - called “ above ground ” risks like government regulations that limit drilling , terrorist disruption of Nigerian production , or attacks on pipelines in Iraq .
Regardless of which side is right in this debate – and I ’d feel better if global production had n’t essentially stalled over the last two years – there is no question that even before the world realizes accepts that peak oil is at hand , the U.S. faces the more near term threat of peak exports .
In other words , at some point a cap on the use of at least one fossil fuel – oil – is coming whether or not we limit carbon emissions to combat global warming .
And while Congress might have helped manage that transition fifteen years ago , today politicians have far less room to maneuver .
So let ’s rewind the tape and consider whether we would be in our present fix if we had imposed an increase in the gas tax and taken other measures to address global warming in 1993 ( or 30 years ago when scientists first warned that greenhouse gas emissions would likely alter climate ) .
If we ’d gradually increased the price of oil starting 15 years ago , presumably people would try to use if more efficiently as they do in Europe and other nations where gas prices are high , and as we are doing today in the U.S. at the point of a gun .
While today a good portion of the profits generated by high oil prices go overseas ( often to nations unfriendly to the U.S. and its values ) , a U.S. gas tax would at least have kept some of that money at home , where it could help advance the development of alternatives , or , through tax credits , helped the poor deal with their disproportionate burden of high prices .
Higher oil prices fifteen years ago would have lowered the bar for profitability in alternative energy , creating incentives for entrepreneurs and advancing the date for deployment of solar , wind , and other technologies .
It ’s arguable that if we ’d taken action to address the threat of climate change when the scientific consensus gelled in the 1990s , that the threat of supply disruptions , whether through peak oil or peak exports , would be further off in the future .
It ’s arguable that if we ’d followed through on developing a more diversified energy portfolio in the 1970s , or even the 1980s or 1990s , that oil prices would be lower than they are now .
( Even adjusted for inflation , gas prices have risen ten times the amount of Gore ’s proposed gas tax . )
Instead , we find ourselves today with very high gas prices and alternatives still in their infancy .
Other than hydroelectric and nuclear ( which take many years to deploy ) , alternatives account for only 3 % of the energy delivered by oil each year .
To meet increasing energy demand , wind , solar , tidal and other alternative energies would have to grow twice as fast as they ever have in the past .
Some argue that we should open up fragile wilderness areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve ( ANWR ) or presently off - limits parts of the continental shelf for oil drilling .
But even if we did do that , they would not produce oil for several years , and once we had despoiled those areas , what then ?
Where would we turn for new supplies ?
Are we willing to subordinate every American value to maintain our allegiance to one fossil fuel ?
One source of energy waiting in the wings is coal , which is still cheap and relatively plentiful .
But coal carries heavy environmental costs , both during mining and in its emissions , and swap coal for oil would contribute to a dramatic upsurge in greenhouse gasses even as we are trying to reduce the threat of climate change .
There is a way out of this pickle .
A first step is to dramatically increase our commitment to energy efficiency , by far the most cost efficient way to extend oil supplies .
Big corporations like DuPont and General Electric have been doing this for years –not to combat climate change but to improve profits .
There is plenty more to do – improving gas mileage comes to mind .
For all the very real pain that $ 4 a gallon gas inflicts , Americans are finally adjusting their lives to conserve oil .
Improving energy efficiency with off - the - shelf products and technologies and help buy us time to ramp up sound alternatives to fossil fuels .
The government can nudge this along with tax incentives , but to the degree that egregious waste of oil jeopardizes our economic health , our national security , and the stability of the climate , tax penalties should be part of this mix as well .
Since consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 % of the nation ’s GDP , ordinary Americans , through their purchases can do much to address the threat of climate change , and also help spur wiser use of scarce , expensive oil .
Let me ask you this question : if when shopping you could see a clearly marked label identifying a product as climate friendly , how many of you would make that choice ?
Precedents show that most people would do that as well .
For years now green groups have been certifying wood products that are harvested in environmentally friendly ways , and as a result of consumer interest in these products , major companies such as Home Depot and Lowe ’s have been shifting to sourcing wood products from certified sources .
It should n’t be too difficult to establish a standards center to vet and certify climate friendly products , and you can bet that if consumers begin making such choices , manufacturers and retailers will respond .
Voluntary actions such as these can help reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions , but the cold math is that such actions alone will not be enough to head off a further build up in the atmosphere , particularly since giant nations such as India and China are only just now ramping up their use of fossil fuels .
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose 3.1 % in 2007 , and for the first time ever , China surpassed the U.S. as the world ’s largest emitter of this greenhouse gas .
China ’s dubious honor as the world ’s biggest contributor of climate changing emissions shows you what happens when a large developing economy turns to coal to fuel its growth .
We already have more greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere than there have been since we evolved as a species .
As greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise , we are entering unknown territory as far as the consequences for climate .
Given population growth and the quest for material betterment around the world , it will take extraordinary action simply to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions somewhere above their present levels , much less reduce them to the degree that would relieve some of the pressure on the climate system .
That means that we need more than just tax incentives and penalties to encourage efficiency .
We need to reach agreement to cap emissions .
With agreement on a cap , we can then use markets to trade carbon allocations , which , if properly structured would have the effect of channeling resources to where they would do the most good .
My proposal would be to create the cap at the global level and then set subtargets for three vertical slices of the globe : the Americas , Europe , the Middle East , India and Africa , and Asia , and the Pacific nations .
How each region reached its target would be up to them , and both the target and subtargets would be the product of negotiation , but such a design would at the least bring both developed and emerging economies together and working towards a common goal .
I offer this design as one way forward .
If someone has a better idea I ’m open to that as well , but I ’m committed to providing leadership on this issue .
One thing that has become clear in the 20 years since the threat of global warming emerged as an issue of international concern , is that there will be no progress unless the U.S. , the world ’s largest economy , takes the issue seriously and offers leadership in coming to grips with the threat .
It is also clear that the U.S. will not lead unless its President makes this threat a key issue of his or her administration .
And this brings me back to why I ’m standing here today on the shores of Lake Lanier talking about climate change rather than jobs , the credit crunch , health care , terrorism of any of the many other issues that press upon Americans today .
Just as it has become clear that the world will not take action on climate change without leadership provided by a U.S. president , it is also clear that a U.S. President cannot call upon the American people to address this issue unless it is an issue in a Presidential campaign .
We cannot give mere lip service to climate change during the long march of a campaign , and then once in office tell Americans that it is one of the most consequential issues of our time .
To do so would beg the question , “ if it ’s so important , why did n’t you bother to mention it while you were running for office ? ”
At least this is the conclusion we can draw from the past four Presidential elections .
Regardless of expressions of concern voiced when we suffer heat waves , floods , hurricanes , or some other climate related catastrophe , every national election cycle , the issue has gone onto the back burner .
I suspect that this is one reason that we have failed to take action on this threat .
No Presidential candidate has made dealing with the threat of climate change a central issue of his or her campaign .
I ’m here to tell you that this ends today .
The job of a President is to offer vision and leadership on all the matters of concern to Americans , but it is also the job of a President to rouse Americans to deal with grave threats to our security that may not have the hot - button immediacy of rising unemployment , falling home prices , food and gas prices .
In the final analysis , how we respond to the challenge of climate change will offer a glimpse of the real meaning of the fantastic material progress of the past 100 years .
If we push to the side concerns about global warming and environment , and simply open every acre for oil drilling and dig up every available car load of coal , we are in effect saying that the great wealth and progress of the so - called American century was really nothing more than the lucky discovery of fossil fuels , and that it will continue only so long as we have fossil fuels to burn .
On the other hand , if we recognize the steeply mounting costs that accompany fossil fuels , and begin to move towards their successor , we are making a very different statement about American progress .
Recognizing that we need to develop alternatives is an affirmation of American ingenuity .
Fossil fuels have played a huge role in our history .
President Bush has said that we are " addicted to oil . "
I would substitute the word " entranced " for addicted because once we fell under oil 's spell , we put aside all plans to develop alternatives , some of which date back over 100 years .
We need to snap out of this trance and recognize that they are just one form of energy , and when one form of energy becomes too scarce or costly , an ingenious society finds a new source of energy to replace .
That is the America I believe in , and it is the America the world needs today . ”
As part of our ongoing effort here at Current Configuration to make your life not only better , but also 10 % more crunchy , we ’re offering you this first installment of what will be an ongoing series of Essential Life Lessons .
Kicking off this series will be a critical but even - handed examination of a common misunderstanding that occurs in a realm of many misunderstandings : the bathroom .
Put simply , there is a right way to hang the toilet paper , and a wrong way .
Read on to determine the status of your own roll .
Toilet paper has a natural curve , a way of being that lends itself to certain orientations on the toilet paper spool . *
If handled with skill and knowledge , it can provide an abundance of both sanitation and comfort , quilted together in each square of pillowy ply .
If handled with clumsy ignorance , or worse , carelessness , it will beset the user with pain , filth , and frustration .
Do n’t let it end this way , with you curled on the tile floor of the stall , weeping in frustration , covered in wasted papier de toilette .
To convince you , we ’ve created some diagrams , harnessing the power of SCIENCE , to demonstrate the natural benefits of the over hanging method .
First , we examine the optimal viewing benefits of the over hanging method .
Below are examples of the helpful and fruitful over - hung method on the left and the annoying and detrimental under - hung method on the right .
Notice the dramatic difference in the amount of visible toilet paper .
Ironically , it is the over - hung toilet paper that has both the most visible free sheetage and the least amount of sheetage free from the roll to do it .
Now , this may not seem like a big deal on its own , but in these extra sheets lies your undoing .
Observe .
We here at Current Configuration , for the purposes of ease and expediency , do the one - handed tear ( okay , really , it ’s just me , but bear with me , er , us ) .
The one - handed tear is a quick maneuver that takes advantage of the perforated squares , allowing your bundle of toilet paper to be liberated with one quick swipe of the arm .
This is the foundation of bathroom ease , the cottony bedrock on which enjoyment rests in the restrooms of many nations .
The one - handed tear relies on a quick and forceful motion directed either away from or towards the tear - er .
The forces applied in this motion are great and , like the atom , are not to be trifled with .
The natural curve of the over - hung method allows the roll to stand fast after a one - handed tear , but the under - hung method creates a calamitous tendency in the roll .
This tendency can only lead to this :
Wasted paper , frustration , the destruction of our forests .
While we realize that it is possible to execute a one - handed tear on an under - hung roll , this is a game of sanitary Russian roulette .
You are bound to lose eventually , and there is no re-rolling an unwound toilet paper roll .
The results will only cause you grief .
Do n’t let this happen to you .
Restroom attendants , janitors , maids , facilities crews , and responsible toiletowners take note :
Do n’t use the under - hung method for your toilet paper rolls .
It leads to the destruction of our precious resources and the pillars of civilization as we know it !
* Does that thing have a proper name ?

When you take your new Apple computer out of the box and plug it in , it ’s pretty much ready to go with every application you need to e-mail , design web pages , sync calendars , edit music , video and photographs and generally get creative the moment you turn it on .
But it ’s always handy to know about third party software out there that can help things along for certain tasks .
Some of the titles on this list are free gratis , some of them are reasonably priced shareware .
The one thing they all have in common , is that none of them have anything to do with Microsoft and therefore work brilliantly ; stable applications you ’ll use every day .
Adobe Lightroom
Lightroom is one of those applications you just have to use to see how powerful it really is .
On the surface it ’s a glorified thumbnail browser , much like Graphic Converter or Adobe Bridge , which ships with Photoshop CS3 .
But dig deeper and you ’ll find a whole new way to perform a number of tasks which Photoshop and its open source free alternative GIMP simply are n’t designed to do .
Lightroom ’s main twist on the thumbnail browser , as we from the computer based photo organising world will know it , is the way in which Lightroom is actually copying the look and feel of doing things the old school way , with a light table and a magnifying loupe , from the days of chemical processing and 35 mm film .
The biggest benefit to adopting this approach is being able to perform a wide range of editing tasks , such as colour correction cropping and straightening of images , all in a full screen , top down interface .
Cropping , for example , when used correctly , can turn an ordinary shot into something the viewer is more drawn into .
By laying on top of the full screen image proportionally spaced lines in a geometrically balanced grid , Lightroom makes it simple for you to always ensure the subject of your photograph is in a part of the canvas which you want the viewers eye to focus on .
There ’s also a full array of keyword and meta tagging , which Lightroom embeds into the image using XML , so that third party applications can read everything from the exposure settings and lens type used , to the location the image was shot , who ’s and what is featured in it , who took it and what the copyright status of the image is for redistribution and fair use .
Then there ’s Lightroom ’s cornucopia of settings for getting the most from RAW files , where information on things like White Balance can be adjusted to effectively shoot the image again with completely different exposure settings , but without the inconvenience of having to travel all the way back to the location where the photo was taken or , in the case of a studio assignment , the added cost of re-hiring crew and talent .
All of this takes place in a full screen interface , with as little interference from the float - over tool bars as possible ; something Adobe ’s flagship Photoshop application could learn a lot from .
There ’s also a full complement of export settings for print and web , which includes a smart and easy to use web gallery template creator , which has a few cool Flash elements included , to easily create a pro looking portfolio .
In short :
It ’s a virtual dark room for the digital photographer .

Audio Hijack Pro
Rogue Amoeba make some great high quality applications with the prosumer Mac user in mind .
Audio Hijack
Pro is the solution you ’ve been looking for if you need to capture and process system audio .
Simply put , it enables you to record the sound of any currently running application and pass it through a virtual mixing desk , complete with auxiliary sends to all of Mac OS X built - in effects and filters , as well as any third party plug-ins you might have installed in the components folder , such as those which bundle with Audio & MIDI music sequencing software .
It ’s not just professional studio sound engineers who will find AHP extremely useful , though .
Hobbyist podcasters always need to get audio from a variety of sometimes obscure sources into their Mac .
Recording their own voice on one Microphone input , another from Skype and perhaps a third from an audio player , for things like sound effects , jingles or other pre-recorded media .
Without something to manage the whole thing , this can often involve having to kludge together multiple sound capture cards on USB hubs & route everything through external hardware mixers , which as well as degrading the audio fidelity , by leaving the digital domain , it ’s also far from being an easy set - up to carry around with your laptop for field recording .
By literally hijacking the sound output of any application , like Skype for over - the - net phone - in contributions to a podcast , for example , AHP ’s simple user interface clearly lays out the record path from input source to output file type ; recording on - the - fly to all the usual audio file formats .
You can also automatically split a recording into multiple chunks based upon total record time or file size in megabytes , which is extremely handy if you ’re recording a long piece intended for release in shorter ‘ episodes ’ or you want to send the recording to an e-mail box which only accepts small file attachments .
It ’s also a huge help to anyone who needs to send large files to a Microsoft Windows application , because the FAT32 file system has a maximum file size limit of just 2 gigabytes .
Splitting can also be done arbitrarily by hitting the key on the top toolbar , which is also a great short cut for marking song in / out points from a radio broadcast of a live music concert or in a teleconference meeting where various different people begin to speak , so each of their ‘ tracks ’ can be later placed on a separate output strip in an audio sequencer for individual adjustment of stereo pan , output levels and other effects , such as compression and limiting .
In short :
It records any sound your Mac can make .

Folder Splitter
We ’ve all done it and it ’s usually the downloads folder which suffers from it the most .
The crime ?
Stuffing a billion files into one folder to such a degree that it takes the computer a month and a day to list everything in it , which makes finding anything completely impossible .
I ’ve forced myself to not do it so much with important files , like holiday snaps and music , but I still have a few folders full of old documents and LOLCATS which Folder Splitter is just itching to munch its way through .
Simply put , it organises a folder full of files into separate directories .
You can also reverse the process by ‘ UnSplitting ’ .
You can sort the splitting options by maximum size , number of files and choose to move or copy .
I use this most of all to make 4.6GB sized folders for archiving of movies and other downloads I want to back - up to 4.7GB write - able DVD .
In short :
No more messy folder excuses .

HandBrake
Many people buy a Mac Mini simply to use it as a media centre , by hooking it up to their HD TV and using OS X ’s built in ‘ Front Row ’ application to navigate the hard drive ’s contents with the provided Apple remote control .
The only problem with this is that , while the Mac Mini ’s form factor makes it easy to hide behind the screen , access to the DVD drive needs to be maintained so that discs can be inserted and ejected .
To get around this many people choose to expand the Mac ’s hard drive , or install an external USB or FireWire drive and ‘ rip ’ their DVD collection to disk , so there ’s no danger of damaging the physical hard copy of the original disc .
HandBrake is , quite simply , THE best DVD ripping software out there and it ’s completely free !
You can use the pre-set menu to choose what format you want to convert your DVD into , for easy transfer to any portable media player .
You can also rip the raw data off the disc and transcode it into DV or another high quality file type , for up - conversion to HD , using smoothing plug-ins for Final Cut Pro or AVID .
HandBrake is also aware of other third party compression and codec software you might have installed , such as DivX pro and XviD or Apple ’s own H.264 variants for pro applications .
It is illegal to share files made from ‘ ripped ’ DVDs with other people , but it is not illegal to make copies if it is for your own personal use only .
HandBrake also reads DVD chapters and can write the markers back to a chapter aware file , like Quicktime – so you do n’t have to visually ‘ skip ’ from the beginning of the program you want to watch , to the section you ’re interested in .
This is useful for playback on the iPod or any number of in - car media players which HandBrake also supports .
With home theatre users specifically in mind , HandBrake also includes pre-sets for ripping to AppleTV format .
The AppleTV is quickly becoming the most popular home media centre set - top - box , thanks to a recent software update which enables it to buy movies directly from iTunes and stream them to an attached HD TV , without the need to browse the web store on a Mac or PC .
In short : Rip your DVD library to file back - ups .

Font Explorer X
When Apple began shipping their first computers , back in the late 1970s , the only interaction their small group of IT enthusiast customers had with the operating system itself , was through a green text on black background command prompt terminal .
While a small team of the first Apple employees were assembling these machines by hand , in Steve Jobs garage , across the other side of town in Menlo Park , the huge photocopier and image processing company Xerox , was developing a system called Alto , which it was the vision of it ’s developers would one day be a common place device in offices around the world .
Alto had an A4 portrait orientated screen , a mouse pointer , a kind of Ethernet network connection to other Alto systems and , most importantly of all , Alto had a Graphic User Interface with the windows and toolbars cliché we take for granted today .
Unfortunately , partly because it cost so much to make and buy and partly because Xerox bosses simply did n’t understand what it was for , Alto did n’t get off the ground .
Before it was eventually canned , however , Steve Jobs ’
Apple had began to enjoy some considerable degree of success in home electronics , a market which had never previously existed for computers of any kind beyond the simple desk calculator .
This follow up to Apple Computer ’s early wooden machines for hobbyists , the Apple II , afforded Jobs a tour of the Xerox research facility , where the GUI , mouse pointer and proportionally spaced fonts of the ‘ What You See Is What You Get ” ( WYSIWYG , pronounced Wizzy Wig ) interface to the Alto , gave him a ‘ Eureka ’ moment and sowed the seeds of what would later become the Apple Macintosh .
What , you might ask , has any of this got to do with a great little Freeware application called Font Explorer X ?
Well , simply put , the Mac has always had Fonts at its heart .
The killer application of the original Mac , which saved Apple as a company ( when the Mac ’s bigger , more expensive sister , Lisa had almost bankrupted them in Jobs ’ pursuit of what he ’d seen at Xerox ) was word processing and WYSIWYG desktop publishing ; the ability to see on paper exactly what you can see on the screen .
Linotype , much like Adobe and other print and design companies at the time , who had made their name on type libraries and printer modules which reproduced graphics for large commercial print shops , which cost thousands of pounds to licence and years of work to develop , began to see desktop publishing as a unique advantage to bring beautiful print and proportionally spaced fonts to the masses , and the Mac was just the platform on which to do it .
The explosion between then and now , in the sheer volume of fonts and type libraries which grace our screens with their detailed serifs and elegant design communication , do have one annoying side effect , however ; the time which it takes for even the snappiest of computers to load them all up .
Font Explorer
X does away with a lot of the load time a bulkier font folder normally incurs by only loading the fonts you ’re going to use .
It can also process requests from certain applications , like Photoshop , to install particular fonts on demand .
So if you ’ve disabled a particular family of fonts , but you then try to open a project which requires them , Font Explorer X will move the font family you need back into the system fonts folder , without having to re-launch the application which requires them .
It can also sift through your entire fonts library and filter out damaged files which can severely cripple a machine with even large amounts of RAM .
It displays the selected font in a bar in which you can test out different characters , or search for certain kinds of special keys .
It really does bring home the power of an operating system Apple have always designed around the needs of printers , graphic designers and artists who need to know that what they see on the screen is capable of being reproduced in print .
Anyone who knows the importance of occasionally booting from the System Installer DVD and performing a Repair Disk Permissions ( analogous to Window ’s defrag , but not the same thing ) should also know the importance of maintaining a well organised and regularly maintained fonts folder .
Once you ’ve used Font Explorer X to do this , you ’ll wonder how you ever managed without it .
In short :
The perfect compliment to OS X ’s built - in ‘ Font Book ’ and world famous , low Level typeface management .

Pixelmator
Functional though it may be ; the generic , by - word for all kinds of image manipulation though it ’s name has become accepted in the common language , there ’s no denying that Photoshop is one hell of an expensive application to buy out - right , if all you ’re looking to do is apply the odd filter here and there or crop a couple of pixels out of a frame and re-touch a bit of red eye camera flash , from your kid ’s birthday party snaps .
Pixelmator is a quick loading , nice looking , full screen application which uses the GPU to apply Mac OS X ’s built - in Core Graphics to your image without taking up CPU cycles .
Consequently many of the jobs which have traditionally been thought of as rather slow and difficult to figure out ‘ Photoshop only ’ tasks , like Gaussian Blurring and other complex filters to improve light balance and colour noise , can be applied lightning fast in an interface almost too cool looking for it ’s own good .
Pixelmator ’s website gives a great quick - glance at all of the amazing applications features , so I wo n’t spend any extra time echoing all of them here , except to add that the simple fact that this application takes but milliseconds to launch , even when dragging and dropping really large uncompressed files into it , as well as sporting a stunning feature set for an application in this price range , has me using it every single day .
There ’s a myriad of filters and effects which it ’s hard to believe are n’t already included in image editors costing three and four times as much , such as page curling and random pattern generators , all of which are controlled by an impossibly cool input method of dragging input lines into and out of the filter box , rather like patching some kind of physical hardware controller , the likes of which you might find in a mad scientists laboratory .
In short : Incredibly good fun and fast .
Cost : £ 29 ( $ 59 ) from pixelmator.com
i ShowU
Sometimes it ’s easier to show than tell .
IShowU captures everything on your screen and records commentary audio from both the built in microphone and the system sound of Mac OS X , so any applications which play audio are also recorded .
There ’s a number of capture quality settings , including 1080 p HD .
The real advantage IShowU has over some of the other titles which do a similar task , is that there is no wait time for your clip to output , once you click to finish recording .
The quicktime file of your screen - cast is ready immediately .
IShowU makes a number of high quality tutorial and demo podcasts possible , including Bert Monroy ’s exceptional Pixel Perfect and Alex Lindsay MacBreak Studio .
In Short : Incredibly stable and useful for all kinds of screen capturing .
Cost : £ 10 ( $ 20 ) from shinywhitebox.com
Renamer4Mac
This used to be a free application , but I see from the latest version the author is wanting $ 40 , for a bundle with another application .
I ’ll mention it anyway because if you can find a copy of the old ( free ) version this is one of the most useful tools you can own if , like me , you ’re always loosing track of where your photographs are on your hard drive , because you put them all in one folder with their default auto - generated file names , straight off removable memory media .
Renamer4Mac , by dragging and dropping a list of files on it , can remove characters from the beginning and end of a string , insert sequential alpha numeric characters , add the date and include the old file name , without overwriting the file extension ( or with if you choose to ) , so you never need have folders full of esoterically named files , ever again .
Cost : $ 40 ( £ 20 ) with a free trial from renamer4mac.com
Quıcĸsıɩⅴεʀ
I mean this in no small way .
Quicksilver is the most essential Mac OS X application ever made .
It is way beyond the scope of this article to list every feature of this incredible application , except to say that it is beyond me as to why Apple did n’t introduce their own version of it , into OS X , a long time ago .
If you ’re going to be simplistic about it , it ’s a program launcher – and you can use it as nothing more than such if that ’s all you ’re looking for .
Merlin Mann insists , and I ’m prone to agree with him , that it is so much more than that – in terms of streamlining your working day for a happier more productive life – it really is that powerful .
Simply Put :
You will use it constantly from the moment you install it , while your Windows friends scratch in vain to find anything even half as useful , stable and fast .
It is the very definition of easy to use .

Transmit
I ’m old enough to remember , back in the days of dial - up internet , when uploading a few changes to a web page was something you scheduled your tea and coffee making around ; it took so long .
These days , with cable broadband , you ’re free to make changes to a site on the fly , without worrying about uploading megabytes of files you might never use in the final design , while trying out different ideas .
Transmit makes the process of doing that as easy as dragging and dropping between any two windows on the desktop .
The interface is designed to act and feel like any other Finder pane , complete with super - handy “ Open With ” menus for all the files you keep on your FTP server , for ease of editing in the application associated with it .
For example , I can directly open a JPEG graphic file in Photoshop , edit it and simply by saving the file , Trasmit will upload the changes to the FTP server – immediately making them available on the web page I am editing , so I can try them out in a variety of browsers .
This might not sound like an Earth shattering feat of modern engineering , but the Mac OS X like style with which this rock solid and reasonably priced application carries it out , is so smooth , you ’ll soon find yourself recommending it to friends and installing it on all your Macs .
The killer feature of Transmit , to my mind however , is droplets .
You can bookmark any location on any server as a droplet icon – which when you drag and drop files onto it , immediately upload to that location via FTP .
For example , I want to upload a gallery of images to a site I already know has the Gallery open source image management software installed on it .
I do n’t need to open an FTP program , drag and drop the files , edit the HTML , update all the links to that gallery , try it in different browsers and essentially spend an hour doing something which should only take seconds .
With droplets , I drag the files I want to add to a specific location onto the icon , Transmit begins uploading them and when it ’s done , all I have to do is update the Gallery cache and it finds the images I ’ve uploaded automatically .
Simply Put :
It behaves as if your FTP servers are any other location on your Mac .

Identical twins are identical , right ?
After all , they derive from just one fertilized egg , which contains one set of genetic instructions , or genome , formed from combining the chromosomes of mother and father .
But experience shows that identical twins are rarely completely the same .
Until recently , any differences between twins had largely been attributed to environmental influences ( otherwise known as " nurture " ) , but a recent study contradicts that belief .
Geneticist Carl Bruder of the University of Alabama at Birmingham , and his colleagues closely compared the genomes of 19 sets of adult identical twins .
In some cases , one twin 's DNA differed from the other 's at various points on their genomes .
At these sites of genetic divergence , one bore a different number of copies of the same gene , a genetic state called copy number variants .
Normally people carry two copies of every gene , one inherited from each parent .
" There are , however , regions in the genome that deviate from that two - copy rule , and that 's where you have copy number variants , " Bruder explains .
These regions can carry anywhere from zero to over 14 copies of a gene .
Scientists have long used twins to study the roles of nature and nurture in human genetics and how each affects disease , behavior , and conditions , such as obesity .
But Bruder 's findings suggest a new way to study the genetic and environmental roots of disease .
For example , one twin in Bruder 's study was missing some genes on particular chromosomes that indicated a risk of leukemia , which he indeed suffered .
The other twin did not .
Bruder therefore believes that the differences in identical twins can be used to identify specific genetic regions that coincide with specific diseases .
Next , he plans to examine blood samples from twin pairs in which only one suffers from asthma or psoriasis to see whether he can find gene copy number changes that relate to either of these illnesses .
The result might also call into question the many findings of previous twin studies that assumed identical twins were indeed identical , Bruder notes .
" It 's pretty unlikely they 're going to significantly change any of the results found so far , " counters Kerry Jang , a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , who runs Canada 's largest twin study .
" We can adjust our models to take [ genetic differences ] into account in the same way we 've adjusted for different environments . "
The discovery of this genetic variation gives hope for an obscure but pressing issue in the case of a criminal suspect who is an identical twin .
" If one twin is a suspect and the whereabouts of the other twin cannot be determined , then the jury is often left without the ability to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt " in cases that rely on DNA evidence , says Frederick Bieber , a pathologist at Harvard Medical School .
" If the twin issue comes up in a criminal investigation it 's possible that if there are [ copy number variants ] that differ between the two twins that might help sort that out , " Bieber says .
Given that there are 80 pairs of identical twins in Virginia 's convicted offender database alone , this might not be as small an issue as it may sound .
And such genetic variation also matters to the population at large .
Bruder speculates that such variation is a natural occurrence that accumulates with age in everyone .
" I believe that the genome that you 're born with is not the genome that you die with — at least not for all the cells in your body , " he says .
Charles Lee , a geneticist at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston , agrees .
Genetic variations can arise after a double strand of DNA breaks when exposed to ionizing radiation or carcinogens .
" It reminds us to be careful about our environment because our environment can help to change our genome , " he says .
Plus , these variations may predict age - related diseases .
Lee adds : " As you age … your chances for having a genomic rearrangement that causes a certain disease increases all the time . "
The differences between identical twins increase as they age , because environmentally triggered changes accumulate .
But twins can also begin their lives with differences , according to Bruder 's study , and that calls into question their very name .
" Maybe we should n't call them identical twins , " Harvard 's Bieber says .
" We should call them ' one - egg twins . ' "

To gin up support for off - shore drilling , the Right has an ace up its rhetorical sleeve : the Chinese in Cuba .
Here ’s Vice President Cheney .
“ [ O ]il is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida .
We ’re not doing it .
The Chinese are in cooperation with the Cuban government …
Even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply .
Yet Congress has said … no to drilling off Florida . ”
“ Even the communists ” is a nice flourish .
Mix the red scare with the yellow scare and get Uncle Dick ’s own Orange Scare .
Guaranteed to freak out Americans concerned about their energy security .
Here ’s House Republican Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , piling on :
“ Even China recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores ; thanks to Fidel Castro , they ’ve been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the Florida Keys . ”
Adds House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) , “ Right at this moment , some 60 miles or less off the coast of Key West , Florida , China has the green light to drill for oil in order to lower energy costs in that country . ”
Problem is , that ’s all false .
Like , completely false .
China is not currently drilling off the shores of Cuba ; in fact , it does n’t even have a off shore drilling contract .
What is does have is a permit to drill on Cuban land .
“ China is not drilling in Cuba ’s Gulf of Mexico waters , period , ” Jorge Piñon , an energy expert at the University of Miami ’s Center for Hemispheric Policy , told the Miami Herald .
In fact , it is not yet drilling on Cuban land , either .
The Herald added :
China ’s Sinopec oil company does have an agreement with the Cuban government to develop onshore resources west of Havana , Piñon said .
The Chinese have done some seismic testing , he said , but no drilling .
Western diplomats in Havana told McClatchy that to the best of their knowledge there is no Chinese drilling offshore .
The Congressional Research Service also debunks Republican claims :
“ While there has been some concern about China ’s potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects , to date its involvement in Cuba ’s oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state - run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation .
( Sinopec ) ”
In a Democratic - controlled Congress , off shore drilling is not going to expand any time soon .
But the war against dishonest bombast never stops .

Critics and challengers of Naomi Klein ’s work had better take a close look at her latest book , “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , ” before launching their attacks .
This is one writer whose research and documentation are so exhaustive that would - be detractors will not only find her analysis to be dauntingly watertight , even if they do n’t share her views about the unnatural disasters enabled by free - market capitalism , but they might also discover that some of her source material seems strangely familiar .
That ’s because she took a page — or several hundred pages , rather — from just the sort of think tanks , government officials , scholars and publications that would seem to oppose her ideas most forcefully .
But instead of trying to explain recurring socioeconomic patterns in the wake of various global crises by using a familiar “ lefty ” lens to justify her claims , Klein looks to the likes of Milton Friedman , the Cato Institute , Henry Kissinger and the Financial Times to bolster her argument about how “ disaster capitalism ” was cooked up decades ago and how it can explain what happened following Hurricane Katrina , Augusto Pinochet ’s 1973 Chilean coup , and more recent events like Burma ’s cyclone and the floods in the American Midwest .
The inner workings and key subscribers of disaster capitalism were exposed when “ The Shock Doctrine ” first came out last September .
Klein called in just before the book ’s June 24 paperback release to discuss this scary piece of nonfiction with Truthdig ’s Associate Editor Kasia Anderson , as well as to talk about the resource - rich Shock Doctrine Web site and how she believes the notion of disaster capitalism is , unfortunately , still relevant at this moment .
An audio recording of this interview can be heard here .
Kasia Anderson :
So , I have read your book and was very alarmed , and I think it was a nice wake - up call for me .
But let ’s start out by talking a little bit about disaster capitalism , which is the central idea of your book .
I was reading your L.A. Times article from earlier this year and you say , “ Over the last four years , I have been researching a little - explored area of economic history : the way that crises have paved the way for the march of the right - wing economic revolution across the globe .
A crisis hits , panic spreads and the ideologues fill the breach , rapidly reengineering societies in the interests of large corporate players .
It ’s a maneuver I call ‘ disaster capitalism . ’ ” So that lays the groundwork a little bit .
Now , with all due respect to your keen perception , why do you think this is a “ little - explored area of economic history ” when you ’re looking at events that go back as far as five decades ?
Naomi Klein :
Well , I think largely because this is our contemporary history , and there has n’t been that much looking back at how … the economic model that has been dominant since Reagan — how it has spread throughout the world , and when there is a look back , the people doing the looking back are the people who imposed the policies in the first place .
It ’s been a victor ’s history , and it ’s been a history told by the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation , and there have been some important left - wing academics who have begun to provide a counter - history like David Harvey at CUNY University … a couple of years ago [ he ] wrote “ A Brief History of Neoliberalism , ” which was really the first alternative history of how these ideas swept the globe .
But , in terms of why the crisis has not been understood by popular audiences before — popular readers before — has to do with the fact that , not that this is a secret , but that it ’s a tactic that has been discussed exclusively in technocratic circles .
So my sources on this are , you know , Washington conferences attended by central bank presidents , think tanks , the International Monetary Fund .
And there is a kind of an armor that goes up around how highly technical and specialized the language is around these discussions — it ’s almost designed to make laypeople ’s eyes roll back into their heads .
So , I was fortunate to work with some wonderful researchers , graduate students , who were working in these areas of researching World Bank policies , and came across this sort of cache of literature , of technocratic literature , and we found the smoking - gun quotes like John Williamson , who was the man who coined the term the Washington consensus , a very powerful Washington economist , admitting that there had never been a case of a developing world country accepting the Washington consensus without a crisis , and he gave a name for this , he called it “ The Crisis Hypothesis . ”
And it turns out that there had been all these studies conducted by think tanks , by academic economists , studying the interrelationship between what they call deep crisis and deep reform .
And once again , if you did n’t know what you were looking for , you would n’t necessarily read a paper with that title , you know ?
Anderson : Yeah .
Klein :
But once I knew what I was looking for , I started to see it all over the place .
Anderson :
So , can you briefly walk us through how a seemingly politically unrelated disaster , like a natural disaster , creates the condition for economic shock therapy and how it plays out from there ?
Klein : Yeah , I think what this comes out of is a profound understanding that the more radical pieces of the right - wing economic program like privatizing Social Security or privatizing water just do n’t enjoy popular support , and that creates a problem in a democracy — it does n’t create a problem in a dictatorship , because you can do it anyway in a dictatorship .
Anderson : Right .
Klein :
In fact , it was only dictatorships that were willing to impose these policies for the first decade in the ’70s .
It was Pinochet ’s Chile , Videla ’s Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay under military regimes that experimented with Chicago - school economics .
It was n’t until the ’80s that democratic governments started imposing them .
And that ’s when Milton Friedman wrote this sentence that I quote in the book : “ Only a crisis , actual or perceived , produces real change , and when that crisis occurs , the change that occurs depends on the ideas that are lying around . ”
And I think that phrase , “ ideas that are lying around , ” is really key to understanding how this works .
Because it ’s essentially a mission statement for the Washington think tanks , which Friedman was tremendously instrumental in building and inspiring and supporting .
And , you know , what we saw in the ’70s and early ’ 80s was an explosion of right - wing think tanks whose mission statement really was to get the ideas ready for when the next crisis hits .
And in some cases , what we see from a lot of these think tanks is that they also create atmospheres of crisis .
Just for fun , I would look at the list of papers published by the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute , looking for how many times the word crisis appears in a paper — “ the coming crisis in Medicare , ” “ the coming crisis in Social Security ” — so , they really specialize in claiming that countries are just doomed unless they follow this set of unwanted reforms .
But , to answer your question about natural disasters , the think tanks are instrumental in having the ideas ready , and the best example to me is Hurricane Katrina …
Anderson : Yeah .
Klein : … because the levees broke , and the state — all three levels of government failed — municipal , state , federal .
And really , the whole thing was an indictment of this very ideology .
Everyone was saying , “ Where is the government ?
Where ’s the government when you need it ? ”
And maybe this whole idea of vilifying the state was n’t such a great idea after all .
And even people like Jonah Goldberg were saying , you know , “ Where ’s big government when you need it ? ”
And I think a lot of people assumed that Katrina would be a wake - up call , an ideological wake - up call .
There was one writer who said it should be for the neocons , the breaking of the levees should be for the neocons what the fall of the Berlin Wall was for Communists .
And you know what , it should have been , but it was n’t , and it ’s for two reasons :
One , progressives were tentative and unwilling to really , I think , fill the breach with ideas of our own for how to reconstruct New Orleans in a completely different way , in a much more democratic way , and also to talk about global warming when there was a feeling of , you know , we do n’t want to be .
…
You often heard people say … “ This is n’t a time for politics . ”
Anderson : Right .
Klein : Well , meanwhile , at the Heritage Foundation , two weeks after the levees broke , they had a meeting — and we have the minutes from this meeting , which we can link to . …
Anderson : On the Documents and Resources section ?
Klein : Yeah , yeah — we definitely should link to this one .
The heading on the document is . …
Well , first of all , the people who attended the meeting were from a variety of right - wing think tanks , as well as the Republican Study Group — highly placed Republican congresspeople .
And they came up with 32 free - market solutions for Hurricane Katrina .
And it was everything from give parents school vouchers instead of rebuilding the public schools ; mixed - use housing instead of repairing the public housing ; drill in ANWR [ the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ] … ; build more oil refineries .
I mean , it was just the wish list !
And so what you see there is just , you know , the readiness of the right — aided by these think tanks , funded by multinational corporations and the richest families in the United States — to seize on a crisis that they themselves created with their ideology to push for more of the same .
I mean , Katrina was a catastrophe , the flooding of New Orleans was a catastrophe created by heavy weather linked to global warming , because the increase in category 5 hurricanes is directly linked to warming ocean temperatures , and weak infrastructure , which is linked to the systematic neglect of the public sphere as a result of the campaign to destroy the New Deal .
And what is their solution ?
It ’s more fossil fuels … and destroying the public infrastructure altogether .
And the fact is much of this has happened .
The public housing in New Orleans is being destroyed .
The hospitals — the public hospital in New Orleans is still not open , Charity Hospital .
The school system … has been handed over to charter schools .
Anderson :
So you would say that think tanks having these ideas lying around is kind of a way of cuing each other with their inside language to potential future opportunities ?
Klein :
Well , I mean , the ideas are the same no matter what the crisis is .
They just get rebranded to meet the crisis , right ?
So , suddenly privatizing Social Security is an economic stimulus to deal with the recession .
And suddenly , you know , school vouchers are part of reconstructing from a hurricane .
It ’s the same ideas .
So , it ’s easy to have them lying around , because you ’ve got the same answers to every problem .
And we ’re seeing it now with this huge push , led by [ Newt ] Gingrich , now picked up by Bush and McCain , to deal with the cost of high gas prices by drilling offshore , and they want to drill in ANWR — Gingrich does , and a lot of the right - wing think tanks .
So whatever the crisis is , it ’s an opportunity to just push harder for the same old policies that they have n’t been able to get through without a crisis .
…
As soon as … people started to really talk about recession , [ Treasury Secretary Henry ]
Paulson started talking about privatizing Social Security — a huge piece of the Bush platform that they could not get through without a crisis .
Anderson : I could see how maybe some followers of Milton Friedman might say you ’re drumming up conspiracy theories , but it ’s hard to argue with the evidence that you ’re presenting here and in your book .
So , what do you say , or what might you say , to critics who think you ’re making connections and seeing deliberate actions on the part of these governments that just are n’t there ?
Klein :
Well , everything in my book is documented .
And calling me a conspiracy theorist is just a political strategy .
It ’s not actually an argument — it ’s a way to not have an argument .
It ’s an argument avoidance strategy .
And , you know , I ’m really careful not to make any claims that I ca n’t source .
And my sources are the right - wing economists themselves , which is what I think drives them most crazy .
I mean , one of my most favorite reviews for the book was a negative review in the Financial Times where he says , “ The worst thing she does is quote the Financial Times to bolster her argument . ”
Anderson : Consider the source .
Klein :
It ’s true !
I found the Financial Times enormously [ helpful ] . …
And , you know , I do n’t quote other “ lefty , ” you know , analysts to support my claims , much as I may enjoy reading their writing .
That ’s not what ’s supporting this argument .
Now , I think there is a real pushback now from the true , you know , hard - core Friedman fanatics , like the Cato Institute has published an attack paper on the book , and … Reason [ magazine ] has sort of an unnatural obsession and so on .
But this is really about the Friedman legacy . …
It ’s not really about my book , because my book really is n’t about Milton Friedman .
My book talks about where Friedman fit into large historical forces .
And I ’m very clear in the book that if Milton Friedman had n’t played this role , somebody else would have let the counterrevolution against the New Deal , because it was n’t just his idea — it was a revolt of the elites who were tired of big trade unions , and they were tired of paying high taxes .
It was a pushback after many , many victories from the left .
And the University of Chicago , for various reasons , became ground zero for that pushback , for that counterrevolution .
And Milton Friedman , because he is a tremendous popularizer , really led the way and played an important historical role , meeting with many political leaders , acting as their adviser .
But this is n’t about him .
And , for instance , in this Cato Institute background paper , the writer talks a lot about how Milton Friedman only went to Chile once and met with Augusto Pinochet once , you know , that hardly constitutes influence .
Well , first of all , I make that clear in my book that he only went there once , but the whole point of those three chapters is that there was a massive program that was started by the U.S. State Department to bring hundreds of Latin American students to the University of Chicago to study .
Anderson : Right , the exchange program .
Klein : Yeah , and then to go back to Chile and take up top positions in Pinochet ’s government as finance minister , head of the Central Bank .
So , this is so much bigger than Friedman , and the response is only focused on Friedman .
And it ’s only focused on redeeming his name .
And … the truth is that the far right does n’t have , or the far economic right , does n’t have a lot of gurus , right … [ they ] do n’t have a lot of heroes like this .
There ’s Reagan … but intellectual heroes — there really are n’t many , right ?
Anderson : Right .
Klein : I mean , who — Ayn Rand ?
It ’s a thin bunch .
And Friedman and his family are really quite obsessed with legacy .
In one of his last interviews — I just saw a clip of it on the Cato Institute Web site — he talks about how the real test of his influence is not what people think of him now but what they ’ll think of him in 25 years .
So , there was , you know , a great deal of consciousness about securing a place in history .
And when Milton Friedman died in 2006 , it seemed that his place was pretty secure , I mean , the obituaries and memorials were just across - the - board hagiography .
And that ’s changing , you know , and that ’s threatening .
And so now there ’s this pushback that I think is really not about the economic legacy of these policies but much more about a man and his fans and his family wanting to protect their version of the role he played in history .
And what ’s interesting is that … the fiercest fight is actually happening right now at the University of Chicago , where it was announced three weeks ago that there ’s going to be a Milton Friedman Institute — a $ 200 - million Milton Friedman Institute — to carry his legacy forward , and it was launched by Gary Becker , who was one of his students and a real disciple — a true Chicago - school ideologue who still teaches at the school .
And what ’s interesting is that there ’s been a little bit of a rebellion of academics at the University of Chicago .
And more than 100 of these professors , faculty members , have signed a protest letter talking about how it ’s already so difficult for them … and these are not economists — they ’re anthropologists , they ’re historians , political scientists … how difficult it is for them to travel in the global South , like in Latin America and Africa , and be associated with the Chicago School of Economics , because it is seen as having done so much damage around the world .
This is really unprecedented — the idea that Milton Friedman ’s name would be seen as a liability at his own alma mater !
And what ’s striking to me is , when I read the letter , is that , you know , at the height of the Pinochet controversy in the ’70s , when Orlando Letelier accused Milton Friedman of being complicit in the human rights abuses and Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize , there was like a sort of flurry of protests , but only three professors at the time signed their names to this protest letter .
So , even at the height of these huge debates about torture , only three people sign their names , but now in 2008 , more than 100 faculty members at the University of Chicago are willing to sign their names .
Anderson :
Do you think it was out of fear before — or maybe losing their position , at the lower end of the crisis scale ?
Klein :
Well , I do n’t know , I think it still would be risky , right ?
Anderson : Yeah , sure .
Klein : I mean , especially because this is a $ 200 - million , you know , endowed gift to the university that it ’s easy to fundraise for precisely because Milton Friedman ’s policies are so very profitable !
And , you know , in this day and age , it ’s actually really rare for any building to be named after an academic , you know .
Anderson : Mmm-hmm .
Klein : Usually they ’re named after corporations or donors .
So , I mean , it says something about Milton Friedman in a sense that … I think that it ’s because he has been such a gift to corporate America that corporate America is willing to give back .
Anderson :
In the form of a building .
Klein : Yeah .
Anderson : Now , speaking of more recent events – on your Shock Doctrine Web site I ’ve been following updates and stories about more recent crises and catastrophes , and I thought of you yesterday because I read a headline about President Bush visiting flood - damaged Iowa and saying , “ You ’ll come back better ! ” from the damage and the floodwaters .
So can you talk a little bit about other events that have happened since the release of your book and contextualize them according to your ideas ?
Klein :
Well , first of all , always be afraid when George Bush says he ’s going to build back better , because we ’ve heard that line before .
What happens after disasters is that — it ’s not mysterious — what we need to do is look at what the pre-existing agenda was , right ?
Anderson : Yeah .
Klein :
And what was it that the business lobby in any given area wanted to do but could n’t because of people — because of people being there to defend their interests .
And it ’s a pretty good bet that those ideas will immediately resurface after the crisis hits and when people are least able to organize an effective opposition .
The most dramatic example of this is right now in Burma .
There was recently a piece in The Washington Post about how the Burmese regime immediately started parceling out the highly fertile land of the Irrawaddy Delta , which was the hardest - hit region by the cyclone , to their cronies , and just essentially treating the disaster … in the same way the tsunami was treated — as if it cleared the land and was now free to be parceled out . …
Anderson :
To fancy resorts .
Klein : Yeah , or more profitable agribusiness companies and industrial fishing because that area — which is Burma ’s rice bowl , the most fertile agricultural land — was like the coasts of Sri Lanka , was inhabited by small - scale farmers and fishing people .
They were in the way .
And it was an immediate shock doctrine move .
The other thing , of course , that generals did was use the disorientation and chaos to push through this constitutional referendum , which would have been , according to Burmese activists — it would ’ve been a focal point for a new wave of protests after the protests had been so brutally repressed last September .
But of course , there was no chance of that happening in the midst of the disaster .
So that ’s a pretty classic example of what I write about in the book — a really tragic one .
You know , China is a really interesting example , because , I think . …
One of the things I write about in the book is that the crises are volatile , and they can go either way , and the right has developed this shock doctrine strategy to have their ideas ready and move immediately when a crisis hits precisely because the fear is that the left will move — that it will unleash forces that are quite damaging .
Milton Friedman developed his crisis philosophy in response to watching how progressives responded to the Great Depression .
As far as Milton Friedman was concerned , everything went wrong with the response to the Great Depression , because that was what created the New Deal ; it was what created all the social programs that his ideological movement has been bent on dismantling for the past half - century .
So , he was well aware that these sort of market shocks can go in progressive directions , and there ’s many cases of this .
One example is Mexico in 1985 where there was an earthquake — terrible earthquake hit Mexico City .
But what happened was that the buildings that immediately fell apart , immediately collapsed , were overwhelmingly public housing , housing for poor people .
And buildings right next to those public housing buildings — privately owned or government buildings — sustained minimal damage .
So what the earthquake showed was what people suspected already , which was that the government had been cutting corners in building homes for poor people , that they had n’t respected safety codes , that they had probably taken all kinds of bribes along the way .
And it launched a democracy movement in Mexico that ultimately unseated the PRI — the 60 - year rule of the PRI .
And there ’s a whole analysis in Mexico about how everything started with that earthquake , and there ’s a book I read while I was researching “ The Shock Doctrine ” called “ Cracking Open Mexico ” that talks about the role of the earthquake .
So , if we look at what ’s happening in [ China ’s ]
Sichuan province , it ’s quite striking , because you have this same phenomenon with the schools , where many schools have collapsed — an estimated 10,000 children were killed in the earthquake .
And you have all these photographs of a school that just collapsed completely right next to a building that ’s standing intact .
And then you have the rage of the parents , and you have this added factor in China which is that the state told these parents that they could only have one child .
That was a state policy .
And you have these children who represent the hope for six adults — the grandparents and the parents — and now the state that forced these parents to have one child now appears to not have taken care of that child , neglected that child .
And , you know , there ’s something extremely powerful about the rage of the parent with nothing left to lose . …
Anderson : I ’ve seen those photos .
Klein : Amazing , right ?
Anderson : Yeah .
Klein :
So , China could end up being a counter - example to the shock doctrine , where I think the predictable response is what the Chinese government has already said , you know , we ’re going to build back better , with even bigger factories , you know , and they ’ve been very open about this , and we should expect nothing less .
China ’s economic development model is extraordinarily land - hungry .
Any land that is cleared they will obviously redesign , and they will put to the use of their vision of economic development .
So , that would n’t be a surprise if that happened .
They pretty much do that anyway .
But what would be really interesting is if this kick - started a democracy movement in China , and I do n’t think it ’s out of the question , because China ’s in a really tough position right now in terms of timing with the Games .
We are seeing repression and a locking down of critical coverage of the earthquake in the Chinese press , but I really feel like there ’s only so much they can do .
I mean , the Games are in two months , and I think after the crackdown in Tibet , they ’re very wary of more backlash .
Anderson :
What do you think about what ’s going to happen in the Midwest ?
Any prognostications ?
Klein :
You know , I do n’t have any yet .
What do you think ?
Anderson :
Well , I think that there will be parts of big cities that might be hard - hit , and that might find themselves restructured differently later .
I do n’t know too much about the city layouts of these places that were affected most , like Cedar Rapids , places like that .
So , I ’m interested , in kind of a morbid way , unfortunately , to see if something like what ’s gone on in New Orleans and other places that you describe in your book — if that ’s going to be the case . …
Klein :
Well , I think that … what ’s gonna happen is that it ’s intersecting with the global food crisis and the fact that the price[s ] of crops are at record highs right now , because of scarcity , and the agribusiness companies like Monsanto and Cargill are reporting record profits in the midst of a food crisis .
And I think there will be more land grabs ; I think that the few small - scale farmers , independent farmers , that are left are probably going to be gobbled up .
Anderson :
Are you at all optimistic about a possible regime change in the U.S. , if a Democrat in the White House would , in fact , represent this … ?
Klein :
You know , I ’m optimistic about the possibility of social movements in the U.S. demanding a change in ideology .
I ’m optimistic because I ’ve been blown away by the responses I ’ve been getting from the book and just how receptive people are to talking about systems as opposed to just people .
And I feel like the electoral campaigns — even though [ Barack ]
Obama ’s campaign has been inspiring in many ways , it ’s also been a way of not talking about politics at a moment when we have so many urgent issues calling out for real policy debates .
And instead we have been stuck in the political equivalent of “ American Idol , ” right ?
So , my optimism is entirely contingent on whether we can build counter - movements of the type that generated the New Deal , because I do n’t really think it ’s about the man in power .
I think if we look at Obama ’s economic inclinations , this is not where he ’s prone to take risks .
I think he ’s prone to take some risks with foreign policy much more than with domestic economic policy .
Anderson :
He ’s been criticized for that .
Klein :
Well , look at who he appointed as his chief economic adviser .
Anderson :
Well , I think that just about does it for me .
We will certainly direct our readers and listeners to your Shock Doctrine Web site to look at all the documents and also all the updates . …
Klein : Great .
I ’m so pleased that this is happening .
Thank you .
Anderson : Yeah , me too , and thanks so much for your time — I ’ve really enjoyed talking to you .
Klein : My pleasure .

Watch “ The Shock Doctrine ” film by Klein and director Alfonso Cuarón :
As early as fourth grade , students who will be at risk of failing the high school exit exam -- a state requirement to earn a diploma -- can be identified based on grades , classroom behavior and test scores , according to a new study released Tuesday .
The findings , based on an extensive study of student achievement in San Diego schools , call into question the effectiveness of aiming significant efforts and tens of millions of dollars at struggling high school seniors and older students to help them pass the exam .
“ From a political standpoint , such spending seems necessary .
However , our results strongly suggest that these 11th - hour interventions by themselves are unlikely to yield the intended results , ” according to the report by the Public Policy Institute of California .
Instead , the authors suggested , “ moving a portion of these tutoring dollars to struggling students in earlier grades -- when the students are still in school -- could be a wise choice .
An ounce of prevention could indeed be worth a pound of cure . ”

Assemblyman Pedro Nava ( D - Santa Barbara ) , who wrote legislation that provides more than $ 72 million annually for two years to tutor seniors who could n’t pass the exam , said it would be unfair to reduce support for older students to pay for increased support for younger ones .
“ I suppose they should sit down with the parents of these kids who are looking at failing the [ exit ] exam and persuade these parents that they do n’t need the money , ” Nava said .
“ Inherent in the conclusion of the report is that education needs help at all levels .
We should n’t be put in a position where we are pitting the outcomes of seniors against the future of preschoolers .
That makes no sense . ”
State Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell said school districts ought to have greater flexibility in how they spend such funds .
“ We need to have comprehensive intervention and not wait till 12th grade , ” he said .
Advertisement
Additionally , he said , the study underscored the need for universal preschool , as well as expanding the state ’s class - size reduction efforts .
The exit exam was created by state legislators in an effort to standardize the achievement of high school graduates across the state ’s 1,053 school districts .
Students in the class of 2006 were the first who were required to pass the exam to receive diplomas .
From their sophomore through senior years , students have six chances to take the exam , which includes math and English .
Students must score at least 55 % on the math portion , which is eighth - grade level , and 60 % on the English part , which is ninth - or 10th - grade level .
More than 93 % of students pass the exam by the end of their senior year .
Educators said the study results are buttressed by earlier research that shows early academic achievement , the mastering of basic math skills and reading comprehension , is a building block for future success .

“ We ’ve recognized for a long time that performance in the earlier grades is one of the best indicators of success later in school and in life , ” said Chris Eftychiou , spokesman for the Long Beach Unified School District .
At Pasadena High School , guidance counselor Allison Steppes said she worried that social promotion and lack of parental involvement led to some students passing through elementary schools without mastering basic skills .
“ I do n’t think we ’re doing enough at the elementary stages because it ’s ridiculous to get to 12th grade , take the [ exit exam ] six times and still not pass it , ” she said .
But she questioned the validity of a student retaking the test after failing it half a dozen times .
Steppes said she advised students who repeatedly failed the exam but finished 12th grade to get their high school degree at a community college , which does not require students to pass the exam .

“ I want the student to move on with life , ” she said .

Al got an advance review copy of neal Stephenson 's new book Anathem — which looks really good ! — and discovered that it came wiht a CD of music inspired by the story .
Incredibly weird , wonderful music .
I 've just listened to several of the songs on this CD and , frankly , this is some weird shit .
I say this without reservation .
The musical styles are all over the map except that they all only use human voices ( and occasionally hands ) .
Some of it is similar to Western , Christian , styles of chanting .
Other tracks are more Classical vocal arrangements with singing .
The rest of the tracks seem to be heavily influenced by Eastern , Buddhist , styles of chanting , especially Tibetan Buddhism with its use of harmonics and overlaying voices .
It varies quite a bit from song to song .
Additionally , when there are recognizable words , they are not in English ( nor in any language that I recognize ) .
" Celluar Automata " is the weirdest track of this sort with multiple voices weaving in and out , along with some clapping and exclamations in an unknown language .
" Thousander Chant " would be at home on some of the collections of Tibetan chanting that I have and whoever is performing it is obviously trained in the throat chanting used by Tibetans and others in Asia .
As it happens , I actually know the guy who made this — it 's David Stutz , the former free software maven for Microsoft whose resignation letter was a brilliant work of analysis explaining just what Microsoft should be doing to co-exist with free / open source software .
He was also a key developer for the NeXT , Visual Basic and a lot of other widely used technologies .
These days , he has a winery and makes incredibly strange , beautiful traditional music .

WASHINGTON  Groping for a quick response to rising gas prices , Congress voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to order the Bush administration to stop depositing oil in a national reserve even though lawmakers predicted the impact for consumers would be modest at best .
“ Is it a giant step ?
No , ” said Senator Byron L. Dorgan , Democrat of North Dakota , a leading proponent of the idea of trying to influence the price of gas by redirecting supplies from the reserve to the commercial market .
“ But is it a step finally , at long last , in the right direction ?
It is . ”
Despite initial resistance from the White House , the Senate voted 97 to 1 to stop putting 70,000 barrels of oil a day in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the remainder of this year ; the House later approved a similar bill by a vote of 385 to 25 .
Senators of both parties said the House bill could clear the Senate within days and be sent to the president .
The rapid action demonstrated lawmakers ’ anxiety about election - year howls from constituents who are straining the family budget at the gas pump .
It also was a rare break between Congressional Republicans and Mr. Bush as his usual allies voted en masse for the measure even though the White House has portrayed filling the reserve as a security issue and a way to guard against supply disruptions .

Tom McGee 's business is surging faster than the price of gasoline .
That 's because PMP Corp. is one of the few places in the U.S. that gas stations can turn to when they need old - style gas pumps adapted to register prices over $ 4 a gallon .
The mechanical dials on many vintage pumps can't register prices over $ 3.99 a gallon or ring up single sales north of $ 99.99 , which helps explain why Mr. McGee held an emergency meeting at his company here May 21 .
The brainstorming session , in a conference room at PMP , focused on how to increase output at the small factory in the face of a sudden surge of demand for its extremely specialized service .
PMP takes the mechanical internal organs from old gas pumps and modifies them so they can tally higher numbers .
Many small - town stations , especially in remote , rural areas , can't afford to buy new pumps , which can cost as much as $ 10,000 each .
PMP 's retrofits are between $ 600 and $ 800 .
" Our business was relatively flat until the first week of March , " says Mr. McGee , the company 's president .
" Then the price of fuel , mainly kerosene and diesel , went over $ 4 " a gallon and the phone has n't stopped ringing .
PMP has a 20 - week backlog , up from three days in March , and Mr. McGee 's 70 workers are doing maximum overtime .
He has hired more temporary workers , but it is slow getting them up to speed .
The labor - intensive work involves tasks such as printing new numbers on the spinning wheels that form the core of the pricing mechanisms .
His suppliers are running out of crucial parts .
Only a handful of companies offer this retrofitting .
The work is also done by pump manufacturers like Gilbarco Veeder - Root , part of industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp. , of Washington , D.C.
An estimated 8,500 of the nation 's 170,000 gas stations have the old - style pumps , according to Bob Renkes , executive vice president of the Petroleum Equipment Institute .
" Mostly they 're mom-and - pops , in rural areas like the Dakotas , Mississippi , " says Mr. Renkes .
Each state has its own rules for what stations have to do to adapt to higher prices .
Some are allowing " half - gallon pricing " until the stations can have their equipment upgraded .
But that is against the law in Kentucky , which fears consumer confusion .
Minnesota is more easygoing -- to a point .
Stations can keep using the old pumps indefinitely , but must tape over the price gauge -- while leaving the gallon gauge visible .
That way , buyers know how much fuel they have taken and can settle with the attendant , who presumably will become deft at using a calculator .
Mr. McGee is philosophical about his business : " We know this is a windfall and that it will eventually pass , " he says .
" And this is n't really a very profitable part of our business , so it 's not like we 're making tons of money on this . "
PMP , founded in 1950 as Petroleum Meter & Gas , also renovates other gas - station devices , such as the small printers in modern digital gas pumps .
The company , which is private , did n't disclose its sales .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Siberia ’s Lake Baikal has warmed faster than global air temperatures over the past 60 years , which could put animals unique to the world ’s largest lake in jeopardy , U.S. and Russian scientists said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The lake has warmed 1.21 degrees Celsius ( 2.18 degrees Fahrenheit ) since 1946 due to climate change , almost three times faster than global air temperatures , according to a paper by the scientists to be published next month in the journal “ Global Change Biology . ”
“ The whole food web could shift , ” Marianne Moore , a biology professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts and one of the authors of the paper , said in an interview .
The frigid lake , which holds 20 percent of the world ’s freshwater , boasts 2,500 species , most of them found nowhere else , such as the world ’s only exclusively freshwater seal .
In potentially bad news for that animal , the paper found that the lake ’s annual days of ice cover had fallen an average of 18 days over the last 100 years and could drop two weeks to two months more by the end of the century .
The findings could foreshadow the vulnerability of smaller lakes to global warming because Baikal ’s great volume of water had been thought to protect it from rising temperatures , the paper said .
Moore said Baikal ’s seal , which raises its pups on the ice , could suffer because the animal has several onshore predators .
If ice caves the pups are raised in melt , Asian crows could also eat the pups , she said .
Changes in the food cycle have already been seen .
Numbers of multicellular zooplankton , which normally live in warmer waters , have increased 335 percent since 1946 , while numbers of chlorophyll have risen 300 percent since 1979 , it said .
In addition , the number of diatoms , which live under the ice and later die and become food for tiny organisms living in the lake ’s depths , could fall , Moore said .
“ Ice recession may have a greater effect than the rising temperatures , ” she said .

The rate of climate warming over northern Alaska , Canada , and Russia could more than triple during extended episodes of rapid sea ice loss , according to a new study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) .
The findings raise concerns about the thawing of permafrost , or permanently frozen soil , and the potential consequences for sensitive ecosystems , human infrastructure , and the release of additional greenhouse gases .
“ The rapid loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region , ” said Andrew Slater , NSIDC research scientist and a co-author on the study , which was led by David Lawrence of NCAR .
The findings will be published Friday in Geophysical Research Letters .
Last summer , Arctic sea ice extent shrank to a record low .
From August to October last year , air temperatures over land in the western Arctic were also unusually warm , reaching more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) above the 1978 - 2006 average .
This led the researchers to question whether the unusually low sea ice extent and warm land temperatures were related .
Lawrence , Slater , and colleagues used a climate model to explore the relationship between low sea ice extent , increased air temperatures , and permafrost thawing .
Previous climate change simulations identified periods of rapid sea ice loss that last 5 to 10 years .
The new study shows that during such episodes , Arctic land would warm 3.5 times faster than average rates of warming predicted by global climate models for the 21st century .
The findings point to a link between rapid sea ice loss and enhanced rate of climate warming , which could penetrate as far as 900 miles inland .
In areas where permafrost is already at risk , such as central Alaska , the study suggests that periods of abrupt sea ice loss can lead to rapid soil thaw .
Thawing permafrost may have a range of impacts , including buckled highways and destabilized houses , as well as changes to the delicate balance of life in the Arctic .
In addition , scientists estimate that Arctic soils hold at least 30 percent of all the carbon stored in soils worldwide .
While scientists are uncertain what will happen if this permafrost thaws , it has the potential to contribute substantial amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere .
Funding for the research came from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy .

This image , released on May 31 , 2008 , shows the ground underneath NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander , adding to evidence that descent thrusters dispersed overlying soil and exposed a harder substrate that may be ice .
NASA ?s Phoenix Mars Lander may have already caught its first glimpse of Martianice less than a week after arriving at its new red planet home .
New images released Saturday reveal what could be a patch of exposedice beneath the Phoenix lander , mission managers said in an announcement today .
Phoenix beamed the images back to Earth late Friday from its Vastitas Borealislanding site in the northern polar region of Mars after using a roboticarm - mounted camera to peer beneath its undercarriage .
The new views revealed patches of smooth , level surfaces beneath Phoenix ?
sthrusters , boosting the confidence of researchers who had hoped the spacecraft ?
spulse rocket engines could kick up the Martian topsoil to expose a buriedlayer of water ice .
" This suggests we have an ice table under a thin layerof loose soil , " said Horst Uwe Keller , the lead scientist for Phoenix ?s roboticarm camera at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research inKatlenburg - Lindau , Germany .
Phoenix , a stationary lander , setdown in the Martian arctic on May 25 to begin a planned three - month missionto probe its surroundings for buried water ice using a scoop - mounted robotic arm , as well as onboard ovens and wet chemistry lab .
The probe ?s $ 422 millionmission is aimed at determining whether the icy Martian north could have oncebeen habitable for primitive life .
" We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of thesurface , " said Phoenix principal investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in a statement .
" The thrusters have excavated two tosix inches and , sure enough , we see something that looks like ice .
It 's notimpossible that it 's something else , but our leading interpretation is ice . "
Phoenix pulsed its rocket engines to make a three - point landing on abroad , flat valley in a region similar in latitude northwestern Canada onEarth .
The area is in a region where spacecraft orbiting Mars have spottedindications of subsurface water ice in the past , making it a prime digging sitefor Phoenix ?s robotic arm .
NASA ?s Phoenix spacecraft is one of three now currently operating on thesurface of Mars .
The lander joined two twin robots , the Spirit and Opportunity rovers , whichlanded in 2004 and continue to explore different areas of the planet ?s equatorialregions .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices hit yet another record Sunday , with more than half the nation 's states paying more than $ 4 per gallon on average , according to a daily survey from motorist group AAA .
The national average price for regular unleaded gasoline climbed slightly to $ 4.077 a gallon , according to AAA 's Web site .
The average topped $ 4 for the first time last week after crude oil prices surged to a trading record above $ 139 per barrel .
The price has swung back and forth in a $ 10 range since then .
Gas is most expensive in California , according to the survey , averaging $ 4.597 , followed by Alaska at $ 4.436 .
Missouri has the lowest average price at $ 3.834 , followed by Oklahoma at $ 3.846 .
Gasoline prices in the survey have risen 35 percent from a year ago when they averaged $ 3.018 .
On its Web site , AAA says the information is gathered by Oil Price Information Service based on credit card swipes at 85,000 gasoline stations across the nation .

Jesus and Moses
Ralph van den Berg ( 22 May , 2008 ) Posted by :( 22 May , 2008 )
A burglar broke into a house one night .
He shined his flashlight around , looking for valuables ; and when he picked up a CD player to place in his sack , a strange , disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying , " Jesus is watching you . "
He nearly jumped out of his skin , clicked his flashlight off , and froze .
When he heard nothing more after a bit , he shook his head and continued .
Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires , clear as a bell he heard , " Jesus is watching you . "
Freaked out , he shined his light around frantically , looking for the source of the voice .
Finally , in the corner of the room , his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot .
Did you say that ? "
He hissed at the parrot .
" Yep , " the parrot confessed , then squawked , " I 'm just trying to warn you . "
The burglar relaxed .
" Warn me , huh ?
Who in the world are you ? "
" Moses , " replied the bird .
" Moses ? " the burglar laughed .
" What kind of people would name a bird Moses ? "
" The kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus . "

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - The Dalai Lama , Tibet ’s exiled spiritual leader , said on Friday he did not support a boycott of the Beijing Olympic Games .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Asked on NBC “ Nightly News ” whether he wanted the world to boycott the Olympics this summer , the Dalai Lama replied , “ No . ”
Asked if he wanted the United States and other world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony in support of Tibet , he replied , “ That ’s up to them . ”
“ It is very important to make clear , not only just the Tibet case .
But in China proper , the report of human right is poor .
And their freedom , also very poor , ” the Dalai Lama said .
Asked what his message to China was , he said : “ My main point is : We are not against you .
And I ’m not seeking separation . ’”
China blames the Dalai Lama for orchestrating monk - led protests in Tibet last month that later turned violent as part of a campaign for independence .
The Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule , denies involvement .
The European Parliament has urged European Union leaders to boycott the opening ceremony at the Beijing Olympic Games unless China starts talks with the Dalai Lama over the situation in Tibet .
In Washington , the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a resolution urging China to open dialogue with the Dalai Lama , end a crackdown on nonviolent Tibetan protesters and halt repression in the region .
Demonstrations against China ’s suppression of Tibetan protests have followed the progress of the Olympic flame in Europe , the United States and Latin America , prompting a nationalist backlash from China ’s authorities and media .
The Dalai Lama is in Seattle for a five - day Seeds of Compassion conference .
Energy issues were at the top of the summit's agenda Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev and top EU officials have announced the start of talks on a new strategic partnership agreement .
The start of negotiations has been long delayed , amid strained ties under Mr Medvedev 's predecessor , Vladimir Putin .
But , at a meeting with EU officials in the Siberian city of Khanty - Mansiysk , Mr Medvedev said he was looking for a " new impulse " to relations with the EU .
The talks will formally begin on 4 July in Brussels , he said .
They will primarily focus on trade - Russia is the EU 's third biggest trading partner and half of all Russian exports go to the EU .
Objections lifted A relaxed Mr Medvedev hailed the " sincere , neighbourly " mood at the summit , and EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he " really enjoyed this ... very open , relaxed , constructive atmosphere " .
Mr Putin stayed away from the summit .
But despite much talk of co-operation and mutual interest , old problems reared their heads , says the BBC's James Rodgers .
President Medvedev said Russia was alarmed by what he called a tendency to use European solidarity to promote the interests of individual members in bilateral disputes with Russia .
He also harshly criticised US plans to site missile defence facilities in Europe , and warned the EU against relying on others to ensure security in Europe .
Indeed , Russia proposed a new treaty covering security across the European continent - a suggestion it said was warmly welcomed .
Objections dropped
The new agreement is meant to replace the previous 10 - year deal , which expired in 2007 , but will continue to govern relations until the new text comes into force .
Talks had been stalled since late 2006 , when Warsaw objected to a Russian ban on meat imports from Poland .
Fuel woes overshadow talks
After that Lithuania held up progress , saying it wanted discussions on Russia 's support for separatists in Georgia and Moldova .
It dropped its objections in May , allowing talks to go ahead .
Energy supplies were a key issue at the summit , with the EU getting about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia .
The host city is at the heart of Russia 's oil boom and more than 4,000 km ( 2,500 miles ) from Brussels .
The European Commission says it wants the new partnership agreement to establish " a level playing field for energy relations " .
New cloud Russia 's previous gas rows with its former Soviet neighbours - especially Ukraine - have made Europe nervous , our correspondent says .
Among the other subjects covered by the summit were financial market stability , the rise of sovereign wealth funds , climate change and the current food crisis .
There was a potential new stumbling block raised on the eve of the summit , when Finland - a major Russian trading partner - announced it was considering retaliation for Russian moves to increase export duties on raw timber .
The country said Russia 's measures - which it says are designed to bolster the country 's paper - processing industry - would cost up to 16,000 jobs in Finland .

AMMAN , Jordan , June 13 ( UPI ) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki Friday detailed his differences with the United States on a new security agreement between the two nations .
Maliki said that negotiations between his Baghdad government and the United States are at an impasse , The New York Times reported .
The status - of - forces agreement would replace the U.N. mandate , which expires at the end of the year .

" The American version of the agreement infringes hugely on the sovereignty of Iraq and this is something that we cannot ever accept , " he told newspaper editors in Amman , Jordan .
Iraq cannot accept immunity for U.S. soldiers and contractors operating within its borders , he said .
It also cannot allow U.S. forces to carry out military or security operations independently , to arrest Iraqis independently or to use Iraqi airspace and waterways without permission .
On Thursday , after a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan , Maliki was somewhat more conciliatory emphasizing continuing negotiations .

Thursday ’s landmark ruling by ICANN , the organisation that regulates the domain name registration system , is set to shake up the way everybody uses the Internet .
Scratch beneath the surface , and one wonders if the groundwork is being laid for a new categorisation system for websites – if so , how will these new categories be enforced , by whom , and are the only real winners here the domain registrars themselves ?
ICANN passed a unanimous vote to relax the rules that currently limit the top - level domains ( TLD ) of web addresses – that ’s .com , .net , .biz , and so on .
The new ruling means that , technically , anyone will be able to register almost anything as their TLD ( within a 64 character limit ) .
The proposal will also have to become law , and if so , could come into effect as early as 2009 .
“ This was an extremely successful meeting that will be remembered as a milestone in the development of the internet , ” said ICANN chairman Peter Dengate Thrush .
For example , Microsoft might decide to register .microsoft .
The Los Angeles Lakers might like the idea of .lalakers , and Google have probably already figured out a way to put . google on the map .
It ’s not just limited to organisations , either – John Smith might like the idea of . smith or , if he was just a tad too slow , . johnsmith .
Or possibly all John Smith ’s will be required to use that TLD .
All of these things would replace .com , and the way you think about website URLs would become a little bit backward – the TLD will become more important than the name of the website itself , certainly in the way we look at a URL to determine content .
Essentially , we ’ve done away with the need for www , and now we ’re doing away with the need for com – we ca n’t be too far away from the use of common English in URLs .
Or , indeed , any other language – one bonus of this new system is that it will recognise non-English characters ( for example , Chinese or Arabic ) .
It ’s not all upside , though – and let ’s face it , there does n’t appear to be too much of that .
More than a few concerns have been raised .
As it is now , the top - level domain system is pretty simple .
For most organisations , .com , .net and a few major countries is all they really need to cover themselves .
With this new ruling , however , there ’s a chance they may have to register hundreds or even thousands of URLs to be truly safe .
I mean , microsoft is all well and good , but how many people might enter . windows , .vista or .office into their browsers instead ?
These will all become TLDs , remember , and their market value will suddenly boom accordingly .
Which means , of course , that we ’re going to experience a potentially nostalgic phase of millions of domain names being registered by people who do n’t have any right to actually use them .
It ’s gonna get ugly .
And it ’s going to get expensive – the registrars , and corporate lawyers , are going to make out like bandits .
We ’re talking hundreds of millions , maybe billions of dollars here , as every current domain name will need to be re-registered to become a TLD .
And all the sub - domains , too .
And pretty much anything else you can think of .
Or perhaps this new system wo n’t be quite this casual .
There ’s potential here to re-classify the web – to categorise it .
On June 1 , 2005 , ICANN announced that .xxx would become a top - level domain , and other TLDs , such as .aero and . travel would also be available .
The idea was never implemented , and on March 10 , 2006 , ICANN reversed its decision .
The .xxx proposal was rejected again in March 2007 .
Even if the TLD was a dream for parents and employers – instead of endlessly updating content filters , you just block .xxx , and all of your problems are solved – ICANN did n’t like the idea that they ’d have to operate as some kind of regulator .
“ What is pornography ? ” is a harder question to answer than you might initially suspect , certainly when it comes to keeping everybody happy .
The reality is , most porn websites do n’t like the idea of .xxx , specifically because it brands them , which as we ’ve seen makes them a lot easier to eliminate – what ’s to stop an ISP blocking .xxx ?
Plus , of course , a lot of their business comes from ‘ accidental ’ browsing .
That ’s where your husband tells you he was actually looking at something on Wikipedia and then he clicked on a link and was suddenly , and to his horror , on a porn site .
The days of those feeble excuses will soon be history – a quick glance down at the status bar will soon confirm exactly what kind of site you ’re about to visit .
Or will it ?
While the idea of categorisation does have some potential , it ’s only going to work if you have to do it .
If it ’s optional , most organisations wo n’t bother .
The porn industry almost certainly wo n’t .
But if they have to – if it can in any way be enforced – why should it be limited to porn ?
Will all booksellers be made to use .books ?
Technology sites will have to be part of . tech ?
And will blogs be forced to use . blog ?
What about sites that cover all of these subjects ?
And what happens if you refuse ?
All of this pushes the web even closer to the ‘ real ’ world – you do n’t , for example , accidentally pick up Playboy at a newsstand .
It ’s a purposeful move on your part .
A categorised TLD web would be exactly like this , simply because the top - level domain would become more informative than the name of the company .
The content of a URL like geekstuff. books is communicated to the user as quickly as amazon.books , or any other site that ends in that TLD .
Likewise , if you click on a .xxx link , and certainly if you type one in , you have no alibi .
No excuse .
You knew exactly what you were doing .
And so do ICANN .
We inmates are very limited in the things we can access , but because of your great program , I ’ve been able to learn more about the law and my rights , draw better and even write my first novel .
But faking is n't just a skill reserved for fictional characters .
It may be more common than expected .
In fact , 53 % of people lie on their résumé in some way , according to research from the Society for Human Resource Managers .
Some college students are encouraged to embellish items on their résumés .
" They are taught to use the highest - level verb , " says Nancy Davis , a psychology professor at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology .
For instance , an intern who ran copies of an instruction manual might say he " created " the manual on his résumé , Davis says .
But the step from résumé embellishment to outright faking is n't a long one .
Awareness of résumé cooking could make job applicants feel they must push the envelope on their application , if only because everyone else is doing it ( a frame of thought psychologists call false consensus ) .
Melinda Blackman says that this is already common and that the recent scarcity of jobs encourages résumé flexing even more .
Blackman , an industrial and organizational psychology professor at California State University at Fullerton , said she had a graduate student say he had completed an undergraduate program he had n't attended .
She found this out two years after accepting him into the program .
Many candidates lie on applications because they do n't think they 'll get caught .
Sure , some companies shell out thousands to vet candidates : Blackman has seen employers pay as much as $ 7,000 to thoroughly check a candidate for a high - level position .
Such costly checks usually include a drug test , background check and credit check ; some firms even hire a private detective .
But most companies do n't have the time or money to invest .
Experts say the education section of an application or résumé is the most likely to be fraudulent .
The amount of time it takes to confirm the details depends on the university .
Some use efficient systems that take a matter of hours , while others need several weeks to process and confirm the résumé .
Meanwhile , employers worry that their job candidate of choice will find a position elsewhere .
Background checks are not only important to prove the employee is who he says he is .
They 're also a way to avoid a negligent - hiring suit , which could happen if , say , the company hired someone with a history of violence and that person attacked another employee .
Blackman also suggests multiple interviews ( formal and informal ) to give a candidate more chances to raise suspicions .
For the formal interview , another person should sit in with a copy of the résumé , to check what the candidate says for contradictions .
Maybe employers should start hiring fakers to find the fakers .

Startups can bring new ideas to market .
They can give people a chance to change the world on their own terms .
They can create something where nothing existed before .
There is no doubt that they are exciting things to be a part of .
But , as much as the tech world tries to treat them as special , we do n’t believe startups are special .
They are n’t born out of big bang moments where the laws that govern other businesses do n’t apply .
From the moment they go live , startups are as real as any other business .
They are governed by the same set of market forces and economic precepts that wrap around every other company , new or old .
At the atomic level , all businesses need to generate revenue to pay their bills , grow their business , and stay in business .
The sooner they find themselves in the black , the better chance they ’ll have to survive .
Call it a business survival instinct — businesses have to feed themselves or they ’ll die .
Suggesting startups — specifically tech startups — do n’t need to look for revenue opportunities now is akin to spoiling a child and shielding them from the outside world :
They ’re far less prepared when they eventually have to leave the house for the first time .
A poorly run startup is a poorly run business .
A wonderfully run startup is a wonderfully run business .
I do n’t believe there are many great startups that are bad businesses .
Maybe less than 1 % .
If the business is bad the startup is bad .
A great idea , maybe , but a great business , no .
So if you start something up , start a business , do n’t start a startup .

Since its inception in the early 20th century , neuroscience has taught us a tremendous amount about the brain .
Our sensations have been reduced to a set of specific circuits .
The mind has been imaged as it thinks about itself , with every thought traced back to its cortical source .
The most ineffable of emotions have been translated into the terms of chemistry , so that the feeling of love is just a little too much dopamine .
Fear is an excited amygdala .
Even our sense of consciousness is explained away with references to some obscure property of the frontal cortex .
It turns out that there is nothing inherently mysterious about those 3 pounds of wrinkled flesh inside the skull .
There is no ghost in the machine .
The success of modern neuroscience represents the triumph of a method : reductionism .
The premise of reductionism is that the best way to solve a complex problem -- and the brain is the most complicated object in the known universe -- is to study its most basic parts .
The mind , in other words , is just a particular trick of matter , reducible to the callous laws of physics .
But the reductionist method , although undeniably successful , has very real limitations .
Not everything benefits from being broken down into tiny pieces .
Look , for example , at a Beethoven symphony .
If the music is reduced to wavelengths of vibrating air -- the simple sum of its physics -- we actually understand less about the music .
The intangible beauty , the visceral emotion , the entire reason we listen in the first place -- all is lost when the sound is reduced into its most elemental details .
In other words , reductionism can leave out a lot of reality .
The mind is like music .
While neuroscience accurately describes our brain in terms of its material facts -- we are nothing but a loom of electricity and enzymes -- this is n’t how we experience the world .
Our consciousness , at least when felt from the inside , feels like more than the sum of its cells .
The truth of the matter is that we feel like the ghost , not like the machine .
If neuroscience is going to solve its grandest questions , such as the mystery of consciousness , it needs to adopt new methods that are able to construct complex representations of the mind that are n’t built from the bottom up .
Sometimes , the whole is best understood in terms of the whole .
William James , as usual , realized this first .
The eight chapters that begin his 1890 textbook , “ The Principles of Psychology , ” describe the mind in the conventional third - person terms of the experimental psychologist .
Everything changes , however , with Chapter 9 .
James starts this section , “ The Stream of Thought , ” with a warning : “ We now begin our study of the mind from within . ”
With that single sentence , James tried to shift the subject of psychology .
He disavowed any scientific method that tried to dissect the mind into a set of elemental units , be it sensations or synapses .
Modern science , however , did n’t follow James ’ lead .
In the years after his textbook was published , a “ New Psychology ” was born , and this rigorous science had no use for Jamesian vagueness .
Measurement was now in vogue .
Psychologists were busy trying to calculate all sorts of inane things , such as the time it takes for a single sensation to travel from your finger to your head .
By quantifying our consciousness , they hoped to make the mind fit for science .
Unfortunately , this meant that the mind was defined in very narrow terms .
The study of experience was banished from the laboratory .
But it ’s time to bring experience back .
Neuroscience has effectively investigated the sound waves , but it has missed the music .
Although reductionism has its uses -- it is , for instance , absolutely crucial for helping us develop new pharmaceutical treatments for mental illnesses -- its limitations are too significant to allow us to answer our biggest questions .
As the novelist Richard Powers wrote , “ If we knew the world only through synapses , how could we know the synapse ? ”
The question , of course , is how neuroscience can get beyond reductionism .
Science rightfully adheres to a strict methodology , relying on experimental data and testability , but this method could benefit from an additional set of inputs .
Artists , for instance , have studied the world of experience for centuries .
They describe the mind from the inside , expressing our first - person perspective in prose , poetry and paint .
Although a work of art obviously is n’t a substitute for a scientific experiment -- Proust is n’t going to invent Prozac -- the artist can help scientists better understand what , exactly , they are trying to reduce in the first place .
Before you break something apart , it helps to know how it hangs together .
Virginia Woolf , for example , famously declared that the task of the novelist is to “ examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day ... [ tracing ] the pattern , however disconnected and incoherent in appearance , which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness . ”
In other words , she wanted to describe the mind from the inside , to distill the details of our psychological experience into prose .
That ’s why her novels have endured : because they feel true .
And they feel true because they capture a layer of reality that reductionism cannot .
As Noam Chomsky said , “ It is quite possible -- overwhelmingly probable , one might guess -- that we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology . ”
In this sense , the arts are an incredibly rich data set , providing neuroscience with a glimpse behind its blind spots .
Some of the most exciting endeavors in neuroscience right now are trying to move beyond reductionism .
The Blue Brain Project , for example , a collaboration between the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne , Switzerland , and IBM , is in the process of constructing a biologically accurate model of the brain that can be used to simulate experience on a supercomputer .
Henry Markram , the leader of the project , recently told me that he ’s convinced “ reductionism peaked five years ago . ”
While Markram is quick to add that the reductionism program is n’t complete -- “ There is still so much that we do n’t know about the brain , ” he says -- he ’s trying to solve a harder problem , which is figuring out how all these cellular details connect together .
“ The Blue Brain Project ” he says , “ is about showing people the whole . ”
In other words , Markram wants to hear the music .
One day , we ’ll look back at the history of neuroscience and realize that reductionism was just the first phase .
Each year , tens of thousands of neuroscience papers are published in scientific journals .
The field is introduced to countless new acronyms , pathways and proteins .
At a certain point , however , all of this detail starts to have diminishing returns .
After all , the real paradox of the brain is why it feels like more than the sum of its parts .
How does our pale gray matter become the Technicolor cinema of consciousness ?
What transforms the water of the brain into the wine of the mind ?
Where does the self come from ?
Reductionism can’t answer these questions .
According to the facts of neuroscience , your head contains 100 billion electrical cells , but not one of them is you , or knows you or cares about you .
In fact , you do n’t even exist .
You are simply an elaborate cognitive illusion , an “ epiphenomenon ” of the cortex .
Our mystery is denied .
Obviously , this scientific solution is n’t very satisfying .
It confines neuroscience to an immaculate abstraction , unable to reduce the only reality we will ever know .
Unless our science moves beyond reductionism and grapples instead with the messiness of subjective experience -- what James called a “ science of the soul ” -- its facts will grow increasingly remote .
The wonder of the brain is that it can be described in so many ways :
We are such stuff as dreams are made on , but we are also just stuff .
What we need is a science that can encompass both sides of our being .

Five banks have gone into receivership this year , the latest of which is IndyMac which became the largest OTS - regulated savings and loan to fail and second - biggest financial institution to close behind Continental Illinois in 1984 , according to the FDIC .
Nonetheless , the FDIC is very fond of saying " No saver has ever lost a dime in federally insured deposits . "
That 's fine and dandy but inquiring minds are looking ahead and asking " How much uninsured money is at risk , not just at IndyMac but in the entire system ? "
It 's a good question , but first let 's dig a litter deeper into what is happening at IndyMac .
IndyMac Answer Sheet
The FDIC has a Failed Bank Information Answer Sheet on IndyMac to answer depositor questions .
Here are answers to 3 questions of general interest you may not know .
2 . I am a deposit broker or I have a deposit through a broker .
What do I need to do ?
If you are a customer who has an IndyMac Bank deposit through a broker , you must contact your broker with any questions .
Once the FDIC receives a balanced investor file along with all the required documentation , from your broker , your insured funds will be wired to them on your behalf .
4 . Will I collect my uninsured deposits ?
If it is determined that you have some uninsured funds , the FDIC will mail you a Receiver Certificate .
This certificate entitles you to share proportionately in any funds recovered through the sale of the assets of IndyMac Bank .
You will eventually recover some of your uninsured funds .
Of course , you will receive immediate full payment for your insured amount by transfer to IndyMac Federal Bank or from your broker .
In addition , the FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend of 50 % of your uninsured deposit .
For an explanation of the dividend process go to FDIC Dividends from Failed Banks .
11 . Will I continue to earn interest at the same rate ?
Yes , interest will continue to accrue at the contract rate on all non -broker deposits .
If you deposited funds through a broker , the interest will accrue and be paid through Friday , July 11 , 2008 .
50 Cents On The Dollar
" You can count on us " was their slogan .
Not quite .
IndyMac Bancorp Inc. had $ 1 billion of uninsured , unsecured , and unprotected consumer deposits at stake .
The 10,000 uninsured depositors will get 50 cents on the dollar now and wait for the rest .
IndyMac is a much bigger version of last September 's failure of Alpharetta , Ga. - based NetBank , which had $ 109 million of uninsured deposits at the time of its failure .
Uninsured NetBank depositors got 50 cents on the dollar and a conservator 's certificate for the rest .
Four other banks failed this year and uninsured depositors have received no immediate reimbursement .
This time the stakes are much higher .
IndyMac 's uninsured depositors ' balances are about 10 times that of NetBank 's -- 10,000 uninsured depositors with a total of $ 1 billion in deposits .
The average payoff over the past 12 years has been 72 cents on the dollar .
It can take years to collect whatever is left for the uninsured depositors .
Total FDIC Insured Deposits
Total Bank Deposits
$ 6.84 Deposits - $ 4.24 Insured Deposits = $ 2.6 Trillion Uninsured Bank Deposits
5 . Includes vault cash , cash items in process of collection , balances due from depository institutions , and balances due from Federal Reserve Banks .
FDIC Recap
There is $ 6.84 Trillion in bank deposits .
$ 2.60 Trillion of that is uninsured .
Total cash on hand at banks is $ 273.7 Billion .

The backstory is interesting , but in a nutshell the right - wing blogosphere belatedly ( as in nearly two months late ) stumbled onto Sen.
Barack Obama 's April visit to the Daily News , where I had the chance to ask him how an Obama administration might deal with White House internal discussions of torturing terror suspects , and other potential crimes in the Bush White House .
Here 's a short snippet of what I wrote on April 14 :
Tonight I had an opportunity to ask Barack Obama a question that is on the minds of many Americans , yet rarely rises to the surface in the great ruckus of the 2008 presidential race -- and that is whether an Obama administration would seek to prosecute officials of a former Bush administration on the revelations that they greenlighted torture , or for other potential crimes that took place in the White House .
Obama said that as president he would indeed ask his new Attorney General and his deputies to " immediately review the information that 's already there " and determine if an inquiry is warranted -- but he also tread carefully on the issue , in line with his reputation for seeking to bridge the partisan divide .
He worried that such a probe could be spun as " a partisan witch hunt . "
However , he said that equation changes if there was willful criminality , because " nobody is above the law . "
[..]
From there , the far - right blogosphere was off and running , working its way down the food chain until it burrowed into the muck of Limbaughland , who really seemed more worked up about insignificant little me -- who became a " Stalinist " once the worked - up El Rushbo reached the end of his monologue -- than about the Democrat poised to take over the White House :
After the administration 's left office , to pursue an investigation that might lead to criminal indictments for war crimes and other things .
We used to do that to the Nazis .
We did do that to the Nazis , the Nuremberg Trials and so forth .
This is who today 's modern liberals are .
Now , Obama 's got this wacko reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News who 's obviously not a reporter .
He is a leftist who happens to have secured a job in journalism , and he's got an agenda , and the agenda is right out of the cliched story line of the Drive - By Media , that we are a murderous , raping , torturing nation and that Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and Powell have to pay .
This is all about creating the notion in as many people 's minds that our country is criminal , is in a constant state of decline , and we are not worth our reputation as the world 's greatest superpower .
Limbaugh concluded :
This would be a direct assault on the United States and its government .
And you talk about we need to improve our reputation in the world .
Look at how they would do it .
By finding the US guilty at every opportunity of whatever baseless , phony charges that they would make .
This is Stalinist .
If you 've ever wondered what the definition of is Stalinist , this would fit it .
Frankly , I think the political right , all the way up to the White House , doth protest too much on this whole " war crimes " issue ; that is , they 're realizing the polls are showing the GOP may be shut out of power , and people desperately want to steer the conversation away from the things that were actually done the last 7 1/2 years , from authorizing torture to widespread spying on Americans .
You 're going to see a lot of things in the next few months -- some subtle , some blatant -- seeking to shift the debate away from the horrors inside the House at 1600 .
“ I love being a doctor but I hate practicing medicine , ” a friend , Saeed Siddiqui , told me recently .
We were sitting in his office amid his many framed medical certificates and a poster of an illuminated lighthouse that read : “ Success does n’t come to you .
You go to it . ”
A doctor in his late 30s , he has been in practice for six years , mostly as a solo practitioner .
But he told me he recently had decided to go into partnership with another cardiologist ; his days , he said , will be “ totally busy . ”
“ Your days are n’t busy enough already ? ” I asked .
The waiting room was packed .
He had a full schedule of appointments , and after he was done with his office patients , he was going to round at two hospitals .
He smiled wanly .
“ Just look at my eyes . ”
They were bloodshot .
“ This whole week I have n’t slept more than about six hours a night . ”

The Democrats came to Philadelphia on July 12 , seventeen days after the Republicans , meeting in the same city , had nominated a dream ticket of two hugely popular governors : Thomas E. Dewey of New York for president and Earl Warren of California for vice president .
The Democrats ' man , President Harry S. Truman , had labored for more than three years in the enormous shadow of Franklin D. Roosevelt .
In their hearts , all but the most optimistic delegates thought , as Clare Boothe Luce had told the Republican gathering , that the president was a " gone goose . "
Truman , a failed haberdasher turned politician , had the appearance of a meek bookkeeper .
In fact , he was feisty and prone to occasional angry outbursts .
His upper - South twang did not resonate with much of the country .
His many detractors wrote him off as a " little man " who had been unable to deal with difficult post - World War II issues — inflation and consumer shortages , civil rights for African - Americans and a developing cold war with the Soviet Union .
In the off - year elections of 1946 , Republicans had gained firm control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1928 .
Few Democrats believed Truman could lead them to victory in the presidential race .
A large group of cold war liberals — many of them organized in the new Americans for Democratic Action ( ADA ) — joined with other Democratic leaders in an attempt to draft America 's greatest living hero , Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , as their candidate .
The general seemed momentarily persuadable , then quickly backed away .
It was no coincidence that both parties met in Philadelphia .
The city was at the center point of the Boston to Richmond coaxial cable , then the main carrier of live television in the United States .
By 1948 , as many as ten million people from Boston to Richmond could watch the tumultuous process by which the major parties selected their candidates .
They could also see star journalists whom they had known only as voices , most notably the CBS team of Edward R. Murrow , Quincy Howe and Douglas Edwards .
The parties met amid miles of media cable and wiring in Convention Hall , an imposing Art Deco arena decorated with exterior friezes that celebrated American values and the history of humankind .
The structure could accommodate 12,000 people .
Packed to the rafters on a steamy July day , heated by blazing television lights and possessing no effective cooling system , the great hall was like an enormous sauna .
The Democrats ' keynote speaker was Senator Alben Barkley of Kentucky .
A presence on Capitol Hill since 1912 and the Democratic leader in the upper house for more than a decade , Barkley was much liked throughout the party and a master orator in the grand tradition .
His speech scourged the Republican - controlled Congress , quoted patron saints of the Democratic Party from Jefferson to FDR , expropriated Lincoln along the way and cited biblical text from the Book of Revelation .
The delegates cheered themselves hoarse , and an ensuing demonstration waved " Barkley for Vice President " placards .
Truman , watching the proceedings on TV in Washington , was not amused .
He considered " old man Barkley " ( at age 70 , six and a half years his senior ) to be little more than a hail fellow with whom one sipped bourbon and swapped tall tales .
The president wanted a young , dynamic and aggressively liberal running mate .
He already had offered the slot to Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , who declined .
With no backup , Truman turned to Barkley : " Why did n't you tell me you wanted to run , Alben ?
That 's all you had to do . "
Barkley accepted .
By then , the attention of the delegates had shifted to a platform fight that marked the full emergence of the modern Democratic Party .
African - Americans were an important Democratic constituency , but so were white Southerners .
Previous party platforms had never gotten beyond bland generalizations about equal rights for all .
Truman was prepared to accept another such document , but liberals , led by the ADA , wanted to commit the party to four specific points in the president 's own civil rights program : abolition of state poll taxes in federal elections , an anti-lynching law , a permanent fair employment practices committee and desegregation of the armed forces .
Hubert Humphrey , mayor of Minneapolis and a candidate for Senate , delivered the liberal argument in an intensely emotional speech : " The time is now arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states ' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights . "
On July 14 , the last day of the convention , the liberals won a close vote .
The entire Mississippi delegation and half the Alabama contingent walked out of the convention .
The rest of the South would back Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia as a protest candidate against Truman for the presidential nomination .
Nearly two weeks after the convention , the president issued executive orders mandating equal opportunity in the armed forces and in the federal civil service .
Outraged segregationists moved ahead with the formation of a States ' Rights ( " Dixiecrat " ) Party with Gov. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as its presidential candidate .
The States ' Rights Party avoided outright race baiting , but everyone understood that it was motivated by more than abstract constitutional principles .
Truman was slated to deliver his acceptance speech at 10 p.m. on July 14 but arrived to find the gathering hopelessly behind schedule .
As he waited , nominating speeches and roll calls droned on and on .
Finally , at 2 a .m. he stepped up to the podium .
Most of America was sound asleep .
He wore a white linen suit and dark tie , ideal for the stifling hall and the rudimentary capabilities of 1948 television .
His speech sounded almost spit into the ether at the opposition .
" Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it — do n't you forget that ! "
He announced he would call Congress back into session on July 26 — Turnip Day to Missouri farmers — and dare it to pass all the liberal - sounding legislation endorsed in the Republican platform .
" The battle lines of 1948 are the same as they were in 1932 , " he declared , " when the nation lay prostrate and helpless as a result of Republican misrule and inaction . "
New York Times radio and TV critic Jack Gould judged it perhaps the best performance of Truman 's presidency : " He was relaxed and supremely confident , swaying on the balls of his feet with almost a methodical rhythm . "
The delegates loved it .
Truman 's tireless campaigning that fall culminated in a feel - good victory of a little guy over an organization man .
It especially seemed to revitalize the liberals , for whom the platform fight in Philadelphia became a legendary turning point .
" We tied civil rights to the masthead of the Democratic Party forever , " remarked ADA activist Joseph Rauh 40 years later .
In truth , the ramifications of that victory would require two decades to play out .
In the meantime , Thurmond , winning four states and 39 electoral votes , had fired a telling shot across the Democrats ' bow .
Dixiecrat insurgents in Congress returned to their seats in 1949 with no penalty from their Democratic colleagues .
Party leaders , North and South , understood the danger of a spreading revolt .
Truman would not backtrack on his commitment to civil rights , but neither would Congress give him the civil rights legislation he requested .
His successors as party leader would show little disposition to push civil rights until the mass protests led by Martin Luther King Jr. forced the hands of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson .
Only then would the ultimate threat of the Dixiecrats be realized — the movement of the white South into the Republican Party .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Benazir Bhutto died from a fractured skull caused by hitting her head on part of her car 's sunroof as a bomb ripped through a crowd of her supporters , a spokesman for Pakistan 's Interior Ministry said Friday .
Members of Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party in the northwestern city of Peshawar protest her assassination .

" When she was thrown by the force of the shockwave of the explosion , unfortunately one of the levers of the sunroof hit her , " said spokesman Brigadier Javed Iqbal Cheema .
The explanation is the latest from the Interior Ministry .
It initially said Bhutto was killed by shots fired by the bomber , and then , via the state - run Associated Press of Pakistan , it said the cause of death was a shrapnel injury .
But Farzana Raja of Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party told CNN the government 's explanation is " a pack of lies , " she told CNN .
Raja also accused the government of a " total security lapse . "
At a news conference , Cheema showed images of Bhutto in a car , standing up through an open sunroof , looking out at the crowd as she was about to be driven away .
When the gunshots rang out and the explosion occurred , Bhutto " fell down or perhaps ducked " and apparently hit her head on a lever , Cheema said , adding that the lever was stained with blood .
Watch the shots , then a blast »
The blast killed at least 28 more people and at least 100 were wounded .
The Interior Ministry also revealed Friday that it had proof showing that al Qaeda was behind Bhutto's assassination .
Cheema said the government had an intelligence intercept in which an al Qaeda militant " congratulated his people for carrying out this cowardly act . "
However , that claim has not appeared on radical Islamist Web sites that regularly post such messages from al Qaeda and other militant groups .
The Interior Ministry told Pakistan 's GEO - TV that the suicide bomber belonged to Lashkar - e - Jhangvi -- an al Qaeda - linked Sunni Muslim militant group that the government has blamed for hundreds of killings .
U.S. officials believe that a Taliban leader , Baitullah Mahsud , may be the person behind the assassination .
Bhutto was laid to rest in a chaotic funeral at her ancestral home of Garhi - Khuda Baksh on Friday after violent scenes erupted across Pakistan following her death a day earlier .
Watch video from Bhutto's funeral procession »
Hundreds of thousands of people in the surrounding streets almost brought the procession to a standstill before it finally reached the Bhutto family 's mausoleum .
The throngs of her grieving supporters crushed up against the flag - draped coffin , while minor scuffles also broke out .
See images of Pakistan mourning Bhutto . »
Violence erupted in Pakistan in the hours before Bhutto's funeral started , with at least nine people reported killed and banks , train stations and cars torched .
Bhutto's body arrived in the hours before dawn at Garhi - Khuda Baksh after a long journey by plane , helicopter and ambulance .
The opposition leader 's family -- her husband Asif Ali Zardari and three children -- accompanied the body aboard a Pakistani Air Force C- 130 transport plane to Sukkor but traveled by bus from there to Larkana and on to Garhi - Khuda Baksh .
Another former prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , told CNN on Friday that he had planned to attend Bhutto 's funeral , but was advised not to by Zardari , who cited security concerns .
The prime minister 's office has launched a judicial inquiry and the Ministry of the Interior is setting up a police inquiry , according to Information Minister Nisar Memon .
Memon said no decision had been made to postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for January 8 .
Bhutto , who was campaigning for the elections , had completed an election rally and was leaving the rally site , Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh Park , at the time of the attack .
What impact could Bhutto have had in Pakistan ? »
Her father and former prime minister , Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , was hanged in the same northern city in 1979 .
As a shocked Pakistan absorbed the news of Bhutto 's death , authorities called for calm and asked residents to stay inside .
In Sindh province , where Karachi is located , police said demonstrators had burned a dozen banks , set two train stations on fire , along with three trains .
Since Thursday , 240 vehicles have been burned .
Because of the violence , paramilitary forces in Sindh were told to " shoot on sight " anyone causing civil disturbances , a spokesman for the Pakistan Rangers said .
But by Friday morning , Pakistani media reported an uneasy calm had spread across the shaken country , now marking a three - day period of mourning declared by President Pervez Musharraf .
Bhutto led Pakistan from 1988 - 1990 and 1993 - 96 , but both times the sitting president dismissed her amid corruption allegations .
She was the first female prime minister of any Islamic nation .
A terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi in October killed 136 people on the day she returned to Pakistan after eight years of self - imposed exile .
Bhutto had been critical of what she believed was a lack of effort by President Musharraf 's government to protect her .

Two months ago , I wanted to compare Windows XP to Ubuntu Linux in terms of applications performance .
I thought that since most of Linux programs are cross-platform and available for Windows , it could be a good idea to see how only platform change can affect the performance of a particular application .
One of my reasons was also to verify whether or not Linux is capable of getting the most out of new hardware technologies .
However , I only had a Pentium 4 HT machine , and even though I went ahead with the test , I knew it was not going to answer that .
A lot has happened since ; Ubuntu 8.04 came out , and I was happy with it .
Microsoft finalized their third service pack for Windows XP , and best of all I upgraded my PC with an AMD Athlon64 X2 5600 +
CPU , 2GB DDR2 - 800 RAM and a GeForce 8600 GT VGA card .
I decided to test again , especially after I read in the news that Microsoft has made clear its intention to take on Linux in the low - end computers market .
Microsoft will exclusively rely on Windows XP for that purpose , cutting down its price by more than a half , and building on the extreme popularity of the 7 - years - old operating system .
Recently , Microsoft invaded Asus Eee MIDs and the OLPC project which once thought to be Linux best chance of world - wide popularity .
This gives us an idea that Microsoft is well aware of Linux threat and has started to take actions to protect its monopoly .
In fact , I see a true threat because Windows XP is very popular , has the best compatibility of any OS , mature enough to be reliable and also known to be fast and very solid in both gaming and productive domains .
Of course , Linux has many advantages .
It more secure , stable and efficient and it is capable of bringing cutting - edge technologies to low - end machines , but there will be much less incentive to switch to Linux from a cheap Windows XP than from an expensive and complicated Windows Vista .
All of this adds another purpose of my test .
I ’ll try to discover how a 2008 edition of Ubuntu Linux will perform against the 2001 - born Windows XP fortified with 7 years of bug - fixing and 3 Service Packs .
Before I start with the results , I ’d like to say that even though I tried my best to be accurate and academic , I do n’t consider my test conclusive .
There are several things that had to be better and plenty of other factors to consider .
However , I can safely say that the test results are indicative and grossly reproducible .
Let ’s start with some command line programs .
RAR is the backbone of the popular WinRAR , and it is also available for many platforms .
I used the command line version because it is exactly the same for both Linux and Windows .
My test showed that Windows XP SP3 was tangibly faster in creating RAR compressed archives ( by about 25 % ) while extracting compressed data was much faster on Ubuntu 8.04 .
While I am pretty sure that RAR compression is more about the CPU and RAM than the hard drive performance , I am not sure if the faster decompression on Ubuntu was because of faster EXT3 write times or a faster algorithm execution .
Next was ClamAV anti-virus scanner .
It ’s free and relatively popular on Linux ( although most Linux users do n’t use any AV software ) , but it is also available for Windows .
There are several GUI projects for ClamAV , but I used the original command line version .
Ubuntu had a small advantage here , but I am sure that it resulted from the difference between NTFS and EXT3 file systems .
GIMP photo - editing program was next , as the first of three GUI - fitted applications in my test .
Two month ago , I noticed that the Windows version of GIMP could be very slow especially when the script required excessive screen re-drawing ( refreshing ) .
This time I tried to evade this problem by keeping GIMP windows minimized while executing my test script .
However , I could n’t make GIMP perform faster on Windows XP .
It was 25 % slower than its Ubuntu counterpart .
Blender is one of the most important 3D - modeling software around .
It ’s very powerful and absolutely free .
In my test , I used 3 sample projects downloaded from the application ’s website , and measured the time needed to render 25 frames of each one .
Windows XP SP3 was a comfortable winner here , beating Ubuntu by just over 20 % .
This matched the results from my old test , and since 3D rendering is mainly about the CPU ( system RAM is also involved but mainly in its capacity rather than speed ) , I began to develop suspicions about Ubuntu ’s ability to take advantage of modern CPU ’s capabilities ( like SSE3 , SSE4 ) .
It would explain RAR compression performance and also the next test which was video encoding .
For Video Encoding , I chose Avidemux .
With the right media codecs installed , it can pretty much encode to any video format .
I chose x264 as a target ( the same video format of Hi-Def videos ) and both MPEG2 ( standard DV ) and MJPEG as sources ( The most common standard - definition formats ) .
Again , Windows XP SP3 won that one with ease , with just about the same 20 % speed margin over Ubuntu 8.04 .
This consolidated a clear advantage in multi-media processing for Windows XP .
One possible justification for this is that Ubuntu 8.04 Desktop Edition ships with a generic kernel that can work on any x86 platform .
Linux kernel has many incarnations which are more specific and can perform better on a particular hardware .
However , changing the default kernel can cause stability problems .
Many Linux experts recommend compiling a custom kernel for every machine to take full advantage for its potentials , but this requires technical knowledge and , if you are new to Linux , a brave heart .
The next test was an important one .
It was the multi-tasking performance test .
I wrote a script to execute the above - mentioned tests ( some partially ) simultaneously .
Of course , they would finish in different times , and therefore , the shorter tests suffered the most while Blender , for example , stayed alone for more than 6 minutes after everything else was done .
However , most of the tests were close in duration , so despite the lack of accuracy , the test had a very good value in showing how well each operating system could handle multi-tasking .
Apparently , there was no contest at all between Windows XP and Ubuntu when it came to multi-tasking .
The average increase of test duration between mono - and multi-tasking was about 300 % with Ubuntu 8.04 , while it was more than seven folds for Windows XP .
It seems as if the CFS ( completely fair scheduler ) of the newer Linux kernel has paid off .
I always say that multi-tasking tests are of high value because they represent real - life situations .
Of course , my test was an extreme example and it was more of a stress test , but even with lighter workloads , and especially with such a huge difference between Windows XP and Ubuntu , I think that Ubuntu should be the real - life performance leader .
Many people talk about perceived performance , in contrast to benchmark performance , and some of them stress that multi-tasking capacity is the most important factor in perceived performance .
Here we take a look on some details about mono- vs. multi-tasking tests .
The graph shows the test - duration changes from single to multiple operations .
In Windows XP , Avidemux and LAME MP3 encoding tests were run on a higher priority and thus suffered the least .
Meanwhile , decompressing RAR archives and scanning disk folder with ClamAV were severely affected due to extreme hard disk activity , highlighting the NTFS inferiority to EXT3 .
On the Linux side , UnRAR decompression was also the biggest loser ( but not nearly as Windows ) for the same reason ; while ClamAV did much better ( I could n’t understand why ) .
LAME and Avidemux were run with the exact same parameters as in the Windows test , but for some reason , Ubuntu would n’t give them as much CPU time as Windows XP did .
They ended up losing as much time as any other program .
To sum - up , I ’d say that Windows XP SP3 is a very solid performer and it beats the default Ubuntu in anything related to multi-media processing .
This only adds to the misery of Linux in this domain as it still struggles with proprietary codecs and lacks a proper HD support .
I ’d like to further investigate whether Linux kernel has anything to do with this performance deficit .
On the other hand , Ubuntu is a big - time winner in multi-tasking which reflects how well it handles system resources .
It also out - performs Windows in hard disk performance thanks to its support for EXT3 file system .
I ’ll try to keep you updated about this subject .
Thank you for taking the time to read my article .

Reading the memoirs of European colonialists who led the efforts to extend Western control over parts of Asia and Africa in the 19th century , one cannot help but be moved by what seem to be the genuine convictions held by these diplomats , soldiers , businessmen , and missionaries that they were helping spread civilization among the backward people of the world , who should have been grateful for the assistance and guidance of Europe ’s paternalistic powers .
According to that myth of the White Man ’s Burden , selfless devotion and not 
God forbid !
 political , military , or economic interests , were behind the imperialist drive of Britain and France in what is now called the Third World .
That the Indians , the Chinese , or the Africans would resist that show of goodwill exhibited by these supposedly altruistic outside powers seemed to reflect another sign of intellectual underdevelopment displayed by " these people " and their ungrateful and power - driven leaders .
One could hear the echoes from this past in the recent urging by British , French , and American officials and pundits that the leaders of Myanmar should be forced to open their borders to Western aid agencies as part of an effort to help the victims of Cyclone Nargis , which has devastated the country .
Both British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner have proposed that the United Nations Security Council should consider the use of collective military action to get the aid into the country .
At the same time , columnists in influential American and European newspapers have argued that the most effective way to help the suffering power of Myanmar is by doing a " regime change " in Yangon and replacing the military junta there with international peacekeeping forces engaged in " nation - building . "
Both Mr. Miliband and Mr. Kouchner represent left - of - center governments and have insisted that they are not trying to bring back to life old - fashioned imperialism , only trying to advance what has been referred to as " humanitarian interventionism . "
This principle seems to suggest that democratic governments have the right and the obligation to intervene in the affairs of other nation - states , including by deploying military power , when their governments are perceived  by the democratic governments and their elites  as abusers of the rights of their own people .
You do n’t have to be a fan of the cruel and paranoid regime that rules Myanmar to question this somewhat revolutionary principle , which runs contrary to the traditional notion of national sovereignty that has been pivotal in the modern international system .
Indeed , violating that rule , in particular by using military power , has been considered an act of war .
That the British and the French in the early 21st century , not unlike their esteemed predecessors in the 19th century , rationalize such moves by portraying themselves as " do - gooders " who are standing - up to the " evildoers " makes very little difference here .
But it ’s a slippery slope when you start challenging common principles and violate accepted rules that for better or for worse have helped secure a fragile peace in the international system .
Who is going to decide what a " democratic " government is and how to define " abuse " ?
Why should n’t the international community have the right and the obligation to intervene in Saudi Arabia to help provide political rights to more than half of the population ( women ) there ?
And what about the rights of the Roma people in parts of Europe ?
Or for that matter , the African - American victims of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana or the victims of white racism in America ’s inner-cities ?
The Saudis , the Europeans , and the Americans would consider such proposals as absurd ( and rightly so ) and would certainly question the intentions of those raising them .
In much of the discussion about the role of the aid agencies in Myanmar ( or in other parts of the world ) , one very rarely hears about the way many of these organizations have gradually been transformed into another Big Business whose motivations and policies need to be addressed .
And the notion that the Europeans and the Americans may have non-altruistic reasons for establishing a foothold in Myanmar , which happens to be located in a strategically and economically important part of the world , is certainly a legitimate issue to raise in the aftermath of the American military fiasco in Iraq .
The architects of the Iraq adventure also advanced the notion that all they wanted to do in Mesopotamia was liberate Iraq from a cruel military regime .

Nobody wanted Jose Luis Munoz to fail .
The Anaheim gang member raised by a single mother had received a second chance -- or maybe it was his first -- to turn his life around when he settled a lawsuit against the city and police for $ 2.5 million .
In December , he was waiting for the check and paving his future with good intentions .
But four months later he was back in prison for violating parole ; he had been caught associating with other gang members .
When he was released from prison , Munoz , 23 , said he was eager “ to do the right thing . ”
He said he was going to move out of his gang - infested neighborhood and buy a house for his mother , who had worked two jobs while raising him .
Advertisement
Munoz ’s mother declined to comment last week when contacted at her Anaheim home where Munoz grew up .
She and just about everyone else , including the police , hoped that a financial cushion would steer Munoz away from a lifestyle that had already cost him four years in prison and Juvenile Hall .
His current prison sentence is 16 months .
“ We were all pulling for him .
All he had to do was stay away from friends who could only get him in trouble , ” said Anaheim gang Sgt. Dennis Briggs , whose unit is well acquainted with Munoz , whose moniker is Dopey .
In 2005 , Munoz , on foot , was struck from behind by a police cruiser as he surrendered after a brief chase .
He was wedged in the vehicle ’s undercarriage and severely injured .
Munoz said he bolted from police because he was afraid they were going to send him back to prison .
Advertisement
Munoz sued the city of Anaheim and the Police Department over his injuries and was awarded $ 2.5 million .
Attorney Arnoldo Casillas , who represented Munoz in the lawsuit , said he knew there was a possibility that his client would revert to his old ways .
“ I knew his background all too well , ” he said .
“ But I had high hopes and expectations .
It ’s tragic that he ’s right back in prison . ”
In a December interview with The Times , Munoz said he had been visited by two Anaheim gang detectives after he was paroled in October .
One of the officers took a special interest in him , he said .
She gave him her business card with her cell number and encouraged Munoz to call if he needed help or was in danger .

“ There was a safety risk .
He had all this money .
She went to his house two or three times to make sure things were OK with him , ” Briggs said .
“ You always hope you can convince at least one gang member to get away from that lifestyle .
Jose had a perfect opportunity to get away , but he did n’t .
It ’s sad . ”
Munoz said his parole officer also encouraged him to move and offered to help him get settled in another county .
The parole officer could not be reached for comment .
On April 10 , gang officers patrolling the northeast Anaheim neighborhood where Munoz lives spotted an SUV stopped in the street .
The driver -- Munoz -- was talking to a female gang member who was on probation , Briggs said .
The officers questioned Munoz and three other gang members in the vehicle .
Munoz and the girl were arrested on suspicion of associating with gang members , a violation of their parole and probation .
He was returned to prison the following day .
Advertisement
Attorney Richard Longoria , who represented Munoz in a criminal case , said his client lacked self - esteem , “ which makes it extremely difficult for him to find a way out . ”
“ If you did n’t grow up in that lifestyle , it ’s much harder to get out than you realize , ” Longoria said .
“ But the bottom line is that he screwed up .
We are all disappointed . ”
Richard Ramos , a gang expert and author who grew up in Highland Park , agreed that identity and fitting in have a lot to do with Munoz ’s recidivism .
“ People who do n’t have money transform their lives all the time , ” Ramos said .
“ In this case , $ 2.5 million was n’t enough .
To kids like him , identity and belonging are powerful forces that keep them in gangs .
There has to be an inside - out transformation or a life - changing event to bring change .
Gangs compete with your family for loyalty .

( LifeWire ) --
At Jason Keith 's last job , he discovered a colleague sound asleep at work -- head back , mouth open , snoring loudly -- while his co-workers laughed and snapped photos with their cell phone cameras .
Sleepy employees cost companies in productivity and health care .
" At first I thought he was faking it , but he was completely passed out , " says Keith , 31 , who works for a digital printing company outside Boston , Massachusetts .
" He left the company about a month after that episode . "
Caryn Melton , 43 , has nodded off during meetings , at her desk and even during a corporate event .
Melton , who works for a marketing firm in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , says she does n't sleep well at night so she is often tired during the day .
" I love napping .
I turn my chair around so my colleagues can't see me , but I have been caught before .
Luckily , I have n't gotten in trouble .
I just get teased by my colleagues , " she says .
A sleep - deprived nation
Melton is n't alone in her struggle to stay awake on the job .
One - third of those surveyed for the National Sleep Foundation 's annual " Sleep in America " poll had fallen asleep or become sleepy at work in the past month .
The telephone survey questioned 1,000 adults in the continental United States and was conducted between September 25 , 2007 , and November 19 , 2007 .
The poll also found that Americans are working more and sleeping less .
The average amount of sleep was six hours and 40 minutes a night .
The average workday ?
Nine hours and 28 minutes .
Calculate your weekly sleep hours and work hours »
" We are a sleep - deprived nation , " says Rubin Naiman , a sleep specialist with a doctorate in clinical psychology and the director of sleep programs at Miraval , a health and wellness center in Tucson , Arizona .
" We need at least seven to nine hours of sleep a night for optimal health . "
Serenity now
Recognizing that on - the - job sleepiness can affect the bottom line -- the Sleep Foundation puts the annual cost at $ 100 billion in lost productivity , health care costs and employee absences , among other factors -- companies are coming up with novel ways to boost employees ' energy levels .
Watch how sleep loss can harm the brain
" You would be surprised how many companies are providing nap rooms , " says Sara Mednick , a sleep researcher with a doctorate in psychology from Harvard University and author of " Take a Nap ! Change Your Life . "
" Although it is still somewhat of a stigma for some companies , it 's a growing trend . "
Maureen Lippe , founder of New York public relations agency Lippe Taylor , does n't offer just one nap room for her tired employees .
She has three .
" We call them serenity rooms .
I put one on each of the three floors , " she says .
Outfitted with large sofas , blankets and comfortable chairs , the rooms are phone - and BlackBerry - free zones .
" A lot of people nap in our serenity rooms , even me , " Lippe says .
Other companies forgo beds and blankets and focus instead on creating an environment that emphasizes wellness and relaxation , reasoning that such a setting will keep employees refreshed and alert .
OPNET Technologies , a software company with headquarters in Bethesda , Maryland , provides a " Zen computer garden " with plants , Internet access , couches , lounge chairs and other amenities where staff can enjoy downtime .
The FruitGuys , a San Francisco fruit - delivery company , does n't have a nap room , but its employees enjoy unlimited fresh fruit .
Mednick says that although meditation , fresh fruit and other healthy benefits are great , naps should be part of the equation .
She encourages companies to create a workplace napping policy .
" Napping does n't have to happen just because you are not getting enough sleep , " Mednick says .
" There is often a dip in your body , physically , in the afternoon when your concentration is low , and a nap can increase alertness . "
Mednick suggests that companies provide dark , isolated rooms where people can stretch out horizontally .
A ' Band - Aid ' solution ?
While some people favor napping on the job , others are skeptical .
" I think that napping at work is a Band - Aid solution .
It 's trendy for companies , it makes it seem like your employer is concerned , but it does n't really go to the heart of the real problem , which is that people are not getting enough sleep , " says Dale Read , president of the Specialty Sleep Association , a nonprofit trade and industry group representing manufacturers and retailers of air , foam and other types of beds .
Although Read is n't against napping , he compares a 20 - minute nap to " drinking a shot of sugar soda " -- it wakes you up in the moment but does n't equal good nutrition in the long run .
Naiman disagrees .
" There is ample data confirming that naps are refreshing , improve mood , enhance performance and lower blood pressure .
Naps are an important part of the solution to our sleep - deprived culture . "
Tips for a good night 's sleep
One thing all the experts agree on ?
A good night 's sleep is essential .
They recommend the following :
• Institute a sleep routine :
Go to bed at a specific time every night , take a warm shower , read a book or meditate to relax .
• Consume caffeine and alcohol in moderation .
Naiman recommends avoiding caffeine after lunch .
About alcohol , he says , " Less is better , earlier is better and with food is better . "
• Do n't go to bed full or famished .
" A light snack a few minutes before bed consisting of natural or complex carbs such as a piece of fruit or some nut bread is ideal , " Naiman says .
• Make sure your room is cool and dark .
• Find a comfortable mattress and pillow .
But if all else fails , follow Jason Keith 's example .
" When I take a nap at work , I do it in my car , " he says .

necessary
directly
some
My colleague at the University of California - Irvine , Francisco Ayala , has been interviewed recently by the New York Times about his views on science and religion .
Ayala is particularly suitable for the task , being a former Dominican priest and one of the world ’s best known evolutionary biologists .
I happen to agree with much of what Ayala said in the interview , but of course I will be focusing here on where I depart from his positions .
In the interview and in his latest book , Darwin ’s Gift to Science and Religion , Ayala correctly points out that one of the many problems with the idea of Intelligent Design is that there is plenty of evidence that the universe is n’t well designed at all ( this , of course , is not a new observation : both David Hume and Charles Darwin based their critique of the design argument on it ) .
To quote Ayala : “ Consider that at least 20 percent of pregnancies are known to end in spontaneous abortion .
If that results from divinely inspired anatomy God is the greatest abortionist of them all . ”
Ouch .
But then Ayala turns around and provides an apparently elegant , but in fact deeply flawed , solution to the infamous “ problem of evil ” : “ As floods and drought were a necessary consequence of the fabric of the physical world , predators and parasites , dysfunctions and diseases were a consequence of the evolution of life , they were not a result of a deficient or malevolent design . ” Bingo , Darwin gets
God off the hook !
But , wait , what exactly is the logic of this argument ?
Why are floods , droughts , predators and diseases acomponent of the world ?
And even so , this seems to imply that God isn’tresponsible for natural evil ( human - caused evil falls into a different category altogether ) , because he did n’t design living beings one by one , he just set in motion the laws of the universe .
OK , but does n’t a God who picks the laws of physics and biology bearresponsibility for their outcome , however indirectly ?
Is He not all - powerful , all - good and all - knowing ?
I mean , when a human - made bridge collapses we still investigate whether the engineers who designed it have some reasonable degree of culpability ( or whether , ironically , it was an “ act of God ” ) .
Perhaps
God cannot be accused of genocide , but how about at least manslaughter ?
( Over and over and over again , of course ... ) I would have expected a better effort from a scientist who has the additional insight of being a former priest , hence familiar with so - called theological arguments .
But the fact is that it is next to impossible to come up with any better excuse for God , and when one wishes at all costs to reconcile its existence with what we know of the universe , one is bound to run afoul of elementary logic .
Of course , Ayala may actually be an atheist and simply not want to get embroiled in a Dawkins - like media frenzy .
When asked by the NYT reporter what his belief is , Ayala coyly replied : “ I do n’t want to be tagged , by one side or the other .
” Yes , Francisco , but what about intellectual honesty ?
This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
UPDATE : Fixed a bug in compile_while
Ok , so I know it 's been far too long .
Lots going on at the moment ...
This is a very short part , but I 'll try to get the next part cleaned up in the next few days ( teaser at the end ... )
Implementing ' while ' as a primitive
I like small language cores , and it really appeals to me to implement control structures as methods rather than hardcoding them into the language .
As we 've seen , ' while ' can be implemented fairly easily in terms of a quite basic language .
We could streamline it even more by reducing the verbiage needed to pass anonymous functions or by adding a Lisp style macro facility .
There 's an added complication :
Using lambda's that are not proper closures , which is the case for us so far , means there 's no way for the body to access external variables .
That makes the while loop pretty useless .
The " proper " way of fixing that would be to actually implement proper closures , and I promise we 'll get there , but not right now - there are other pieces to get in place first .
So I 'm biting the bullet and adding a built in " while " construct for now .
It also serves the purpose of showing how it 's usually done - it 's quite simple really .
As usual we start with a simple C test to see how to do this :
int main ( ) { while ( foo ( ) ) { bar ( ) ; } }
gcc -S , and this is the relevant part :
jmp .L2 .L3 : call bar .
L2 : call foo testl %eax , %eax jne .L3
Notice how the condition is placed at the end , and we start by jumping to the end ?
The alternative is to place the conditional check at the start , reversing the test and making it jump to after the end of the loop , and then placing an unconditional jump after the body , like the example below , but that results in one extra branch instruction per iteration of the loop :
. L3 : call foo testl %eax , %eax je .L2 call bar jmp .L3 .L2 :
This is not a big deal since performance is n't a concern right now , but the distinction here does n't add any complexity to speak of .
So here 's what we do :
def compile_while ( scope , cond , body ) start_while_seq = @seq cond_seq = @seq + 1 @seq += 2 puts " \\ tjmp \\ t.L #{ cond_seq } " puts " .L #{ start_while_seq } :" compile_exp ( scope , body ) puts " .L #{ cond_seq } :" var = compile_eval_arg ( scope , cond ) puts " \\ ttestl \\ t #{ var } , # { var } " puts " \\ tjne \\ t.L #{ start_while_seq } " return [ : subexpr ]
end
Then we add it to #compile_exp :
return compile_while ( scope , * exp [ 1 ..- 1 ] ) if ( exp [ 0 ] == : while )
And a test :
prog = [ : do , [ : call , [ : lambda , [ :i ] , [ : while , :i , [ : do , [ : printf , " Countdown : %ld \\ n " , :i ] , [ :assign , :i , [ : sub , :i , 1 ] ] ] ] ] , [ 10 ] ] ]
Wrapping it up
Like last time , I 've tar'ed up the files for step 9 together with a Makefile here .
If you have Ruby , make and gcc installed you should be able to just untar it and run make to get the " step9 " test binary :
[ [ email protected ] step9 ] $ make ruby step9.rb > step9.s as -o step9. o step9.s cc - c -o runtime .
o runtime .c cc step9.o runtime .o -o step9 [ [ email protected ] step9 ] $ ./ step9 Countdown : 10 Countdown : 9 Countdown : 8 Countdown : 7 Countdown : 6 Countdown : 5 Countdown : 4 Countdown : 3 Countdown : 2 Countdown : 1 [ [ email protected ] step9 ] $
Next time
Next time we 'll start putting together and going through a simple " text mangler " that 'll let us " parse " a lisp like syntax and generate a Ruby script that runs the compiler on the equivalent program ...
It will turn this ( not the complete program ) :
( defun parse ( ) ( let ( c sep expr ) ( assign sep 0 ) ( assign expr 0 ) ( while ( and ( ne ( assign c ( getchar ) ) - 1 ) ( ne c 41 ) ) ( if ( eq c 40 ) ( do ( copy_expr ) ( assign sep 1 ) ) ( if ( eq c 59 ) ( parse_comment ) ( if ( eq c 34 ) ( do ( parse_quoted c ) ( assign sep 1 ) ) ( do ( if ( and ( isspace c ) sep ) ( do ( printf " , " ) ( assign sep 0 ) ) ) ( if ( and ( isalnum c ) ( not sep ) ) ( do ( assign sep 1 ) ( if ( not ( isdigit c ) ) ( printf " : " ) ) ) ) ( putchar c ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
into this plus driver code to run the compiler :
[ : defun , : parse , [ ] , [ : let , [ :c , : sep , : expr ] , [ : assign , : sep , 0 ] , [ : assign , : expr , 0 ] , [ : while , [ : and , [ :ne , [ : assign , :c , [ : getchar ] ] , - 1 ] , [ :ne , :c , 41 ] ] , [ : if , [ :eq , :c , 40 ] , [ : do , [ : copy_expr ] , [ : assign , : sep , 1 ] ] , [ : if , [ :eq , :c , 59 ] , [ : parse_comment ] , [ : if , [ :eq , :c , 34 ] , [ : do , [ : parse_quoted , :c ] , [ : assign , : sep , 1 ] ] , [ : do , [ : if , [ : and , [ : isspace , :c ] , :sep ] , [ : do , [ : printf , " , " ] , [ :assign , : sep , 0 ] ] ] , [ : if , [ : and , [ :isalnum , :c ] , [ :not , : sep ] ] , [ : do , [ : assign , : sep , 1 ] , [ : if , [ : not , [ : isdigit , :c ] ] , [ : printf , " : " ] ] ] , ] , [ : putchar , :c ] , ] , ] , ] , ] , ] , ] ] ,
By the end of it it will process itself and spit out the equivalent parse - tree encoded in Ruby .
Note how I 've put " parse " in quotes etc. .
It hardly deserves to be described as a parser - we 'll get to a real parser a few steps further out .
Note that I am not going to go down towards writing a Lisp , but I figured since I 've used a Lisp like syntax so far for examples , it would be a good test to see whether we 're far enough along to do something remotely useful yet .
It did need a couple of helper functions beyond what 's present so far to get a decent result , but not much .
The " real " parser will be for a much more Ruby - ish syntax .
Google , the leading claimant of " Do no evil , " has helped Indian authorities nail a student who used some dirty words on Orkut to satirize an Indian elected official .
Google provided information that led to the arrest of 22 year IT professional , Rahul Vaid , who had started an " I hate Sonia Gandhi , " community .
Vaid used a Gmail address as a contact , and Google , tracked it and gave the information to authorities to track him down .
Criticizing Gandhi is in itself not a crime in India , a democracy .
But using vulgar language in your criticism is , and for that Vaid face fines and up to five years imprisonment .
This issue is not quite so simple as I would like it to be .
Internet - based businesses have the complex issue of having to comply with national laws wherever the companies operate , which is very often everywhere .
There are well - touted cases of Yahoo and Facebook ratting on users in China and Morocco and elsewhere .
The thing about Google is the company slogan implies a certain moral superiority that evidence does not back .
In China they have voluntarily complied with national censorship laws , apparently before they were even politely asked to do so .
There 's also the case of Wael Abbas who had 179 YouTube videos of Egyptian police brurtality and government corruption taken down mysteriously for a while , before the Google subsidiary just as mysteriously restored them .
Maybe Google should tweak its slogan to " Do a little evil , when it is in our business interests .

Many Clinton supporters find the current attempts to muscle her out of the race despicable .
Maybe now is the time for Obama to take one for the team and accept her offer of the VP slot .
It is the position he is better qualified for , would end a situation that is supposedly hurting the party , and would put him in a better position to run next time .
Clinton has no ânext time , â  so it makes more sense for Obama to be the one to step aside .
If the convention is held too late in the election cycle for the presidential nominee to campaign effectively , perhaps the date of the convention needs to be changed .
The solution cannot be for viable candidates to set aside their ambitions long before a nominee has been clearly chosen .

2008 June 20
( CNN ) -- Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has decided not to run for U.S. Senate in that state , he told CNN's " Larry King Live " Monday night .
Jesse Ventura says he decided not to run in part because he did n't want to submit his family to media scrutiny .
Ventura , an independent and a former professional wrestler , said he was " close " to running but decided against it in part because he did n't want to submit his relatives to the kind of media scrutiny he says they faced when he was governor .
" Nothing is off - limits today in the world of politics .
These are some of the dilemmas that I go through :
Do I want to put my family on the firing line again ? " said Ventura , who turns 57 Tuesday .
However , he noted he has until 5 p.m. Tuesday -- the deadline to file for the race in Minnesota -- to change his mind .
Among those who have declared for the contest are the incumbent , Republican Sen. Norm Coleman , and Democrat Al Franken , a liberal talk - show host and longtime " Saturday Night Live " writer .
Ventura , openly critical of Coleman and Franken , said he would not endorse either .
As an independent , Ventura won a single term as Minnesota governor in late 1998 , beating Coleman and Hubert Humphrey III , a scion of a Minnesota Democratic dynasty .
Once in office , he struggled with a legislature run by the two major parties and did not seek re-election in 2002 .
He left office with an approval rating near 40 percent , and he told CNN last week that he would need to see " light at the end of the tunnel " before committing to a new campaign .
Do n't Miss Ex-SNL comic Al Franken running for Senate
This month , Minneapolis television station KSTP commissioned a poll that supposed Ventura was running against Coleman and Franken .
The results had Coleman leading with 43 percent , followed by Franken at 27 percent and Ventura at 26 percent .
The poll , conducted Friday through Sunday , had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent .
Before running for governor , Ventura had been mayor of the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park .
In addition to his wrestling career , he served as a Navy SEAL and appeared in the action films " Predator " and " The Running Man " with Arnold Schwarzenegger , who became governor of California in 2003 .
All About Jesse Ventura • Norm Coleman • Al Franken • Minnesota

Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas is too high .
Too high , that is , when it comes to the hysterical statistic quoted in his new public service announcement about drop houses .
Like much of the government propaganda about drugs , Thomas ' PSA uses a questionable stat to grab our attention : " About 90 percent of illegal drugs come from south of the border . "
Nobody doubts that plenty of illegal drugs are funneled through Mexico on the way to the United States .
But Ramona Sanchez , spokeswoman for the local office of the DEA , says it 's more like 60 percent or so .
The PSA , launched last week following a press conference with Sheriff Joe Arpaio , is mainly about Thomas ' favorite subject , illegal immigration .
The PSA begins with the vague , disputable opinion that " illegal immigration is fueling Arizona 's violent crime and drug problem . "
Viewers are reminded of the violence illegal border crossers sometimes suffer at the hands of their smugglers , and then are asked to call Arpaio 's immigration snitch line to report possible drop houses .
In fact , most drop houses are busted only after citizens call police to report them .
Thomas and Arpaio are probably hoping the ad funnels more of the calls to the Sheriff 's Office , which can then boast about arresting higher numbers of Mexicans .
Linking illegal drugs to illegal immigrants , in general , seems nothing but a fear tactic .
The idea put forth in the ad is that if you support Thomas and Arpaio 's approach of busting run -of - the - mill illegal immigrants , you 'll make a dent in the illegal drug trade .
But that 's unprovable nonsense .
Even if 90 percent of drugs really came from south of the border , there 's no reason to think tougher immigration enforcement would dry up the supply of drugs in this country .
Drug cartels often react to enforcement changes by changing their transport routes , and would do so again if traffic from Mexico was slowed .
A 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office states that although 90 percent of the cocaine in the U.S. comes from south of the border , that 's a fairly recent change :
It was only 66 percent in 2000 .
Sanchez , of the DEA , says other drugs , like marijuana or heroin ( not to mention illegal prescription drugs ) , come through Mexico less often than cocaine .
" The percentage is going to be different for each drug , " she says .
The idea that " 90 percent of illegal drugs come from south of the border , " as Thomas ' ad says , " would seem impossible , " Sanchez says .
So where did Thomas get his " 90 percent " statistic ?
Well , his own Web site states that it came from a conservative writer 's opinion article .
The public paid $ 800,000 to produce and air the ad , according to Thomas ' office .
Guess not much of that was spent on quality research .
The writer , Robert Caldwell , published the figure in the article .
But it 's unknown where he obtained the figure — he 's a retired editor from the San Diego Union - Tribune and could not be reached Thursday .
A bit of Internet research showed that members of Congress saw that figure in the text of the Merida Initiative , a law signed by President Bush in June that gives money to Mexico to fight illegal drugs .
The law cites the GAO as the source , but the data seems to have been skewed , as if it were part of a game of telephone .
As noted above , the latest GAO report on the subject merely talks about the 90 percent of cocaine coming from Mexico .
A 2007 State Department report on illegal drugs also implies the 90 percent figure should be applied only to cocaine .
Thomas may not care that his ad contains a garbage statistic .
After all , the ad effectively makes illegal immigrants look like scumbags .
And that could be the point : Maybe Thomas sees the ad as a way to help justify to the public his harsh , expensive immigration - enforcement programs .
VIEWPOINT
Masego Madzwamuse
International development policies are undermining the long term survival of some of the globe 's poorest communities , argues Masego Madzwamuse .
In this week 's Green Room , she says the skills and knowledge needed to survive in the world 's harsh drylands are being sacrificed in the name of progress .
Nature 's contribution to the survival of the poor needs to be recognised as an important asset
The world 's poorest of the poor live in the toughest areas of the planet - the drylands .
These areas all have key factors in common : water is scarce , and rainfall is unpredictable - or it rains only during a very short period every year .
Drylands cover more than 40 % of the Earth 's surface and are home to more than two billion people .
These areas are also home to a disproportionate number of people without secure access to food .
Why are 43 % of the world 's cultivated lands found in dry areas ?
And why have decades of development not led to significant improvements ?
Rather than improving , it would appear that the situation is getting worse , with more frequent droughts , such as those in Ethiopia and Northern Kenya .
Another important issue that strikes me about drylands is that these areas have been completely neglected despite being the world 's home of the poor .
While one international agreement - the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ( UNCCD ) - has been dedicated solely to the drylands of this world , little attention has been paid by the media , development or conservation organisations , or the international donor community .
The only time attention is paid is when droughts ( a regular climatic phenomenon in such lands ) are allowed to proceed to famine , which in this day and age can only be the result of political failure .
Humanitarian and food relief follow the TV headlines , creating more dependencies rather than developing viable and sustainable economies .
Dry heat
It is expected that these areas will be hardest hit by climate change in the future .
The influential Stern Review noted that a 3C ( 5.4 F ) increase in global temperature was likely to result in an extra 150 - 550 m people becoming exposed to the risk of hunger .
Drylands are productive , but only if people 's way of life is protected
The review also said that climate change was likely to result in up to four billion people suffering water shortages .
The world 's drylands are likely to bear the brunt of this gloomy prognosis .
In my opinion , the world will only successfully fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) if we pay more attention to these unique ecosystems and learn from the mistakes of the past .
This means moving away from a colonially biased view of drylands .
It is unfortunately still common to equate drylands with deserts and wastelands , as these areas might not look at first sight very productive , especially during a period of drought .
So , what are the ingredients for success in developing the poorest regions of this world ?
First of all , development interventions need to be adapted to the realities of drylands .
Crop production , whether rain - fed or irrigated , will always be a limited opportunity .
Yet the major effort in " development " is a green revolution for the desert .
Pastoralism is one of the few land use systems that can be compatible with wildlife conservation
Has half a century of development not taught us the reality for cultivation in the drylands ?
Livestock is much more suitable to arid environments and more likely to support rural livelihoods in arid regions .
For instance , Turkana pastoralists of Kenya know that livestock is their mainstay , even though they have some of the fastest maturing varieties of sorghum in the world .
Secondly , we should work with the knowledge and institutional systems of the people who have lived there for centuries .
We need to understand why they have complex common property systems for land and resource management that may span and cover very large territories , and guarantee that a variety of stakeholders can use these scarce resources and survive .
It is important to also understand why they place more emphasis on livestock than crops .
Livestock is a better converter of biomass in such harsh lands .
We must not sweep aside this knowledge and experience .
Instead , we should build on those systems and support them with so - called " modern and scientific knowledge " to improve productivity and create market opportunities .
Medicinal plants , such devil 's claw , thrive in the harsh drylands landscape
Yet we ignore their complex risk management and resilience enhancement strategies .
One classical example has been the numerous efforts to use inappropriate policies to settle nomadic people and restrict their movements .
Nomadic livestock herding has been a key sustainable survival strategy in the more arid areas .
Once grass and water become scarce , these communities move with their animals to the next area .
Thus , they are able to use resources sustainably without leaving themselves exposed to the effects of droughts .
While livestock farming in drylands contributes significantly to national economies , most subsidies go to unsustainable ranching projects rather than the small livestock holders .
National treasures Pastoralism is one of the few land use systems that can be compatible with wildlife conservation .
A nomadic lifestyle is one of the few ways to survive in drylands
Yet where are many of the world 's national parks ?
More than 70 % of Kenya 's are in drylands , which includes a number of important dry season grazing areas for pastoralists .
Dryland peoples depend on the surrounding environment , and they should be able to benefit from conservation through community conserved areas and tourism , rather than having their best lands taken away from them in the name of conservation .
Thirdly , nature 's contribution to the survival of the poor needs to be recognised as an important asset .
It is nature that provides food , fodder for livestock , construction material for shelter , medicinal plants , emergency food and climate regulation ( shade is highly valued in 40C ) .
Opportunities for sustainable development exist .
Sudan is the world 's largest producer of gum arabic , a principal ingredient of colas and chewing gum , which stems from a 2,000 - year agroforestry tradition .
And the arid lands of the Horn of Africa produce the highest quality frankincense and myrrh in the world .
In one district in Botswana that has an average annual rainfall of just 200 mm , dryland ecosystem services contributed $ 190,000 ( £ 95,000 ) to the national income .
Almost 50 % of this came from wild plants such as the medicinal devil 's claw .
Instead of building on this natural capital , development and government interventions tend to replace and disregard them .
Even worse , they are not reflected in the national GDP figures .
As a consequence , most policy frameworks provide incentives for their exploitation rather than their sustainable use .
We cannot continue to let the world 's poor dryland dwellers down .
Panaceas , history tells us , do n't work .
Instead , we need to invest in the innovative and sustainable use of natural assets .
Masego Madzwamuse is the IUCN 's regional programme development officer and focal person for southern African drylands
The Green Room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Masego Madzwamuse ?
Is the international community overlooking the needs of people living in the world 's drylands ?
Are current policies jeopardising centuries of skills and knowledge needed to survive in some of the planet 's harshest environments ?
Or can modern science and technology deliver a sustainable future for all ?
I accidently hit upon this article and I was sincerely moved at the pathetic , scary and pitiable conditions of the people living in drylands .
I wonder in what context and in what faculty do we have the right to say that the world in general is developing and claims are made on humanitarian grounds .
Even though several innovations , discoveries and advancements are made in the field of science and every now and then the world is boasting of achieving unthinkable successes in the same .
yet , this simple scientific fact is being ignored that for the betterment and upliftment of the people living in drylands lies in understandibng the ecology , biology and the decades of experiences of the local people there .
Not only understanding but taking actions from the outcome with the proper utilisation of their resources and the funds which arise for them .
And equally shocking is the negligent and rude attitude of their own government towards these people just for a superficial desire to !
appear sophesticated in teh eyes of the developed world .
I totally agree on the views mentiones in this article and it is time for the " world leadres " to wake up before it is too late .
We should only blame ourselves if in the near future this world of ours becomes the embodiment of natural calamities , destruction and every incident leading to the end of it .
One of the reasons to top of the list would be the total failure to rehabilitate the drylanders even though it was a task that was within the reach of every world citizen .
Bina Patel , Hyderabad , Andhra Pradesh , India A great article .
Whilst I agree with the points raised here I think there is a fundamental requirement now that requires lots of joined up thinking for not only the people of the drylands to survive but the rest of the planet and its peoples .
I would suggest an attack on several fronts .
Firstly move the Olympics to a permanent site on the edge of a drylands area and use the opportunity to drive wind power generation , feeding filtering desalination plants to hydrate via canals and waterways areas that are becoming increasingly dry .
Built as a permanent solution rather than the short term famine relief that we have seen for the past 40 years .
Riding on the back of a world class sporting event this could be the catalyst to solve water supply .
The spread of these resources over 20 - 30 years could make a substantial difference to the areas .
If pastorial patterns are to be sustainable then less people must depend on them in the long term .
We must therefore build and develop a reliable and sustainable food supply whilst trying to limit both here as in the rest of the world the excessive growth of the human population .
dave , Chatham , Kent , UK
These places were never meant for this many people .
Large populations have traditionally congregated around areas which were already suitable for sustaining them .
Populations can survive in drylands , but not the kinds of populations we see there now .
70 million people in Ethiopia alone ?
5.22 children per woman ?
Half the population under 14 ?
You can't feed everyone in those kinds of conditions -- environment - aware practices or not .
As sad as it may be , starvation and death are simply nature 's way of reducing overpopulation .
Chris C , Utah , USA
Is there anything sustainably progressively green about capitalism ?
Capitalism has ripped out the micro and nano climates ( which combined create an overall generally greener clime ) that hedges and diverse field boundary provide and is thus part of the desertification process .
Ancient Egyptian and Greek eco systems were degraded this way .
Small field small farm small development is the classic solution to desertification and that requires education AND support .
The continual subsidised destruction of small field green field boundary in North America and Europe IS contributing to global warming .
Trickyflyingdave , GB I work for an organisation ( excellent development.com ) that is developing appropriate technologies for addressing soil and water conservation in semi-arid areas .
Sand dams improve a community 's resilience to climate change and enable them to develop sustainably .
Sand dams are also the cheapest way of providing water in dryland areas ; however hardly anyone has even heard of them , including in the development community .
Why do we not support more of this kind of sustainable aid intervention , which enables people to get to a situation where they can support themselves , rather than waiting until there is a crisis situation and dropping food in , which only perpetuates dependency ?
Sophie , Brentford , UK Yes , I agree with her .
What i need to emphasize at this point is the international community in these regions focuses on promoting aid rather than developing capacities of these communities to tackle weather flactuation .
Moreover , i do believe that if modern technology can be applied there is a possibility to sustain these communities .
Dereje , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia
Years ago on a University field trip to Tunisia we were told that the government was trying to settle the nomadic Berber people because the government was embarassed that they made the country look ' backward ' to the tourists .
There was no recognition of their skills and contribution to the conservation of the arid region of the country .
So this is another aspect that needs to be considered - the national governments desire to to appear modernised & westernised .

An excellent article and analysis of ecologies and cultures interacting .
It needed to be read by policy makes generations ago !
BUT : it beg the real question , which it totally ignores .
NO policy , strategy or technology is going to be successful anywhere on the planet if populations continue to double every generation or two .
Most data indicate that much of the planet is already past a sustainable population with Any quality of life , with foreseeable technologies .
Until the population growth is contained , and a humane , workable decline in many areas , all the rest is putting out campfires in the midst of a forest conflagration .
As expectations of a first world lifestyle spreads through the growing electronic interconnection world wide , political instability is only going to get worse unless new and obviously more effective political systems replace the present Massively disfunctional ones .
For the planet to survive , the population and it's interaction with our home has to be managed as a single , interactive system .
Nationalism has been the curse of the last two centuries , and has to be discarded for a larger vision of human welfare and newfound knowledge of the realities of humanity 's sustaining biological and geological systems .
The next century should be interesting .

" Conservative Icon Says Republicans Face ' Looming Disaster , ' Calls on Leadership to ' Resign Immediately ' "

Richard Viguerie comments on the failure of Republican leaders to adhere to his party 's " principles " .
However , he has been silent on this point until now .
He , like most Republicans , was content to accept administration policies as long as power was maintained .
He is not upset by abandonment of so - called conservative principles .
Rather , he regrets losing three special elections and realizes that the public has , however belatedly , given up on the Republican " brand " .
Turning on his party leaders only after the worm has turned is hypocrisy in the extreme .
As your introduction points out , Viguerie is himself a key leader of the Republican party .
Jumping ship ( or throwing the rest of the crew overboard ) is not deserving of any award .
It is simply cynical and cowardly .

Sunny Steve - Actually , Viguerie has been quite outspoken about this for some time , having set up ConservativesBetrayed .com some time ago .
This , however , was the most direct I 've seen him be .
At least lately .
FWIW .
BTW , I 'll be Guest Hosting the Peter B. Collins Show tomorrow ( Friday ) and am trying to see if Viguerie is available to come on as my guest .
If so , of course , I welcome to call in with your questions / concerns etc. during the show !

Brad :
Thanks for the rebuttal re : Viguerie .
I am pleased to be corrected and made aware of his earlier break with the Republican party .
My comments do apply , unfortunately , to the large majority of Republicans in the Congress , who enabled all Bush policies when they held the majority , and who have been so united in blocking attempts to change course since 2006 .
Their ability to doublethink points of principle is astounding : eg. McCain recently compromising his stance against torture and the entire Republican establishment ignoring Senator Vitter 's two escapades with prostitutes .
I do note that Viguerie appears to be quite comfortable with Rush Limbaugh as a fellow champion of the conservative cause .
A more craven hypocrite on matters of principle than Limbaugh , I can not conjure up .

. . . who yesterday called at the " Ultimate John McCain " website for the entire Republican Leadership , from George W. Bush on down , to " resign immediately " .
Um , would n't that make Nancy Pelosi President of the United States ?

Re " Republican leaders have " nothing " to offer Republican voters and are motivated by " nothing except a craving for power . "
Along these lines , McCain 's possible running mate , Carly Fiorina , said this at a Washington press conference :
" There is no job that is America 's God - given right anymore . "
Wonder how that 's going to sit with their white working - class guys demographic .
Unbelievable , huh ?

" The conservative movement has been set back 10 - 20 years – possibly even permanently , " pens the man once referred to as the conservative " funding father " and creator of political direct mail fundraising .
The " party Establishment ... has brought the party down , " he writes , adding " the party must clean house .
The party leadership should resign immediately . "
Thanks for the article Brad .
It 's nice to know that there are Republicans / conservatives that are n't " bat shit crazy " and do n't drink the kool - ade the GOP Leadership offers .
Maybe in 15 or 20 years the Republicans / conservatives will realize that they can't subject most Americans to their extreme right wing form of thought .
As my dad always told me .
Live and let live .

I would n't call Ronald Reagan a " conservative " .
He and Bush did more federal spending than all other presidents combined .
And Bush with a Republican congress to boot !
Goldwater ?
Yep , I 'd call him a conservative .
Not Reagan !
Reagan started the tax on unemployment .
That 's right !
Kick 'em when they 're down !
Reagan wanted to LOWER the minimum wage !
Reagan " meddled " in other countries ( Iran Contra ) and should 've been impeached !
NOT " conservative " !
Goldwater yes , Reagan no !
Absolutely not !
He 's dead - on with everything else he said .
The present Republican Party are NOT " conservatives " .
I 'm surprised more real conservatives do n't come out like this guy , and kick these bastards out of the party .
He 's right on the money , that these creeps took over the Republican Party !
Who are they ?
They 're not " conservatives " !
I think we 've been saying that , though , have n't we ?
I do n't have much of a problem with real conservatives .
I think liberals and conservatives ( real ones ) have a lot in common .
Ron Paul is a real conservative .
American Free Press is a real conservative newspaper .
I like both .
They both HATE these " Republicans " worse than we do !
Just like this guy does !

When the Democrats had all the power , it was easy for the New Gingrich Republicans to take over .
It 's like once they get in there , they 're just after power and money .
They DID fuck over their voters !
They promised to " clean up " if you voted them in , and they became corrupt !
They said , " Give us a chance , and see what we 'll do " .
Republican voters ( and others ) trusted them , and they screwed them over for money and power !
This guy is exactly right on that count !
But there 's still too many people out there that think of labels or party 's instead of the person !

How do we know this is n't a case of " too much , too little , too late " -- especially when it emerges that the GOP 's probably consulting fortune - smellers and other weird and unwholesome types for electoral strategy as may ( howbeit unwittingly ) prove disastrous ?

It 's not that they turned their backs on their constituency , think it through .
Who runs the media ?
Large corporate conglomerates !
Who profits from ( offensive ) defense spending ?
Large corporate conglomerates !
Who has profited from every single major piece of legislation over the last 2 decades ?
Large corporate conglomerates !
Corporate uber alles !
They have served their corporate constituency very well .
They 've merely lied quite successfully about who their constituency is .
Now , however , the genie is exiting the bottle .
And no amount of media spin or blackout can put it back .
No amount of populace pandering legislation can put that genie back .
And , ( hopefully ) , no military operation can defeat that genie .
Truth always wins out , and none but the most authoritarian follower types will be left to support their lies .
One huge battle remains , and that one is still up for grabs , for the corporate monster STILL controls the vote counting .
Hammering away at the lies with the mallets of justice and integrity have won the skirmishes , but do n't think for a moment that their corporate buddy 's machinations wo n't be out in force in November .
Nothing short of an overwhelming anti-corporate voter turn out will win this war .
( Note , NOT anti republican / pro democrat , for their are PLENTY of unscrupulous corporate owned Dems out there too ! )
Not only do the corrupted Republicans need to go , so too , where possible , does a significant message need to be sent out , in no uncertain terms , to the likes of the pandering Reid , Pelosi , Rockefeller and Feinstein .
Vote integrity , this November , not party .
( although integrity does heavily favor the Dems )

I used to be a Republican , btw , and just could n't do it anymore when it became apparent that the extreme right - wing fringe was taking it over .

Mr. Viguerie fails to recognize that the present Republican leadership is the result and embodiment of the " conservative " revolution he helped to found .
The vulture has come home to roost .
From the word go in 1994 when the Republicans occupied the chambers of Congress and the backrooms of K Street the sole operating " principle " was not the good of the nation but greed , raw and dripping with blood .

Mr. Vigurie is honest but wrong .
The Republican leadership is totally loyal to core conservative principals .
These principals actually consist of just one central goal and everything it takes to get there .
That is the goal of further concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the super wealthy elite .
Everything else - gay marraige , guns , god etc. are just distractions , lures to bring along the hayseeds .
After all how else do you get the poor saps to vote against their economic interests .
If you gave any random group of Republican leaders the level of power these assholes have had you would get the same result 100 times out of 100 .
This time the next Democratic President needs to bring them to justice .
Bush , Cheney , Condi , Powell , Greenspan , Thomas , Sandra Day , Scalia , all of them .
A fair trail , a conviction and execution by hanging .
This is the prescription for traitors .

As is so often the case , Digby said it best :
There is no such thing as a bad conservative .
" Conservative " is a magic word that applies to those who are in other conservatives ' good graces .
Until they are n't .
At which point they are liberals .
Get used to hearing about how the Republicans failed because they were n't true conservatives .
Conservatism can never fail .
It can only be failed by weak - minded souls who refuse to properly follow its tenets .
It 's a lot like communism that way .

Nice article .
The arguement about whether Richard Viguerie is or is n't a traitor enabler or a hypocrite seems kind of semantic .
The point is that what he said is true .
I 've been blogging the same thing at my site .
I do n't think the reasons he said it are as important as what he said .
I 've had the same ideas for a long time .
Blaming everyone especially on the national level is counter productive .
Sure I think leadership should be canned and quick .
But who is going to do it ?
Think the leadership will or all their consultant companies that make up those syrupy condescending poll survey beg for money questionairs they spend fortunes on .
We the people have to make the change .
The time to make change is now , not after the election .
Now is the time the term enabler is a bad thing , if we do nothing and help enable the status quo .
I think Richard Viguerie gave the gun shot that might get things started .
Newt shot a volley earlier .
We have to get back to the real " bottom up " politics , not lip service , but at the precinct level we have to convince voters that they can trust conservative candidates again .
We need leaders that will listen , that are honest .
The people want to elect someone who will fix government not just claim lofty ideals .
Republicans and Conservatives ( WE ) promised we did n't deliver .
Perhaps it would of been better if we would of died trying during the " Revolution " instead of slowly becoming this do nothing , change nothing , make things worse , condescending bickering mess we have become .
Thanks for letting me vent .

Conservatism was always about power and greed .
Goldwater was n't totally bat - shit crazy , but his ideas were ' out of the mainstream ' , to use a favorite wing - nut phrase .
Buckley was smart and witty and charming and fun to watch and completely wrong .
The Ayn Rand cultists ( Greenspan , anyone ? ) were no different than the Straussian neo-cons : 'we are superior beings , we should be allowed to run the world . '
Of course , when they got the chance they made it work only for themselves , because the rubes do n't deserve more .
It reminds me of John and Fanny Dashwood as they talk themselves out of helping his sisters .
I grew up in a town ( Midland , MI ) enamored of ' conservative principles . '
It was a horrible place - racist , elitist , xenophobic and smug .

Also on Tuesday , General Motors said it would cut employment costs , sell assets and borrow at least $ 2 billion to bolster liquidity in the face of plummeting sales .
The Labor Department said producer prices over the last 12 months were up 9.2 percent , the biggest increase since a 10.4 percent gain in June 1981 when the United States was last mired in a low - growth , high - inflation period known as stagflation .
A regional manufacturing survey showed factory activity in New York contracted for the fifth time in six months and data in the report suggested producers were passing on higher prices to consumers , which could add further fuel to inflation .
The reports come ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 's semiannual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee , which starts at 10 a.m .
" The PPI number is just outrageous , " said T.J. Marta , fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York .
" What does this mean for Bernanke later today ?
Certainly he 's got to talk about the risk to inflation . "
On Wall Street , U.S. stock index futures remained lower after the reports , while the dollar held onto its losses .
U.S. government bonds , which generally benefit in times of economic weakness , added to earlier gains .
The data coincided with a report from General Motors Corp , which said it would cut white - collar employment costs by 20 percent , sell up to $ 4 billion of assets , and borrow at least $ 2 billion in a bid to bolster its liquidity by $ 15 billion through 2009 .
Economists had expected government tax rebate checks to boost June retail sales more , despite the weak economy , but much of that seems to have been reflected in May 's gains .
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast total retail sales to rise 0.4 percent in June after a 0.8 percent gain in May that was initially reported as a 1.0 percent rise .
Excluding autos , retail sales rose 0.8 , which was also below the pre-report consensus of 1.0 percent .
Excluding autos , building supplies and gasoline , retail sales rose 0.4 percent .
U.S. producer prices rose a far larger - than - expected 1.8 percent on the month in June as energy costs soared .
If there was any good news on inflation , it was that core prices at the producer level , which exclude food and energy , edged up just 0.2 percent .
The New York Federal Reserve 's " Empire State " general business conditions index came in at minus 4.92 in July from minus 8.68 in June .
Worryingly , its indexes of prices paid and received both rose to their highest since the survey began in 2001 .
The increase in prices received may raise concerns that inflation is being passed through to consumers .
Affordable health insurance is ILLEGAL in many states .
The Wall Street Journal , among others , has pointed out how one - thousand - plus mandates in New Jersey balloon the premiums to a figure SIX times as high as Kentucky .
Want some health insurance ?
Gotta buy the gold - plated coverage required by law ( hair transplants and all ) .
Endless government mandates make it illegal to sell affordable health insurance AND mandates also raise health care costs — we all have to pay for insurance that includes such things as infertility treatment .
( As the father of two , I do n’t need the latter ! ) .
In the late 1980s , I sold health insurance in New England to people who did not have it .
Many were self - employed .
A young healthy person could buy top-rated major medical for $ 30 / month .
That was low enough to encourage my clients to buy .
Then , the “ progressives ” tacked sugar plum mandates onto health insurance and eventually required all companies to take on any one who applied .
The result ?
Costs soared and most private insurance companies withdrew from the state .
That made it necessary for the state to create an indemnity pool to cover those without insurance .
Guess what ?
The cost was sky high .
My self - employed brother bought a $ 30 / month policy .
Later , he developed two types of cancer , and after the $ 2,000 maximum out - of - pocket , the insurance company paid everything .
Plus his rate did not go up ( that ’s standard insurance law ) .
But the progressives , concerned about people like him , killed private insurance , his carrier withdrew from the state , and my brother paid ten times as much to the state for its “ universal ” coverage .
That ’s the kind of government compassion we could do without .
Eventually , my brother figured it was better to work for a large corporation .
After all , why create your own business when the government makes it so difficult ?
My “ progressive ” friends argue that it is “ nice ” to have these things covered in ALL insurance plans .
But that ’s the one - size - fits - all mentality that got us into this mess .
The social democratic goal is universal single payer ( government ) insurance .
They would , if they could .
Meanwhile , I ’m reminded of the sixties slogan : “ the worse , the better ” — the worse “ progressives ” make things in the insurance market ( where people have choices ) , the better their chance at making the “ right ” choice for us all .
Let ’s hope that other states follow Florida ’s lead in allowing insurance companies to sell a variety of plans without all the mandates .
Yes , it ’s “ back to the 1980s ” and no cure - all , but it is a step in the right direction .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Like a medieval ATM , one family bankrolled the cultural movement that dragged Europe out of the Dark Ages and into modernity .
With their love for art , science and culture , the Medici of Florence catalyzed the Renaissance that began in the 14th century , making household names of da Vinci , Michelangelo and Galileo in the process .
The revival of learning , rationality and the arts patronized by the Medici in Italy spread throughout Europe , sped along by the invention of the printing press , and forever transformed the Western world .
Big business meant extra dough for art
Europe in the 14th century was a downtrodden place , ravaged by war and a plague that killed nearly half its people .
Florence was hard hit by the Black Death , but those who survived tended to be rich as well as newly critical of absolute faith in religion .
The conditions were ideal for a cultural transformation , according to historians .
One of those wealthy families was the Medici , who made money first as merchants and then as de facto rulers and bankers of Florence .
By the 1400s , the Medici was one of the richest and most powerful families in Europe .
The Medici were just as proficient in cultivating culture as they were at amassing their fortune , however .
At the time , artists survived only on advanced commissions and needed to be " adopted " under the patronage of one person or family for long periods of time to continue working .
For their part , the Medici took on Renaissance masters such as Michelangelo , da Vinci , Botticelli , Raphael and Brunelleschi , resulting in grand works of art ranging from the Sistine Chapel to the famous Duomo .
The art produced in Florence from the 14th to the 17th centuries , along with the monumental libraries collected by the Medici , made the city the undisputed beacon of culture during the Renaissance .
Medicis stoked the humanist flame
While the artists funded by the Medici discovered new techniques in painting with oils and perspective , many also dappled in science .
Da Vinci , in particular , studied just about everything as part of a general resurgence in the classic notions of science , philosophy and politics that had been lost for centuries .
With the money he earned from tutoring the Medici children , Galileo Galilei also quietly mapped out the workings of the universe .
Other scientists drawn to the center of Renaissance culture tinkered in Florentine workshops on cartography and tools for navigation .
This renewed interest in the scientific method , called humanism , radiated out from Florence to the rest of Europe quickly with the invention of the printing press in the second half of the 15th century .
By stoking the flames of humanist thought , casual discussions in the gardens of Medici - funded scientists and their contemporaries directly influenced the Protestant Reformation , the creation of new universities around the Western world and the age of exploration of the 16th century .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Israel has approved the construction of almost 900 new homes in East Jerusalem , a move that could hinder international efforts to secure a peace deal by year 's end .
Israel is under pressure to dismantle East Jerusalem outposts like this one in Maaleh Hazeitim , seen in April .
The Palestinians hope to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state .
A spokesman for Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim said his office will issue a tender this week for the construction of 884 houses , 121 of them in Har Homa .
The rest will be in Pisgat Zeev .
Both are neighborhoods annexed by Israel in 1967 .
The housing ministry said it timed the issuance of the permits to coincide with the 41st anniversary of the annexation .
Israel and the Palestinians are in peace talks that include the future of Jewish settlements and East Jerusalem .
In March , Israel announced plans to build 600 homes in East Jerusalem as part of the Jerusalem mayor 's initiative to construct 40,000 homes in the city to ease the housing plight of young couples .
At the time , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who was in the region to shore up support for the peace initiative -- said Israel should stop all settlement activity .
Largely at the request of the United States , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert froze construction in both Har Homa and Pisgat Zeev , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported .
The newspaper said Israel issued a tender last year for the construction of 300 housing units in Har Homa , sparking harsh international criticism .
As a result , Olmert said he will need to approve all future construction plans personally , the paper said .
CNN 's Shira Medding contributed to this report .

The investment was announced at the presidential compound in Mexico City US giant Ford is to invest $ 3bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) in a new car plant in Mexico , the biggest investment in the country 's manufacturing sector .
The move is a blow to American car workers who had hoped the factory would be built in the United States .
Ford has lost more than $ 15 bn ( £ 7.5 bn ) over the past two years and says the new facility is crucial to its future .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon hailed the announcement as a " turning point " for his country .
The new factory , and other changes to Ford 's Mexican operations , are likely to create an estimated 4,500 jobs in Mexico , where car workers earn substantially less than their American counterparts .
Mr Calderon made the announcement with Ford president Alan Mullaly at the presidential compound in Mexico City on Friday .
" We want Mexico to be an automotive country , one that is competitive and with the most advantages so that the worldwide automotive industry will establish itself here , " Mr Calderon said .
Mr Mullaly said : " We are convinced the geographic location as well as Mexico 's highly qualified labour force and economic stability make this decision the right one for our business . "
Environmental concerns
The factory will build Ford 's new Fiesta sub - compact car , which is the company 's attempt to shift towards the fast - growing market for smaller , more fuel - efficient cars .
It will be located near Mexico City and the plant is expected to start delivering the Fiesta to the US market in 2010 .
The BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Mexico City says Ford , the second largest car manufacturer in the US , is being hit by the slowdown in consumer spending and soaring oil prices .
Drivers are moving away from Ford 's traditional stable of bigger trucks and Sports Utility Vehicles because of rising fuel prices , plummeting house prices and concerns about the environment , he says .
The decision to invest in Mexico will be a blow to the United Auto Workers union , which reached a cost - cutting agreement with Ford in a bid to make US plants more competitive .
The company had also hoped its programme of slashing cut - price vehicles to car hire companies would help ease its financial woes .
But earlier this month , Ford announced it was abandoning its goal of making its loss - making North American business profitable next year .
Ford 's plans in Mexico also include moving one of its factories from large truck to small car production , and opening a new diesel engine line at another plant .

As tnkgrl mentions at the outset of this hack , the MacBook Air SuperDrive is a nice little slice of hotness , retailing for a mere $ 99 , and doing the whole external drive thing with Apple 's sense of style .
Unfortunately , it only works with the MacBook Air due to a proprietary IDE to USB bridge , as tnkgrl discovered .
For a mere $ 9 she was able to find a replacement part , and after pushing some internals around she had her self a Mac mini and HP Mini-Note - friendly USB disc drive .
We 've all been laboring under the assumption that Apple needed more than the standard USB power draw , so it comes as a bit of a surprise that she was able to pull this off with a regular part , and we demand Apple start selling $ 108 Super Drives - for - all immediately .

FAMILY VIOLENCE
A report from : Family Resources & Research
It aint what ya dont know that hurts ya .
What really puts a hurtin on ya is what ya knows for sure , that just ai n't so .

Inquire into them , that 's how to know what things are really true .
Quaeras de dubiis , legem bene discere si vis .
-- St. Augustine
Why We Publish This Report
We are sending this report to the media , law enforcement , family law attorneys , and those persons and organizations who deal with family violence , in the hope that we can correct a serious misunderstanding about this very important issue .
We want to make it clear that we have been working to end family violence for decades .
One of us is an original incorporator of our local women 's shelter .
We were members of the " Century Club " , those who contribute over $ 100 annually .
We have sponsored benefit events for our shelter that attracted national media attention .
Since we began publishing scientific studies on family violence the womens shelter has returned our contributions and is conducting a smear campaign against us .
How Can This Be ?
The family violence issue has been distorted and politicized by the gender wars .
Believing what gender activists say about family violence is like believing what the tobacco companies say about cancer .
Unfortunately , almost all information available to the public comes in the form of political propaganda from " Men 's Rights " groups or " Women 's Rights " groups .
This misunderstanding of the family violence issue is so pervasive that city and county governments , the courts , law enforcement , prosecutors offices , mental health clinics , and other tax supported agencies are now funding programs based on gender politics rather than responsible scientific studies .
There are more than 100 solid scientific studies that reveal a startlingly different picture of family violence than what we usually see in the media .
For instance :

Violence against children by women is another issue where the public attitude is very different than the facts revealed by formal studies .
* Women commit most child abuse in intact biological families .
When the man is removed from the family the children are at greater risk .
* Mother - only households are more dangerous to children than father - only households .
* Children are 3 times more likely to be fatally abused in Mother - only Households than in Father - only Households , and many times more likely in households where the mother cohabits with a man other than the biological father .
* Children raised in Single - mother Households are 8 times more likely to become killers than children raised with their biological father .
Other studies reveal more about female violence against children : * Women hit their male children more frequently and more severely than they hit their female children .
* Women commit 55 % of child murders and 64 % of their victims are male children .
* Eighty two percent of the general population had their first experience of violence at the hands of women , usually their mother .
Our culture learns to be violent from our mothers , not our fathers .
Yet , 3.1 million reports of child abuse are filed against men each year , most of which are false accusations used as leverage in a divorce or custody case .
Why We Don't Know the Truth
How could we all be so mistaken about family violence ?
Have we been conned ?
Have we been taken in by one of the slickest " stings " ever executed ?
Here is how the truth has been hidden .
Use of misleading statistics for political and financial gain : * Men do not usually report their violent wives to police .
* Children do not usually report their violent mothers to the police .
* Women are far more likely to report violent men to the police .
* Police statistics describe the activities of the police departments and are grossly misleading as to the nature of family violence .
One study done of emergency room patients shows that only 1 % of men who were injured by women reported the incident to police .
That should be enough to be suspicious of police statistics on spousal violence .
There are other reasons police statistics are dramatically misleading .
Some women call the police because there is a real need for intervention .
However , there are other reasons for a woman to report a man , whether he be violent or not .
* Women are encouraged to report spousal violence by countless media reminders .
Propaganda always includes the female victim and the male perpetrator .
Men are discouraged from claiming to be victims of violent women .
*
Some women call police because they are frightened by a minor incident .
Perhaps she thought calling the police was a " trump card " in an argument .
These women do not realize that with one phone call they have invited the government and gender politics into their homes .
*
Some women make false reports because there are legal , financial , and child custody rewards for making a false report .
Some divorce attorneys and gender activists specialize in encouraging false accusations , and actively coaching women how to falsely accuse .
Several researchers have documented that one of the common adaptive tools of human females , used to compensate for smaller size and social power , is to mimic victim behavior , including false accusations against a power figure ( boss , parent , counselor , teacher , husband , lover , police , etc. ) .
Adolescent girls are the demographic group most prone to this adaptive tool .
These factors , and others , distort police statistics beyond usefulness to anyone who is sincerely looking for the truth about family violence .
However , misleading statistics are a deliberate fund raising tactic for women 's shelters .
The shelter movement almost never mentions scientific studies .
This misuse of distorted police statistics to push a " female victims " agenda is widespread and very misleading .
Gender activists have high jacked the legitimate issue of family violence and turned it into " Americas Most Successful Fundraising Fraud " .
The promotion of family violence myths and misleading statistics detracts from the importance and scope of the family violence problem .
If we are misled about the nature of family violence we will be misled about solutions .
A falsely framed issue skews understanding and jeopardizes justice .
For example , former Massachusetts Bar Association President Elaine Epstein stated , " It has become essentially impossible to effectively represent a man against whom any allegation of domestic violence has been made . "
The Other Police Statistics You Don't Hear About
Men and children may not report when they are injured by a woman , however , the dead bodies of the men and children who are the victims of violent women are usually reported .
Murder statistics are far more reliable than reported abuse statistics .
The Bureau of Justice Statistics released a report of family homicides in 33 urban counties .
Some gender activists claim that violent women are acting in self - defense .
These quoted statistics represent convictions for murder .
1 . " In spouse murders , women represented 41 percent of killers . "
2 . " In murders of their offspring , women predominated , accounting for 55 percent of killers . "
3 . " Among black marital partners , wives were just about as likely to murder their husbands as husbands were to murder their wives : 47 percent of the victims of a spouse were husbands and 53 percent were wives . "
This is a long way from the claim that " men are responsible for 90 % of family violence " .
Those who quote law enforcement statistics to support the " male villain - female victim " dogma are either misled or deliberately attempting to mislead .
The Hidden Victims
The scientific data shows that both men and women are violent to a far greater extent than police statistics reveal .
This scientific data shows that spousal violence is mostly unreported .
In fact , some degree of violence occurs at a rate of 113 incidents per 1000 couples per year ( husband on wife ) and 121 incidents per 1000 couples per year ( wife on husband ) .
Many local women 's shelters emphasize female victims reported to the police , and ignore much larger numbers of women , children , and men who are also victims of family violence .
We quote from a brochure from a battered womens shelter : " What Is Domestic Violence ?
Domestic violence is an increasingly visible social and legal problem wherein women are abused by their partners . "
Notice that it doesnt say that this is one aspect of domestic violence , or that this is the aspect that they deal with , but rather that this is domestic violence .
Surely domestic violence is violence which takes place at home , the word domestic referring to the definition " of or relating to the household or the family .
Female violence against children is another taboo topic among gender activists .
From our experience with shelter personnel , this is a typical attitude .
And after using physical abuse as the topic to begin the discussion of abuse , ( more accurately , " the physical abuse of women by men " ) , many shelter workers go on to mention all the other types of abuse men do to women , like emotional and psychological .
The conversation seldom turns to look at any type of abuse by women to men even though dozens of scientific studies indicate women are at least as violent as men in " domestic " settings .
Most leaders in the women 's shelter movement are fully aware of the broader scope of family violence but hold fast to the villain / victim dogma .
The directors of women 's shelters almost always know that they are deliberately misleading the public .
Why ?
They must maintain their power and fund raising base .
If they lose their special " victim status " they will rapidly go out of business .
They do not want to be replaced with a gender neutral , family friendly , community service agency that implements policy on the basis of scientific studies rather than gender propaganda .
Feminism Vs Science And The Law
There is much confusion about whom to believe in the debate about spousal violence .
On one side we have gender activists who rely on law enforcement statistics .
On the other side we have social scientists who rely on scientifically structured studies .
Unfortunately , the results of scientific studies do not receive media attention .
Americas press is seemingly more interested in political correctness than scientific accuracy .
Therefore , the public perception , and the perception of many well - intentioned domestic violence activists , is radically skewed away from the more balanced perception of social scientists .
Many abuse shelter personnel below the executive level are unaware of the scientific studies , even though they claim to be " domestic violence experts " and often conduct " training " sessions for government agencies .
There are towns and cities in our country where the entire legal establishment , including law enforcement , family law attorneys , and judges , are making decisions about family violence based on political propaganda rather than well established research .
Here is a comment on the subject from a judge who asked for our report .
We have rescued him from any consequences resulting from his candor by disguising his identity .
Dear Revs. Sewell
Thanks for the interesting information .
I am a judge in xxxxx who regularly hears requests for domestic violence orders of protection .
The DV issue has been politicized big time in our area .
We judges are ordered to attend " consciousness raising " seminars where we are harangued by feminist " experts " .
Supervising judges have been courted and won over , and now we have annual breakfasts honoring judges who cooperate with the feminist " agenda " .
As a former prosecutor and divorce lawyer I know that the best deterrent to violence by human beings is arrest , prosecution and appropriate consequences .
With well - prepared cases , vigorous prosecution , and no nonsense consequences the cycle of abuse can be broken , no matter who the abuser is .
Humans become habitual abusers because they get away with it .
It is impossible to make progress in reducing domestic violence until we recognize that women are violent .
As a member of an advisory committee for the local shelter I was shocked at the attitudes of the ladies who ran the center :
The ONLY solution championed by the shelter was to get free from that big bad male .
The committee expressed concern about the underlying anti-male bias which even showed up in the name of the shelter and recommended that the name be changed to The Center for Victims of Abuse - rather than Womens Strength .
Anyway , I forwarded your piece on to a couple of other judges - some of whom will undoubtedly immediately reject its premise .
Judge xxxxxx
The typical response of the abuse shelter workers upon first hearing the results of the scientific studies is to " shoot the messenger " .
You can almost hear their minds snap closed .
There is an almost cult like " party line " among victim advocates .
Much of the belief system of their " cult " has no more scientific or rational basis than that of fanatical religious cults .
On the other hand , some abuse agency personnel have not accepted the " party line " ; particularly religiously sponsored family services organizations .
They are eager to have accurate information upon which to plan and implement rational programs for prevention , intervention , and treatment for abusers and victims of both genders .
Are the family violence " experts " in your community aware of the scientific studies ?
What is happening at the abuse shelter in your community ?
Spousal Violence In Other Countries
We think it is important to note that there have been the same kind of studies done in many countries .
There is cross-cultural verification that women are more violent than men in family settings .
When behavior has cross-cultural verification it means that it is part of human nature rather than a result of cultural conditioning .
Females are most often the perpetrators in spousal violence in all but one of the cultures that have been studied to date .
That leads many professionals to conclude that there is something biological about violent females in family situations .
Researchers are now exploring the role of the " territorial imperative " as a factor in womens violence against men .
Women see the home as their territory .
Like many other species on the planet , we humans will ignore size difference when we experience conflict on our own territory .
So , the scientific results that reveal the violence of American women are not unique to our culture , and do not indicate a special pathology among American women .
World wide , women are more violent than men in family settings .
One of the leading researchers in this field did a cross-cultural comparison of marital abuse entitled " Married Couples from 9 Different Cultures " .
These cross-cultural studies yielded results very similar to family violence studies done in the United States and other nations .
Another survey of couples in Canada found the same familiar pattern in that the rate of severe husband - to - wife violence was 4.8 % , while severe wife - to - husband violence was 10 % .
The Canadian study below is typical of the results of scientific studies on family violence done in many nations .
Female Vs. Male Perpetrated Violence As A %age Of All Respondents :
Minor Violence % of females % of males
Threw an object ( not at partner ) 23.6 15.8 Threaten to throw object 14.9 7.3
Threw object at partner 16.2 4.6 Pushed or grabbed 19.8 17.2 Severe Violence Slapped , punched , kicked 15.8 7.3 Used weapon 3.1 0.9 Violence as self defense 9.9 14.8 Alcohol factor 8.0 16.0
My partner needed medical help 14.3 21.4 Overall Violence 39.1 26.3
The Propaganda Problem
Abuse shelter advocates have severely distorted the picture and deliberately produce fraudulent statistics and dis-information .
Even when they quote well - grounded statistics , they misuse the information .
Here is an example :
One of the favorite statistics quoted by abuse shelter advocates is that a woman is the victim of spousal violence every 15 seconds .
This statistic is deduced from a well conducted piece of research which was published in the Journal of Marriage and Family , a respected professional journal for marriage and family therapists .
The Abuse Shelter advocates arrived at this figure by using one of the conclusions of the study , i.e. ; 1.8 million women suffer an assault from a husband or boyfriend per year .
What abuse shelter advocates always fail to report is another finding of the same study , i.e. ; 2 million men are assaulted by a wife or girl friend per year , which translates as , a man is the victim of spousal violence every 14 seconds .
This is typical of the wide spread deception practiced by abuse shelter advocates .
Americas press establishment is a party to this deception , and shares the blame for exacerbating the problem by helping to perpetuate a false diagnosis .
Acknowledging That Women Are Abusers Leads To Better Solutions
Women usually initiate spousal violence episodes ( they hit first ) , and women hit more frequently , as well as using weapons three times more often then men .
This combination of violent acts means that efforts to find solutions to the family violence problem need to include appropriate focus on female perpetrators .
We need to recognize that women are violent , and we need nationwide educational programs that portray women as perpetrators .
Other studies show that men are becoming less violent at the same time that women are becoming more violent .
Educating men seems to be working .
Educating women to be less violent should now be the main thrust of public education programs .
Any family violence program which accepts the " male abuser - female victim " paradigm is based on a false premise .
These kind of family violence programs actually perpetuate the problem of abuse and do not deserve to be supported by private citizens or government agencies .
Many government agencies , and legitimate charities , have been funding a feminist political cause , rather than funding rational , solution focused , family violence prevention programs .
What kind of family violence program do you have in your community ?
Does your local program encourage the healing of families , or do they take the " divorce " approach ?
Does the family violence prevention program in your community devote as much attention to violent females , as it does to violent males ?
If not , why not ?
We need a family - friendly agency in our community that delivers services to all family members and works to preserve families , not tear them apart .
We dont need gender activists with an anti-marriage , anti-family political ax to grind .
We need to separate gender politics from the issue of family violence .
We need to look at the full spectrum of family violence , not just female victims .
We need to consult scientific studies when we make policy decisions .
We cannot hope to implement rational , solution - focused programs and policies until we face the fact that " behind closed doors " women are at least as violent as men .
Some Exceptions To The Usual Media Silence On Science Based Stories On Family Violence .
Spouse Abuse a Two - Way Street By Warren Farrell , Ph.D. USA Today , June 29 , 1994
Just as bad cases make bad laws , so can celebrity cases reinforce old myths .
The biggest myth the O.J. Simpson case is likely to reinforce is the myth that domestic violence is a one way street ( male - to- female ) , and its corollary , that male violence against women is an outgrowth of masculinity .
When I began seven years of research into these issues in preparation for " The Myth of Male Power " , I began with these two assumptions since I had been the only man in the United States to have been elected three times to the Board of Directors of the National Organization of Women in New York City , and these assumptions went unquestioned in feminist circles .
My first finding - that in the U.S. and Canada more than 90 % of the domestic violence reports to the police were by women , not men - seemed to confirm these assumptions .
But , then the picture became more complex .
About a dozen studies in the U.S. and Canada asked BOTH sexes how often they hit each other , all of them found that women hit men either more frequently or about as often as the reverse .
Two of the main studies - by Suzanne Steinmetz , Murray Straus and Richard Gelles - assumed men hit women more severely , so they divided domestic violence into seven different levels of severity .
They were surprised to discover that , overall , the more severe levels of violence were conducted more by women against men .
A caveat , though .
Men hitting women did more damage than the reverse .
However , this caveat carried its own caveat : it was exactly because mens hits hurt more that women resorted to more severe methods ( i.e. tossing boiling water over her husband or swinging a frying pan into his face ) .
These findings were supported by the Census Bureaus own survey :
As early as 1977 , the U.S. Census Bureau conducted the National Crime Survey , surveying 60,000 households every six months for three and one half years .
They found women use weapons against men 82 % of the time ; men use weapons against women 25 % of the time .
Overall , they found that even the women acknowledged they hit men more than men hit women .
The key issue , though , is who initiates this cycle of violence .
Steinmetz , Strauss and Gelles found to their initial surprise that women are more likely to be the first initiators .
Why ?
In part , the belief that men can take it - - they can therefore be a punching bag and not be expected to hit back .
I was still a bit incredulous .
I asked thousands of men and women in my workshops to count all the relationships in which they had hit their partner before their partner had ever it them .
and vice versa .
About 60 % of the women acknowledged they had more often been the first to strike a blow : among the men , about 90 % felt their female partner had been the first to strike a blow .
I still felt violence was an out growth of masculinity .
I was half right .
Men are responsible for most of the violence which occurs outside the home .
However , when 54 % of women in lesbian relationships acknowledge violence in their current relationship , vs. only 11 % of heterosexual couples reporting violence , I realized that domestic violence is not an outgrowth of male biology .
Why do we vigorously denounce domestic violence against women and not even know about domestic violence against men ?
Women Abuse Men : Its More Widespread Than People Think By Armin A. Brott .
M.D. From Special supplement to The Washington Post , 12/28/93
Despite all the evidence about female - on - male violence , many groups actively try to suppress coverage of the issue .
Suzanne Steinmetz received verbal threats and anonymous phone calls from radical womens groups threatening to harm her children after she published " The Battered Husband Syndrome " in 1978 .
She says she finds it ironic that the same people who claim that women - initiated violence is purely self defense are so quick to threaten violence against people who do nothing more than publish a scientific study .
Steinmetzs story is not unique .
Ten years after that study , R.L. McNeely , a professor at the School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin , and Gloria Robinson - Simpson published " The Truth About Domestic Violence : A Falsely Framed Issue . "
The article examined various studies on domestic violence and concluded that society must recognize that men are victims " or we will be addressing only part of the phenomenon . "
Shortly thereafter , McNeely received letters from a Pennsylvania womens organization threatening to use its influence in Washington to pull his research funding .
Robinson - Simpson , who uncovered some of the most important data , largely was left alone .
According to McNeely , " she , a young assistant professor , was assumed to have been " duped " by the senior male professor . "
Domestic Abuse : Its Not Always His Fault By Betsy Hart , Scripps Howard News Service
8/18/97
Not long ago members of Virginias General Assembly considered a bill meant to keep husbands from abusing their wives : putting a warning label at the top of marriage licenses !
It didnt get far .
( Possibly calmer heads prevailed and pointed out that its non marital relationships that are a major risk factor for abuse . )
Still , this attempt highlights the prevailing notion in domestic violence circles that " its always his fault . "
That , in fact , is the title of the cover article in the summer issue of " The Womens Quarterly , " published by the Independent Womens Forum , an increasingly high - profile group thats kind of an antidote to the National Organization for Women .
Author Sally L. Satel , psychiatrist and Yale medical school lecturer , shows how accepted Gloria Steinems assertion that " the patriarchy requires violence in order to maintain itself " has become .
I.e. , abusive men arent criminals , or drunks , or particularly troubled people some of whom may be redeemed .
They are just men .
The Chicago Metropolitan Battered Womens Network explains : " Battery is a fulfillment of cultural expectation , not a defiant or sick behavior . "
This view pervades the activist groups dealing with this issue , and the bureaucracies that fund them with federal dollars .
Today a dozen states basically preclude treatment other than feminist therapy of domestic batterers , Satel notes , and more are following .
Forget joint counseling when appropriate and desired .
Involving the batterers mate in treatment amounts to " blaming the victim .
That , despite the fact that many abuse experts unhindered by feminist blinders recognize abuse is often part of a " dance of mutual destructiveness " as psychologist Judith Shervin writes .
And that women initiate violence in cohabiting relationships as often as men ( often using weapons to make up for physical differences ) according to leading abuse researchers - widely respected across philosophical lines - Richard Gelles and Murray Straus .
No matter .
" Don , " a college administrator arrested for once slapping his wife ( they are still together ) was required to attend a typical " abuse " program .
Every week " the message was clear , " Don told Satel .
" Whatever she does to you is your fault , whatever you do to her is your fault .
It would have been a lot more helpful if they taught us to recognize when we felt ourselves being driven into a position where we lash out .
The message should have been " recognize it , deal with it , and quit hitting . "
All Don got was guilt about his maleness .
Hand in hand with this agenda are feminist backed " must arrest " and similar legal policies which exist in hundreds of jurisdictions .
These require police to arrest one partner - almost always the man - when called to a domestic dispute .
Even when things have completely cooled down , there was no hitting , and the woman doesnt want the man arrested .
Common " no - drop " polices do not allow a woman to drop abuse charges once theyre filed , even if her motive was anger , not fear .
In California , it is mandatory for judges to issue a restraining order separating the parties in all domestic violence cases .
Such practices treat women like children , and ensure that if couples stay together - and most in fact do - nothing really changes , Satel writes , though the woman might mistakenly and dangerously be led to believe it has .
While there is virtually no convincing data that this feminist approach to male violence is effective , Satel notes , several respected studies suggest that these typical legal practices can escalate spousal violence in some men by further enraging them .
The goal of these feminist treatments and legal responses , Satel says , is to separate women from their abusive partner - no matter what the circumstances , and no matter how fervently the women wish otherwise .
These " one size fits all " policies might make a bit more sense if " abuse " always meant serious , systematic violence .
But the feminist politicization of the term " abuse " renders it virtually meaningless .
A typical check - list , this from the Westchester Coalition of Family Violence agencies , tells women that if their partner behaves in " an overprotective manner , " " turns minor incidents into major arguments " or " insults you , " then " you might be abused . "
Sometimes , of course , no redemption is possible , and leaving , or ensuring the violent spouse is locked up ( preferably for good ) , is the only answer .
And Satel rightly notes that the feminist agenda in this area has forced law enforcement to take domestic abuse seriously .
But once again , the radical feminist agenda of " man bad woman good " has permeated the culture on an a fundamentally important issue , and once again it has done a terrible disservice to the constituency feminists are supposed to help - women .

Sen . Barack Obama has a bad idea for " extending the life of Social Security . "
He has proposed applying the Social Security tax to incomes above $ 250,000 , in addition to the current tax on incomes up to $ 102,000 .
It 's unfair , he explained , for middle - class earners to pay Social Security tax on " every dime they make " while the very rich pay on " only a very small percentage of their income . "
Reporters cited the Obama statement without asking for the logic behind having someone making $ 100,000 pay on every dime and someone making ...
KABUL , Afghanistan 
The girl was 11 when she was molested by a man with no legs .
The man paid her $ 5 .
And that was how she started selling sex .
Afghanistan is one of the world 's most conservative countries , yet its sex trade appears to be thriving .
Sex is sold most obviously at brothels full of women from China who serve both Afghans and foreigners .
Far more controversial are Afghan prostitutes , who stay underground in a society that pretends they do n't exist .
Customs meant to keep women " pure " have not stopped prostitution .
Girls are expected to remain virgins until their wedding nights , so some prostitutes have only anal sex .
Police make two to three prostitution arrests each week , according to Zia ul - Haq , the chief investigator in the Interior Ministry 's department of sexual crimes .
They are often the casualties of nearly three decades of brutal war and a grinding poverty that forces most Afghans to live on less than $ 1 a day .
" Prostitution is in every country that has poverty , and it exists in Afghanistan , " says women 's rights activist Orzala Ashraf .
" But society has black glasses and ignores these problems .
Tradition is honor , and if we talk about these taboos , then we break tradition . "
The girl is now 13 , and her features have just sharpened into striking beauty .
She speaks four languages — the local languages of Pashtu and Dari , the Urdu she picked up as a refugee in Pakistan and the English she learned in a $ 2.40 - a- month course she pays for herself in Kabul .
She is the breadwinner in her family of 10 .
She does not know what a condom is .
She has not heard of AIDS .
The Associated Press learned her story in a dozen meetings over four months , as well as interviews with police and aid workers .
For months she insisted she was a " good girl " — a virgin .
But in March , she confessed to having anal sex with men for years , starting with the legless beggar .
She looked down as she spoke , her face and hands sooty from car exhaust .
She tucked her hair repeatedly under her head scarf .
The girl grew up in Pakistan , where her family fled during a bloody civil war in Afghanistan in the early 1990s .
She cleaned cars for money .
Five years ago , her family and a flood of other refugees returned to Afghanistan after the U.S. - led invasion toppled the Taliban regime .
But her father could earn only $ 40 a month doing various odd jobs .
So she sold chewing gum and newspapers and cleaned car windows in the muddy , potholed streets of Kabul .
She made about $ 3 a day .
That was where she met Uncle Lang , a nickname that literally means Uncle Legless .
Uncle Lang was a land mine victim .
When the girl and a friend brought him tea and food , he forced himself upon them , police say .
" I did n't know anything about sex , " she says .
" But it happened . "
It 's hard to know how many other women in Afghanistan are prostitutes because of the extreme secrecy around the issue .
A University of Manitoba report last September estimated about 900 female sex workers in Kabul .
A 2005 report by the German aid group Ora International drew data from 122 female sex workers , of whom less than 1 % knew about AIDS .
The youngest was 14 .
Prostitutes in Afghanistan include scores of Chinese women serving Western customers who work for security firms , companies and aid groups in Afghanistan .
Many of the women say they were tricked into the trade by middlemen who promised them respectable jobs , but Gen. Ali Shah Paktiawal , head of Kabul 's criminal investigations , denies this , saying : " They come here of their own will . "
The shame of prostitution in Afghanistan is intense .
" In our culture , it is very , very bad , " said Soraya Sobhrang , the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commissioner for women 's affairs .
Under the Afghan penal code , prostitution is often considered adultery , which is punishable by five to 15 years in prison .
Under Islamic law , married prostitutes can be stoned to death .
Some prostitutes are forced into the sex trade by their families .
The Ora report said 39 % of the sex workers interviewed found clients through their relatives — including 17 % through their mothers and 15 % through their husbands .
For many girls , there is little recourse .
" They think that if they tell us the truth , we will return them to their families , and their families will kill them , or that we will send them to an institution and they will be put in prison , " says Jamila Ghairat of the aid organization Women for Afghan Women .
" The girls are afraid of their families , the government and everyone . "
In some cases , it is families that pimp out the girls .
At one family - run brothel , the oldest girl was a 15 - year - old , orphaned when her parents died in rocket attacks in Kabul .
A relative had married her off to a 9 - year - old boy whose father was a pimp .
She ran away three times , but each time her father - in - law bribed police to bring her back .
She finally escaped to the human rights commission .
Makeshift brothels exist all over Kabul , but they are always moving , says Esmatullah Nekzad , a policeman formerly with the force 's Department of Moral Crimes .
The clients are mostly Afghan men .
" Most Afghan men have this hobby — young men from about 16 to 30 years of age , " says Nekzad .
" You go , you take their phone number , then you tell your friends .
It 's all by telephone . "
The girls stay in one place for anything from five days to three months , until neighbors learn of their business .
That 's what happened with the girl Uncle Lang raped .
In November , he trafficked her and several others to the northern city of Mazar - i - Sharif to beg and sell sex .
Within days the neighbors became suspicious and tipped off police .
Police raided the place and arrested the prostitutes .
Uncle Lang fled .
For a few weeks , the girl went daily to a women 's aid organization .
She arrived in the morning , worked in the kitchen and had an hour of counseling every day .
She left at 4 p.m .
Her hands became clean and soft .
She was happier .
She started praying to ask Allah forgiveness for her sins .
At first she said her family did not know she was selling sex , and her mother would kill her .
But during the counseling sessions , she let it slip that her parents encouraged her to work with Uncle Lang .
When she stopped seeing him , they sent her 10 - year - old brother instead .
One day , an aid worker spotted her with Uncle Lang on a popular street lined with kebab and ice cream shops .
The aid worker confronted her .
A day later , the girl stopped going to the organization .
She has not been seen or heard from since .

A major evolutionary innovation has unfurled right in front of researchers ’ eyes .
It ’s the first time evolution has been caught in the act of making such a rare and complex new trait .
And because the species in question is a bacterium , scientists have been able to replay history to show how this evolutionary novelty grew from the accumulation of unpredictable , chance events .
Twenty years ago , evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski of Michigan State University in East Lansing , US , took a single Escherichia coli bacterium and used its descendants to found 12 laboratory populations .
The 12 have been growing ever since , gradually accumulating mutations and evolving for more than 44,000 generations , while Lenski watches what happens .

Profound change
Mostly , the patterns Lenski saw were similar in each separate population .
All 12 evolved larger cells , for example , as well as faster growth rates on the glucose they were fed , and lower peak population densities .
But sometime around the 31,500th generation , something dramatic happened in just one of the populations – the bacteria suddenly acquired the ability to metabolise citrate , a second nutrient in their culture medium that E. coli normally cannot use .
Indeed , the inability to use citrate is one of the traits by which bacteriologists distinguish E. coli from other species .
The citrate - using mutants increased in population size and diversity .
“ It ’s the most profound change we have seen during the experiment .
This was clearly something quite different for them , and it ’s outside what was normally considered the bounds of E. coli as a species , which makes it especially interesting , ” says Lenski .
Rare mutation ?
By this time , Lenski calculated , enough bacterial cells had lived and died that all simple mutations must already have occurred several times over .
That meant the “ citrate - plus ” trait must have been something special – either it was a single mutation of an unusually improbable sort , a rare chromosome inversion , say , or else gaining the ability to use citrate required the accumulation of several mutations in sequence .
To find out which , Lenski turned to his freezer , where he had saved samples of each population every 500 generations .
These allowed him to replay history from any starting point he chose , by reviving the bacteria and letting evolution “ replay ” again .
Would the same population evolve Cit+ again , he wondered , or would any of the 12 be equally likely to hit the jackpot ?
Evidence of evolution
The replays showed that even when he looked at trillions of cells , only the original population re-evolved Cit+ – and only when he started the replay from generation 20,000 or greater .
Something , he concluded , must have happened around generation 20,000 that laid the groundwork for Cit+ to later evolve .
Lenski and his colleagues are now working to identify just what that earlier change was , and how it made the Cit+ mutation possible more than 10,000 generations later .
In the meantime , the experiment stands as proof that evolution does not always lead to the best possible outcome .
Instead , a chance event can sometimes open evolutionary doors for one population that remain forever closed to other populations with different histories .
Lenski ’s experiment is also yet another poke in the eye for anti-evolutionists , notes Jerry Coyne , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago .
“ The thing I like most is it says you can get these complex traits evolving by a combination of unlikely events , ” he says .
“ That ’s just what creationists say ca n’t happen . ”

ASPEN , Colo . - " There 's an African proverb that says , ' If you want to go quick , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . '
We have to go far quickly , " former Vice President Al Gore told a packed , rapt house at the Benedict Music Tent Wednesday .
With many scientists pointing to a window of less than 10 years to moderate the effects of global warming , he said , meaningful change is still possible , but " It is a race . "
The size of the climate problem ?
Worldwide atmospheric carbon has jumped from 280 to 383 parts per million in the last century ; the polar icecaps are melting three times faster than anyone 's direst prediction ; China is on the verge of surpassing the United States for greenhouse gas emissions ; bark beetles and wildfires are sweeping across Western forests ; temperatures are climbing , sea levels rising , glaciers vanishing .
By some estimates , humans must pull 30 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere to have a shot at reversing such effects .
" What we 're facing worldwide really is a planetary emergency , " Gore said .
" I 'm optimistic , but we 're losing this battle badly . "
Gore , interviewed by business luminary John Doerr , spoke at the Aspen Institute 's Greentech Innovation Network summit -- a gathering of world innovators hoping to boost the development of green technologies .
It 's going to take a 90 - percent decrease in carbon emissions from developed fossil fuel guzzlers like the U.S. and a 50 - percent decrease worldwide to get a handle on the problem , Gore said -- changes that will take major leaps of political will far beyond what current politicians see as feasible .
That reduction , which would be mandated by a world - wide treaty , could happen through carbon taxes , cap and trade , technological innovations , and energy conservation and efficiency , he continued , as long as it is accompanied by a major grassroots public shift to sustain it at the level necessary .
Gore advised the audience to compare the blue orb of the Earth to Venus , where daytime temperatures reach 867 degrees Fahrenheit and it rains sulphuric acid .
The two planets have the same amount of carbon , Gore explained , but Venus ' just happens to be in the atmosphere , while most of the Earth 's is still locked underground .
" The habitability of this planet for human beings really is at risk , " he said .

So is there room for optimism faced with the specter of Venus ?
Gore thinks so , but it's not in the current parade of presidential candidates or the slew of climate - related bills moving through the U.S. legislature -- measures Gore called " baby steps . "
" It 's going to depend on what 's in the hearts and minds of the people , " he said , and that 's part of the motivation for Gore 's recent Live Earth event -- a 24 - hour , seven - continent concert series that featured more than 100 musicians hoping to raise awareness of the solutions to global warming .
Live Earth reached countless concertgoers , he said , as well as more than 8 million people by Web streaming .
Add to that the fact that Gore has spent 30 years trying to bring the world around to the effects of global climate change , and the last several touring with his slideshow ( now the Oscar - winning documentary , " An Inconvenient Truth " ) , writing books , and teaching 1,400 people worldwide how to deliver the global warming message in several different languages .
Next week it will be China , then India .
" It 's a different kind of campaign , " he noted , one that surpasses what he might be able to accomplish in a bid for the presidency in 2008 .
" Dealing with this climate crisis is not only what we have to do , it 's our chance to get our act together , " he said , pointing to the escalating loss of tropical forests , the crisis in Darfur , the destruction of global fisheries .
The problem is so big , any solution must be comprehensive - and it should be a wakeup call .
" These are not political problems .
They are moral imperatives . "

The family on the sofa is divided , but not equally .
On one side a sullen , rather menacing father stares defiantly at the camera ; on the other , a waifish , stressed - looking mother is shielding anxious children .
The message of the advertisement is one we have heard or seen innumerable times in the media : domestic violence is only perpetrated by men , who are by nature disposed to controlling behaviours , while women and children ( an inseparable unit ) are always innocent victims .
I call it misandry , discrimination against men , but although the Ontario Human Rights Code bars “ discrimination via signs or symbols , ” I doubt that any charges of discrimination will be laid against the Canadian Women ’s Foundation , which has been carpet - bombing the media with this ad .
Its appearance in newspapers , bank statements and on the sides of buses is aimed at promoting awareness of domestic violence :
Generally speaking , men are portrayed as objects of scorn , objects of wrath or disparecidos — that is to say , they are often not treated at all .
The image represents a half - truth and therefore a lie .
The truth , established by all credible , peer - reviewed research , including our official number cruncher StatsCan , is that unprovoked intimate - partner violence is about equally split between men and women .
Imagine another picture based on a half - truth : a woman on one side of the sofa , a man protecting children or even his aged mother on the other — because women abuse the elderly and their children more frequently than men do .
You never will see such an ad .
Media bias against men is as notable for what you do n’t see and hear as for what you do .
( And speaking of what you do n’t see or hear , when was the last time you saw a public service ad around the alarmingly elevated statistics for male suicides ( up 81 per cent ) , especially those involved in acrimonious custody disputes ?
We ’re inundated with breast cancer ads ; when do we see ads about prostate cancer ?
And if 94 per cent of work - related deaths happened to women rather than to men , I think more of us would be familiar with that shocking statistic . )
Except for radio talk shows , where real people with no ideological axe to grind control the agenda , misandry is ubiquitous in the media – and by media I mean all kinds : advertisements , sitcoms , films , political ads , TV talk shows , social service agency websites and billboards , and of course the punditocracy .
But it flies beneath most people ’s radar , which is another way of saying that misandry is such an acceptable form of cultural bias – the last respectable form of cultural bias – that people are unaware of it when they hear it , read it , or see it .
White , heterosexual men
We live in an age in which the media are scrupulously rigorous in self - censoring when it comes to the terrible social crime of offending women , gays , people of colour and natives .
Only one identifiable group – white heterosexual men ( if they ’re Christian , so much the better ) – is considered fair game for overt collective prejudice .
Identifying active misandry is easy .
One has only to imagine the same words , image or falsehood or failure to report attached to any other identifiable group , and the imbalance becomes clear .
Here for example , is mainstream writer Nora Ephron , ironically a revered romantic comedy writer ( she scripted When Harry met Sally , and Sleepless in Seattle ) , in a recent post on the Huffington Post blog regarding the American political primaries :
“ This is an election about whether the people of Pennsylvania hate blacks more than they hate women .
And when I say people , I do n’t mean people , I mean white men … the outcome of the general election will depend on whether enough of them vote for McCain .
A lot of them will : white men cannot be relied on , as all of us know who have spent a lifetime dating them … ”
It goes on in this vein .
Her claim is absurd .
Blacks and blue - collar white women vote as bloc-ishly as white men , so why the anger at white men ?
It ’s unseemly , and yet it went completely unremarked .
Apply the same words to black men or women and watch the sparks fly .
Of course no mainstream writer would ever say these things of blacks or women .
They know better .
As a print journalist , my particular interest is my own peer group , many of whom echo Ephron ’s gratuitous contempt for men .
While most male writers take up journalism because they are news or political junkies , a good many women journalists have entered the field specifically as women with a feminist axe to grind .
That ’s not quite the same as spreading a conservative or liberal or libertarian message , where you attack a line of thinking , not actual people .
Urging feminism on readers and viewers is tantamount to spreading misandry , for feminism as it is ideologically conceived and played out in society today evokes zero - sum thinking and the conspiracy - theory temptation .
When women succeed , it is because they are superior ; when they fail , it is because they have been thwarted by men .
Male writers who try to defend men from anti-male bias or who criticize feminist ideology find it a very impolitic career move if they are not already well established .
I personally know two excellent male writers , probably Canada ’s most under - utilized researchers , who ca n’t get a media foothold because they critique feminism .
Male desaparecidos
Once you decide to take conscious notice of the problem , media bias in a myriad of forms leaps out at you .
Positive images of women are ubiquitous ; positive images of manly men are uncommon .
Generally speaking , men are portrayed as objects of scorn , objects of wrath or desaparecidos — that is to say , they are often not treated at all .
The cumulative message is that if men try hard to meet criteria established by women as lovers , husbands and fathers , they can hope to achieve status as contributors to women ’s and children ’s happiness , though on the whole they are unnecessary to it .
But all too often they are portrayed as active agents of women ’s and children ’s unhappiness .
Women who rid themselves of these bad eggs are portrayed as heroic .
Promiscuous women in TV sitcoms like Sex and the City present as warm , loyal and liberated .
The promiscuous men in these stories are depicted as shallow , untrustworthy and opportunistic .
When men are characterized as heroic fathers in films , it is usually because the woman has fled the scene or died , a paradigm that debuted with the 1979 film , Kramer vs Kramer .
Men are only allowed to present as good parents when they are desperately trying to fill the shoes of a mother .
It is a role they must learn .
In movies with couples , it is rare for the father ’s parenting skills to outshine the mother ’s , whose commitment and skills are presented as inherent .
The past few years have seen a spate of “ baby ” movies : Juno , Waitress , Knocked Up , Baby Mama , Then She Found Me .
All have in common career women challenged by fertility issues or inconvenient pregnancies they choose not to terminate .
In every case the elective mother may have foibles , but she is on the whole mature , smart and responsible .
The men are undesirable parent material , lumps of animated clay to be tossed away , or spun and shaped by a woman potter into a domestically useful artefact .
These potential or accidental fathers range from the merely wimpy , to infantile , to explicitly abusive .
None of the films express reservations about a child ’s future with no father .
Anger and violence
The most disturbing aspects of media misandry revolve around the issues of anger and violence .
Domestic violence is — apart from custody — the hottest of the hot button issues for demonisers and myth busters alike .
The message that male anger is a problem , while female anger is n’t , ends in overt publicity campaigns like the divided - family ad I mentioned at the outset .
But it begins in a common stereotype , pervasive in the media , of female anger as cute , inconsequential and victimless .
For example , a current TV ad promoting a stop - smoking aid features a flight attendant in the throes of nicotine withdrawal .
A series of vignettes shows her screaming at male passengers for no reason , snarling and sobbing over the public address system and in general acting hysterically and irrationally .
The choice of setting — an airplane — is no accident .
On airplanes and in airports in general , " civilians " are at the mercy of officials and airline personnel , who wield absolute power over passengers .
There is no recourse for unfair treatment .
The male passengers subjected to her tirades shrink away in bewildered acquiescence .
Their “ wussy ” reaction is played for humour , but in fact their fear of her is rational .
There is nothing funny about being arbitrarily thrown off an airplane .
But far from critiquing this woman 's egregious misuse of her power , the ad makes light of it .
In the end , once the nicotine remedy begins to work , she is sheepishly laughing at herself .
One cannot possibly imagine an ad in which a male flight attendant harangues and menaces a female passenger .
Indeed , that would be considered a form of sexual assault under today 's feminist - inspired governmental guidelines .
The message here is that when women humiliate and threaten men as a side effect of personal " issues " , men can just suck it up , since their right to respectful treatment is always subject to women 's discretion and situational needs .
Casually misandric ads like this can be found at one end of the spectrum .
The other end is more socially and culturally consequential .
With the media ’s facilitation , an entire industry has been built on the Montreal Massacre , a tragedy – unlike male gendercides , which frequently occur in war – that has no historical precedent or sequel .
The weeks before every December 6th anniversary produce a media orgy around domestic violence against women , with Marc Lepine , who was a solitary sociopath , touted as a mere exaggeration of typical male drives .
Conversely the media treatment of Remembrance Day , the one day a year feminists tacitly lay off men , no longer celebrates the specifically manly trait of physical courage .
If you ’ll notice , Remembrance Day now is played out in gender - neutral programming , with combat / non - combat lines blurred to equalize the contributions of men and women .
Gays excused
While the plight of abused heterosexual men is ignored in the media , whatever afflicts gay men is instantly picked up on .
When StatsCan released figures last month indicating intimate - partner violence was disproportionately high amongst gay and lesbian couples , the Globe and Mail immediately commissioned a feature article – “ A Skeleton that ’s Still in the Closet ” .
The violence scenarios described in the selected gay - couple examples are exactly the same as those in straight couples , reinforcing objective research which finds that partner violence is gender - neutral , a function of individual pathology .
Yet , unlike hetero male violence , for which no explanation other than an inherent urge to control women is ever offered , this article falls over itself finding reasons to excuse violent behaviour by gays .
In their treatment of men , a lazy perpetuation of falsehoods , an incurious acceptance of bogus studies and statistics , and an eager willingness to recycle superannuated stereotypes constitute the present media template .
I began with mention of the Ontario Human Rights Code .
I will end with it as the central motif of a seemingly trivial but memorable example of misandry that was brought to my attention by an extremely vigilant reader .
Ninety - nine per cent of funded social services in Canada , even those advertising “ family services ” , provide counseling and other forms of help only to women victims of domestic violence .
Here is how the Crouch Neighbourhood Resource Centre in London , Ontario provided itself with the moral high ground for refusing funded psychiatric help to men in crisis :
From their website last Fall :
We at Crouch want to ensure that all our programming [ is ] accessible to all .
The Ontario Human Rights
Code states in section i : Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services , goods and facilities without discrimination because of race , age , ancestry , place of origin , colour , ethnic origin , citizenship , creed , sexual orientation , age , record of offences , marital status , same - sex partnership , family status or disability .
Sounds official , eh ?
But in the actual Ontario Human Rights Code , between the words creed and sexual orientation is the word sex .
Its omission was no accident .
To accommodate an ideological bias , this website deliberately falsified the Ontario Human Rights Code .
The excision of those three letters was , for me , in its Orwellian implications , the most chilling of all examples of media misandry .

A new generation of environmentally friendly ' hybrid airships ' could be just about to take off
Germany is producing zeppelins again .
More than 70 years after the infamous Hindenburg disaster , its latest airship was gently guided out of the hangar doors last month to make its maiden test flight .
The Zeppelin NT , built from endowment money left behind by German airship pioneer Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin , will make further test flights around Friedrichshafen over the coming months , before flying to London - where a former contestant from The Apprentice , Rory Laing , plans to offer tourist joyrides over the capital for £ 150 a throw .
What is it about airships that continues to capture the imagination ?
By rights , the lumbering airborne relics of a century past should be no more than museum curiosities , consigned like gas lamps to the sentimental roll - call of redundant technology .
But like sacked television contestants , it 's hard to keep an idea as audacious as the airship down .
With the cost of oil at record highs , and airline chiefs warning of the end of cheap flights , the idea of the airship is being seriously floated once more .
The appeal is of the airship is easy to grasp .
Environmentalists like George Monbiot cite their frugal use of fuel when compared to other forms of flight .
They are also quiet and fly at low altitude , at around 4,000 ft compared with 35,000 ft , further lessening their environmental impact .
Although they are relatively slow , typically travelling at 125 mph - as quick as a high - speed train , but still needing about 43 hours to cross the Atlantic - most need no runway and could be deployed without need for further airport expansion .
One British company , SkyCat , is even floating the idea that airships could take off from the reservoirs bordering Heathrow airport .
Airships appeal , moreover , to romantic travellers who see something glamorous in their more stately form of travel .
Once it 's flown around London for a while , the new Zeppelin will cross the Atlantic itself en route to San Francisco where it will conduct more tourist flights ( a sister ship is already operating in Japan ) .
In engineering terms , the Zeppelin NT represents a remarkable revival in the fortunes of the airship .
On the right vector
It 's more nimble than the old airships .
The NT uses " vectored thrust " , which is in principle the same ability to direct its thrust in much the same way as a Harrier jump jet .
This is important , because one thing holding the airship back is it vulnerability to wind , especially gusts .
Most traditional airships need a dozen people to tie it to a mast ; the NT , just three .
The renaissance has been a long time coming .
The development of the airship in the latter part of the 20th century saw the once stately transport reduced to the role of tethered balloon : a static camera platform and floating advertising hording like America 's Goodyear blimp .
But since the millennium , ideas for a new generation of airships have abounded .
Lockheed Martin , the world 's largest defence manufacturer , has been secretly testing the crewed hybrid P - 791 that marries the buoyancy of an airship with the aerodynamics of an aeroplane .
Deep in development in California is the Aeroscraft , another hybrid that touts itself as a sky yacht and looks a lot like Thunderbird 2 from the old TV show .
Then there is the Stratocruiser , a beautiful re-imagining of the zeppelin by Tino Schaedler , a London - based German set designer and thinker .
It 's a wonderful flight of fancy designed to incorporate a gourmet restaurant , swimming pool and nightclub with resident DJs .
" Over the last year or so we 've seen a real renaissance in the airship ventures , both in manned tourism - based airships and in surveillance , " explains Andreas Grünewald , a zeppelin enthusiast who blogs at Airshipworld .
" It 's something very present and growing , especially over the last year or so .
There 's a lot going on " .
The trouble though with the buzz of a zeppelin revival is a simple one : carrying capacity .
The Zeppelin NT has a passenger capacity of just 12 , plus two crew .
The Aeroscraft , more ambitious offering , could be adapted to manage anything up to 180 .
( A 747 carries about 460 people . )
Airships may be enjoying their most exciting phase since the 1930s .
But do n't sell your shares in the airlines just yet .
Though people think the 1937 Hindenburg disaster killed off airships , they never took off for mass transit .
The Hindenburg was from a fleet of just two , and fixed - wing passenger aircraft had already overtaken the zeppelin for passenger carriage .
" They were for a very limited number of wealthy passengers and mainly as an alternative to luxury passenger shipping services to a very few destinations , " says Douglas Botting , author of Dr Eckener 's Dream Machine , a biography of the zeppelin .
" If the Hindenburg disaster had not stopped the zeppelin service dead in its tracks , world war two would have done . "
The airship 's passenger days seemed behind it .
But around a decade ago , a British designer , Roger Monk , working inside the shed in Cardington where Britain 's own airship programme was conducted in the 1930s , began to revive the idea with his SkyCat .
The SkyCat was the first serious " hybrid airship " combining the aerodynamics of a fixed - wing aircraft with the lighter - than - air properties of a balloon .
The SkyCat also employs a " hover - skirt " which allows it to land not just without a runway , but without a mast to tie it to , giving it a drawing - board advantage over the zeppelin .
" In our case we do n't need any ground crew whatsoever , " says Michael Stewart of SkyCat .
" We can land our ship anywhere : on water or snow or marsh and even rubble . "
The latter point you keep hearing about airships ; that they could be used for disaster rescue .
An airship can fly over broken bridges and land without a runway , taking aid to precisely the point it is needed .
What 's new , SkyCat ?
The SkyCat is a beautifully conceived vehicle , but one that has so far failed to receive proper funding .
The team have built a 25 m - long model , dubbed the " Sky Kitten " , but that 's it .
The problem is money .
Airships are expensive and do n't carry many people .
SkyCat has been floating around for a decade and yet it has failed to raise the hundreds of millions needed to get it off the ground .
But even if hybrid airships can find commercial backers , they still face a steep climb .
The next thing holding airships back is the cost of the gas .
To fill the SkyCat with helium , for example , would cost between £ 1 m to £ 3 m .
However , the helium does n't need to be refilled each time the airship lands , and " you only lose about 1 % a year " , says Stewart .
But a further disadvantage is speed .
SkyCat will fly with a top speed of 100 mph , far less when flying into a prevailing wind .
London to Manchester would be far slower than the train .
Another problem is their vulnerability to wind .
Although , " as they increase in size they become less so " , says Grünewald .
" With increasing technology that problem will be reduced to the same level of vulnerability faced by aeroplane . "
The sight of zeppelins over London is sure to rekindle interest in the airship .
The rising price of oil may one day make them affordable .
For a short - haul journeys , they could easily compete with the likes of ferries and trains , but the return to long - haul remains something of a dream .
And yet who would have thought , a decade ago , that passenger airships would ever fly at all ?
John McCain , when I was born , you were nearly six years older than my mother .
Now , seven years into her retirement , you want a new job : the hardest job in the world .
Wow !
Obviously , my mother is n’t running for president , but her age gives me a context for considering yours .
And within that context , your age gives me pause .
Apparently , I ’m not alone .
In a Quinnipiac University poll of swing states ( Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania ) published last week , nearly a quarter of respondents said that your age made it less likely that they would vote for you .
It was n’t just the young who had an issue with it either .
More than 20 percent of those 55 and older agreed .
And , while one would expect a partisan divide , independents leaned more toward the Democratic point of view .
That should give you pause .
Fair or not , this is a serious hurdle for you .
So , why is it that you ca n’t seem to stop making light of it ?
That is a bad idea .
( Imagine Barack Obama making a string of self - depreciating black jokes .
See , bad idea . )
Let ’s review .
Famous robotics company iRobot - maker of the noted Roomba autonomous floor - cleaner and supplier of war - bots to the US military - has announced a radical new development contract .
The company is to create a " soft " robot able to wriggle its way through " openings smaller than its actual structural dimensions " .
It almost goes without saying that the $ 3.3 m in military blobotics funding comes from DARPA , the Pentagon boffin collective which is to the established military - technological paradigm what stun grenades are to tea-parties .
“ During military operations it can be important to gain covert access to denied or hostile space , ” said Dr Mitchell Zakin of DARPA , suggesting that the squashy machines are intended to penetrate physical security covertly .
“ We believe that a new class of soft , flexible , meso - scale mobile objects that can identify and maneuver through openings smaller than their dimensions to perform various tasks will be quite valuable " .
“ Consistently [ tackling ] challenges with robots has made us a trusted DARPA partner , ” said Helen Greiner , co-founder and chairman of iRobot , offering a shrewd hint as to the best way of becoming friends with the radical military brainboxes .
The new flexi-penetration bot programme has been dubbed ChemBots .
It was originally announced last year , as a modification to a wider enabling - techniques push , but nothing further was made public until now .
DARPA requires that the final $ 3.3 m prototype machine :
Travel a distance Traverse an arbitrary - shaped opening much smaller than the largest characteristic dimension of the ChemBot Reconstitute size , shape , and functionality after traversing the opening Travel a distance again Perform a function using the embedded payload
The Phase One version , which iRobot are now embarked upon , should be " approximately the size ( but not necessarily the form - factor ) of a regulation softball " which can move 5 metres in 20 minutes , pass through a 1 cm opening and reassume its original shape in 15 seconds .
Roughly speaking , then , we 're talking about a cricket - ball sized job which can get through a keyhole .
This might open up a few backdoors , in a security sense .
DARPA do n't care how this is done , but they do note that " nature provides many examples of ChemBot functionality ... mice , octopi , and insects readily traverse openings barely larger than their largest ' hard ' component " .
The paradigm - punishing boffins reckon that the squidgy mechanoids could make use of " gel - solid phase transitions " , " shape - memory " , " magneto- rheological materials " or - perhaps rather more credibly - " geometric transitions , eg , folding " .
That last might be the one to bet on , perhaps combined with miniature , deflatable balloon tyres .
One might also note that payload and function are agreeably non-specific , and that many explosives - just for instance - are available in liquid or gel form .
It would probably be within the rules of the game for the robot to simply blow up or release a gas in order to " perform a function " .
But iRobot is an imaginative company , and makes lovely robots .
( Even if the machines are n't all that good at cleaning floors . )
It can probably come up with something a bit more cunning . ®
In the roughly 36 hours since the Canadian DMCA was introduced , the outrage from thousands of Canadians has been nothing short of remarkable .
The CBC has picked up on the story , reporting on the surge in online protests that include approximately 10,000 new members of the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook group ( nearly 50,000 members as of this writing ) , over 4,000 letters and emails sent through Copyright for Canadians , hundreds of comments on articles in the mainstream press ( and this blog ) , and a huge number of individual blog posts .
My sense is that the government still does n't quite get it .
The usual suspects generated the expected supportive press releases , yet simmering online are thousands of Canadians who are angry and who vote .
There remains much work to be done – there will be opportunities for people in Calgary to meet Industry Minister Jim Prentice at his Calgary Stampede breakfast on July 5th , for residents of Guelph to make their voice heard in the fall by - election , and for Canadians across the country to participate in offline protests this fall .
In the meantime ( once again ) :
Write to your MP , the Industry Minister , the Canadian Heritage Minister , and the Prime Minister .
If you send an email , be sure to print it out and drop a copy in the mail ( no stamp is needed – c / o House of Commons , Ottawa , ON , K1A0A6 ) .
If you are looking for a sample letter , visit Copyright for Canadians .
Take 30 minutes from your summer , to meet directly with your MP .
From late June through much of the summer , your MP will be back in your local community attending local events and making themselves available to meet with constituents .
Give them a call and ask for a meeting .
Every MP in the country should return to Ottawa in the fall having heard from their constituents on this issue .
If you are not a member of the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook group , join .
If you are , consider joining or starting a local chapter and be sure to educate your friends and colleagues about the issue and starting working through the list of 30 things you can do .
I ’ve not been to an arcade myself for ages , nor have I really had the time ( or quite frankly , the inclination ) to play any games recently .
To see what the Japanese are doing , MyVoice took their second look at game usage , although I ’m not sure when the first look took place !
Demographics
Over the first five days of May 2008 14,373 members of the MyVoice internet community successfully completed a private on - line questionnaire .
54 % of the sample were female , 2 % in their teens , 15 % in their twenties , 37 % in their thirties , 29 % in their forties , and 17 % in their fifties .
The last two times we were in arcades ( or game centres , as they are known in Japan ) , we spent all our cash on the UFO Catchers with nothing to show .
That falls under the category of “ prize games ” in Q6 , and before I next go I ’ll be sure to study this video on how to win at them !

More than 30 % of trips made in cars in Europe cover distances of less than 3 km and 50 % less than 5 km .

As noted by the World Health Organisation [ 1 Mb pdf ] , The short journeys use up a disproportionate amount of fuel , so even if your six a week 5 km trips to the shops are just 6 x 5 km = 30 km of your weekly 200 km of driving , they 'll make up more than 30 km / 200 km = 15 % of your fuel use .
This is because engines reach their peak efficiency after fifteen minutes or more of driving , and short journeys involve more stopping - your engine burning fuel for you to stay still is as inefficient as you can get .
Eliminating these short trips in your car can save you a lot of fuel , as well as improve your health .
A little while ago a friend was explaining to me how he drove 1.5 km to the train station every day .
" If I walk , I get sweaty , I can't be sweaty in the office . " " Take off your tie !
Put it on at work .
And anyway , if you get sweaty with a 15 minute walk , then youto walk more . "
" No , I 'm okay .
I just need to get something more fuel - efficient , perhaps a motorbike .
"
The next week he told he'd been to the doctor .
" He says I need to lose weight and walk more .
" This , I think , a fairly common thing .
Your arse widens to fit into the seat you sit in all day .
But as well as short trips , at least two - thirds of trips are discretionary .
You can do without them .
The following is the data of purpose of journey by car from 1992 , the most recent year available for such data for Australia as a whole .
[ source , ABS
We have here figures for the percentage of all trips taken for that purpose .
The average time spent driving each day is 1hr27 ' .
The average time per trip does n't add up to this 87 ' because not every trip is done every day ; but when the trip is taken , that 's the average time of it .
Only about a third of trips ( work , child care , and possibly education ) are non-discretionary and more or less unavoidable , assuming zero public transport and not able to bike , walk , etc .
The rest can be set aside ( " passive leisure " , driving just for fun ) or rearranged for efficiency - shopping from distant shops can be done weekly all in one go , etc .
Next toyou use the car it 's irrelevant whether you keep an extra spare tyre in the back , hit the accelerator hard or not , and so on .
It just does n't matter .
The most effective way to save fuel is not to drive .
I suggest a couple of experiments .
Keep a logbook in your car , and over a month note each trip , start time , end time , odometer at start and finish , and the purpose of each trip - like in the table above .
After that month sit down and look over your logbook .
Figure out how many of your trips were - driving 1 km to the shops , going for a Sunday drive , etc - and how many - you went to the shops for the fourth time this week , you could have taken the bus but got up late so had to drive to get there on time , that sort of thing .
Now divide those trips into your monthly fuel bill .
So you get a figure for how much you 're spending on trips you did n't have to take .
This expense is only going to get greater .
Peak fossil fuels is simply that over time demand for fossil fuels goes up while their supply goes down , so naturally the price leaps up .
And any rational response to climate change means that the price of polluting will go up .
So you could n't be bothered walking to the shops , it was late and you had a long day .
That trip may look fine at $ 1.50 / litre fuel , but how about at $ 3/lt ?
$ 10 / lt ?
That 's $ 40 a gallon , by the way .
If you say that it 's still worth it , then next time you go to the pump , set aside that extra money you 're willing to spend .
Do that a few times , and see if you can really do without that extra cash and not spend it on something else .
If so , I suggest the Red Cross .
If not - well then it 's time to stop those unnecessary trips .
Now the second experiment .
For just one week do n't use your car .
Just imagine that it 's broken and in the workshop .
What do you do ?
Give up on life , quit your job , stay at home ?
Nope - you .
After the week , imagine that you 've just learned to fix it will cost more than you can afford at the moment - you wo n't have the money for another three weeks .
Now what ?
Well , another three weeks go by ... are you dead yet ?
Or did you find a way to cope ?
So , here 's my fuel - saving tips , my immodest proposal .
1 .
Get rid of your car .
2 .
Or at least , stop trips you could do some other way .
Radical ideas , I know .
Probably communist or Islamofascist or something .
But with peak fossil fuels and climate change , we 're facing a radically new world whatever we do .
We simply wo n't be able to keep on truckin' .
May as well get used to it .
I think it 's better to do by choice what is going to be forced on you one day anyway .
It 's better for me to do a light walk which is comfortable every day in my thirties than to not walk , have a heart attack at 58 , open heart surgery , and then do a light walk which is very painful .
It 's better to live on less money than I earn ( rather than spending it all or getting into debt ) because one day I may earn less , and then I 'll be used to it , or have savings to tide me over .
It 's better to grow a few pots of fruit and vegies now so that if food is really expensive later I can just grow more then , than it is to grow nothing now and have to learn it all very quickly later .
Sharon Astyk recently noted that two - thirds of Americans " die in debt , in pain and alone . "
We should be able to do better than this , and a lot of it depends on how we choose to live our lives .
I was once taught the Seven P's : proper preparation and planning prevents piss - poor performance .
We do n't all have to rush out and live on our own self - sufficient homesteads , or form lobby groups to hassle the government , or anything like that .
But as Edison said , we live like squatters , not as if we owned the property .
We have to stop that .
Get rid of your car , it 's an albatross around your neck .
I know , I know .
" I can't , I 'm the exception , lots of people can do it , but I can't , it 's impossible , I 'm helpless , poor me . "
I know , I know .
Just try the two experiments I suggested .
Many things seem impossible , then we try them and they turn out to be possible - not easy , but possible .

Relativity & Gravitation Group
The Relativity & Gravitation Group is part of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics , which in turn is part of the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Cambridge .
The group was founded by Dennis Sciama in 1961 , and is currently headed by Professor Paul Shellard .
It is internationally renowned for a number of important developments in Einstein 's classical theory of gravitation , including the no hair and area theorems for black holes and the theorems indicating that singularities would occur both in gravitational collapse and at the beginning of the expansion of the Universe .
In recent years the group 's main effort has been towards the inclusion of quantum effects , and the development of a theory of quantum gravity ; in particular , the semi-classical quantization of black holes ( leading , e.g , to the discovery of the thermal radiation produced by them ) and the formulation of the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity ( leading to the no boundary condition for the Universe ) .
Furthermore , the group has expertise in the areas of supergravity , string and membrane theories of gravity , cosmology , cosmic strings and other topological defects in cosmology , numerical relativity and Regge calculus .
In addition , the group houses and operates COSMOS , the UK national cosmology supercomputer .

The National Post reports that the Canadian DMCA , which may be introduced tomorrow , will include a " personal use download " fine of $ 500 .
The front page story indicates that the fine ( presumably a new form of statutory damage award ) could be awarded on a per infringement basis , leading the possibility of hundreds of thousands of dollars in liability for file sharing .
This provision has been rumoured for some time and may be designed to reduce the maximum possible awards , since the current statutory damages provision provides for damage awards of up to $ 20,000 per infringement .
Some sources say that it comes as a result of Prentice 's concern that the Conservatives could be tied to huge damage awards against teenagers for peer - to - peer file sharing .
If that is indeed the case , it is not clear how this provision will solve that concern .
While there are still many questions about this provision ( does it target downloading or uploading ?
does it exempt sound recordings covered by the private copying levy ?
is the $ 500 a set amount or a maximum ?
is it per infringement or cover all activity ?
does it require actual evidence that files made available are downloaded ? ) , consider a case involving 1000 song files , not an unusually high number .
The " retail " value of those files is roughly $ 1000 , yet on a per infringement basis the Prentice proposal could lead to a damage award of $ 500,000 .
Even small scale cases would lead to huge awards – 50 songs could lead to a $ 25,000 fine .
Ironically , the prospect of huge damage awards comes as Canadian musicians and songwriters have both rejected lawsuits against individuals .
If Prentice hopes that the provision reduces the concern associated with file sharing lawsuits , this move may actually have the opposite effect .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - European researchers said on Monday they discovered a batch of three “ super - Earths ” orbiting a nearby star , and two other solar systems with small planets as well .
An artist 's impression of the trio of super - Earths discovered by an European team using the HARPS spectrograph on ESO 's 3.6 - m telescope at La Silla , Chile , after five years of monitoring .
REUTERS / ESO / Handout
They said their findings , presented at a conference in France , suggest that Earth - like planets may be very common .
“ Does every single star harbor planets and , if yes , how many ? ” asked Michel Mayor of Switzerland ’s Geneva Observatory .
“ We may not yet know the answer but we are making huge progress towards it , ” Mayor said in a statement .
The trio of planets orbit a star slightly less massive than our Sun , 42 light - years away towards the southern Doradus and Pictor constellations .
A light - year is the distance light can travel in one year at a speed of 186,000 miles a second , or about 6 trillion miles .
The planets are bigger than Earth -- one is 4.2 times the mass , one is 6.7 times and the third is 9.4 times .
They orbit their star at extremely rapid speeds -- one whizzing around in just four days , compared with Earth ’s 365 days , one taking 10 days and the slowest taking 20 days .
Mayor and colleagues used the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher or HARPS , a telescope at La Silla observatory in Chile , to find the planets .
More than 270 so - called exoplanets have been found .
Most are giants , resembling Jupiter or Saturn .
Smaller planets closer to the size of Earth are far more difficult to spot .
None can be imaged directly at such distances but can be spotted indirectly using radio waves or , in the case of HARPS , spectrographic measurements .
As a planet orbits , it makes the star wobble very slightly and this can be measured .
“ With the advent of much more precise instruments such as the HARPS spectrograph ... we can now discover smaller planets , with masses between 2 and 10 times the Earth ’s mass , ” said Stephane Udry , who also worked on the study .
The team also said they found a planet 7.5 times the mass of Earth orbiting the star HD 181433 in 9.5 days .
This star also has a Jupiter - like planet that orbits every three years .
Another solar system has a planet 22 times the mass of Earth , orbiting every four days , and a Saturn - like planet with a 3 - year period .
“ Clearly these planets are only the tip of the iceberg , ” said Mayor .
“ The analysis of all the stars studied with HARPS shows that about one third of all solar - like stars have either super - Earth or Neptune - like planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days . ”
An MIT and Â Columbia University team has successfully tested a novel reactor that could chart a new path toward nuclear fusion , which could become a safe , reliable and nearly limitless source of energy .
Begun in 1998 , Â the Levitated Dipole Experiment , or LDX , uses a unique configuration where its main magnet is suspended , or levitated , by another magnet above .
The system began testing in 2004 in a " supported mode " of operation , where the magnet was held in place by a support structure , which causes significant losses to the plasma - - a hot , electrically charged gas where the fusion takes place .
LDX achieved fully levitated operation for the first time last November .
A second test run was performed on March 21 - 22 of this year , in which it had an improved measurement capability and included experiments that clarified and illuminated the earlier results .
These experiments demonstrate a substantial improvement in plasma confinement -- significant progress toward the goal of producing a fusion reaction -- and a journal article on the results is planned .
Fusion -- the process that provides the sun 's energy -- occurs when two types of atoms fuse , creating a different element ( typically helium ) and releasing energy .
The reactions can only occur at extremely high temperatures and pressures .
Because the material is too hot to be contained by any material , fusion reactors work by holding the electrically charged gas , called plasma , in place with strong magnetic fields that keep it from ever touching the walls of the device .
The LDX reactor reproduces the conditions necessary for fusion by imitating the kind of magnetic field that surrounds Earth and Jupiter .
A joint project by MIT and Columbia University , it consists of a supercooled , superconducting magnet about the size and shape of a large truck tire .
When the reactor is in operation , this half - ton magnet is levitated inside a huge vacuum chamber , using another powerful magnet above the chamber to hold it aloft .
The advantage of the levitating system is that it requires no internal supporting structure , which would interfere with the magnetic field lines surrounding the donut - shaped magnet , explains Jay Kesner of MIT 's Plasma Science and Fusion Center , joint director of LDX with Michael Mauel of Columbia .
That allows the plasma inside the reactor to flow along those magnetic field lines without bumping into any obstacles that would disrupt it ( and the fusion process ) .
To produce a sustained fusion reaction the right kinds of materials must be confined under enormous , pressure , temperature and density .
The " fuel " is typically a mix of deuterium and tritium ( known as a D - T cycle ) , which are two isotopes of hydrogen , the simplest atom .
A normal hydrogen atom contains just one proton and one electron , but deuterium adds one neutron , and tritium has two neutrons .
So far , numerous experimental reactors using different methods have managed to produce some fusion reactions , but none has yet achieved the elusive goal of " breakeven , " in which a reactor produces as much energy as it consumes .
To be a practical power source , of course , will require it to put out more than it consumes .
If that can be achieved , many people think it could provide an abundant source of energy with no carbon emissions .
The deuterium fuel can be obtained from seawater and there is a virtually limitless supply .
Most fusion experiments have been conducted inside donut - shaped ( toroidal ) chambers surrounded by magnets , a design that originated in the Soviet Union and is called by the Russian name Tokamak .
MIT also operates the most powerful Tokamak reactor in the United States , the Alcator C-mod , which is located in the same building as the new LDX reactor .
Tokamaks require a large number of magnets around the wall of the torus , and all of them must be working properly to keep the plasma confined and make fusion possible .
The new approach to fusion being tested in the LDX is the first to use the simplest kind of magnet , a dipole -- one that has just two magnetic poles , known as north and south , just like the magnetic fields of Earth and Jupiter .
Tokamaks and other fusion reactor designs use much more complex , multi-poled magnetic fields to confine the hot plasma .
Unlike the Tokamak design , in which the magnetic field must be narrowed to squeeze the hot plasma to greater density , in a dipole field the plasma naturally gets condensed , Kesner explains .
Vibrations actually increase the density , whereas in a Tokamak any turbulence tends to spread out the hot plasma .
The renowned physicist Richard Feynman once compared confining a plasma inside the magnetic field in a Tokamak to " trying to hold Jell - O with rubber bands , " says LDX chief experimentalist Darren Garnier of Columbia .
" It 's the difference between pulling and pushing . "
Whereas the Tokamak 's magnetic field tries to push the plasma in from the outside , " we have the field lines on the inside , pulling on the plasma , " which is inherently more stable , he says .
Another potential advantage of the LDX approach is that it could use a more advanced fuel cycle , known as D - D , with only deuterium .
Although it 's easier to get a self - sustaining reaction with D - T , tritium does n't exist naturally and must be manufactured , and the reaction produces energetic neutrons that damage the structure .
The D - D approach would avoid these problems .
The LDX magnet has coils made of superconducting niobium - tin alloy , which loses all electrical resistance when cooled below about 15 degrees Kelvin ; in the device , it is cooled to 4 degrees Kelvin - - 4 degrees above absolute zero , or minus 269 degrees Celsius , a temperature that can only be achieved by surrounding the coils with liquid helium .
This is the only superconducting magnet currently used in any U.S. fusion reactor .
When in full operation , the frigid magnet , contained in a double - walled vessel that is essentially a large thermos bottle , is surrounded by plasma heated to millions of degrees Celsius .
Garnier says that in full operation , the system is quite literally a snowball in hell .
Besides providing data that might someday lead to a practical fusion reactor , the experimental device could provide important lessons about how planetary magnetic fields work , which is still poorly understood .
So the experiment is of great interest to planetary physicists as well as to energy researchers .
Keeping the huge magnet levitated to just the right height requires a feedback system that constantly monitors its position , using eight laser beams , and then adjusts the power of the lifting magnet accordingly .
" That was tricky to develop , " Garnier says , and in early experiments " we did drop it a couple of times . "
Fortunately , they had designed the structure with a spring - mounted lifter under the magnet , used to lift it into its starting position , which could absorb the falling weight without damage .
The work is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy .

Peace at any cost is a prelude to war !
Ryan C. Comstock March 1 - 7 , 2000 Irish American Newspaper By Jim Smith BOSTON --
In a controversial measure designed to placate offended minority residents , officials of the Boston Housing Authority are asking residents to remove shamrock displays from doors and windows in housing developments across the city , the Irish Echo has learned .
Confirming rumors that have been circulating around South Boston in recent weeks , Lydia Agro , BHA 's communications director , told the Echo that housing managers are advising residents that shamrocks and other " bias indicators " are offensive to some minority residents and should not be publicly displayed .
" There are a number of symbols that have been identified by some of our residents as making them uncomfortable and unwelcome , " Agro said .
" In response to those concerns , we 're including shamrocks along with swastikas , Confederate flags and other symbols which may give offense . "
According to Agro , some tenants complained about shamrocks during recent mediation training sessions offered to BHA employees and residents .
The training , geared toward addressing issues of bias and harassment , was recently nominated for one of federal Department of Housing and Urban Development 's " Best Practices " awards .
" We 're aware that symbols such as shamrocks can reflect racial and ethnic pride , " Agro said .
" We respect that , but at the same time we want to promote a sense of community here .
There is no written policy .
We 're simply asking our residents to avoid public displays of any bias indicators .
The policy is being greeted with outrage and incredulity by many residents in the South Boston housing developments and by some city officials .
Jean McDonald , a leader of the residents task force in the Mary Ellen McCormack Development , which was named decades ago for the mother of former House Speaker John McCormack , said that elderly tenants are especially anxious about the policy , which sends them the message , she said , that their traditions are no longer acceptable .
" Some of the women here already feel like they 're living in a prison colony , " she said .
" Some of them have been here for more than 20 years .
You 'd think they'd be entitled to some respect .
Instead , they 're actually living in fear , not knowing what to expect next . "
James Kelly , president of the Boston City Council , told the Echo that the percentage of whites and Irish Americans in the city 's public housing has been dropping sharply in recent years .
" There 's only a small number of Irish Americans left , mostly elderly on fixed income , " he said .
" Having them take down their shamrocks is a hateful way of letting them know their time has passed .
Believe me , the ' no Irish need apply ' mentality is very much alive and well at the BHA . "
According to Kelly , minority residents now constitute the majority of every family development in the city , and the BHA is administered almost exclusively by blacks and Hispanics .
An attempt at harmony Although the anti-shamrock policy was purportedly designed to foster harmony and camaraderie among a diverse population of residents , it is having the opposite effect .
" You 'll probably be seeing even more shamrocks around here now , and I hope we do n't have any violence over this , " McDonald said , vowing to put a wooden shamrock outside her dwelling in the coming days in defiance of the BHA .
Many residents are especially miffed that the BHA is putting shamrocks and swastikas in the same category of offensive symbols .
The shamrock , a trifoliate plant said to have been picked by St. Patrick as a symbol to illustrate the doctrine of the Trinity , is regarded as the national emblem of Ireland , while the swastika is the anti-Semitic emblem of Nazi Germany .
Jeannie Flaherty of the McCormack development said that she 'll be putting a shamrock on her door any day now .
" I 'd like to see someone try to get me to take it down , " she said .
" There 's a Chinese man who lives across the hall with some kind of Oriental sign on his door .
Maybe they should check that out when they come around to talk to me . "
McDonald said that the policy is reminiscent of the forced busing controversy that has plagued Boston since the mid-1970s .
" They brought the minorities into the schools here and told the people in Southie to send their kids to school across the city , " she said .
" When the people rebelled , the press jumped all over them and called them racists .
Now we 're supposed to give up our symbols and traditions because somebody 's offended .
Give me a break ! "
Writing recently in the South Boston Tribune about the controversy , John Ciccone , director of the South Boston Information Center , said : " If new people move into a neighborhood , especially one as established and close - knit as South Boston , it is they , the newcomers , who must adapt .
Long - time residents here will not change and give up their traditions such as the shamrock and others because it might somehow make a new arrival uncomfortable .
And that 's just the way it 's going to be .
Get used to it . "
At the Old Colony development in South Boston , a former city youth worker told the Echo that the BHA is concerned primarily with minority statistics and less with the lives of the residents who live in the developments .
Speaking on the condition of anonymity , he said that shamrocks , which still adorn basketball courts and murals in the development , were symbols of pride when he was growing up there .
" Even the Italian kids wore shamrocks , " he said .
" We had our differences , but we got along OK . "
" Nowadays , the kids in here would rather shoot heroin than basketballs .
This place has been going downhill for years , and kids are literally dying from drugs .
It 's supposed to be for low - income people , but they got drug dealers from Roxbury driving fancy cars and living here .
Nobody cares .
It 's a real sad situation , and the BHA 's talking about shamrocks ? "

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian scientists say they have obtained the most detailed pictures so far of the insides of a prehistoric animal , with the help of a baby mammoth called Lyuba found immaculately preserved in the Russian Arctic .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The mammoth is named after the wife of the hunter who found her last year .
The body was shipped back to Russia in February from Japan , where it was studied using computer tomography in a process similar to one doctors use to scan patients .
“ We could see for the first time how internal organs are located inside a mammoth .
It is pretty important from a scientific point of view , ” said Alexei Tikhonov , deputy director of the Russian Academy of Science ’s Zoological Institute , who has been leading the project .
“ Her internal organs were well preserved -- the heart was seen distinctly with all its ventricles and atria , as well as the liver and its veins , ” Tikhonov told Reuters .
“ This is the best preserved specimen not only of the mammoth but of any prehistoric animal . ”
The mammoth species has been extinct since the Ice Age .
Tests on Lyuba showed she was fed on milk and was three to four months old when she died 37,000 years ago in what is now the Yamalo - Nenetsk region in Russia ’s Arctic .
Scientists were excited by the find because , although her shaggy coat was gone , her skin was intact , protecting her internal organs from contamination by modern - day microbes .
Tikhonov said the computer tomography , which provided a sharp three - dimensional image of Lyuba ’s insides , revealed no injuries or fractures .
The scans showed her airways and digestive system were clogged with what scientists believe was silt , leading them to conclude that she must have drowned .
GENETIC MAP
Tikhonov , who heads the Zoological Museum in Russia ’s second city of St Petersburg , said Lyuba ’s contribution to science could be far bigger than thought up to now .
“ If we take samples of Lyuba ’s tissues by biopsy , without unfreezing her , there is a big chance we can obtain promising results in genetics and microbiology , ” he said by telephone from St Petersburg .
“ I believe the genetic map ( of the mammoth ) will be decoded within a year or two .
As for ( Lyuba ’s ) practical use , we will have discovered methods of decoding the genetic map of any extinct prehistoric animals , ” he said .
“ There were species that died out during the human era .
And while I do not think someone would attempt to reproduce the mammoth , it would still make sense to bring back to life gigantic birds from Madagascar or New Zealand , or the Steller ’s sea cow ( an extinct mammal ) , and so on and so forth . ”
Lyuba ’s body is stored in a purpose - built container that maintains sub-zero temperatures to prevent the pre-historic tissue from decomposing .
She will soon be flown to Salekhard , capital of the Yamalo - Netnetsk region .
“ She will be exhibited in Salekhard starting this summer , ” Tikhonov said .
“ A special glass - case with constant sub - zero temperatures has already been prepared for her . ”
As promised , original fiction returns to Futurismic – and how !

Uxo , Bomb Dog
by Eliot Fintushel
My bomb dog Uxo , my sweetie , my pal , he sweated and huffed , tongue unscrolled , forelegs folded .
His fur was matted and dripping .
I held Mumps back with both my arms around her shoulders .
The kid had lobbed stones at old Ux and tied soup cans to his tail , but now she ’d jump mines to pet him .
“ Stay put , little one .
Uxo ’s pacing himself , is all . ”
“ You can beat that pile of tin , Uxy . ” Mumps ’s chin was tear wet .
Her voice choked and tumbled over the words .
“ Damn Volkovoy !
Damn him !
Cheater ! ”
We stood on a hill overlooking the meadow .
A bunch of other kids ambled behind us , rags and bones , scruffy faces , some little ones on the shoulders of the bigger .
Bit by bit , as Uxo and the damn machine cleared the meadow , we ’d advance to the new safe zone for a better look .
It was a comical sight , if not for the stakes : Volkovoy , dull gray heap , like a breaching whale , trundled and pivoted , roared and smoked , extruding claws and spades and hammers .
It plowed up the sod .
Now and then , if it could n’t defuse a dinger , Volkovoy flashed and shook , encasing and detonating the thing , then dropping it out the back , busted metal dung .
Meanwhile , Uxo , sweetie , his tail curled back like the tongue of a letter “ Q , ” walked and sniffed and walked .
His smart flat face was matted and dirty , but when he yipped and looked back at me and the kids – “ A bomb here , boss ! ” he seemed to say .
“ Look how good I am ! ” – his eyes were full of light .
Then I ’d tiptoe out to fetch the dinger and disable it .
He knew not to lick me then .
The bombs in Sheep ’s Meadow were easy and few .
That ’s the great thing about your Neo -Luddites : their effectiveness as terrorists is limited by their disdain for the machine .
( We share that . )
Of course , it only takes one mine – or the rumor of one – to put forty acres off limits .
They ’d done a neat job of quarantining Central Park , you ’ll have to grant , with a little TNT and a lot of tongue wag .
My hip ached like hell over the plastic leg , and it was a job and a half keeping those kids back .
The girls were the worst , because they knew I hesitate to swat them .
Queenie and her half - sisters , Mumps and One Finger , might have lost some toes , dangling them down at the rim of the clean zone – such as they had to lose .
I ’d yell , and they ’d smile back and root old Uxo on .
Mumps , of course , you ’d have had to know her to know she was smiling : love peck from a Jack - in - the - box smithereened half her chin .
Sweet kid , what , nine or ten ?
She watches for wires underfoot since then , I ’ll guarantee .
And she idolizes Queenie – something sad in that , truth to tell : it ’s because Queenie is perfect , tall and blond , a wiry ten - year - old with brains to spare and nothing missing .
Spot pushed through them and leaned into me .
“ You should throw in the towel , ” he said .
“ General Checkers do n’t give a damn if your hound explode or drop down dung and gizzard pie .
Volkovoy ’s just about bagged it .
Think of the dog , Blackie , and do n’t be so goddam proud . ”
Spot had all his bodily parts , lucky bastard .
He was a de-mining vet from Frisco , from when they blew up the Golden Gate Bridge and ringed San Fran with black ball belly busters .
He ’d been a year at it when he got smart and kicked himself upstairs to be a Mine Safety Specialist .
That ’s what I am , but I came to it the other way : I got a leg blown to hell , and then MSS was all I was good for .
The government threw me and Spot together –two itinerant clowns with an easel lecture and a barrel of all day suckers .
“ Throw in the towel , huh ? ”
My bomb dog was dead tired and footsore .
Wretched to the bone , wretched to the fiber , he ran on love and will .
He panted , limped , sniffed dirt , panted , limped .
“ You go straight to hell , ” I told Spot .
“ Uxo ’ll take him . ”
#
Yes , they sent me Spot for a partner .
He came with orders from General Checker ’s staff .
I was n’t inclined , but I could n’t say no .
Pudgy fellow , a head taller than me , muffin of a man with a sweet baby face , strawberries and cream .
( Me , I ’m a scarecrow , all bone and ball bearings , face it , a rangy beast , was and will be , pop eyed , with the shoulders and neck of a vulture .
Throw in the gimp leg , a couple gone fingers , and a heart condition .
Guess
I ’ve the sort of visage only a mother could love , and she ’s dead . )
I had n’t had a friend since my Uxo wandered off at the Zimbabwe frontier .
That was when I lost the use of my left leg .
It was not from a landmine exactly , though the place was lousy with mines that the Rhodesian Army had laid there way back during the revolution .
Local bosses called us in .
Bad enough , said they , that no one in these regions can fetch wood or water without they risk their life , but with every accident , your tourism hits the skids .
And investment goes down – look at New York today .
Still , it was n’t a landmine hobbled me .
No , the landmine hobbled a lion , and the lion hobbled me .
Animals go crazy when a mine gets them , and it happens all the damn time .
Turns them into raging man-killers .
I woke up in a lean - to with one leg chewed to shit – and no Uxo .
What dog ? , they said .
You ’re lucky to be alive , they said .
No more room in the cemeteries , and we dare not make more – because of the mines .
I ’d been two years without Uxo when they sent me Spot .
A fellow gets lonely .
I made my peace .
Spot was a quick fellow , a thinker , and never without an angle .
The way he always worked his lips , worked and worked his lips , it put me in mind of a rock sucker at the Frisco aquarium before the dambuster leveled it .
I showed him the ropes .
Pretty straightforward : gather a crowd , get ’em laughing , then the pitch :
NO SPORT –
REPORT ! REPORT !
“ KARELESSNESS KAN KILL . ”
Spot was the White Face , me the Buffoon .
The White Face fellow is the one who kicks and barks , which suited old Spot to a tee .
“ Dammit all , Blacks , ” he said to me over knockwurst and cola the very first day we met , “ I was flush and pretty before I had to move here .
I had this trick used to make me a pile of dough .
Ever hear of the Russian Roulette ?
Me and some pigeon , we take turns spinning the cylinder on this here army issue revolver , see ?
The way I got it notched and oiled , it ’s like loves - me - loves - me - not on a daisy , has to do with evens & odds - I always knew how the thing ’d shake out .
There ’s a sucker dies every minute , do n’t they say ?
Last time , like always , the mark blew his head off on schedule , but here ’s the goddam kicker .
He ’d lied to me .
The bastard had lied to me .
I went through every pocket and lining and orifice , Blackie – picture it if you have the stomach – and they was n’t a silver nor sawbuck .
Blackie , boy , it puts a fellow in doubt of human decency , I swear it does .
Stiffed by a stiff .
I liked to slide through them border checks by means of a greased palm , did n’t I , but here I was flat busted .
It panicked me so , I dropped the business .
Lost my appetite for it .
Now I ’m down to this .
Pass the mustard ? ”
“ You made that up . ”
“ I did n’t . ”
“ You do n’t fool me .
You ’re a sweetheart , Spot , are n’t you ? ”
“ The mustard . ”
How had a grifter like Spot worked the perilous Frisco terrain ?
How had he held his own on those famous squads of “ half - shattered de-miners who daily offered up their other half , ” as the Chronicle put it ?
“ What ?
You kidding ? ” says
Spot when I put it to him .
“ Scammed the whole business , Blackie boy .
I never put in a day .
It was all done with fake ID ’s and Muff the supervisor ’s craps chits – I ’d bought them off a guy I know , and I knew I was buying me Muff . ”
I did n’t believe a word of it .
Damn me but there was something to Spot .
I liked him .
Me and Spot worked up a passable “ Dead and Alive ” routine .
We knock shoulders and he falls down dead – looks like .
But when I try to drag off the corpse , an arm pops up .
I push it down and try to drag him off again , but then , say , his head curls up .
So I push it down with my heel .
I lift his legs to drag again , but the other arm rises .
Then a leg , maybe .
Or he hinges up , legs and arms both , like a sprung bear trap , and I ’m nearly squished pushing those appendages back down .
It goes faster and faster , me frantic to get rid of the corpse .
You get the picture .
Meantime he ’s winking to the audience , and they ’re howling .
I ’m the stupid one .
One time Sonny says to me , “ The bit you and Spot do , ‘ Dead and Alive , ’ you should n’t call it that . ”
“ Why the hell not ? ”
“ You ’re one or the other , are n’t you ?
Ca n’t be both . ”
“ Sure .
That ’s the point .
It ’s a joke , Sonny . ”
“ It ’s not funny .
Take bugs . ”
“ Bugs ? ”
“ Bugs that make you sick and kill you . ”
“ What about them ? ”
“ Are they dead or alive ? ” This was the point of it .
This was what he was trying to sneak by me .
“ Alive , ” I says .
“ Those bugs are living things , Sonny .
Bacteria , you call them . ”
“ Alive . ” He thinks about it a minute .
He squeezes dirt in the webs of his toes .
He puckers and un puckers his lips .
“ Alive , huh ?
Damn .
There ’s no beating a live thing , is there , a wily live thing ?
Hell , I ’d rather fight a dinger , a damn dead dinger , than a live thing like that . ”
“ Why did you need to squirrel that out of me , Sonny ?
What ’s your interest in bacteria ? ”
“ Who ’s interested in bacteria ? ” says he .
And he runs off .
BETTER SAFE THAN
S C A R R Y !
“ KARELESSNESS KAN KILL . ”
Far as I know , Spot had no wife and no woman and no friends but me and his General Checkers .
He was not too keen on animals .
All he cared about was his general .
It was Checkers this and Checkers that , “ me and the general , ” “ the general and me . ”
“ ‘ Cause , Blackie , me and the General , I swear to Nader ” – thrusting up his right hand with two fingers curled together – “ we ’re like this . ”
He ’d find me moping sometimes , polishing my prosthesis or staring at the blue yonder .
“ What you studying , Blackie boy ? ” says he .
And I ’d tell him , “ It ’s my bomb dog , Uxo .
I miss him , Spot. Honest to Nader , I do .
Never had a woman longer than a night , even before I was one leg short of a pair .
But my Uxo . . . ”
“ You ’re a loon , ” he ’d say .
“ If I had me a dog I ’d train her to carry bombs , not sniff ’em .
Big furry dog , see ?
Strap plastique twixt her tits and send her into the enemy camp .
Train ’em and sell ’em .
Hell , the accessories alone – special straps , special ordnance , all that – there ’s dough in it , Blackie boy . ”
I had to blink .
“ Who gave you an idea like that ? ”
“ It ’s in the air , Blackie . ” Surprising how mystical the fellow might wax .
“ Open up your eyes . ”
Now , of course , I understand what “ in the air ” meant : General Checkers .
Spot did n’t want to hear about bloody Kabul when Uxo sniffed the cluster bomb bits and I smithereened ’em with explosive foam .
( Wonderful stuff .
Spread it , ignite it , and blow the dingers harmless . )
Somalia ?
Maputo ?
He did n’t care worth spit .
He did n’t care about old Nick , either –Nicaragua , I mean , where my Uxo earned his big medal nearly at the cost of his hide .
Spot never cared to hear about any of it .
I feel it was a defect in his character .
“ Ah , Blackie , you poor sap .
As between a dog and a machine , when it comes to war , only a fool would go for the canine . ”
“ I ’ll take Uxo . ”
KEEP TO THE LANE !
“ You go straight to hell , ” is what I told Spot , when he said we should throw in the towel .
My kids yipped and swore at him , too .
Spot smiled .
He tried to pat Mumps ’s shoulder .
“ Hey , I ’m only thinking of old Uxo , you little cherry bombs , ” says he .
One Finger reached over and swatted his knuckles with the spent ammo belt she uses to bundle her swag .
Spot pulled back quick .
He sucked his fingers .
“ Crusty shame you ca n’t see reason .
Dog ’s the one that ’ll pay for it .
Damn it all , I could get General Checkers to requisition you a waterproof tent and a safe spot to put it on if you pulled the hound and made nice .
But no . . . ”
One Finger said , “ Your sweetie general so sure that heap of gears gonna win , why he send you here to buy us off ? ”
“ He did n’t send me , brat .
I come on my own , out of pity for you . ”
“ Aw , you do n’t pee without your general ’s say - so . ”
The call went up : “ He rises ! ”
Uxo was on his feet again .
Mumps was so happy , she jumped higher than the tripwire bomb that sculpted her chin and collar bones back in Jersey .
“ ‘ Ataboy , Uxy ! ”
She leapt and skipped to the lane Volkovoy had just cleared .
“ Hey , wait ! ” I jumped after .
Her white lace skirt , the dumpster find of a little lifetime , fluttered as she skipped .
Queenie snagged my elbow .
“ Leave her be , Blackie .
It ’s cleared , ai n’t it ? ”
If I ’d had the time , I would have told her , there ’s clear and there ’s clear .
“ Let me go . ”
If I ’d had the time , I would have told her that the army ’s idea ai n’t zero injury like yours or mine , it ’s “ acceptable losses . ”
“ Queenie , for Nader ’s sakes . . . ”
If a tank can go through it , I would have said , if I ’d had the time – “ Dammit , Queenie . ” – or if a platoon can cross and have enough left to bivouac on the other side , why , by the army , that ’s okay , and that ’s the standard Volkovoy toes to .
“ Let go ! ” I shook Queenie loose and bounded for Mumps . . .
There was a flash and a wave of heat .
I could n’t see anything for a minute , but I felt Mumpsy all over me , clinging and clawing , and when my hearing came back , I heard her wail .
I was on my back , I discovered shortly , and I had all my parts , and so had Mumps .
These damn days , you ca n’t ask much more than that .
STEP ON A CRACK ,
BREAK YOUR MOTHER ’S BACK .
#
According to the glossary in the NATO protocols , a mine may be detonated “ by the passage of time , the action of its target , or by controlled means . ”
(1) The passage of time .
I ’ve seen mines hidden in elephant grass and low shrubs , where the tic of a twig in an unlucky breeze will blow a crater big enough to bury a man .
I ’ve seen them in dunes , I ’ve seen them in eyries , I ’ve seen them in the crotches of trees .
Waiting .
We might have had an end to them back by the turn of the century or so .
All the suits , the honchos , the fat players met in Ottawa , Canada , in 1997 to ban the “ use , production , stockpiling , and transfer ” of anti personnel mines , the kind that ’ll blow your legs off years after the soldiers have gone home , the gift that keeps on taking .
This was back when there were only two hundred million landmines worldwide , plus , per annum , another two thousand planted for every one we cleared .
Give or take .
Still , it was nothing like today : the thing seemed doable .
A hundred and twenty nations agreed , but the brute of them all would n’t sign : the United States of America .
And here we are .
(2) The action of its target .
The shambling shards of men and women , ligatures and cauterized joints , pegs and hooks and makeshift hardware – soup can elbows , hose clamps cuffs – when blood loss or gangrene do n’t scotch the fixes . . . look out any window .
There ’s your targets , cities full of them .
Time was , a human person might have to journey to a strange far land to see such testimonials .
Now , with your Neo Luddites and your Xian Militia and your Rights and your Lefts all “ in the basement mixing up the medicine , ” any old window will do .
Near the start of the twentieth century , ninety percent of war dead were soldiers .
At the end it was ten percent .
Now , into the twenty first , Nader bless and save us , they say it ’s five .
The other ninety - five being you and me .
Civilians .
Look out any window .
But mind the glass .
(3) Or by controlled means .
Find it , mark it , quarantine it , blow it up .
That ’s what my old job was , mine and Uxo , my bomb dog’s .
Long before any of the world wars , soldiers were made to tunnel under enemy positions and fill the earth below with explosives .
“ Mine warfare , ” they called it .
That ’s where we get the term .
You might say that it ’s part of our ancient cultural heritage .
#
Did I say , “ the action of its target ? ”
Truth is , the inaction of the target is the mine layer ’s goal , most often .
Grand Central Station was a ghost castle when I first met Queenie and No Fingers and Mumps and Sonny and the gang .
All ’s it takes is one bomblet , one smithereened limb or gutted rib cage , one pop and flash , to close forty acres , as the Ludds knew well .
Who would risk the rest ?
You assume devices everywhere .
Hell , that ’s what I ’m paid to teach ’em .
USE YOUR PATE .
CIRCUMNAVIGATE .
It was the Xians mined Grand Central Station , same as Port Authority , with the plastique gadgets the folks call “ Bible Thumpers . ”
One little Bible Thumper had unmanned a copper at a newsstand near the 42nd Street doors , and Hell broke loose .
What with the ruckus on the Tappan Zee and George Washington Bridges with the Ludds , and the Lincoln Tunnel nightmare that the Rights dreamed up , there were n’t enough of us de-miners to go around .
I was already on the Awareness Squad then , already gagging about with my Spot , and they sent us down between clown turns to help cordon off Grand Central .
I did n’t expect to find anybody there .
Who had spare limbs to gamble ?
But kids .
Mumps and a couple dozen little street toughs took the place for their playground .
“ Hey , get down off that chandelier . ” I was cracked to be standing where I was standing just to shout that .
Spot dawdled at the entrance , spooling and unspooling yellow tape (. . .
CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION . . . ) with now and again a halfhearted yip : “ You crazy ?
‘ Mon back , Blacks .
Ain’t our job , f’r Nader ’s sakes . ”
Mumps and Queenie and some I never met were up in the crystals like a band of spider monkeys japing and hurling shit .
“ I said , get down , you bozos , it ’s not safe . ”
“ Nuts to you .
We ’re watching Sonny . ”
“ There ’s more of you ? ”
My heart was in my throat .
Children and mines .
And the holy Xians were n’t above laying butterfly mines , pretty ones , pretty as a quick death , that a child might grab for a toy .
“ Suffer the children to come unto me , ” do n’t they say ?
Yes , come and get it .
Anything to prove a point .
To pass a law .
To force the release of a “ political prisoner . ”
“ Sonny found a dog , ” they said .
“ A dog ? ” I was getting a kink in my neck looking up at them , but I did n’t dare move much .
Like I say , sometimes it only takes a tic .
Then I heard the yapping and the teasing .
Yips and shouts echoed one over the other through the empty station :
“ Hold him .
Hold him still . ”
“ I ’m holdin’ him .
Waddaya think I ’m doin’ here ?
Peel your belt and slip it round his middle .
Hurry up .
Jeez , this mutt ’s a handful . ”
“ I got a rope up one leg here . ”
“ Tie the cans on . ”
“ Would you please hold him still ? ”
“ I ’m holdin ’ him still . ”
They were in the stairwell that led down to the commode , a dangerous place in its time , the Grand Central Station Men ’s , but for different reasons .
I saw the dirt tracks leading there , and I left the monkeys in the chandelier and followed them .
I kept to the tracks careful as I could .
There were pits and corrugations everywhere in the old tile , any one of which could hide a man killing gob of explosive .
At my back I heard Spot complain : “ Leave ’em be , Blacks .
We ’ve warned ’em , ai n’t we ?
If they blow themselves up , it ai n’t on us . ”
I rounded the corner .
It took my eyes a few seconds to adjust to the dark of the corridor that ended in the stairway down .
Three or four kids wrestled with a dog .
The creature yelped and cowered while they manhandled and bound him .
He was a sorry thing to look at , a loose sack of bones and knots , the fur dull and patchy , matted with filth .
The dog was n’t fighting to beat them , either .
The moves he made , curling and feinting , head lowered , fangs hidden , were those of a puppy at play .
But the poor thing was confused by the children ’s ferocity .
He whined , cocked his head , and tried to scamper back while they labored to pin and tether him .
They were so absorbed in the business , the dog , weakened and baffled as he was , making them fight so hard , that I was able to come right up on them before they noticed me .
“ You kids crazy ?
This place is mined .
Let that dog go , and . . . ” The words stuck in my craw .
The kids turned their heads to see what ailed me , what had choked off the booming galoot .
Me , I just stared at the dog , ghost of a dog , yes , ghost of a square , fine dog , the once bushy tail , albeit balder , curled back into a little circle as of old , his ears , as of old , taut and low , and the coat of fine fur , though wrinkled and sagging , with the same scarlet patch . . . “ Uxo ! ”
Ux cocked his head at me .
He sniffed , then yelped and bounded so hard he slipped the kids , trailing sisal and hemp , and ended before me , up on his hind legs with his forepaws on my chest , a licking and a licking my stubbly mug .
“ He your dog , Mister ? ” They were thunderstruck .
I stood on a landing halfway down the narrow stairwell .
“ Down , boy – do you know , you kids , do you have any idea who this canine is ? ” I kissed him and rubbed him while he tried to engulf me for sheer joy and dog love , than which there ’s nothing bigger .
“ This is Uxo the bomb dog . ”
“ Bomb dog ? ”
I had them now .
“ So happens this dog achieved the rank of colonel in the United States Army . ”
The eyes on those kids were big as pancakes .
When they inched close and sat down before me on the next few steps down , it was as if those big eyes had pulled them there , and their bodies wagged after like tails .
“ You ’re shittin ’ us , ” one of them said , but his heart was n’t in it .
She longed to hear more , as any fool could tell .
“ Dogs ca n’t be soldiers . ”
“ You bet they can , little sister , and my Uxo was the king of them .
Back during the wars , they were drafted and commissioned and decorated or busted – say , if one peed on a general ’s cuff – just like a human person .
And my Uxo was the king of them .
Why , he was even awarded the Purple Heart , was my Uxo . ”
“ He was n’t . ”
“ You see that scarlet streak the shape of Florida just in front of his left hind leg ?
Uxo got that down in old Nick . ”
“ The Anti-contra - contras ? ”
“ That ’s right .
I was handling him , as they say , though the truth is , it goes both ways .
Uxo sniffed and I defused .
One time we was out away from our platoon , and Uxo sniffed some old nitre the Anti’s had left all round a ruined cane field where the cripples played football .
Well , a sort of football .
If they had two feet to a half dozen heads , those Nicks were lucky .
And old Ux dove away from me–zingo ! –and jumped on some little - un , knocked him away from a dinger that exploded right under old Ux .
Saved that fellow ’s life .
Uxo got patched up mostly , brave dog , excepting that spot where the hide shows and the fur never grew back .
“ Yes , my Ux was awarded the Purple Heart for that one ; he was in the army then , like myself .
He was one of only two dogs that ever got that particular medal , the other being a German Shepard name of Chips down in Sicily who he bit the hand of Ike once when he tried to pet him , which my Uxo never would . ”
“ Ike ? ” said a ragamuffin girl , all muscle and grit with an angel ’s face .
“ Eisenhower , dummy . ” A boy in a girdled potato sack puffed out his chest and jutted his chin .
He was unsteady on one leg ; where the foot should be there was a lump of old bandage .
The thing it covered would be toeless , I bet .
And I bet right – this was the child I would come to know as “ Sonny . ” “ Eisenhower .
He was a general and a president . ”
“ Smart fellow , ” says I , spitting Uxo ’s tongue off my mouth .
I whistled for Uxo to sit , and , God bless him , he remembered the melody , two clean chirrups .
“ He ’s not your dog , though , ” Sonny pipes up .
“ We caught him , we keep him . ”
Mumps and Queenie and the chandelier gang were perched at my back on the steps above me .
I had n’t noticed them till now .
“ Shut up , Sonny , ” says Queenie .
Mumps sat next to her , brushing her friend ’s hair with a dried out teasel head .
“ Tell us some more , Mister . ”
I told them about Angola and the Sudan and Afghanistan and Iraq where me and Uxo soldiered months and years after the live wars had ended .
I was kissing and rubbing and fussing over Uxo the whole time I was talking , and I noticed the pucker of a scar along his right side .
“ Look here , ” I said , “ God damn me if I do n’t know what that must be . ”
And I told them the story of the lion .
I knew what had happened to Uxo now , why I had lost him .
Maybe , ripped by the same lion that had ripped me , he lay in the bush till some kind folks found him and healed him .
Could they have seen him for what he was and sold him back to the de mining authorities in Zimbabwe ?
Maybe the Americans got hold of him then .
Cream rises to the top , do n’t it ?
And he winds up stateside with the de miners of the NYSLORC , the New York State Law and Order Restoration Command .
And he breaks loose of it – looking for me ?
Or else the whole damn thing was a miracle .
Take your pick .
I did n’t hear Spot shout anymore .
He must have given up on me and gone fishing , the way he liked to , by tossing a Burmese made M 76 into the East River .
A dozen kids sat around me and Uxo , some of them practically in my lap .
They nuzzled Ux nose to nose .
“ Hey , watch that shnoz , you bugs , ” says I . “ It ’s a thousand times finer than yours or mine . . .
Uxy ’s part Canaan dog , from the Pariah stock out of the Palestine .
Time was , I ’d give old Uxo my bunk and sleep on the floor beside him . ”
“ Why you call him ‘ Uxo ? ' ” Queenie wanted to know .
“ It ’s what he ’s trained to sniff , ” I told her , “ short for Unexploded Ordnance . ”
Sonny said , “ So when ’s he gonna explode ? ”
#
It was on a Green Day that Spot broached the Sheep ’s Meadow business , a bloody Green Day when everyone ’s a damn Naderite , even the Rights and Republicans .
Ever since the wars and the floods , you ca n’t find a soul whose family was n’t Naderite , “ honest to Nader , ” going back to Ur and Chaldea .
The Ludds claim him as their own ; so do the humble bomb - heaving Xians , and everyone in between .
No bomb shows on Nader Day .
Everybody scarfs kelp and bean curd pie courtesy of NYSLORC .
They chant passages from Unsafe at any Speed , and they listen to consumerist harangues and ecological diatribes from some of the biggest price gougers and polluters on the surface of the earth , such as it is nowadays .
They all wear their big Nader noses .
They bare their shoulders and crowd into the safe zones for sunscreen sharing .
I believe in my Nader as deeply as the next fellow , but I wo n’t take part in such stuff .
Spot felt the same way , he told me .
We nabbed our pie , with some extra for my Uxo , and we sneaked off to eat it in private , which is to say , in the shade of the half finished Trade Towers , all two stories of them , the ones they put up after the Anti-atheists blew the second World Trade Towers to hell , and that NYSLORC abandoned as too much red ink for the city stockholders .
We had a cranny we liked to sit in and gab - bare concrete and steel with tarps sagging between the girders , but it was solitary and out of the sun .
Uxo sat off in a corner happily pulling and gnawing at a hard rubber Nader nose someone had dropped in the gutter .
“ I need a little favor , Blackie boy , ” says Spot .
“ I ’ve made me some shady acquaintances , I confess .
It was abysmal bad judgment on my part , I know it , but I was new on this island , and , well , anyway , what ’s done is done , am I right ?
A person has to pick himself up and . . . ”
“ What kind of acquaintances do you mean , Spot ? ”
“ The gambling kind , Blackie .
The kind that runs in packs and do n’t know the French for ‘ forgive . ' ”
“ You in debt to them , Spot ? ”
He sighed .
He pushed aside his plate of curd .
“ Afraid so .
My head is on the block here , Blacks .
These sharks mean business .
These are the big boys .
They got ten thou worth of my chits , and if I do n’t pay them back by next Saturday , I ’m a dead man .
You gotta help me out , Blackie .
You ’re my only hope , you and Uxo . ”
“ Uxo ?
Waddaya talking about – Uxo ?
What ’s Uxo got to do with it ? ”
“ Well , Blackie , now , that ’s the whole thing .
That ’s what I ’m trying to tell you .
It has to do with General Checkers .
You know me and him are like this . ”
The crossed fingers .
“ He ’d give me the dough , but it ’d be bad for my character , see ?
He says he ’d do it , but it ’d be bad for me , see ?
He ’s a military man , and that ’s the way your military types think , see ?
Character .
But he ’ll still give me the money , I mean , only -”
“ Yeah . . . ? ”
“ Only I gotta do something for it . ”
“ What ? ”
Uxo stopped worrying the nose , which he had pinched between his paws , and pricked up his ears .
We could hear the Naderites drumming and singing away off in the Washington Mews .
They must have un tethered the symbolic horse , the one that would run wild through the downtown streets , a Green Day ritual to celebrate the end of the production of passenger cars – as if it had been something that anybody had a choice in .
Uxo went back to work on the wet left rubber nostril at just about the same moment that Spot stopped working those lips of his and gave me a suppliant look .
“ I , we , gotta arrange a sort of a , well , contest . ”
“ A contest ? ” I says .
“ Do n’t be mad at me now .
You see the fix I ’m in here , do n’t you ? ”
“ What sort of a contest ? ”
“ You want my kelp ? ”
“ What sort of a contest , Spot ? ”
“ The General has some pals in the de-mining technology business , see ?
Just like Ike said – military industrial , see ?
It ’s a marriage made in heaven . ”
“ Ike said it was a bad thing . ”
“ Whatever .
But these pals of the General ’s , outfit name of UM&D , they ’ll bankroll the whole thing , me included . ”
“ What whole thing ? ”
“ The contest , Blackie – what are we talking about here ? ”
“ What contest ? ”
“ The de-mining contest – at Sheep ’s Meadow .
Between your Uxo and their machine .
The General and his friends at UM&D , they want to show these investors , these high rollers , what Volkovoy can do . ”
“ Volkovoy ? ”
“ Yeah , it ’s this big machine , is all , a de-mining machine . ”
I had seen lots of de-mining machines , of course .
I ’d seen them in war zones between the battles , and I ’d seen them when the armies were gone , in those places that had the dough to hire them .
The specs were not the same .
“ This machine , is it a military tool or civilian ? ”
“ Huh ? ”
“ What standard is it designed for , Spot ?
Would you walk across a field it cleared ? ”
“ Well , no , I mean , but I ’d send a squadron across it .
Okay , military .
I see your point .
Military – so what ? ”
“ If it do n’t clear to UN standards , 99.6 % , then why should a stiff like me help them ?
Nader !
This is the kind of thinking that got us into this mess .
They want to sell them to foreign armies .
They ’re just in it for the money , are n’t they ? ”
“ And so should you be , Blackie , boy !
Do n’t you see ?
What better way to demonstrate how good it is than to pit Volkovoy against the most famous bomb dog on the face of the earth . . . ? ”
“ Most famous . . . ?
Wait a minute . ”
“ Do n’t be modest .
You can get some dough off it , too .
The General and his buddies are rolling in dough .
Made in heaven , I ’m telling you , like Ike said . ”
“ That ’s not what Ike – listen , you ’re crazy .
Uxo ’s past his prime , f’rcrissakes .
I ’m not gonna risk his life for . . . ”
“ For mine ?
That ’s what it comes to , Blackie .
Besides – come on .
Uxo ’s a champ .
Uxo ’s famous .
The General had heard all about his Purple Heart and everything .
You should have seen his face when I happened to mention
Uxo one day , just chitchatting , see , that I got this pal and that this pal ’s got this old bomb dog . . . ”
Uxo had finished his nose .
He sidled up and commenced to beg eats off me and Spot .
Spot petted him and shoved his plate under Uxo ’s nose .
Uxo wolfed it .
“ Spot , ” I says , “ there has to be another way . ”
“ There is n’t , Blackie .
Listen , I ’m begging you , Blackie .
It ’s my head on the block here .
And it ’s for humanity , too , remember .
They ’re test running a de-mining gizmo here .
Think of the lives , and so on .
And there ’ll be something in it for you . ”
He saw I was about to shake my head no , so he jumped in with , “ And for the kids .
For the kids , Blackie – do n’t forget that .
You could put some decent clothes on their backs , a roof over their heads , for Nader ’s sakes , three squares a day , sure thing . ”
“ Win or lose ? ”
Spot laughed .
“ You ’re a hard item , Blackie .
Win or lose , huh ?
If that ai n’t the crusty limit !
Volkovoy is top of the line , Blackie boy .
All due respect , your Uxo winning ai n’t in the picture .
Lose , is what I ’m talking about .
Lose .
I ’m your friend , goddammit to hell : I would n’t put you in the spot of needing that mange bucket to win .
It ’s Uxo ’s reputation we want here .
The dog himself , thank God , do n’t matter . ”
Just then Uxo stiffened and sniffed the air .
The tarpaulin on the uptown side of our banquet room rustled , and Sonny punched through .
He had two hands full of pie and Nader noses bulging out of both pockets .
“ What the hell ? ” says I .
“ Do n’t think I was following you , ” he says .
“ I was just looking for a quiet spot , like you , away from the stupid Ralphies .
The towers do n’t belong to you , you know – want some pie ?
I got extra . ”
We did n’t .
“ I heard what you bums were talking about , Blackie , ” says Sonny , “ and if you ’re going to run Uxo against that machine , you better make sure what the rules are . ”
“ Kid , ” says Spot , “ why do n’t you shut up and eat your pie ? ”
“ What do you mean , Sonny ? ” says I .
“ Dead and alive , ” says he .
“ Uxo ’s alive and Volkohoozis is dead .
That ’s what I mean .
That ’s what the contest has to be .
Dead against alive .
Just so everybody knows it , and nobody tries to sneak a human person inside that thing – or another dog , say .
Because that would be cheating , and then Uxo wins . ”
“ Kid , ” says Spot , “ your brains must have gone where your gone foot went .
Who ’d want to hide something worse inside of something better ? ”
Sonny pulled a face and slipped out the same way he had come .
“ What ’s with him ? ” says Spot .
I said , “ Damned if I know . ”
#
The next night after Spot and the General ’s proposition , we camped out , me and the kids and Ux , in the home team dugout at the ruins of Yankee Stadium up in the Bronx .
The night was wild , with a stiff eastern wind and noctilucent clouds scudding past a sickle moon .
Being in the business I ’m in , with the connections I ’ve got , I happened to know the place was safe , and since most people took it for a death trap , we had it to ourselves most nights we felt like it .
We felt like it that night , wanted to stay someplace special for the decision we had to make .
Spot was out beating the squatters on Wall Street with a hustle he called “ Bears and Garbage . ”
It had to do with betting on the actual bears that foraged around there nowadays .
Spot .
What can you say ?
The kids did n’t like the deal .
For one thing , they did n’t trust Spot .
For the other , like me , they were afraid for old Uxo .
Those days they were tagging along with me all over what used to be Manhattan Island , corn starching their faces white and sticking things on their noses – a rose petal , a split radish , a wad of red bubble gum – and helping out in the bomb shows .
They worked up a tolerable routine , and they even pulled Uxo into it .
They pasted a red paper cone over Uxo ’s shnoz .
They called themselves the Feckless Warriors – a phrase Queenie , who could read , had read in a book , but I do n’t know how well she understood it , because their refrain was :
WE USED TO HAVE FECKS ,
BUT NOW WE ARE WRECKS .
STAY AWAY FROM LANDMINES .
One Finger played the landmine , rolled into a ball , kissing her knees and a hugging her shins , with a fist ( the good one ) full of tin foil bits and pulverized spaghetti noodles .
When one of the kids made to fetch her or step on her , the others , Uxo included , would pull him away , but at the last they failed , of course , and One Finger exploded , de-fecking them .
I never in my life had the benefit of so many belly laughs as when those kids did their number .
I loved them almost as much as I loved my Uxo .
They loved Uxo , too , and no mistake .
Ux was their playmate and their hero .
The stories I ’d told them of Uxo ’s feats , they told one another and everybody else – and then they made up some more .
Mumps liked to hold
Uxo ’s head between her palms and roll her own head against it .
She ’d kiss him and shake him and wrestle him down .
It delighted my Uxo .
He loved the children .
He ’d lie on his back , pawing at the air and mewling like a puppy till one of them rubbed his belly , and then , with fangs sheathed , he ’d gnaw at them and give them little love pecks .
The kids loved to feed him and groom him .
I watched old Uxo regain some of his girth and muscle and sheen .
Sonny said , “ Forget it .
Spot and his girlfriend the General , all ’s they want is to see Uxo dead . ”
Queenie said , “ Uxo can take him . ”
“ He ’s old , ” I said , Uxo in my lap .
He was asleep and dreaming , head on his paws , muzzle in the hollow of my good knee .
Now and then he squirmed and yipped to doggie angels or groaned happily and snugged himself deeper into my lap .
I said : “ He ’s old , and he do n’t take the sun like he used to .
Heat stroke , blisters . . . ”
Queenie said , “ Spot said the contest would be at Sheep ’s Meadow , the part that nobody ’s de mined yet .
That ai n’t much .
How long would he be out there ?
His nose is still good , ai n’t it ?
No way he ’d stumble into something and blow up . ”
“ Not that .
Not likely , ” I said .
“ Ux knows his nitre – trained in Belgium .
Unless there ’s been a hard rain and the soil is wet , or if there ’s soot or ashes mixed in - that ’d throw him off good . ”
Mumps hugged Uxo for a pillow .
She was curled up against me and talked in a sleepy voice .
“ Same as metal for a machine .
Your Volkovoy ’d be helpless on a bridge , I bet .
That ’s why the Ludds mined the Tappan Zee . ”
Time was it was baseball averages every toddler knew .
Now it was mine lore .
“ Or if there were lots of pipes and wires or trash underground , that would bumfuzzle ‘ im for sure . ”
I said : “ You ’re thinking of the gizmos that pulse out a current and read what bounces back , like radar .
But some of those sensors work just like a dog ’s nose , Mumpsy .
‘ Course , they have a lot of mix - ups into the bargain .
Take the ones at the checkpoints : every damn time , they sniff my meds , and before you can say Ralph Nader , there ’s a badge in my face and a baton at my chest . ”
“ Your meds ? ”
“ Nitroglycerine pills , ” says I . “ For the ticker . ”
Sonny was just outside the dugout swinging a couple of bats he ’d boosted from an unlocked cage – unlocked , that is , as far as a baby burglemeister like Sonny was concerned .
Sometimes he ’d drop one of the bats and , with the other , clobber a gelded landmine he ’d picked up , then fetch it and clobber it again .
It set an awful example , playing with dingers , but , well , Sonny was Sonny .
“ You dying , Blackie ? ” he piped up .
Jiggling my pill tin for a castanet : “ Not so long as the goddam Civil Service keeps me in these . ”
“ You know , ” says Sonny , never looking at me , mind you , but just swinging and a swinging those bats , “ I heard about those checkpoint sniffers .
They run off bugs . ”
“ Bugs ?
You mean , bacteria ? ”
“ That ’s it . ”
Over the left shoulder , over the right shoulder , swinging and a swinging and eying the black horizon .
“ Bugs .
Glow bugs . ”
“ Yeah , I ’ve heard of that , ” I says , “ bacteria that glow funny when they ’re exposed to nitre .
Is that what those sensors have ? ”
“ That ’s what I hear , ” says the little man .
He swings and he swings .
Inscrutable , I call that one .
One Finger , who had looked to be fast asleep under the bench in a wrap of Astroturf , picked up her head and said , “ Anyway , I do n’t care .
Machines are n’t perfect .
They can get thrown off just like a dog can .
And they ca n’t smell plastic like Uxo can . ”
“ Machines do n’t get tired , ” Sonny put in .
“ Yes , folks , ” the PA boomed , “ machines do n’t get tired . ”
We all looked up at the broadcasters ’ booth .
Uxo ticked his tail and muttered .
“ Take old Volkovoy : backups in backups in backups . . . ”
“ How ’d Spot get up there ? ” No Finger crawled out from under the bench .
After his fashion , Spot commenced to sing :
“ On the first day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the second day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the third day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
three Lateral Migration Radiography Units ,
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the fourth day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
four One and a half Kilowatt Carbon Dioxide Laser
Thermal Impulse Induced Temperature Differential Imaging Devices ,
three Lateral Migration Radiography Units ,
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the fifth day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
FIVE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE TILLER DRUM CHISELS ,
four One and a half Kilowatt Carbon Dioxide Laser
Thermal Impulse Induced Temperature Differential Imaging Devices ,
three Lateral Migration Radiography Units ,
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the sixth day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
six Giant Magnetoresistant Sensor Arrays ,
FIVE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE TILLER DRUM CHISELS ,
four One and a half Kilowatt Carbon Dioxide Laser
Thermal Impulse Induced Temperature Differential Imaging Devices ,
three Lateral Migration Radiography Units ,
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the seventh day of Nadermas , Volkovoy had installed :
seven Active Electromagnetic Induction Sensors ,
six Giant Magnetoresistant Sensor Arrays ,
FIVE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE TILLER DRUM CHISELS ,
four One and a half Kilowatt Carbon Dioxide Laser
Thermal Impulse Induced Temperature Differential Imaging Devices ,
three Lateral Migration Radiography Units ,
two Resonant Microstrip Path Antennas ,
and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose .
“ On the eighth day arrrrrrgh . . . “
Spot fell into a drunken snore .
Uxo woke for an instant .
He shoved his nose into my palm to make me pet him , whereupon he let his eyes close , and he slid back down into doggie bliss .
“ Sonny , ” says I , “ why do n’t you see if you can scootch up to the booth and kill the PA before old Spot wakes the whole damn island ? ”
“ Sure thing . ”
Off he scooted , bum foot and all , up the bleachers and hand over hand to where Spot had snuck .
“ Must have drunk his Bears and Garbage boodle , ” I opined .
In a minute we heard Sonny ’s voice as if from the throne of Nader : “ Want me to kill him ? ”
I shouted , “ Just shut the thing off and leave him be . ”
One Finger told me , “ Never mind Sonny .
He do n’t mean it when he talks like that .
It ’s just his mumma and poppa died -”
“ Landmines ? ”
“ Nope .
The shits .
Some bug , he said . ”
“ Ah , bugs .
Bacteria .
Dysentery . ”
For fear of the mines folks let a piece of land go to swamp , things breed , and sickness spreads .
Happens all the time .
“ The shits .
Then an uncle took him in and raised him with a stick with a nail in it . ”
“ I figured something like that , ” I said .
I addressed them all : “ Well , seems like Volkovoy has a variety of systems at its disposal .
State of the art gadgets with coils and currents .
Backups for backups , a Russian doll of gadgets .
But that ’s not the point , kids .
Winning or losing is not the point .
Myself , love Uxo as I do , respect him as I do , I do n’t see him carrying the day .
But the point is , do we give it a go ?
Do we put old Ux out there , risk his venerable hide , do you see – for UM&D ’s money ?
I ’m putting it to you kids , because you love him like I do , and , dammit , that gives you some say so . ”
Sonny vaulted down from the bleachers .
“ Would n’t be bad having a place to live once the ice hits . ”
Queenie said , “ I do n’t care about that .
I care about assholes like Spot and Checkers dissing our Uxo .
I say , Uxo will beat Volkovoy ’s cast iron butt .
If we get some dough at it , fine .
But I just want to see the suits wag their heads and eat humble pie . ”
The other girls shouted , yes , and Sonny sort of nodded , though he was too proud to make so much of his assent .
Uxo shook , but I pressed him to my lap again ; docile as a lamb , he closed his eyes .
I said , “ That ’s the wrong idea , kids .
But if you say yes , I say yes .
Our Uxo ’s going to de mine the Sheep ’s Meadow and give the high hats their goddam show .
Bring on Volkovoy . ”
They cheered , of course , but then Queenie spotted the beer soaked scrap of paper in Sonny ’s paw , and , being Queenie , she had to grab it and read it – or try to read it : ” . . .
Mag - nee - toh - ree - ziss - tent Sensor . . .
My - crow - strip . . .
Kill - oh - watt . . . ”
Sonny parked his chin on her shoulder and watched her sound out the syllables .
“ How do you suppose Spot got a hold of that thing ? ”
“ His sweetie general , stupid .
Ther -mal . . . Radio - graph - ee . . . ”
“ I mean , why , Queenie ?
What was a jerk like Spot doing with Volkovoy ’s spec sheet ? ”
“ Singing it , Sonny .
Did n’t you hear ?
Now would you let me be ?
Rez - oh - nant My - crow - strip Path An - ten - nuhz . . . ”
The moon drowned in a thick bank of clouds .
Dust devils swirled across the infield .
The E-section gates stuttered and echoed .
Sonny shrugged .
He went back to his bats .
The rest of us got busy falling asleep .
#
That Sonny : a brusque mystery .
I always thought someone must have beat him silly before he knew to punch back .
He flinched when anybody made a sudden move , but he sneaked it into some nonchalant gesture .
Did n’t fool me .
I ’ve seen that bravado in men of all ages .
Even in a dog or two .
He kept his own council , but I saw he desired fine things .
Reading , for example – the way he had to snatch Spot ’s printout of Volkovoy ’s backup systems .
He collected printed matter , though he could n’t read much of it .
He squirreled away books and ledgers and learned journals , even phone books , in a locker at an abandoned Y. Queenie told me .
He would n’t let anyone catch him being less than impenetrable .
He did things nobody understood , and if you opposed him , he fought you .
Take the contest rules , when Spot proposed them on behalf of the General .
Spot had them all typed down , just like the list that Sonny had boosted .
Volkovoy and Uxo were to work parallel swaths in the death zone in Sheep ’s Meadow .
I was to stand on the side , handling Uxo by means of whistles ; we were well used to that .
When
Ux sniffed a dinger , I ’d go and geld the thing .
But Volkovoy was to do everything on its own .
Volkovoy , in its lane , had to find any mines or live ordnance and destroy it as well .
Sound fair enough ?
Not for Sonny .
“ No , ” says he , “ you got to add one line . ”
“ Shut up , ” says Spot , “ What do you know about anything ? ”
“ Plenty .
You got to add one line . ”
“ Sonny , ” whines Queenie .
“ You did n’t even want us to do this . ”
“ Sonny , dammit , Sonny , ” the rest of us are complaining .
“ One sentence or no go , ” says Sonny .
“ What sentence would that be ? ’ says Spot , with a smile that was an easy spit ’s distance from bloody murder .
“ This one , ” says Sonny .
“ That this contest is to prove who ’s better , a living creature or a machine , and however it gets proved , no matter what ’s in the ground or out of the ground when the thing is finished , that ’s what makes the winner . ”
“ You ’re like a dog on a bone , kid , ” says Spot .
“ Ca n’t you give it a rest ? ”
Nobody knew what Sonny was talking about , but Sonny put up such a fuss , and , truth to tell , we all loved him so ( all but Spot , I suppose ) that Spot finally had to write Sonny ’s sentence down .
“ Do n’t you have to clear it with your general ? ” says I .
“ No , ” says Spot .
“ The General and me , we talked over this little eventuality .
I apprised him of it after Sonny did his little bellyaching on Green Day .
Me knowing how soft you was on the little joker , I mean . ”
Here he frowned at Sonny like Sonny was something he had just scraped off his shoe .
“ It ’s okiedokie by the General , but if that ’s how things are going to be , then you wo n’t be paid for just joining in the show .
You have to win . ”
“ That mean your money is on the line , too ? ” says I to Spot .
“ Do the sharks eat you if Uxo loses ? ”
“ There was n’t no sharks , ” he whispered .
“ Do n’t hate me , Blackie .
I ’m the General ’s man .
How else am I supposed to be anybody ? ”
I did n’t hate him .
I guess I ’d known the truth all along but would n’t let myself know that I did .
“ Do it , yes , we ’re on , ” the kids were yelling .
“ It ’s crazy , ” I said , but in the end , the kids infected me with their craziness , I guess .
Sonny prevailed .
It was to be an actual contest with actual stakes .
I did n’t sleep a wink after that right up till the day at Sheep ’s Meadow .
Why had I gone along with it ?
Damn me if I was n’t more of a kid inside than the kids were .
I was swollen with love of Uxo , love and pride , insane pride .
Odds on , we would come away from this with nothing , and Uxo dead tired – or dead .
#
Flat to the stubbly grass and sifted loam of Sheep ’s Meadow , we still had all our parts , Mumpsy and me .
Mumpsy had a mild flash burn , a hide full of bloody pits and nicks , plus a cinder spray tattoo .
I busted up my good knee , and one hand would never clap again .
I thanked Nader for the breath in our lungs and the pulse in our veins .
For a minute , I confess , eyes closed , senses electric , I even took some pleasure in the hug little Mumps was giving me .
I had n’t felt such a thing since before the wars , when I held my sister ’s baby , dear warm dumpling flush to my shoulder and chest .
Mumpsy clung to me like I was her own flesh .
But when my head cleared and I looked up , Spot was looking down .
“ The General wants to talk to you , Blackie . ”
Mumps spat blood from a bit tongue , looked daggers at Spot , peeled off me , and made for her pals .
“ Watch yourself , Spot , ” says I , “ you might be standing on something . ”
“ Nah , you just cleared it , did n’t you ?
Get up .
The General wants to talk to you – Gawd , you look a crusty mess .
You okay , Blackie boy ?
Maybe you should take one of those yellow pills of yours ? ”
“ No , I ’m perfect , Spot . ” I tightened my belly .
I shivered a bit , shook the roar out of my brains , and stood .
I was n’t bleeding that bad .
I wobbled a little before achieving the steady vertical , and the first thing I did was to scan the meadow for Uxo .
“ The dog ’s okay , Blackie .
At least , it ai n’t dead yet . ”
I could n’t see Uxo – hidden for a moment back of Volkovoy , or mixed up with the stars and flowers that stippled my vision .
Up the hill , the kids fussed over Mumps .
They ’d left off cheering Uxo for the moment .
“ We ’ve put Volkovoy on pause so ’s you and General Checkers can have a little tête à tête .
You can call off your Uxo or let him keep working – we do n’t care .
Blackie , ” – the hand on my shoulder – “ it ’s hopeless . ”
I whistled my whistle that told Uxo to stay and wait , a long toot and a chirrup .
He barked back .
I nodded to Spot .
“ Let ’s go . ”
I followed Spot to the edge of the pasture , back behind the old latrine .
I breathed slow and I walked slow , and Spot let me .
He kept looking back at me like a worried mother .
General Checkers stood under a white parasol that an orderly held for him there .
I ’d heard of countermine boots before , but I had never seen them .
Do n’t know how a fellow could walk in them .
Somebody must have suspended General Checkers above a vat of molten iron and dipped him to mid-calf , was my impression .
He had a dark blue uniform .
He had a dark blue cape with gold piping .
He had epaulettes and ribbons and medals on his jacket and stars all over his hat .
A fellow would have had a hard time shooting the man without perforating a couple of those badges .
Inside those clothes a monstrous tall fellow stood sweating .
His face was all sausages .
If he had any hair , I could n’t see it for his hat .
He smiled and smiled while the sweat dripped down his face and rained off his chin like spray off a busted gutter .
That fellow smiled so fiercely he could have leveled a squadron by the gleam off his teeth .
It nearly leveled me .
He had what I ’d call an intentional belly , not the featherbed kind of a pot , but the kind that you do n’t want to mess with , the kind that will bull you up against a wall and pin you there while its owner chokes you .
A serious mean belly , I call it .
Spot ran ahead of me – it was an odd feeling .
It was as if , as soon as his General was in sight , he was n’t my friend anymore .
He was the General ’s man , period .
“ He ’s here , General , ” says he , like I was a parcel of mail .
To me : “ Come on . ”
I stepped up to Spot ’s General .
“ Good job , Spot , ” says he .
Then he turns to me .
“ Stinks here , do n’t it ?
And the heat .
I can practically feel myself putrefy under all that sun .
But , damn me , it ’s worth it .
Let ’s face it : everybody loves a mine field . ”
Waving off objections , though nobody was making any : “ I know !
I know !
But let ’s be honest : it ’s like the smell of a fart .
You pull a face– but you sniff , do n’t you ? ”
“ General Checkers , ” says I , “ I ’ve got a dog out there sweating in the sun just like you and me .
Could we get to the point , if you please ? ”
“ You hear that , Spot ? ” says he to his man .
“ That ’s what I call cajones .
This fellow has a full couple , and no mistake . ”
Back to me : “ Ah , ca n’t say as I blame you , Blackie .
I was a mudface once , you know .
I was n’t born with medals and adjutants , for Nader ’s sakes . ”
The General pulled from his pocket a palm sized cardboard box and slipped the top off .
I smelled .
I drooled .
“ Have a choklit , Schraffts Assorteds from before the wars . ” I clamped my teeth .
“ No ? ” He threw a couple into his mouth , crushed , swallowed , smiled .
Spot smiled too .
“ Now listen , Blackie , m’boy , your Uxo – good dog , do n’t get me wrong , but face it : he has n’t got the chance of a maggot up a Mauser barrel .
Hell , Blackie boy , only reason I asked Spot to set up this little show we got running here was for an entertainment for my friends and associates at UM&D – and for my friends ’ friends . ”
The general tilted his head in the direction of a near hill where three gentlemen and as many ladies all sat in business suits sipping cocktails , if I ’m not mistaken , under a wagon tent .
“ My friends own the plant that produces Volkovoy – that ’s what the ‘ D ’ is for in UM&D : de-mining .
And their friends are thinking about buying in , if you catch my drift – but we ’ve all seen enough , I think . ”
“ The General works for them , ” Spot chirped .
“ Shut up , you ass . ”
Checkers snapped his head toward Spot so quick the sweat flung off him – it wet my cheek – and his umbrella lackey trembled .
“ Nobody works for anybody here – where was I ? Your Uxo !
Damn me to the tits , if he ain’t a soldier ’s goddam soldier , Blackie boy . ”
Laughing : “ Damn me to the tonsils , damn me to my granny ’s toupee .
But .
But , is what I ’m saying here , Blackie .
The mutt ’s at death ’s door .
You really want to see him slip off into mange and mutt pus ? ”
The General pulled out a child sized black leather belt with a pouch attached .
“ What ’s that ? ” I says .
With a wink : “ What ’s in here , Blackie , will blow a friggin ’ tank sky high .
If .
If , say , some four - legged tail - wagging sonuvabitch of a soldier was to mosey underneath her . . . ”
“ No ! ”
“ Slow down , Blackie , for Nader ’s sakes .
Hell , the Russians used to do it with bottlenose dolphins out of Sevastopol on the Black Sea .
Worked like a goddam charm . ”
“ Damn your eyes , General Checkers , sir .
My Uxo ’s gonna beat that tin can of yours .
He ’s a creature , General , a living creature .
And no machine is a match for a living creature . ”
“ Ah , Blackie , you poor sap , yonder ’s a field full of machines that ’re more than a match .
Count your fingers if you think I ’m wrong .
Ain’t it a machine reduced them for you ? ”
“ He ’s got you there , Blacks , ” Spot crowed – then he winced and dodged a little , recalling his recent comeuppance .
“ Now , you listen to me , ” says the General , “ Your dog is finished .
I ’m offering you an out . ”
Laying a hand on my shoulder : “ Uxo ’d do anything for you . ”
Here came the other hand .
“ And if I say no ? ”
A little of the theater drained out of his face .
“ You could n’t be that stupid . ”
Clutching my shoulders in what he must have thought was a brotherly way : “ Look , your country is calling you , Blackie . ”
Sotto voce : “ Nobody expects a dog no more . ”
His lips were in my ear now , fat lips , and I could feel their flappage against my lobe : “ We ’ve got this one job , Blackie : hit the Ludds where it hurts and smithereen them whilst their heads spin , see ?
Right now they ’re rolling up the dry bed of the Potomac , them and the Xians in collusion .
Uxo could blow up their lead vehicle and stop the lot .
Taste it , Blackie - the Ludds KO ’ed by a living thing , by a dog , not by a machine – there ’s poetry in it .
Those throwbacks would be demoralized .
I need you , Blackie .
I need Uxo .
Nobody knew any bomb dogs were left .
Everybody thought they ’d died off after the wars , and what with the new gizmos , nobody bothered to train more .
You see what I mean ?
Demoralized . ”
He gave me my ear back , and stood there a nodding and a smiling , with eyes like freezer burn .
I just stared back at him , eyeball to eyeball .
I did n’t lower my peepers .
I did n’t blink .
I could see that he was n’t used to that , and it made him angry .
“ Otherwise . . . ” He puffed a bit , and he narrowed his eyes . ” . . . you ’d get nothing , of course . ”
“ That ’s assuming me and Uxo lose . ”
“ Oh , you ’ll lose . ”
“ You ’ll lose , Blackie , ” Spot chimed in .
“ You know what the ‘ U ’ in UM&D is for ? ”
“ Tell me , Spot .
What ’s the ‘ U ’ for ? ” I felt so sorry for him , licking the ass of a martinet like Checkers , it nearly eclipsed my annoyance with him – but not quite .
He was the smartest fellow and the dumbest I ’ve ever known , and all rolled up together , good and bad , like worms in a bait bucket .
He flashed his General another shit - eating grin and then explained to me : “ Universal , Blackie boy .
You ca n’t match ’em , and you sure as hell ca n’t beat ’em . ”
I just ground what teeth I ’ve got and stared past Spot at that gorilla of a general till he busted out laughing .
Up to that moment I had not understood exactly how phony the man was .
He could n’t be mad but he turned it to a yok - fest .
Then how could the fellow laugh when he really wanted to ?
He could n’t .
He had n’t the courage , this great courageous galoot , to give range to his human feelings .
I wondered what ancient farts he must be clutching with that tight ass ?
What tears had turned poison behind his eyes ?
That ’s how a fellow can kill , I was thinking – once he ’s killed himself , why , there ’s nothing to it .
Then it was I knew for a dead certainty : we would n’t lose .
#
Spot shadowed me most of the way back to the meadow .
He could n’t seem to decide where he belonged , with me or with Checkers .
He kept standing and turning to look back at the General , then sprinting to come alongside me again .
I paid him no mind .
I jutted chin and chest , set my jaw , and strode to the theater of battle .
“ Blackie , Blackie , boy , that was a big mistake , Blackie . ”
“ Why was that a mistake , Spot ? ” I never slowed .
He stumbled to keep pace , and me with my half plastic gam .
“ The General , he , those fellows in the tent , I mean – look Blackie , Uxo ’s got to lose .
He ’s got to . ”
“ Why would that be , Spot ? ”
“ Because , well , because . . . ” Now he grabbed my arm and made me stand still .
He looked up at me with hollow and ruined eyes , jowels like dripstone , a ghost of himself .
“ Because I made some side bets , Blackie boy . ”
He laughed , but he did n’t smile .
“ Who ’d have thought , huh , Blackie ?
Who ’d have thought that the mutt . . .
I bet everything , more than I ’ve got .
I ’m telling you the Nader ’s truth this time , Blackie .
They ’ll bust me to pieces .
They do n’t know the French for ‘ forgive . ’
They ’ll string me up and kill me .
You ’ll help me out , wo n’t you , Blackie boy ?
I ’ll make it good .
I ’ll pay you out everything the General would have paid you if you ’d won .
Mostly .
Come on , pal . . . ”
I pulled away from him .
I gave him my back .
I walked on toward my kids and my dog .
“ You ’re not gonna win , anyway , you dumb sonuvabitch .
Go on , Blackie .
Go dig yourself a grave , you and the brats .
Nobody cares about you , you sap .
Look at you !
You ai n’t even a whole man , Blackie . ”
I was coming up a rise , angle left and angle right , poke and pivot , as I had to on my busted leg .
I heard Volkovoy gear up , so I gathered my wind , and I whistled Uxo to get going .
“ You ’re history , Blackie boy .
You ’re dead – Blackie , Blackie , please , I ’m begging you , Blackie . . . ! ”
Now I breasted the hill and saw the two racers , Volkovoy and Uxo , the dead and the alive .
I was only a little dizzy .
The kids rooted at the sidelines .
Sonny policed them , bulled them back whenever they surged toward their four - legged beloved .
They had reason to cheer , at the moment .
Volkovoy , for some mystic purpose , had moved twenty five yards backwards in its lane to neck and neck with Uxo .
It had been doing this every so often , and I knew it only presaged an even greater leap ahead , but the children , bless them , chose not to remember .
“ Go , Uxy !
Now you got him ! ”
Mindless of the wheezing , gyring , smoking behemoth , Uxo sniffed dirt and ambled forward in his lane .
He was slowing again , even though he had just rested .
How much longer could the old dog last ?
The field , as we had suspected , was sparsely mined .
This was not so much a matter of removing lots of explosives as of proving where the dingers were n’t .
For the bomb dog , that ’s just as much work .
The sun was low in the sky .
It had cooled a bit .
Shadows of the hills on its west rim fell across the meadow .
I thought I saw the soil glow before Volkovoy on the swath over which it had just backed up .
It glimmered like foxfire , dimly – or so I thought .
I was just musing about that odd little show , when Sonny climbed to where I stood and threw a crushed can at my foot .
“ What ’s that ? ” says I .
“ What ’s it look like ? ”
“ Cola can , Sonny .
Or chicken gumbo soup .
Who cares ? ”
“ One of the tinies wandered out when I was n’t looking .
I scooped her back quick , but she was playing with this .
There were lots of them buried in the ground .
Cans and busted pots and pipes and printed circuits , and you could even see a car top , Blackie .
Volkovoy ’s blade must have turned it all up . ”
“ So what , Sonny ? ” I was only half listening .
Uxo had stopped moving , and I was looking to see if he would signal me to come defuse a dinger .
But there was something wrong with him .
I hopped down the rise and picked my way – chary as a de-miner , as the saying goes – toward Uxo , who sat licking his nose and snorting .
“ What ’s up ? ” says Sonny , following me .
“ Stay back . ”
“ No .
What ’s up ? ”
“ He ’s bleeding . ”
I skirted Volkovoy ’s lane , safe for a mechanized squadron , maybe , but iffy for a man , and came up on my Uxo from behind , across the ground he ’d checked .
I hugged him .
I stroked him under the chin and lifted his head to inspect the wound .
“ Cut it on scrap tin , I bet , ” says Sonny coming up on us .
Sure enough , the earth around us was lousy with rubble .
The dirt had been worn away or blown away in patches .
Just as Sonny had said : metal debris everywhere .
“ The goddam Rights , ” says I , dabbing Uxo ’s face with a clean hanky .
“ Before the Ludds mined this park , a band of Urbophobes were building a uranium reprocessing plant here .
Can you believe it ?
Smack dab on old Mannahatta .
Bunch of throwbacks in the goddam USA Senate backed them .
Hated the cities and city people .
Never got very far , though , what with simple NIMBYism .
Looks like they left in a hurry , and someone plowed under their leavings .
Plus , there were a few squatters twixt them and the mine - layers . ”
“ Yeah , ” says the kid , “ I was one of them . ”
I thought of the stick and the nail Queenie had told me about , but I kept my mouth shut .
Poor Sonny on the lam , alone .
“ So ? ” says Sonny .
“ Looks bad , ” I says .
“ The cut ’s nothing , but Uxo ’s worn out .
It ai n’t worth him shredding his face here . ”
“ You do n’t get it , do you ? ”
“ What are you talking about ? ”
Volkovoy was moving again .
It found a couple of dingers and disabled the firing chains with its precision sensors , its music box brains , and its burglar tool fingers .
Backups in backups in backups .
“ A compass would go crazy here , would n’t it ? ” says Sonny .
“ How do you figure Volkovoy sniffs out those dingers , huh ? ”
“ Why ca n’t you just talk straight , Sonny , goddammit ? ” says I . “ What are you babbling about ?
I got a bleeding dog here and a field full of tin cans and dingers and . . . holy Nader in heaven ! ”
My face went slack .
I finally caught his meaning .
“ Bugs , ” says Sonny .
“ Gotta be .
Bacteria .
Bioluminescence – you saw the glow , did n’t you , Sonny , you wily bastard ? ”
“ We win . ”
I kissed my Uxo between the ears .
“ We ’re done here , Uxy sweetie . ”
The three of us headed for the sidelines .
The kids stopped cheering when they saw us come near .
Their faces were as long as a New York winter , but we were about to make them happy .
#
Volkovoy whined , roared , and spat foam while me and the kids huddled .
He was still whining , roaring and spitting foam while we tramped uphill to the General ’s encampment .
We felt like a platoon .
We had our battle plan .
Mumps rehearsed her lines as we climbed .
One Finger marched and sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic , as best as she remembered .
Amazing are the little shards of culture that survived the wars – lullabies , work songs , oaths . . .
“ Oratory , Naderoola !
“ Hunky dory , Naderoola !
“ Gory glory , Naderoola :
“ Deluth is parched and gone ! ”
Checkers was in high spirits .
He rose from his camp chair to greet us .
“ So you ’ve come to surrender , huh ?
Well , by Nader , ” – paw on my shoulder – “ you can keep your sword , General Blackie .
Har , har .
Look at the bright side – you ’ve done your little bit to de mine the Sheep ’s Meadow , yes ?
The kiddies can play there again .
Picnics , baseball , what have you . ”
This was all a lie , I knew , since Volkovoy hewed to the military and not the humanitarian standard , but I let old Checkers flap his lips .
“ It ai n’t like it was all for nothing .
No dishonor .
Uxo gave it the old college try .
Do the math : pound for pound , all that .
Too bad you put the kibosh on our original deal , of course .
The dough would n’t do you no harm in these straits , but – there ’s right and there ’s wrong , for Nader ’s sakes .
Volkovoy has won . ”
“ Yeah , ” says Sonny – the opening volley – “ Volkovoy .
Uh huh .
But was it a living creature or a machine that won ? ”
Sonny had brought along that gelded dinger of his .
He kept throwing it up and catching it as he spoke , which leant an insouciance to his words that seemed to irk old Checkers .
“ Cute kid . ” The General tousled Sonny ’s hair for the half second he managed to keep him under his hand .
“ I just said – and we all saw – that Volkovoy won .
You pulled the mutt , did n’t you ? ”
Mumps jumped her cue .
“ General , ” says she , skirts aflutter .
If she had waited another minute , she would have forgotten what to say .
“ What is it , darlin ’ ? ” - a pinching her cheek .
“ Is Volkovoy dead or alive ? ”
“ What ? ”
“ Dead or alive ? ” says Sonny .
Up and down , the dead dinger , up and down .
“ Well , he ain’t alive , ” the General laughed .
“ Neither he nor nothing in him .
Do the math .
He ’s a lab on wheels , a lab and a tank and a plow . . . ”
” . . . and a Single Chip Neuromorphic Silicon Nose , ” says Queenie .
“ We know . ”
Sonny gave Checkers a sly sidewise look : “ You let us know . ”
“ Huh ? ”
“ The spec list you gave Spot . ”
“ The what ?
Why , I never gave . . .
Spot , you scoundrel , have you been rifling through my private papers ? ”
Sonny half smiled .
“ No , you gave it to him , General Checkers , sir .
You wanted Blackie and us to see it .
Well , we heard it , actually – I bet you did n’t think old Spot would sing it to us . ”
“ He ’s not much of a crooner , ” Mumps put in .
Spot was creeping off – “ Gotta see a man about a dog , ” he mumbled to his collar bone – when Mumps jabbed : “ No offence , Spot . ”
Spot smiled , then remembered that he should n’t , so he stopped it .
The General roared : “ Who is this child , Blackie ?
Spot , why are we dealing with children here ?
This here is a clown show , is what it is .
I never in all my life . . . ”
It was my turn .
“ What Sonny is getting at , General , sir , is that the list is not complete .
It was a little disinfo ploy , was n’t it , sir ?
Whether Spot boosted it or you had him deliver it , that do n’t matter , sir .
What matters is that a certain item , as we surmise , has been left off the list . ”
“ The ninth day of Nadermas , so to speak , ” Queenie put in .
“ Bugs , ” says Sonny .
General Checkers ’ eyebrows knotted .
That whole puss of his , in fact , turned into a mess that old Gordias would have wondered at , and Alexander the Great , by Nader , would have needed three swords to undo it .
“ Bugs ?
What , I , uh . . . ”
“ Live bugs , General , ” says Sonny .
“ Live , not dead .
Back - tee - ree -uh . ”
“ That sod was full of rubble , General , ” I says .
“ Not one of the gadgets on your list could have spotted a bomb in all that metal junk . ”
Now the suits were up .
They sauntered over from their wagon tent , holding cocktail glasses by the stem , pinkies extended , I swear to Nader .
An elegant lady , three sails to the wind , with black silk stripes on her tuxedo trousers and black lipstick and a spiked choker , who seemed to be the boss of them , barked , “ What ’s happening here , Checkers ?
Show ’s over , is n’t it ?
Our guests are impressed and ready to do business - is there a problem ? ”
“ Of course not , of course not , Ms. Buttons , ma’am , ” said Checkers with a slight bow and a gentlemanly sweep of the arm .
No Finger , taking charge of her considerable power of cuteness , took the woman ’s hand in her little hand and pronounced in a baby voice : “ General Checkers is n’t playing fair , ma’am .
It was supposed to be creature versus machine , alive versus dead , but he cheated and snuck live creatures inside Volkovoy to do the real work .
That ’s why we made Uxy stop . ”
“ Bacteria , ma’am , ” Queenie reiterated .
“ Nitrogen sensitive bioluminescent bacteria .
We win , and he wo n’t pay . ”
Ms. Buttons frowned at the General .
“ Is that true , Checkers ? ”
“ After a fashion , yes , but . . . ”
“ Pay them . ”
“ What ? ”
All the color washed out of his face .
“ What difference does it make , Checkers ?
For Nader ’s sake , we ’ve seen what we needed to see .
Win or lose , who gives a damn ?
We ’ll mass produce Volkovoy and as long as the Ludds are laying mines , them and the Anti’s and the Anti-anti’s and who all , we ’ll make more money than you can stuff up a Liberal ’s loose asshole . ”
“ Ma’am , all due respect , it is n’t a matter of that . . . ”
“ Yes , it is .
Pay them . ”
Spot had been standing stock still the whole time , frozen where Mumps had zinged him .
He shouted : “ It is n’t right . . . ”
“ Shut up , Spot , ” says the General .
He was a man who hated to lose , but as between military and industrial , it seems , the industrial is the fellow on top .
So Checkers says to me , “ My paymaster will take care of you , Blackie .
Just get the hell out of my sight , you and your no -necks , and take Spot with you . ”
“ General , please . . . ” says Spot , but the General has already taken Buttons in arm , and they are waltzing back to the wagon tent to talk the big bucks .
“ General , ” I heard the lady say as they retired , “ we ’re going to be rich as Republicans . . . ”
“ Looks like everybody wins , kid , ” says I to Sonny .
“ How bad a thing could it be , UM&D stamping out a shit load of Volkovoys to clean up the goddam world , even if it ’s just halfway clean ? ”
“ UM&D , huh ? ” says he , with that smug mystic look .
“ You know what the ‘ M ’ is for , Blackie ? ”
He shoves his gelded dinger under my nose .
I had n’t noticed what a slick job it was , a neat black ball with stubs where the sensor arms had broken off .
He turned it to display the tiny print etched along a join :
UM&D
“ Son of a bitch , ” says I .
#
With the dough that stiff neck paid us we bought us a trunk of canned refries from before the wars , and a canvas wall tent , and some blue nylon two man tents that fit in a little bag , and coats full of goose down for each and every one of us against the coming drear , and a solar powered calculator for Nader knows why but Sonny had to have one , and a Barbie doll for No Finger – the little girl Barbie , Barbie Barbie , not the vivisectionist one , Klaus Barbie , that boys favor nowadays – and an actual palm sized computer for Queenie that actually still worked and it had a shit load of batteries that came with it and whole books that were loaded into it , and many other necessaries and luxuries , and rawhide toys for Uxo , and we still had some dough left over against the next catastrophe , which Nader knows there will be one .
With plenty of grub and a sure dry place to sleep , everybody kicked back and played awhile – between our bomb shows , of course :
ONE THING ’S CERTAIN –
KICK A DINGER
AND IT ’S CURTAINS .
We ate like Republicans .
We fattened up Uxo .
But my mind kept returning to the Sheep ’s Meadow .
Uxo had never finished his lane , and Volkovoy ’s , which was only cleared to minimal , combat standards , could still maim or kill someone .
Maybe it was stupid , with all the minefields on Manhattan Island , to fixate on this one , but it seemed my bailiwick , me and Uxo ’s last bomb job .
So I stole away from the kids some mornings , in the cool at daybreak , and walked Uxo out to Central Park .
I did n’t want them around causing trouble , maybe getting hurt .
I worked Uxo slow and easy .
I took my time unlinking the firing chains on those simple dingers the Ludds had laid .
We were almost finished in seven good mornings , but on the eighth , which , like the goddam eighth day of Nadermas , I had figured to be the last , we encountered a little problem .
Some bare - chested fool was running all over Sheep ’s Meadow , leaping and jumping as if he were trying to tamp down the topsoil – or break his damn feet .
I calmed old Ux with a hand on his back as I got down onto my haunches beside him .
I wanted to careful see what sort of a bird we were up against before announcing ourselves and causing his death or ours .
It was n’t Spot – he was too skinny , and it was n’t Spot – his gait was too tipsy , and then , by Nader , it was Spot .
I had n’t seen him since the day of the big contest – three weeks or so , time enough for a fellow with some determination to turn himself into a howling skeleton .
“ Spot , boy , ” I shouted , “ stand still .
You ’re on live ground .
Me and Uxo ’ll guide you out . ”
He fell down laughing .
“ That you , Blackie , you hound - humping loony ?
What makes you think I want to be guided out ? ”
I went round the safest way I knew , playing the odds just a bit here and there for fear that Spot would find his dinger .
“ Just you stand still , partner .
Here we come .
There ’s eggs and toast back at the kids ’ place , Spot .
You hungry ? ”
Just stay alive a minute , was the thought .
“ It ’s no use .
You ’re talking to a dead man , Blackie , boy . ”
He jumped up and slammed down hard , like belly flopping onto a pond .
“ Missed it , ” he mumbled .
Then he says , laughing , “ The bad guys have called in my chits , Blackie , boy , just like I said they would . ”
Me and Uxo came up along
Uxo ’s lane now , a safe clear run , till we came to the edge of the bad ground .
“ We ’ll talk to ’em , Spot .
They ’re businessmen , ai n’t they ?
We ’ll negotiate .
What good are you dead , am I right ?
They lose their whole investment . ”
Spot skipped and kicked .
The man was hysterical .
“ What good ?
For an example , that ’s what . . .
“ HERE LIES SPOT ,
“ BEATEN TO A PUDDING ,
“ EYES GOUGED ,
“ BONES BROKE ,
“ TONGUE FOR A NECKTIE
“ THROUGH HIS SLIT THROAT .
“ DON ’T CROSS THE MOB . ”
“ Tell me , Blackie , what the hell did I ever do wrong ?
I never hurt anybody .
All I ever wanted was to help people and be good . ”
One last jump , and Spot found his dinger .
It was an awful sight .
I had to hide my eyes in Uxo ’s fur .
Uxo shivered and howled .
My head to his flank , I felt the howling through his ribs .
I looked up and saw Spot ’s blasted body lying face down , half buried in a man -sized hole .
Sure , I cried , but it was nothing new .
Those times were full of blasted bodies and tears .
I did n’t have to do much digging .
What was left of old Spot I kicked down into the earth .
I used my hands and my feet to pile down dirt .
Afterwards I had to sit down and breathe .
Uxo licked the sweat off me .
I saw dimples in the air , and my chest felt like a falling elevator car , but a pill fixed it .
Uxo and I finished that morning .
Turns out , Spot ’s was the last dinger in Sheep ’s Meadow .
It was Spot de-mined it .
The kids who play there nowadays – “ picnics , baseball , what have you ” – they have Spot to thank .
#
Sometimes in my tent at night while Uxo snores , I dream .
I dream about ancient heroes .
I dream about Jason and the Argonauts , for example : how Jason planted dragon ’s teeth in King Aeetes ’ field and raised up demons , then slew them .
I wonder if we can slay our portion , geld our dingers , me with my gimp leg , Uxo with his tired old bones , these kids with the bum dice Fate has thrown them .
Dragon ’s teeth , landmines – not much changes .
I guess the question is , once all the mines are pulled , supposing we manage that , will we have the guts not to plant any more ?
Maybe we ’re all just too selfish , too scared , and too angry .
The way I figure it these latter days , before you de-mine the goddam world , you have to de-mine yourself .
I laid a stone where Spot was buried .

An impression of Ventastega pictured with its fossil skull Scientists say a fossil of a four - legged fish sheds new light on the process of evolution .
The creature had a fish - like body but the head of an animal more suited to land than water .
The researchers ' study , published in the journal Nature , says Ventastega curonica would have looked similar to a small alligator .
Scientists say the 365 - million - year - old species eventually became an evolutionary dead end .
Counting digits
About one hundred million years before dinosaurs began to roam the Earth , in what is referred to as the Devonian Period , Ventastega was to be found in the shallow waters and tidal estuaries of modern day Latvia .
According to lead author , Professor Per Ahlberg , from Uppsala University , Sweden , this creature had the head of a tetrapod , an animal adapted to live on land .
The body , though , was fish - like but with four primitive flippers .
" From a distance , it would have looked like an alligator .
But closer up , you would have noticed a real tail fin at the back end , a gill flap at the side of the head ; also lines of pores snaking across head and body .
The famous Tiktaalik fossil " In terms of construction , it had already undergone most of the changes from fish towards land animal , but in terms of lifestyle you are still looking at an animal that is habitually aquatic . "
Experts believe that Ventastega was an important staging post in the evolutionary journey that led creatures from the sea to the land .
Scientists once believed that these early amphibious animals descended in a linear fashion , but this discovery instead confirms these creatures diversified into different branches along the way .
Professor Ahlberg points to the discovery of a fossil called Tiktaalik in Canada in 2004 .
It is believed to be the " missing link " in the gap between fish and land animals .
Ventastega is a later species but is a more primitive form of transition animal .
" Ventastega fills the gap between Tiktaalik and the earliest land based animals .
All these changes in these creatures are not going in lockstep ; it 's a mosaic with different parts of animal evolving at different rates .
Ventastega has acquired some of land - animal characteristics , but has not yet got some of the other ones . "
For instance , the creature had primitive feet - but with a high number of digits .
Superb sands " I would draw the inference that Ventastega probably had limbs very much like Acanthostega ( another transitional species ) .
These were little things sticking out of the sides , with a strangely high number of digits .
You would have seven , eight , maybe even nine toes per foot , rather than five or so which you would expect to find in modern day animals , " the Uppsala scientist explained .
Unfortunately for Ventastega , a multitude of toes does not inevitably lead to evolutionary success .
It eventually died out .
Other creatures went on to become our very distant land - living ancestors .
Scientists are delighted with the quality of these Latvian fossils , saying they are really well preserved .
Professor Ahlberg believes it is due to some of the geological characteristics of the area .
" This region has had a very quiet geological history since that time , and as a result the rocks have not been folded or squashed up to form mountains .
" We still find sediments not yet properly turned to rock .
These fossils were found in compact , wet sand .
It 's not sandstone , it 's sand ; you dig it with a breadknife .
" Once you take it back to the lab very carefully , you can remove the remainder of the sand with brushes and needles .
These fossils are fragile but superbly preserved .
They are actually three dimensional , not flat .
It makes it very easy to interpret the skeleton . "

ここのとこ ろObjective-Cを勉強中なんですが、まず最初にびっくりしたのがメソッド名の長さです。
Objective -Cでは、メソッドの呼び出し時に引数の名前を明示するので、「このメソッドの2番目の引数は何の意味だっけ？」などと悩む必要がなくなる反面、メソッド名が「動詞＋前置詞＋名詞1:名詞2:名詞3...」のような構成になって、ものすごく長くなります。
一番長いメソッドは何文字あるのか好奇心が湧いてきたので、Cocoaのリファレンスに載っているクラスを対象に調べてみました。
まず、メソッド全体の長さベスト10です。

A new Microsoft - powered table lets you flirt with strangers at a bar — without ever leaving your seat .
Microsoft debuted the high - tech tabletop at Harrah ’s Rio All - Suite Hotel in Las Vegas this week .
It revolutionizes the very nature of the watering hole and may change the face of the drunken hookup forever .
Virtual Flirt
Shy guys , listen up :
This feature could let you approach women in a bar without having to actually approach them .
The counter ’s built - in 30 - inch flatscreen has a program that gives you a glimpse at the location ’s ladies , even if they ’re sitting right behind you .
You can look at them via integrated cameras , chat with them , take and send photos , and even use the convenient number exchange option when you ’re ready to seal the deal .
All this , and you never have to make eye contact .
Unfortunately , though , Microsoft forgot to incorporate the cybersex add - on , so you will have to engage in some old - fashioned human interaction if you wish to engage in an amorous event .
eBartending
Want to mix your own drink ?
Now you can — sort of .
The system ’s Mixologists program gives you the toys to play bartender .
You can click on any alcohol , juice , or mixer and drag as much of it as you want into your drink .
Once you finish the concoction , a bartender will get the message and whip up your custom - made creation .
The Mixologists program will even remember your drink so you can get it again .
The hope is to eventually network throughout all Harrah ’s properties so you could order your drink from any station , anywhere at its Vegas hotels .
Bar Boredom
The computers have plenty of options to help you beat a boring night at the bar .
You can watch videos on YouTube and play a variety of games .
Oh , the bar can watch you , too :
The system is designed to track your drinking and gambling habits to help the hotel better market to you .
Future Uses
This may only be the beginning of the tabletop computer technology .
The systems — which are completely safe to set drinks on — have already been used in AT&T Wireless stores , where they recognize phones and give customers information specific to their devices .
Microsoft is now working on applications for Starwood Hotels .
We can only hope that they too will have the built - in flirt technology , room - to - room .
Check out the system for yourself in this video that will be nothing like any normal person ’s experience .

9 blasts rock Bengaluru ; 1 killed , 7 injured
Vicky Nanjappa in Bengaluru | July 25 , 2008 14:46 IST
Last Updated : July 25 , 2008 23:16 IST
Bengaluru has been attacked .
Low intensity blasts in a span of one hour in six different places rocked the IT capital of India on Friday afternoon in which one person died and seven were injured .
While the first seven blasts took place between 1.30 - 2.30 pm , the eighth blast blast took place at Hosaguddahalli , near Gopalan Mall , on Mysore road at around 5.30 pm and the ninth blast took place near the Army Engineering College on Mysore Road at 6.30 pm .
The Bengaluru police have termed it as an act of terror .
The first two blasts occurred at Adugodi at 1.30 pm behind the famous Forum Mall , which is a major shopping destination in Bengaluru .
The second bomb was placed near a granite factory under some granite slabs .
The blast at Madiwala occured near the check post at 1.50 pm , which were followed by a blast at Nayandahalli in a bus shelter at 2.10 pm .
Between 2.10 and 2.30 pm very low intensity blasts were reported near the Mallya hospital at a park and on Richmond and Langford road .
A woman who died in the blasts has been identified as Lakshmi .
She , along with her husband , was standing at the bus stop when the explosion occurred .
Reports suggest that she was hit on the head by a bolt .
He husband Ravi has also been injured in the attack .
Five other persons have been injured in the blasts .
Bengaluru Police Commissioner Shankar Bidri said the blasts were of low intensity and gelatin sticks were used .
Preliminary investigations show that the bombs were attached to a timer device and were triggered off by a mobile phone .
A similar pattern was used in the Hyderbad twin blasts and also at Jaipur and Ajmer .
While various theories are being floated regarding the cause of the blasts , the police maintain that it was only to scare people and create law and order problems .
While the Intelligence Bureau are not ruling out the hand of the Students Islamic Movement of India behind the blasts , the cops maintain that it is too early to blame anyone .
The IB says that the attack could be three pronged -- one to scare the IT sector in Bengaluru , two to warn the Karnataka police in the wake of the arrests of SIMI cadres in Karnataka which led to the arrests of 10 supremos of SIMI in Indore and lastly as a retaliatory measure since the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power for the first time in south India .
Looking closely at the manner in which the attacks were carried out , the IB says that it was more of an attempt to scare the people rather than kill .
The bombs were of low intensity and the places in which they were hidden is a clear indication that the intention was more to scare the general public and in the case of the Madiwala and Adugodi explosions , the IT sector in particular .
There are large number of IT professionals living in these two areas .
Moments after the explosions , panic set in Bengaluru city .
People were seen running helter skelter at the blast sites , while the rest of the city remained tense .
What made matters worse was that all mobile lines were jammed and people were trying desperately to contact their near and dear ones .
However , shops and establishments did not down shutters and offices and schools remained open even after hearing the news of the blasts .
The only effect of the blasts were traffic jams all across the city .
On the spot , people looked shaken up and were in a daze following the explosions .
They said they heard a loud explosion and when they looked around there was dust that had kicked up and several window panes shattered .
The police were quick to get into the thick of the action and both the dog squad and the forensic team were pressed into service .
Bidri assured the people that the situation was under control and there was no cause for panic .
He said that security had been beefed up and the police have taken stock of the situation .
Gopal Hosur , joint commissioner , crime , said that there was nothing to worry .
He said that the blasts were low intensity in nature .
He assured the people that the situation was under control .
Some people say that the way to succeed is to do one thing at once , and do it properly .
Look at Gerald Ford , they say .
See ?
See what happens when you walk and try to chew gum at the same time ?
Then along came the 1990s , computers , the Internet , and a generation of workers who may or may not have a legitimate claim to some sort of attention - deficit disorder .
It 's a good thing President Ford is n't on the job market now , as he'd need to be able to multitask a lot more than simple combined - ambulation / mastication in order to stand out among today 's job seekers .
Not so fast , according to Christine Rosen , a writer with The New Atlantis ; multitasking is nothing but a con !
Now , stop me if you 've heard this before .
I thought I had , and you know what ?
I had , not once but twice in the past two years !
In March 2006 , Time said just the same thing .
Then , in March 2007 the New York Times did , too .
Here we are in June 2008 , and now The New Atlantis has joined the call .
The complaints against multitasking are the usual ; you 're not as focused as you could be if you were just doing one thing at once , switching focus repeatedly actually makes you less productive as each time your brain takes a few moments to reprioritize tasks and so on .
There are a number of scientific studies that back up many of these points , such as the one that showed that receiving e-mail messages affected volunteers ' performance during IQ tests more than a toke on a joint , although I 'm yet to hear of anyone smoking a spliff at work and trying to claim that it 's not an issue because ' Bob over there is checking his e-mail . "
I 'll come out and say it : I do n't think this reminder is going to have much of an impact on today 's worker doing more than one thing at once .
I confess , I 'm one of them .
Perhaps you are , too .
Right now I should probably be doing something other than writing this post , but a look across my Macbook 's screen and the obligatory external LCD ( no one can adequately multitask with just one screen ) I see an IM conversation , the gossip , gripes , and goings on in our electronic office ( also known as an IRC channel ) , an app that I 'm using to analyze microscope slides , an Excel spreadsheet , and then the full complement of e-mail , newsreader and browser windows .
Between Exposé and tabbing between apps , I can flit from task to task , buzzing around like a crack - smoking housefly .
The fact that the Internet is always right there , and with it one 's friends ( e- mail , IM , etc ) , one 's library ( the web , obviously ) , and even the TV ( YouTube , etc ) mean that the duller everyday work tasks are practically invitations to alt - tab , F5 , kthnxbai .
Employers seek ever - greater productivity from their workers , which means getting more work from them for the same amount of pay .
Faced with that situation , it 's hardly surprising the cube - dweller responds by spending 15 minutes an hour looking at LOLCATs .
Besides , I 'm just old enough to remember the days before you used to be able to multitask ; people used to sit at their desks reading the newspaper instead .
Nature released the results of an online survey in which 20 percent of respondents , largely drawn from the scientific community , admitted to using brain - enhancing drugs like Ritalin ( methylphenidate ) and Provigil ( modafinil ) .
Sixty - two percent of the scientists who had taken drugs used Ritalin while 44 percent reported using Provigil and only 14 percent had tried beta blockers like propranolol .
The 1,427 - person survey was launched after a duo of articles this winter touched off a storm of questions about widespread neuroenhancer use by the scientific community .
Jonathan Eisen of UC - Davis , an evolutionary biologist , even successfully spread an April Fools ' rumor that the National Institutes of Health were planning to regulate the use of brain " steroids " as a condition of funding scientists .
All of this led me to ask Wired.com scientists ( and other readers ) three questions :
1 . Have you used cognitive enhancers ?
2 . Did they work for you ?
3 . Would you talk to me about your experiences ?
Feel free to comment , e-mail ( alexis_madrigal@wired.com ) , IM ( gatobarb on AIM ) , or call ( 415.276.8481 ) if you 're interested in sharing your cognitive enhancement story .

Cellar coma girl wakes after seven weeks after being played Robbie Williams songs
Monster : Josef Fritzl fathered Kerstin with after locking up his daughter Elisabeth in his cellar 24 years ago .
Cellar victim Kerstin Fritzl woke from her two - month coma after being played Robbie Williams songs .
Kerstin was unconscious and critically ill with multiple organ failure when she was admitted to hospital on April 19 .
The 19 - year - old was placed on a life support machine and put in a medically - induced coma and has now been successfully revived , thanks to being played a series of hits by the pop star .
She is now on the mend and has a wish - to see the former Take That star in concert .
At a news conference in Amstetten , Austria , this morning doctors detailed how she has managed to make a complete recovery and has been reunited with her mother and siblings at a clinic .
Doctors confirmed there should be no major lasting damage .
Doctor Albert Reiter , who led the medical team , described the moment when she first opened her eyes as ' very emotional ' .
He said : ' We smiled at her and she smiled back . '
" One night I had to order her to finally go to sleep at 3 am as she kept listening to Robbie Williams CDs . "
Now the teenager is said to be a good communicator and has made two requests - she wants to take a boat trip and she is desperate to see Williams in concert .
Doctors realised she was getting better when they saw her dancing in bed to a track .
Doctor Reiter added that her mother Elizabeth had played a huge part in her recovery by visiting her on a daily basis and helping to motivate her daughter by talking to her .
Within days the teenager had taken her first steps and on Sunday she was transferred to the clinic where her mother and five brothers and sisters are staying .

Emotional : Dr Albert Reiter , who treated Kerstin Fritzl speaks during a news conference in Zeillern , Austria
It was the first time the 19 year - old had encountered her family outside the cramped dungeon where she has spent her entire life .
Doctors had set up the plan in advance knowing that Kerstin had only ever before seen her mother and two brothers , as well as her captor Fritzl , 73 , who is in custody awaiting trial .
Medics feared Kerstin - born to Fritzl and his daughter Elisabeth during her 24 - year incestuous captivity - would die when her organs stopped working .
She was hooked up to a life support machine to keep her vital organs steady .
Last month there were unconfirmed reports she had showed flickers of life and at one point had opened her eyes as she began the slow process of emerging from the coma .
Kerstin initially became sick after biting her tongue .
Blood got into her lungs and an infection began to spread through her body .

Cellar prison :
The cellar bathroom where Fritzl 's dungeon prisoners were expected to wash
In a rare act of mercy , evil Josef Fritzl chose to release the teenager and take her to hospital after she collapsed in his underground lair .
Kerstin is one of the seven children Fritzl , an engineer and property developer , fathered with his own daughter Elisabeth , 42 , whom he kept as his personal sex slave in a purpose - built dungeon beneath his home .
One of the children , a baby boy called Michael , died shortly after birth and Fritzl burned his body in an incinerator .
Fritzl selected three of the children , Lisa , 15 , Monika , 14 , and Alexander , 12 , to live with him and his wife Rosemarie , 68 , in their upstairs apartment in the town of Amstetten .
The other three children , Kerstin , Stefan , 18 , and Felix , five , were forced to live in the damp cellar beneath with their mother , never seeing the light of day until police revealed the case on April 26 .
Elisabeth 's mother Rosemarie , 69 , has also gathered strength after health problems sparked by revelations of her husband 's vile dungeon in Amstetten , Austria .
The family recently symbolised Kerstin 's presence by circling her name with a heart in a touching poster of personal messages .
Appeal : A poster bearing the Fritzls ' hand - prints and a heart for Kerstin while she lay ill in hospital
When the teenager fell ill , doctors sent out a national TV appeal to find her mother , who , Fritzl claimed , had run off to a sect .
Unsuspecting Rosemarie was away on holiday in Italy at the time but rushed home to support the children .
The family are expected to stay in their clinic for several months while they adapt to the real world .

What does a 5 - 4 decision in a case like Boumediene v. Bush mean ?
In Republicanland , it means everything the Supreme Court has told them they 've been wrong about for the past 7 years is one vote away from being suddenly right .
And staying that way forever .
One more vote , and torture is n't unconstitutional .
One more vote , and indefinite detention on the president 's say - so is n't unconstitutional .
One more vote , and warrantless wiretapping is n't unconstitutional .
And do we really need to follow the implications in other arenas ?
Surely no executive branch official could be forced to testify at Congressional oversight hearings .
And do n't even ask about reproductive rights .
John McCain ( for whom at least a very few a very few Hillary Clinton holdouts insist they will vote in November , presumably as punishment for Democrats who failed to grasp their wisdom ) could not be more overt about his desire to eliminate them :
John McCain believes Roe v.
Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned , and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench .
One vote away .
One more vote , and everything you thought you understood innately about the nature of our system of government can change , and the insane right - wing trolls who 've astounded you with their seemingly otherworldly interpretations of constitutional law will be right , and will claim they 've always been right , but for the interference of " liberal , activist judges . "
And they will laugh in your face .
But in the meantime , they 'll be spitting in it .
Like Sen. Lindsey Graham does , when he says he's so sure the Court is wrong in Boumediene that he 's willing to amend the Constitution to prove it :
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) vowed Thursday to do everything in his power to overturn the Supreme Court ’s decision on Guantanamo Bay detainees , saying that , " if necessary , " he would push for a constitutional amendment to modify the decision .
These are the Republicans with whom -- if we 're to believe the buzzwords -- we 're supposedly obligated to seek " bipartisan compromise . "
There 's no such thing as " compromise " with people who believe that you and your " correct " understanding of the Constitution , what it says , and what it means is more properly viewed as being merely " pre-wrong . "
A man confronting his own mortality ?
Courtesy Vintage Images / Getty Images
Death looms around us all , but for the most part , people try to avoid thinking about it .
The success of antiaging skin care products and the hospital 's increased role as supporter of life beyond the time after quality of life diminishes both attest to this .
But while people in most cultures may avoid thinking about death , others find it a fascinating study .
An entire school of thought is dedicated to the study of death and dying -- along with its processes , like grief .
This field is called thanatology .
Thanatologists believe that humans have compartmentalized death in a quest to trick ourselves into believing that we will not die .
Unfortunately , by failing to confront our own mortality -- or even the mortality of those around us -- we will be ambushed when death inevitably comes knocking .
What 's worse , we will fail to live our lives in the best manner possible :
It is the person who has accepted his own mortality who will live life to the fullest , say thanatologists .

Those who study death -- physicians , funeral directors and psychologists alike -- point out that before the early part of the last century , death was a very visible part of life in Western culture .
When a person died , he most likely died at home .
His corpse was often laid on a sofa or in a bed in the living room ironically enough , and meals were taken around it .
Family members slept near the body of their deceased beloved .
They had professional photographers take photos of the family gathered around the body , which was sometimes propped up with the eyes open to make the dead still appear to be alive .
This process often took place over the course of days before the person was buried .
Both adults and children were exposed to the body .
In this way , a child became socialized with death , and was arguably more ready to face his own mortality than the children of today .
So why is death so hard for many people to confront ?
Fear of the unknown is certainly one reason , but there is also another , more sublime aspect that is based on modern medicine .
A century ago , a person with cancer would die .
A person with access to today 's medical technology has a much better chance to live .
In this manner , some have come to see medicine as a way to cheat death , and rather than confront the fact that they will die one day , they look instead to medicine to save them from their inevitable fates .
This is what the psychologist Ernest Becker considered a distraction .
Becker won the Pulitzer Prize in 1974 for his book , " Denial of Death . "
It was Becker 's opinion that culture at large served to distract all of us from our impending deaths .
It 's as if we are all on the same roller coaster , chugging slowly up toward the tallest hill .
At the crest is death , and every one of us will eventually make it to that crest .
Culture in this metaphor is a set of giant televisions on each side of the coaster tracks , which some people choose to watch rather than look up toward the top of the hill and consider what 's beyond the hill .
But although some allow themselves to be distracted , we are all unconsciously fully aware of our finite time here on Earth .
In Becker 's opinion , this causes feelings of anxiety and woe and is expressed through aggressive acts like invasions and wars .
Becker 's field of study -- referred to as the psychology of death -- does suggest a worst way to die .
Since culture has the potential to distract us from confronting death , it can lead us to waste our lives .
The worst type of death , according to Becker 's theory , would be one that followed an insignificant life .

The pre-WWDC Apple rumor mill has finally churned out something that does n't have the words " 3G " and " iPhone " involved -- sources have told both Ars Technica and our friends at TUAW that Steve will also use his keynote to introduce the next major version of OS X , codenamed " Snow Leopard . "
As the derivative release name indicates , there are n't many changes in store from 10.5 Leopard --
Apple 's said to instead be focusing on tightening up speed and stability as it starts producing more mobile devices .
What 's more , this could be the end of PowerPC and Universal support in OS X , as Snow Leopard is said to be Intel - only .
That 's bound to ruffle a few feathers , but things could get even more heated if Carbon is deprecated as is also being rumored .

Proof # 1 - Try praying
How might we prove that God is imaginary ?
One way would be to find a contradiction between the definition of God and the God we experience in the real world .
What would happen if we get down on our knees and pray to God in this way : Dear God , almighty , all - powerful , all - loving creator of the universe , we pray to you to cure every case of cancer on this planet tonight .
We pray in faith , knowing you will bless us as you describe in Matthew 7:7 , Matthew 17:20 , Matthew 21:21 , Mark 11:24 , John 14:12 - 14 , Matthew 18:19 and James 5:15 - 16 .
In Jesus ' name we pray , Amen .
We pray sincerely , knowing that when God answers this completely heartfelt , unselfish , non-materialistic prayer , it will glorify God and help millions of people in remarkable ways .
Will anything happen ?
No .
Of course not .
This is very odd .
Jesus makes specific promises in the Bible about how prayer is supposed to work .
Jesus says in many different places that he and God will answer your prayers .
And Christians believe Jesus -- according to this recent article , " 54 % of American adults believe the Bible is literally true . "
In some areas of the country the number goes as high as 75 % .
If the Bible is literally true , then something is seriously amiss .
Simply look at the facts .
In Matthew 7:7 Jesus says : Ask , and it will be given you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
For every one who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
Or what man of you , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
If " every one who asks receives " , then if we ask for cancer to be cured , it should be cured .
Right ?
If " our Father who is in heaven gives good things to those who ask him " , then if we ask him to cure cancer , he should cure it .
Right ?
And yet nothing happens .
In Matthew 17:20 Jesus says :
For truly , I say to you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ' Move from here to there , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
If " nothing will be impossible to you " , then if we ask to cure cancer tonight , cancer should disappear .
Right ?
Yet nothing happens .
Note that if we take the Bible less - than - literally here , the statement " nothing will be impossible to you " becomes " lots of things will be impossible to you , " and that would mean that Jesus is lying .
In Matthew 21:21 : I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only can you do what was done to the fig tree , but also you can say to this mountain , ' Go , throw yourself into the sea , ' and it will be done .
If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer .
If " you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer " , then if we ask to cure cancer tonight , cancer should dissappear .
Right ?
Yet nothing happens .
Note again that there is not a non-literal way to interpret " you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer " , unless you replace " whatever " with " nothing " or " little . "
The message is reiterated Mark 11:24 :
Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
If God says , " believe that you have received it , and it will be yours , " and if we believe in God and his power , then what should happen if we pray to cure cancer tonight ?
It should be cured .
Either that , or God is lying .
In John chapter 14 , verses 12 through 14 , Jesus tells all of us just how easy prayer can be : " I tell you the truth , anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing .
He will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father .
And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the Son may bring glory to the Father .
You may ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it . " [ ref ]
Look at how direct this statement is : " You may ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it . "
This is the " Son of God " speaking .
Have we taken him " too literally ? "
No .
This is a simple , unambiguous statement .
Have we taken his statement " out of context ? "
No - Jesus uses the word anyone .
Yet Jesus ' statement is obviously false .
Because when we ask God to cure cancer tonight , nothing happens .
We see the same thing over and over again ...
In Matthew 18:19 Jesus says : Again I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
For where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
In James 5:15 - 16 the Bible says :
And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well ; the Lord will raise him up .
If he has sinned , he will be forgiven .
Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed .
The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective .
In Mark 9:23 : All things are possible to him who believes .
In Luke 1:37 : For with God nothing will be impossible .
Nothing could be simpler or clearer than Jesus ' promises about prayer in the Bible .
Yet , when we pray to eliminate cancer , nothing happens .
And keep in mind that this is Jesus talking here .
These are not the words of human beings .
These are not the words of " inspired " human beings .
These are supposedly the words of God himself , incarnated in a human body .
Jesus is supposed to be a perfect , sinless being .
And yet , it is obvious that Jesus is lying .
What Jesus says is clearly incorrect .
Jesus is supposed to be God .
God is supposed to be perfect .
When Jesus speaks , he should speak the truth .
Yet when we look at what Jesus says about prayer ,
he is clearly lying .
If you would like additional proof , gather a million faithful believers together into a giant prayer circle .
Have them all pray together in Jesus ' name that God cures every case of cancer on the planet tomorrow .
Pray sincerely , knowing that when God answers this completely heartfelt , unselfish , non-materialistic prayer , it will glorify God and help millions of people in remarkable ways .
Now , we certainly have two or more people gathered together , and they have asked in Jesus ' name , and we have not one but a million faithful believers who , by definition , have faith and believe .
We have fulfilled every one of Jesus ' requirements .
Will Jesus answer the prayer now ?
Of course not .
Your prayer will go unanswered , in direct defiance to Jesus ' promises in the Bible .
In fact , if you pray for anything that is impossible , your prayer will always go unanswered .
If you are an intelligent , rational human being , all of the examples mentioned above show you that the God of the Bible is imaginary .
The Bible clearly promises that God answers prayers .
Yet when we pray , nothing happens ( for a complete discussion proving that nothing happens , please see this page ) .
What Jesus says about prayer in the Bible clearly is not true .
Therefore , one of two things must be happening : God is imaginary .
God does exist , but he never answers prayers .
Unfortunately , God is defined by the Bible to be a prayer - answering being .
The contradiction between the reality of God and the definition of God proves that God is imaginary .
In fact , we have ample scientific evidence to demonstrate that the belief in prayer is nothing but pure superstition , as shown in the next proof ...

Understanding the Rationalizations
A favorite Christian rationalization for why God does not answer our prayer to eliminate cancer is because " it would take away free will . "
The logic :
If you pray and God answers your prayer , then God would have revealed himself to you , and you would know that God exists .
That would take away your free will to believe in him .
Of course , if this is true , then by default all of Jesus ' statements about prayer in the Bible are false .
It means that God can not answer any prayer .
Also , why is a God who must remain hidden like this incarnating himself and writing the Bible ?
If Jesus is God , and if God is perfect , why are n't all of Jesus 's verses about prayer true ?
Was Jesus exagerating ?
Was he fibbing ?
If Jesus is perfect , why would n't he speak the truth ?
Why does n't a prayer to cure cancer worldwide tomorrow work ?
Believers have many different ways to explain why all these verses in the Bible do not work , even if you are praying sincerely , unselfishly and non-materialistically , and even if the answer to your prayer would help millions of people and glorify God in the process .
They will say things like this : " You need to understand what Jesus was saying in the context the first century civilization in which he was speaking ... " or : " When Jesus talked about ' moving a mountain ' , he was speaking metaphorically .
When someone says , 'it is raining cats and dogs , ' no one takes him literally .
Jesus was using a figure of speech rather than speaking literally ... " or : God is not a thing .
He is a being .
He has a will .
He has desires .
He relates to people .
He has personality traits .
Prayer is a fancy word for talking to God .
God , who knows everything , even before we say it , knows the difference between our thoughts and wishes , and when we are actually addressing him .
He hears our prayers and responds .
His responses are based on his personal decisions .
We cannot predict how he will respond to our prayers ... [ ref ]
The primary problem with these rationalizations is that they miss the point .
The fact is that God never answers any prayers , as discussed here .
Going one step further , the problem is that all of these rationalizations miss two other important points :
God is supposed to be an all - powerful , all - knowing , perfect being .
The statement , " Nothing will be impossible for you " , along with the other Bible verses quoted above , are false .
The fact is , lots of things are impossible for you .
If a perfect being is going to make statements about how prayer works in the Bible , then three things are certain : 1 ) He would speak clearly , 2 ) he would say what he means , and 3 ) he would speak the truth .
That is what " being perfect " is all about .
A perfect , all - knowing God would know that people would be reading the Bible 2,000 years later , and therefore he would not use first - century idioms ( he would say what he means ) .
He would know that normal people will be reading the Bible and interpreting it in normal ways , so he would speak in such a way as to avoid mis-interpretation ( he would speak clearly ) .
He would know that when you say , " Nothing will be impossible for you " , that what it means is , " Nothing will be impossible for you " and he would make sure that the statement " Nothing will be impossible for you " is accurate ( he would speak the truth ) .
If God says it , it should be true -- otherwise he is not perfect .
Unfortunately , the fact is that thousands of things are impossible for you no matter how much you pray , and no one ( including Jesus ) has ever moved a mountain .
In order to see the truth , you need to accept the fact that all of the above verses are wrong .
The fact is , God does not answer prayers .
The reason why God does not answer your prayers is simple : God is imaginary .
