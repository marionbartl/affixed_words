Ford 's 2,215 page 2007 master contract with the UAW
1941 UAW - Ford contract
Factory wages are n't Detroit 's problem , and strikes are very rare in the auto industry nowadays .
The real issue is the job classifications ( see top photo of Ford 's 2,215 page 2007 master contract with the UAW vs. the 1941 UAW - Ford contract below ) .
Ford 's UAW contract has lots of them , governing who can and who can't perform specified tasks on the factory floor .
So if a machine breaks down , an assembly line can come to a halt while everyone waits for the worker with the proper classification to arrive at the scene .
If other workers nearby are perfectly capable of fixing the machine , well , that does n't matter .
The number of job classifications is less than it was a decade ago , but it 's still far too many to maximize a factory 's efficiency .
The classifications and attendant work rules are enforced by union bureaucracies — members of each plant 's shop committee , grievance committee , health and safety committee , etc .
They 're all paid by the companies , as are their legions of corporate counterparts .
One man 's feather - bedding is another man 's job .
All this begs a fundamental , and uncomfortable , question .
Can a UAW - represented car company compete effectively , long term , with its nonunion competitors ?
At the very least , companies organized by the UAW have lots of extra costs to bear at their factories located in the U.S .
It 's interesting , then , that Consumer Reports rates the quality of the four - cylinder Ford Fusion higher than the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord , and the Lincoln MKZ higher than its Acura and Lexus counterparts .
The Fusion and MKZ are built in a factory without job classifications because it's in Hermosillo , Mexico , and is n't represented by the UAW .
If Ford targets future expansion in Mexico , the recent contract vote will spell further decline for a union that , like Detroit 's car companies , badly needs cultural change .

How Ford Is Making Its Comeback

Wells Fargo to repay $ 25 billion bailout
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wells Fargo said Monday it has reached an agreement with the government to return $ 25 billion in bailout money it received during last year 's financial crisis .
The San Francisco - based bank said repayment of the funds is contingent on a $ 10.4 billion common stock offering .
The move comes on the same day that Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) announced plans to repay the $ 20 billion it received under the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , while Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) returned $ 45 billion in TARP money last week .
Wells Fargo also said it would raise $ 1.35 billion by issuing common stock to certain employees instead of cash as part of their 2009 compensation .
It also plans to boost equity by selling $ 1.5 billion worth of assets , pending approval by the Federal Reserve .
The bank expects to have a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 6.2 % once the bailout funds are repaid .
Under the TARP program , Wells Fargo said it had paid $ 1.4 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury .
" TARP stabilized our country 's financial system when confidence in financial markets around the world was being tested unlike any other period in our history , " said John Stumpf , Wells Fargo 's president and chief executive , in a statement .
Stumpf was one of 12 bank CEOs present at the White House Monday where president Obama urged them to make more loans to small businesses and modify mortgages to aid struggling homeowners .
In a statement released late Monday , Stumpf said Wells Fargo is committed to serving the financial needs of consumers and businesses as the economy continues its recovery .
" We remain committed to keeping credit flowing , and working closely with financially distressed home owners , as we have throughout this downturn and credit crisis , " Stumpf said .
Meanwhile earlier in the day , Citigroup said it would raise money to repay the government through a combination of stock and debt , the bulk of which would come from a $ 17 billion common stock offering .
The New York - based bank also said the government plans to gradually sell the $ 25 billion worth preferred - stock it owns in Citi over the next 6 to 12 months .
At Citibank , the rush to repay TARP money stems partly from concerns about ongoing government restrictions , including caps on pay packages for executives at the nation 's largest bailout firms .
On Friday , White House " pay czar " Kenneth Feinberg capped base salaries for 75 Citigroup executives at $ 500,000 for the remaining three weeks of 2009 .
Those changes were expected to serve as the model for their pay next year as well .
But , by paying back the bailout , Citigroup will no longer be required to submit pay packages for its executives to the government for approval .
Wells Fargo was not under the authority of Feineberg 's pay restrictions .

( CNN ) --
Did you set your clocks back this morning ?
If you forgot , you may want to go ahead and do it now .
Do n't feel like you 're being rude ; we 'll wait right here for you .
There .
You have now given yourself the illusion -- as all of us do , every spring and autumn as we adjust our clocks and watches -- that you are in control of the concept of time .
But that 's a battle that we all seem to have lost a while ago .
Every technological advance fools us into thinking that we have conquered time , that we have made it our servant .
Yet there is this nagging feeling that it is we who have somehow become enslaved .
We suspect that our time is not , in fact , our own -- that it is some alien creature that has overcome us and altered us .
We are constantly , as if against our wills , in a rush to be in a bigger rush .
So why , then , does each day 's invisible finish line seem farther and farther away ?
The other morning , I was in an airport when I saw an artifact from a dying era , something as evocative , in its own way , as the crumbling edifices of ancient Rome .
The artifact in the airport had been disabled , ready to be hauled off to the scrap heap .
Its name was printed upon it : " AT&T Public Phone 2000 . "
You may be familiar with the contraption .
In the early 1990s , when 2000 still seemed distant and exotic , AT&T started installing the things in airports across the U.S. The AT&T Public Phone 2000 was far more advanced than a traditional pay telephone .
It featured a glass screen , which blinked madly at passing men and women , inviting them to come hither .
It featured a keyboard .
It had a wide bench seat .
The idea was that the business traveler with an extra few minutes before his or her flight could sit down , insert a credit card , and -- here was the magical part -- send a written message to friends and associates in other parts of the country .
They were big and bulky and undoubtedly expensive to produce , and soon enough they became all but useless because people now carry tiny personal versions of those machines in their pockets .
Which is why the wiring had been cut on the AT&T Public Phone 2000 that I saw the other day , and why it sat there in the terminal , unavailable for use .
Our ability to reach each other in a millisecond , and to reach the world at large , has progressed so rapidly that we did n't seem to fully notice as it happened .
One day we were walking down city streets making eye contact with each other , taking in the local scenery , and the next we were staring at the screens of our hypnotic phones , receiving real - time messages and breaking - news updates from people hundreds of miles away .
It was a tradeoff we did n't exactly ask for .
Yes , the concept of distance was all but erased -- but so , in a way , was the concept of place .
We were sold the notion that we could be anywhere , with the tap of a key .
What we only gradually began to recognize was that , by being everywhere , sometimes it felt like we were nowhere .
Any delay began to feel unacceptable .
Most of us grew up accustomed to having to wait for letters in the U.S. mail ; when e-mail made that largely unnecessary , we told ourselves that the new speed of electronic correspondence was satisfying and ideal .
But then came instant messages , which were .
. . well , instant .
This was all supposed to save us time .
Yet do you feel as if time is something you have mastered ?
Do you believe that you have many more free hours to yourself now ?
Have the ever - sleeker - and - smaller machines and the ever - more - potent software cleared your schedule , made you a man or woman of leisure ?
Or do you sometimes worry that you are working for your handheld communication device , instead of the other way around ?
" What 's new ? " has ceased to be a casual pleasantry , and has become an urgent demand .
Indeed , the word " new " itself has lost its punch ; in marketing campaigns , the adjective " new " has increasingly been tossed aside and replaced by the adjective " next . "
" New " now seems somehow old .
At family gatherings and get - togethers of friends , something is happening that would have seemed outlandish even a few years ago .
People at the parties are posting photos and videos of the events on social networking sites even as the parties are still going on .
Thus , friends and acquaintances around the country and around the world are looking at the party pictures and videos and evaluating them before the party is even over .
And people who are at the parties themselves , checking in on the same social network sites , are looking at the publicly posted pictures of the party they are still attending .
It 's like a bizarre form of proactive nostalgia for something that has n't finished taking place yet .
Some day soon , even this will seem quaint and outmoded ; some day soon , this current ability to be constantly in touch will feel creaky and broken - down , like the AT&T Public Phone 2000 that was ready to be carted out of the airport .
Right around the next corner -- someone is already working on it -- the next generation of technology is almost ready , with the promise of compressing time and space in ways that will make us dizzy .
And yet :
Has all of this increased your ability to take a deep breath , to relax , to savor the time that is available to you ?
Did all of the rushing deliver you to someplace better ?
Now . . .how did we get started on this ?
Oh .
Of course .
Did you set your clocks back this morning ?
You do n't want to let time get away from you .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .
He was named as Mariano Bacio Tarracino , 53 , and is believed to have been connected to a mafia clan involved in a drug trafficking turf war with a rival group .
Anti-mafia investigators said they released the horrific footage of the murder , which happened in May , because they still had not managed to find the killer – despite the fact that the angle of the surveillance cameras means that his face is clearly visible beneath his baseball cap .
He even seems to be smirking after carrying out the execution .
The world 's largest book stands upright , set in stone , in the grounds of the Kuthodaw ( literally - royal merit ) pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill in Mandalay , Myanmar ( Burma ) .
It has 730 leaves and 1460 pages ; each page is three and a half feet wide , five feet tall and five inches thick .
Each stone tablet has its own roof and precious gem on top in a small cave - like structure of Sinhalese relic casket type called kyauksa gu ( stone inscription cave in Burmese ) , and they are arranged around a central golden pagoda .
Royal merit
The pagoda itself was built as part of the traditional foundations of the new royal city which also included a pitakat taik or library for religious scriptures , but King Mindon wanted to leave a great work of merit for posterity meant to last five millennia after the Gautama Buddha who lived around 500 BC .
When the British invaded southern Burma in the mid nineteenth century , Mindon Min was concerned that Buddhist dhamma ( teachings ) would also be detrimentally affected in the North where he reigned .
As well as organizing the Fifth Buddhist Synod in 1871 , he was responsible for the construction in Mandalay of the world 's largest book , consisting of 729 large marble tablets with the Tipitaka Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism inscribed on them in gold .
One more was added to record how it all came about , making it 730 stone inscriptions in total .
The marble was quarried from Zagyin Hill 32 miles north of Mandalay , and transported by river to the city .
Work began on 14 October 1860 in a large shed near Mandalay Palace .
The text had been meticulously edited by tiers of senior monks and lay officials consulting the Tipitaka ( literally - the three baskets , namely Vinaya Pitaka , Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka ) kept in royal libraries in the form of peisa or palm leaf manuscripts .
Scribes carefully copied the text on marble for stonemasons .
Each stone has 80 to 100 lines of inscription on each side in round Burmese script , chiselled out and originally filled in with gold ink .
It took a scribe three days to copy both the obverse and the reverse sides , and a stonemason could finish up to 16 lines a day .
All the stones were completed and open to the public on 4 May 1868 .
Assembly and contents
The stones are arranged in neat rows within three enclosures , 42 in the innermost , 168 in the middle and 519 in the outermost enclosure .
The caves are numbered starting from the west going clockwise ( let ya yit ) forming complete rings as follows :

Thirty years later in 1900 , a print copy of the text came out in a set of 38 volumes in Royal Octavo size of about 400 pages each in great primer type of letters .
The publisher , Philip H. Ripley of Hanthawaddy Press , claimed that his books were " true copies of the Pitaka inscribed on stones by King Mindon " .
Ripley was a Burmese born Armenian brought up in the royal court of Mandalay by the king and went to school with the royal princes including Thibaw Min , the last king of Burma .
At the age of 17 he fled to Rangoon when palace intrigues and a royal massacre broke out after the death of King Mindon , and he did have the galley proofs checked against the stones .

Iran says it will soon inform the International Atomic Energy Agency of a timetable for inspection of its recently - announced nuclear facility .
Head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi broke the news in an exclusive interview with Press TV late on Monday .
Iran has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that the new plant will produce enriched uranium of up to 5 percent , consistent with its nuclear energy program .
Salehi noted that the plant is under construction within the framework of the IAEA regulations , saying " Iran has taken all the precautionary steps to safeguard its nuclear facilities .
" The Iranian nuclear chief said the attacks and accusations leveled by the United States and its Western allies during last week 's summit of the G - 20 in Pittsburgh were pre-planned .
He also accused the major powers of politicizing Iran 's nuclear activities .
Salehi said that his country will try to resolve the issue both politically and technically with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany ( P5+1 ) and the IAEA .
He , however , branded accusations of enriching uranium at its second enrichment site for military purposes as ' baseless ' .
The Head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization reiterated that the Islamic Republic has no intention of making nuclear weapons , saying its atomic drive is only aimed at peaceful purposes .
He noted that having a nuclear weapon is " against our ethics and religion " .
" It is against our tenets , it is against our religion to produce , use , hold or have nuclear weapons or arsenal , how can we more clearly state our position , since 1974 we have been saying this , " Salehi elaborated .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Healthcare workers in Indiana and Tennessee will be among the first to get swine flu vaccines in the United States on Monday , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .

Vaccination clinics are scheduled for Monday morning for staff at Le Bonheur Children ’s Medical Center in Memphis , Tennessee and Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis , the CDC said .
Last week , the center said the first doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine would arrive on Tuesday .
The first vaccines to administered will be AstraZeneca unit MedImmune ’s nasal spray .
The U.S. government has ordered about 250 million doses from five companies -- Sanofi- Aventis SA , CSL Ltd MedImmune , Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline .
MedImmune had especially good production of the H1N1 vaccine and has been the first to make doses available .
The vaccines will trickle in at a rate of about 20 million doses a week , and officials are unsure how many Americans will actually get them .
The U.S. government is providing them for free ,
but clinics and retailers may charge to administer them .
The picture is further complicated by seasonal flu vaccination , which started last month .
Pandemic H1N1 has been circulating since it was first identified in two U.S. children last March but it has picked up speed since schools returned from their summer break in August .
The CDC said it is not especially deadly , but it is affecting younger people than seasonal flu usually does and at a time of year when there is generally little or no influenza .
Dozens of children and at least 28 pregnant women in the United States have died from the virus and at least 100 pregnant women were sick enough with it to be hospitalized , the CDC said .
Pregnant women , healthcare workers and people with special health conditions including heart disease and diabetes are supposed to be the first to get the vaccine .
Pressed for comment by NBC , President Obama says that Fox News is essentially a TV version of a talk radio station .
I think this is just the right approach .
Obviously , Fox is very successful and has a big audience .
And I do n’t think the Obama administration should refuse to appear on Fox News , something I very much doubt they ’d do .
But it would not be honest to pretend the Fox is a real news organization in the sense that the other network news divisions or cable outlets are .
I ’ve always noticed that Fox is the biggest on getting people who come on for interviews to give mini-Fox testimonials .
How Fox is fair - and - balanced or the most cutting edge news organization out there or various nonsense like that .
And if I ’m not mistaken what that dingbat Liz Cheney ’s beef is is that President Obama and members of his administration wo n’t do those promos for Fox .
“ Congratulations to Fox , a great news organization in the grand tradition ! ” and so forth .
Fox is not just not a conventional news organization like ABC News or the New York Times .
It ’s not even a legit opinion journalism outfit , as many other have noted over the last few days .
Pretending otherwise is no better than pretending your cousin does n’t have that drinking problem everyone in the family knows she has or telling people Corleone family businesses are all legit .
Come to think of it , the really apt analogy is professional wrestling .
It ’s entertainment .
Lots of people like it .
And to each his own .
But it ’s not right to pretend it ’s a real sporting event , is it ?
It ’s just not right .

The US Air Force Research Lab recently put out a request for 2200 Sony PlayStation 3 games consoles .
The military researchers want to wired them up with the 300 or so they already have to make a type of supercomputer never seen before .
But it wo n’t be the ultimate gaming system to teach pilots how to blast enemies out of the sky .
Instead it will analyse radar and simulate the workings of brains .
The consoles are desirable because of the unique abilities of the chip at their heart .
Jointly designed by Sony , Toshiba and IBM , the Cell chip is designed for the speedy and efficient graphics processing that gaming requires , as well as for number crunching .

Big iron
The supercomputer that was until last month the world ’s fastest , Roadrunner , was built by IBM using 12,000 Cell chips .
But to get world - beating performance , those chips were combined with 6000 extra processors typically used in servers , 113.91 terabytes ( more than 100,000 gigabytes ) of storage and high - speed data links , which put the total cost at $ 120 million .
The air force , by contrast , wo n’t be starting with the high - performance versions of Cell chips used in Roadrunner .
Instead it will simply line up its thousands of complete PS3s on racks and connect them via the standard Ethernet ports .
“ Our interest was to see what we could get on a much more limited budget , ” says Richard Linderman , senior scientist for advanced computing architecture at the air force lab in Rome , New York .
Since April 2008 the lab has been testing an array of 336 PlayStations that cost $ 360,000 in total .
“ The best feature was a low price – $ 400 per unit – which has since dropped to $ 300 , ” Linderman says .
The not - so - good features were hardware limitations , such as the chips having only 256 megabytes of random - access memory built on , and a data - transfer rate just 1/10th that of Roadrunner .
Go slow
Without modification , the PlayStations can also only perform calculations using numbers encoded using 32 bits , rather than the more accurate 64 - bit operations of Roadrunner .
But although unsuited to the simulations of climate or nuclear weapons that are usual for the largest supercomputers , the new machine will have other uses .
The trial PS3 cluster excelled at image enhancement , processing high - definition video and analysing radar signals , says Linderman .
It ’s also well - suited for air force studies of large - scale “ neuromorphic ” processing that simulates the working of the human brain .
The new cluster , bigger than any assembled before , will also be able to run at full power in “ interactive mode ” , meaning a user can give it new instructions while it is still at work in response to its results so far , just as we interact with a desktop computer .
In contrast , supercomputers typically run in “ batch mode ” and must complete the task they are set without interruption .
Cheap power
Linderman says the completed network should offer one - fifth of Roadrunner ’s computing power for 1/60th the price – just $ 2 million .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist Charles Leiserson , not involved with the project , says the approach makes sense .
Wherever possible , “ build your system around commodity components ” , he says .
The cluster should handle jobs such as image processing well because they can be broken down into independent parts , avoiding the data bottleneck of the standard network links between consoles , he says .
“ It could be a very cost - effective way of solving those problems , ” he told New Scientist .

So if you ’re American you ’re probably eating Thanksgiving this Thursday with your close friends and family .
And you ’re probably pretty certain you can recognize your siblings right ?
But what makes you so certain they are genetically connected to you ?
" We take it for granted how we know who are mother is , how we know who our father is , how we know who our brothers and sisters , aunts and uncles , cousins , etc . "
That 's David Lewis a PhD student in psychology at the University of Texas at Austin .
And he recently completed a study specific to sibling recognition .
Evolutionary psychologists point to these two things to tell if you and your sibling share the same mom : witnessing your sibling having a maternal perinatal association otherwise known as “ breastfeeding . ”
" So if you 're an older sibling , watching a younger individual nurse from your mother is a very reliable cue to being siblings with that individual because in mammals , mothers have 100 percent maternity certainty .
That is to say that aside from modern inventions with surrogate mothers , mothers are 100 percent certain that the thing that they give birth to is their biological offspring . "
And the other variable is length of co-habitation with your sibling and mother .
But sibling recognition also requires a known shared paternal connection .
" But there 's a problem in mammals .
And that is that for fathers they cannot be 100 percent certain that their mates ' offspring are their genetic progeny .
Unless they did a DNA test .
But unfortunately during the course of human evolution they did n't have those handy DNA tests . "
So if fathers cannot be certain that their offspring are theirs then siblings cannot be certain they share the same father .
Lewis wanted to find out if facial resemblance could be a cue to genetic relatedness .
Meaning that the more siblings resembled each other , the more certain they could be that they shared mom and pop genes , and so also more likely to have a close relationship .
( Since past psychological studies have shown that blood is often thicker than water . )
He found that indeed the more closely siblings resembled each other ( based on a third party rating ) the more emotionally close they were and the less conflict between them .
" They 'll do more favors for each other .
They 'll interact positively more frequently with one another .
In hypothetical situations there is this idea that this individual is my best friend , I 'll tell them a secret when I wo n't tell anyone else .
Those are the individuals that they are sharing with .
And the siblings that do n't look like them precisely the opposite set of patterns . "
But ultimately then this concludes that ... " facial resemblance is an indicator of kinship even when we believe we already have the kinship problem solved .
And we 're totally unconscious of it . "

Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling has said government borrowing is the best way to support the UK economy in the long run .
The chancellor admitted that borrowing " may feel counter - intuitive " , but said in the longer run , it " will mean the bills we face as a country are lower " .
There are concerns that government debt levels are too high and that tax rises and public spending cuts are needed .
Government borrowing has increased significantly during the recession .
In a question - and - answer session after the speech , Mr Darling said he agreed with the Bank of England Governor Mervyn King in saying there were " no simple answers " to reforming big banks .
Mr King said on Tuesday that some banks might have to split their core business from riskier practices , so they did not get too big to be allowed to fail .
Mr Darling said : " We cannot have a regulatory regime that excludes the possibility of failure . "
He also said that more competition was needed in the banking sector , and that the government would be actively encouraging a greater competition when it sold its stakes in the banks it was forced to bail out during the financial crisis .
Government support Referring to calls to cut back on borrowing and spending , Mr Darling said ending government support now would be " wrong and dangerous " .
He said the country faced a choice .
" We can resign ourselves to a decade of austerity , low growth and low employment , " he said in a speech in London .
" Or we can embrace change , turn it to our advantage and seize the huge opportunities a global recovery will bring . "
He added that withdrawing government support to the economy " would put the recovery at risk and abandon people facing unemployment " .
The government has pumped billions of pounds into the economy to try to stimulate demand during the recession , both directly through its £ 175 bn quantitative easing programme , and indirectly by propping up banks and cutting VAT .
Planning for growth But Mr Darling said there was still much work to be done .
He outlined three main steps that need to be taken .
" First , we must support the economy until we 're sure the recession is over .
Some are tempted to think the crisis is over .
It 's not .
Banks all over the world are still dependent on government support . "
Second , the chancellor said the country must rebuild its financial strength by raising taxes and making " tough choices on public spending for the years ahead " .
" That will mean cutting costs , cutting waste and cutting lower priority budgets , while continuing to invest in our priorities and our future , " he said .
Finally , he said the government needed to plan for growth .
" Not only is growth the best way of creating jobs and increasing prosperity - it is also the best way to earn the money to pay down debt .
" We need growth , because when we grow , the economy becomes bigger , we all become richer as a country , and it gets easier to pay back debt . "

RIYADH , Saudi Arabia  Iranian officials claimed Monday that they had evidence of American and British involvement in the country ’s worst suicide bombing attacks in years , raising tensions as Iran meets with Western nations for another round of delicate talks on its nuclear program .
At least five commanders of Iran ’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were killed and dozens of other people were left dead and wounded on Sunday in two bombings in the restive southeast along Iran ’s frontier with Pakistan , according to Iranian state news agencies .
The coordinated strike , one of the largest against the Guards in the region , appeared to mark an escalation in hostilities between Iran ’s leadership and the Baluchi ethnic minority .
Iranian officials accused foreign enemies of supporting the insurgents , singling out the intelligence agencies of United States , Britain and Pakistan .
Mohammad Ali Jafari , the Guards ’ commander in chief , told the semiofficial ISNA agency on Monday : “ Behind this scene are the American and British intelligence apparatus , and there will have to be retaliatory measures to punish them , ” adding that Iran had documents proving their and Pakistani involvement .
Mike Pence ( R - IN ) , along with a group of rogue congressmen , is planning to go to Copenhagen to " derail Democratic efforts to negotiate an international climate agreement " -- basically , the Party of No is going international .
And according to Mr. Pence :
President Barack Obama ,
Pence added , should refrain from negotiating treaties " in the absence of a national consensus . "
... which is an interesting interpretation of Article II on the Constitution , which say of presidential powers :
He shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ;
Checking , double - checking , and even triple - checking .
Nope .
Does n't say a thing about seeking a national consensus as defined by what a right - wing , obstructionist congressman from Indiana says .

Fanciful science fiction and space art frequently depict the lovely visage of a twin sunset where a pair of binary stars dips below the horizon ( think Star Wars ) .
While it has been established that planets could exist in such a system by orbiting in resonances , that only holds true for fully formed planets .
Can forming star systems even support an accretion disk from which to form planets ?
This is the question a new paper by M. G. Petr - Gotzens and S. Daemgen of the European Southern Observatory with S Correia from the Astronomiches Institut Potsdam attempts to answer .
Observations of single young stars with disks have revealed that the main force causing the dispersion of the disk is the star itself .
The stellar wind and radiation pressure blow the disk away within 6 to 10 million years .
Predictably , more massive and hotter stars will disperse their disks more quickly .
However , “ many stars are members of a binary or multiple system , and for nearby solar - like stars the binary fraction is even as high as ~ 60 % . ”
Could gravitational perturbations or the added intensity from two stars strip disks before planets could form ?
To explore this , the team observed 22 young and forming binary star systems in the Orion Nebula to look for signs of disks .
They used two primary methods :
The first was to look for excess emission in the near infrared .
This would trace accretion disks as they radiate away absorbed energy as heat .
The second was to look spectroscopically for specific bromine emission that is excited as the magnetic field of the young star pulls this ( and other ) elements from the disk onto the stars surface .
When the results were analyzed they found that as much as 80 % of the binary systems had an active accretion disk .
Many only contained a disk around the primary star although nearly as many contained disks around both stars .
Only one system had evidence of an accretion disk around only the secondary ( lower mass ) star .
They authors note , “ [t ] he under - representation of active accretion
disks among secondaries hints at disk dissipation working faster on ( potentially ) lower mass secondaries , leading us to speculate that secondaries are possibly less likely to form planets . ”
However , the average age of the stars observed was only ~1 million years .
This means that , even though disks may be able to form , the study was not comprehensive enough to determine whether or not they would last .
Yet a survey of the currently known extra-solar planets reveal that they must .
The authors comment , “ [ a ] lmost 40 of all the extra - solar planets discovered to date reside in wide binary systems where the component separation is larger than 100AU ( large enough that planet formation around one star should not strongly be inuenced [ sic ] by the companion star ) . ”
Strangely , this seems to stand at odds with a 2007 paper by Trilling et al .
which studied other binary systems for the same IR excess indicative of debris disks .
In their study , they determined “ [ a ] very large fraction ( nearly 60 % ) of observed binary systems
with small ( < 3 AU ) separations have excess thermal emission . ”
This suggests that such close systems may indeed be able to retain disks for some time .
It is unclear on whether or not it can be retained long enough to form planets although it seems unlikely since no exoplanets are known around close binaries .
Chapter 12
A Brief Journey Through Hacker Hell
The two of us are headed to the nearby town of Pa'ia , where we are scheduled to meet up with some software programmers and their wives for dinner in about an hour or so .
It 's about two hours after Stallman 's speech at the Maui High Performance Center , and Kihei , a town that seemed so inviting before the speech , now seems profoundly uncooperative .
Like most beach cities , Kihei is a one - dimensional exercise in suburban sprawl .
Driving down its main drag , with its endless succession of burger stands , realty agencies , and bikini shops , it 's hard not to feel like a steel - coated morsel passing through the alimentary canal of a giant commercial tapeworm .
The feeling is exacerbated by the lack of side roads .
With nowhere to go but forward , traffic moves in spring - like lurches .
200 yards ahead , a light turns green .
By the time we are moving , the light is yellow again .
For Stallman , a lifetime resident of the east coast , the prospect of spending the better part of a sunny Hawaiian afternoon trapped in slow traffic is enough to trigger an embolism .
Even worse is the knowledge that , with just a few quick right turns a quarter mile back , this whole situation easily could have been avoided .
Unfortunately , we are at the mercy of the driver ahead of us , a programmer from the lab who knows the way and who has decided to take us to Pa'ia via the scenic route instead of via the nearby Pilani Highway .
" This is terrible , " says Stallman between frustrated sighs .
" Why did n't we take the other route ? "
Again , the light a quarter mile ahead of us turns green .
Again , we creep forward a few more car lengths .
This process continues for another 10 minutes , until we finally reach a major crossroad promising access to the adjacent highway .
The driver ahead of us ignores it and continues through the intersection .
" Why is n't he turning ? " moans Stallman , throwing up his hands in frustration .
" Can you believe this ? "
I decide not to answer either .
I find the fact that I am sitting in a car with Stallman in the driver seat , in Maui no less , unbelievable enough .
Until two hours ago , I did n't even know Stallman knew how to drive .
Now , listening to Yo - Yo Ma 's cello playing the mournful bass notes of " Appalachian Journey " on the car stereo and watching the sunset pass by on our left , I do my best to fade into the upholstery .
When the next opportunity to turn finally comes up , Stallman hits his right turn signal in an attempt to cue the driver ahead of us .
No such luck .
Once again , we creep slowly through the intersection , coming to a stop a good 200 yards before the next light .
By now , Stallman is livid .
" It 's like he 's deliberately ignoring us , " he says , gesturing and pantomiming like an air craft carrier landing - signals officer in a futile attempt to catch our guide 's eye .
The guide appears unfazed , and for the next five minutes all we see is a small portion of his head in the rearview mirror .
I look out Stallman 's window .
Nearby Kahoolawe and Lanai Islands provide an ideal frame for the setting sun .
It 's a breathtaking view , the kind that makes moments like this a bit more bearable if you 're a Hawaiian native , I suppose .
I try to direct Stallman 's attention to it , but Stallman , by now obsessed by the inattentiveness of the driver ahead of us , blows me off .
When the driver passes through another green light , completely ignoring a " Pilani Highway Next Right , " I grit my teeth .
I remember an early warning relayed to me by BSD programmer Keith Bostic .
" Stallman does not suffer fools gladly , " Bostic warned me .
" If somebody says or does something stupid , he 'll look them in the eye and say , ` That 's stupid . ' "
Looking at the oblivious driver ahead of us , I realize that it 's the stupidity , not the inconvenience , that 's killing Stallman right now .
" It 's as if he picked this route with absolutely no thought on how to get there efficiently , " Stallman says .
The word " efficiently " hangs in the air like a bad odor .
Few things irritate the hacker mind more than inefficiency .
It was the inefficiency of checking the Xerox laser printer two or three times a day that triggered Stallman 's initial inquiry into the printer source code .
It was the inefficiency of rewriting software tools hijacked by commercial software vendors that led Stallman to battle Symbolics and to launch the GNU Project .
If , as Jean Paul Sartre once opined , hell is other people , hacker hell is duplicating other people 's stupid mistakes , and it's no exaggeration to say that Stallman 's entire life has been an attempt to save mankind from these fiery depths .
This hell metaphor becomes all the more apparent as we take in the slowly passing scenery .
With its multitude of shops , parking lots , and poorly timed street lights , Kihei seems less like a city and more like a poorly designed software program writ large .
Instead of rerouting traffic and distributing vehicles through side streets and expressways , city planners have elected to run everything through a single main drag .
From a hacker perspective , sitting in a car amidst all this mess is like listening to a CD rendition of nails on a chalkboard at full volume .
" Imperfect systems infuriate hackers , " observes Steven Levy , another warning I should have listened to before climbing into the car with Stallman .
" This is one reason why hackers generally hate driving cars - the system of randomly programmed red lights and oddly laid out one - way streets causes delays which are so goddamn unnecessary [ Levy 's emphasis ] that the impulse is to rearrange signs , open up traffic - light control boxes . . . redesign the entire system . "
1
More frustrating , however , is the duplicity of our trusted guide .
Instead of searching out a clever shortcut - as any true hacker would do on instinct - the driver ahead of us has instead chosen to play along with the city planners ' game .
Like Virgil in Dante 's Inferno , our guide is determined to give us the full guided tour of this hacker hell whether we want it or not .
Before I can make this observation to Stallman , the driver finally hits his right turn signal .
Stallman 's hunched shoulders relax slightly , and for a moment the air of tension within the car dissipates .
The tension comes back , however , as the driver in front of us slows down .
" Construction Ahead " signs line both sides of the street , and even though the Pilani Highway lies less than a quarter mile off in the distance , the two - lane road between us and the highway is blocked by a dormant bulldozer and two large mounds of dirt .
It takes Stallman a few seconds to register what 's going on as our guide begins executing a clumsy five - point U - turn in front of us .
When he catches a glimpse of the bulldozer and the " No Through Access " signs just beyond , Stallman finally boils over .
" Why , why , why ? " he whines , throwing his head back .
" You should have known the road was blocked .
You should have known this way would n't work .
You did this deliberately . "
The driver finishes the turn and passes us on the way back toward the main drag .
As he does so , he shakes his head and gives us an apologetic shrug .
Coupled with a toothy grin , the driver 's gesture reveals a touch of mainlander frustration but is tempered with a protective dose of islander fatalism .
Coming through the sealed windows of our rental car , it spells out a succinct message : " Hey , it 's Maui ; what are you gonna do ? "
Stallman can take it no longer .
" Do n't you fucking smile ! " he shouts , fogging up the glass as he does so .
" It 's your fucking fault .
This all could have been so much easier if we had just done it my way . "
Stallman accents the words " my way " by gripping the steering wheel and pulling himself towards it twice .
The image of Stallman 's lurching frame is like that of a child throwing a temper tantrum in a car seat , an image further underlined by the tone of Stallman 's voice .
Halfway between anger and anguish , Stallman seems to be on the verge of tears .
Fortunately , the tears do not arrive .
Like a summer cloudburst , the tantrum ends almost as soon as it begins .
After a few whiny gasps , Stallman shifts the car into reverse and begins executing his own U - turn .
By the time we are back on the main drag , his face is as impassive as it was when we left the hotel 30 minutes earlier .
It takes less than five minutes to reach the next cross-street .
This one offers easy highway access , and within seconds , we are soon speeding off toward Pa'ia at a relaxing rate of speed .
The sun that once loomed bright and yellow over Stallman 's left shoulder is now burning a cool orange - red in our rearview mirror .
It lends its color to the gauntlet wili wili trees flying past us on both sides of the highway .
For the next 20 minutes , the only sound in our vehicle , aside from the ambient hum of the car 's engine and tires , is the sound of a cello and a violin trio playing the mournful strains of an Appalachian folk tune .

Disinfectant could teach bacteria methods of resistance Disinfectants could effectively train bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics , research suggests .
Scientists know bacteria can become inured to disinfectant , but research increasingly shows the same process may make them resistant to certain drugs .
This can occur even with an antibiotic the bacteria have not been exposed to .
Writing in Microbiology , the National University of Ireland team , who focused on a common hospital bacterium , urges a rethink of how infections are managed .
Scientists in Galway found that by adding increasing amounts of disinfectant to cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lab , the bacteria learnt to resist not only the disinfectant but also ciprofloxacin - a commonly - prescribed antibiotic - even without being exposed to it .
The researchers report the bacteria had adapted to pump out anti-microbial agents - be they a disinfectant or an antibiotic - from their cells .
The adapted bacteria also had a mutation in their DNA that allowed them to resist ciprofloxacin - type antibiotics specifically .
Residue from incorrectly diluted disinfectants left on hospital surfaces could promote the growth of antibiotic - resistant bacteria
Dr Gerard Fleming Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium most likely to infect those who are already seriously ill .
It can cause a wide range of infections , particularly among those with weak immune systems such as HIV or cancer patients , as well as people with severe burns , diabetes or cystic fibrosis .
Surface disinfectants are used to prevent its spread - but if the bacteria manage to survive and go on to infect patients , antibiotics are used to treat them .
Bacteria that could resist both these control points could be a serious threat to hospital patients , the study said .
At the high concentration levels generally employed this was unlikely to be a problem - but " in principle this means that residue from incorrectly diluted disinfectants left on hospital surfaces could promote the growth of antibiotic - resistant bacteria " , said study author Dr Gerard Fleming .
" What is more worrying is that bacteria seem to be able to adapt to resist antibiotics without even being exposed to them . "
Disinfectants may not just be the problem , they may also be the cure
Dr Gerry McDonnell
There is an increasing body of research that raises concerns about the effects on antibiotic resistance of disinfectants and antiseptics .
An EU report published earlier this year stressed the importance of the " appropriate and prudent " use of disinfectants to minimise the risk that bacteria become resistant to both forms of defence .
It also emerged this year that treatments in hospitals in Brazil had been compromised by a bacterium , mycobacterium massiliense , which had developed resistance to a common sterilisation fluid and a number of antibiotics used to treat the subsequent infections .
" This was very significant because it was really the first incident related to resistance to a biocide which led to clinical failure , which is new , " said Dr Gerry McDonnell , a researcher in the field .
" This really needs to be an area of active investigation and debate .
But it 's worth bearing in mind that disinfectants may not just be the problem , they may also be the cure . "
Research was published this year showing that the disinfecting wipes used to protect against MRSA could in fact spread the bug , as the solution contained was often not sufficient to kill all the bacteria picked up , and hospital staff often used the same wipe to clean more than one surface .

IGN - owned digital game distributor Direct2 Drive announced today it 's refusing to sell Activision ' son PC , protesting the game 's integration with Valve 's Steamworks .
"
We do n't believe games should force the user to install a Trojan Horse , " said the company -- referring to Steam , in a statement explaining its decision .
The company says its beef is not with publisher Activision -- in fact , will offer a $ 5 coupon off of some of the Activision titles it sells as a compensation to its users .
Direct2 Drive instead opposes 's Steamworks integration -- as an online storefront for digital download games , it competes directly with Valve 's Steam service in some areas .
In the highest - profile endorsement of Valve 's digital tools to date , Infinity Ward will use the Steam client to update , support and authenticate the game .
The company says it told publisher partners earlier in the year that it would not sell titles that use Steam as a workaround for DRM , as it opposes the bundling of a storefront with a functionally free technology .
is considered by many measurement systems to be the holiday season 's most anticipated title , and Activision has boldly stated it expects the " biggest entertainment launch of all time " for the game .
Retailer GameStop agrees , having seen more preorders for the game than it 's ever registered , and expecting the game to see the biggest launch in its history All PC copies ofwill ship with Steamworks support -- not just those sold on Steam itself .
Beyond the Steamworks features themselves , one possible secondary benefit of that move means all copies of the game will be automatically updated the same way with the same patches .
Gamasutra has contacted Valve for comment on this story and will update with any we receive . :
Other major digital download sites have also joined this boycott , with GamersGate also not stockingon PC , and Stardock - owned Impulse confirming to website VE3D : " We share some of the same concerns as Direct2 Drive over the bundling of the Steam client with the game .
The most obvious issue is the forced inclusion of a competitor 's store that blocks us from carrying the game . " ]

Relentless Software ’s Blue Toad Murder Files is a game which dares to try out an episodic structure , with different episodes set to be released consistently until all six are available on the store .
This strategy failed to win over most gamers in Siren : Blood Curse and caused problems with the game ’s length and plot , but can this light - hearted murder mystery title prove that the method can be successful , or does the game fail to break the mold ?
You play as one of four characters from the Blue Toad Detective Agency who arrive at the quintessentially English village of Little Riddle , only to be confronted by a series of dastardly deeds that plague the populace .
Immediately , you set about solving the first murder , and throughout Episode 1 you are given a cast of plausible suspects , as well as clues to the identity of the killer .
To learn who the murderer is , you must question several stereotypically English townsfolk , from the snobbish hotel manager to the reassuringly clichéd “ h’officer ” of the law .
The process of interrogation is rather linear , with no choice or control available to the player , but this seems natural to the game , which styles itself like an episode of Poirot , and feels much like reading an Agatha Christe novel .
The voice acting for the game is superb ; the characters are wonderfully brought to life , with each given a unique personality .
Especially the narrator , who ’s passionate voice gives a touch of humor to the generally boring aspects of games , such as menu navigation , while simultaneously managing to capture the manner of the Murder Mystery Radio dramas that dominated the first half of the 20th century .
What is even more remarkable is that all the voice acting in the game is done by by one man , Tom Dussek , without any of the characters sounding the same .
While talking to the villagers you are tasked with puzzles and mini games of varying difficulty that tax the mind , but not your enjoyment .
Solving the puzzles , which can be anything from math riddles to logical or verbal reasoning , can be rather difficult , but not so much as to frustrate the player , as most should be able to solve the puzzles given enough time .
Fortunately , if there is an enigma which you just can’t crack , this does n’t spell the end for your gaming session , as there is the option to ‘ Give Up ’ , which allows you to continue , at the expense of any points .
Points are given out depending on how fast you manage to find the solution , as well as how many times you make a mistake , with the reward being a gold , silver or bronze medal ( unless you give up , and get nothing ) , all of which are then tallied up at the end and compared to your rival players .
James Joyner argues against a civilian trial for KSM :
[ T] hese men are not citizens of the United States .
Second , they ’re accused war criminals .
They simply should not be tried in U.S. civilian courts .
Rather , they should either be held accountable in a Nuremberg - style international forum or treated as war criminals by a U.S. military tribunal under the mechanisms provided by Congress and approved by the Supreme Court .
Aside from the virtual certainty that the trial will devolve into a media circus , there ’s an incredibly good chance that Mohammed and his comrades will go free .
The fact that KSM was repeatedly waterboarded would seem to taint any subsequent evidence , including his own confession .
I think it 's a potentially brilliant move .
I do not believe for one moment that this case was brought in a civilian court without sufficient evidence to convict KSM of criminality to put him away for good .
But what an open civilian case will also do - and it's why a war criminal like John Yoo is so apoplectic - is reveal the extent to which the brutal torture of KSM was unnecessary , and led to the government 's inability to prosecute him to the full extent of the law .
It will be a civic lesson to America and the world .
It will show the evil of terrorism and the futility and danger of torture .
It will be a way in which Cheney 's torture regime can be revealed in all its grotesque excess at the same time as KSM 's vile religious extremism is exposed for its murderous nihilism .
That all this will take place in New York - close to where the mass murder took place - is a particularly smart touch .
This will , then , be a Nuremberg - style event - because it will pit Qaeda barbarism against the cooling , calm and resolute nature of real Western justice in the clear light of history .
But it does one more critical thing .
It reveals a new confidence in ourselves and the Western way of life .
NRK ble i morgentimene nedringt av forskrekkede folk fra hele Nord - Norge , som hadde sett et merkelig lysfenomen på østhimmelen .
– Det var som en stor ildkule som gikk rundt , med et stort lys rundt det igjen , sier Fred Hansen fra Bø i Vesterålen .
Morten Kristiansen fra Ånstad på Sortland fikk tatt bilde av fenomenet i retning nordøst mot Hongfjorden .
– Klokka 07.45 i dag opplevde jeg et meget underlig fenomen på himmelen , en stor ring kom fram , som så bredte seg ut , og den sendte en grønn stråle ned mot jorden , hva kan det være ?
Åge Edvardsen om lysfenomen .
Programleder i morgensendingen hos NRK Troms , Karen Marie Berg , snakker med Åge Edvardsen , som så fenomenet .
Fred Hansen fra Bø i Vesterålen var på vei til jobb , da han oppdaget lysfenomenet på himmelen .
Da stoppet han bilen .
– Jeg stirret på det i omtrent to minutter , så kjørte jeg videre .
Men så måtte jeg stoppe igjen , og da så jeg på lyset i rundt ett minutt , sier han .

– Missil fra en russisk ubåt
Romfartsekspert Erik Tandberg ved Norsk Romsenter sier at det trolig dreier seg om en russisk rakett skutt opp fra Kvitsjøen .
Romekspert Erik Tandberg Foto : NRK
– En mulig meldig fra russiske militære om at det skulle foretas prøveoppskytning fra en russisk undervannsbåt i Kvitsjøen , kan det være en forklaring .
Kvitsjøen eller Hvitehavet er en stor innbuktning av Nordishavet i det nordvestlige Russland , sør for Barentshavet .
Tandberg mener det kan ha skjedd en feil med det militære rakettvåpenet .
– Det kan da enten skjedd en feil slik at de har måttet ødelegge den , slik at den ikke skulle gjøre skade .
Eller så har det oppstått en feil ved selve missilet , slik at et trinn har blitt løsrevet fra resten , og har fortsatt i en ukontrollert bane på egen hånd , sier Tandberg .
Han får støtte fra seniorrådgiver Pål Brekke i Norsk Romsenter .
– Oppskytingen var varslet på forhånd .
En melding på et nettsted for radioamatører referer til et varsel om forbud om å navigere ved Kvitsjøen i det aktuelle tidsrommet , sier Brekke til NRK .
Russerne : – Ingen oppskyting
Den russiske Nordflåten hevder imidlertid at det ikke har vært skutt opp noen ballistisk rakett de siste dagene .
Ifølge internasjonal avtale har landene plikt til å informere om slike oppskytinger .
– Gigantisk fyrverkeri
Hva er dette ?
Blått lysfenomen på himmelen .
Foto : Morten Kristiansen
Lyset ble observert både i Nord - Trøndelag , Nordland , Troms og Finnmark .
I Hamarøy i Nordland ble Trond Lødding vitne til lyset .
– Det var noe som sirkulerte rundt mot klokka , og ga fra seg lys .
Og i dette lysfenomenet ble det 10 - 12 ringer , og det virket som om det kom nærmere og nærmere .
Og bak dette var det som en neonblå aura som så ut som det kom i fartsretningen , sier Lødding .
Lødding forteller at han så fenomenet i et par minutter , før lyset i midten slokket .
– Da var det som om det ble en svak gigantsol som bare ble større og større .
Og så forsvant det .
Det var en pussig greie , sier han .
– Hva tenkte du da du så dette ?
– Nei , jeg lurte jo på hva dette var for noe .
For jeg har jo sett både meteorittstormer og andre himmellegemer , men dette har jeg ikke sett før .
Det så ut som en sånn gigantisk fyrverkerisak som vi hadde før i tida , som vi spikret på en påle .
Lyset gikk rundt og rundt , men det sprutet ikke .
Forsvaret undersøker
Lysfenomenet sett fra Dverberg .

Pressetalsmann ved forsvarets fellesoperative hovedkvarter John Espen Lien på Reitan i Bodø sier de har registrert lysfenomenet .
– For oss vil selvfølgelig en slik rakettutskyting være noe vil legger merke til .
Så vil vi analysere og bruke de analysene til vår egen forståelse .
Det ligger i sakens natur at en del av de tingene vi analyserer ikke vil bli offentliggjort .
I forrige måned ble et annet mystisk lys observert over Nord - Norge .
Da viste det seg at det var en rakettoppskyting fra Barentshavet .
Truls Lynne Hansen ved Nordlysobservatoriet i Tromsø sier også at det dreier seg om en rakett som ble skutt opp fra Kvitsjøen i Russland .
– Raketten har trolig kommet ut av kontroll og eksplodert .
Det spesielle spiralformede lysmønsteret kommer av at sola skinte på drivstoffet som lekket ut , sier Hansen .

A common line of argument in this field is to suggest that sexual preferences for certain body types exist because we ’ve evolved these desires to maximise our chances of mating with the most fertile or healthiest partner .
For example , studies have interpreted the fact that taller men are more likely to attract mates and reproduce in terms of evolutionary pressures on sexual desire .
But most of these and similar studies have been completed on Western samples , while the authors draw conclusions about the ‘ universal ’ nature of these ‘ evolutionary ’ pressures .
To test how universal these body preferences really are , anthropologists Rebecca Sear and Frank Marlowe looked at whether similar preferences existed in the Hadza people , a hunter - gather tribe from Tanzania .
It turns out , these supposedly ‘ universal preferences ’ do n’t exist in the Hadza .
You can read the full text of the paper online as a pdf , but this is taken from the Science News write - up :
Hadza marriages do n’t tend to consist of individuals with similar heights , weights , body mass indexes , body - fat percentages or grip strengths …
Neither do Hadza couples feature a disproportionate percentage of husbands taller than their wives , as has been documented in some Western nations , the researchers report in the Oct. 23 Biology Letters .
Almost no Hadza individuals mention height or size when asked to explain what makes for an attractive mate , Sear and Marlowe add .
People everywhere seek healthy , fertile marriage partners , Sear proposes .
“ But I suspect there may not be a preference for one particular signal of health in mates across every population , ” she says … .
Sear and Marlowe criticize evolutionary psychologists who have argued that physical size influences mating decisions in all societies .
That argument rests largely on self - reports of Western college students and analyses of personal advertisements in U.S. newspapers for dating partners , they say .
The problems with relying on Western college students as participants in psychology studies is also addressed by a new paper just released by Behavioural and Brain Sciences which you can read online as a pdf .
The article reviews data from psychology experiments and argues that not only are college students a very restricted subset of society , but they are actually wildly atypical in comparison to the rest of the world ’s population .
In fact , the authors state that “ The findings suggest that members of WEIRD [ Western , Educated , Industrialized , Rich and Democratic ] societies , including young children , are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans ” .

The observer code pattern refers to many observers being notified of a change in state of a particular variable , typically by use of callbacks or similar .
For example , many objects in a GUI might register as observers of the colour scheme setting , and would then be notified by a callback if the user changed their preferred colours , so that they could then redraw themselves in the new colour .
Recently , an implementation of the observer pattern was discussed on haskell - cafe .
A lot of the OO implementations ( and the initial haskell - cafe offering ) are sequential , meaning that the observers are notified in a sequential fashion ( and typically execute their code in the thread that does the notification ) , which goes against the concurrent approach of this blog .
The observer pattern is very easy to capture in CHP .
There are actually several implementations —
I will discuss the slightly lengthier process - based approach in this post , and show a simpler version next time .
Our observer pattern here is implemented in a process .
The process has two channels : one to receive new values when the state changes , and one to receive new observer actions ( to be run when the state changes ) .
For simplicity , I am not concerned with removing observers in this version .
For our observer actions , we can use the SendAction type from the Control .
Concurrent .CHP
.
Actions module in the CHP library .
Something of type SendAction a is like having type a -> CHP ( ) ( i.e. it performs a CHP action when given something of type a ) , but it also contains information about how to poison the action .
So the outside of our observer process looks like this :
observer :: forall a . Chanin a -> Chanin ( SendAction a ) -> CHP ( ) observer newValIn newObsIn = observer ' [ ] where observer ' :: [ SendAction a ] -> CHP ()
The first channel takes in the new values , the second channel takes in the new observers .
Note that we have no outgoing channels in this process initially — they will be passed in by sending SendActions .
This process delegates to an inner process ( a common idiom in CHP ) that takes the current list of actions as its argument :
observer ' acts = ( ( newVal <-> newObs ) `onPoisonRethrow` ( do poison newValIn poison newObsIn poisonAll acts ) ) >>= observer '
The inner process offers a choice between receiving a new value ( newVal ) , or receiving a new observer ( new Obs ) .
If poison occurs , the two input channels are poisoned and all the observers are poisoned .
newVal and newObs both return the new list of observers , which are then fed into a recursive call .
They are defined as follows :
where newVal = do x <- readChannel newValIn runParallel_ [ sendAction a x | a <- acts ] return acts newObs = do a <- readChannel newObs
In return ( a : acts )
newVal reads in a new value , and in parallel it runs the current list of observer actions ( which are then returned unaltered ) .
newObs reads in a new observer and adds it to the list ( the order of the list does n’t matter ) .
That ’s all we need for our observer .
Typically the observer actions are channel - writes , so that the information is passed out of the observer process to whatever other process we want , which then executes the real response to the state change .
Here is some example code for using the observer :
useObserver :: Chanout String -> Chanout ( SendAction String ) -> CHP ( ) useObserver newValOut newObsOut = do --
Send a new value when no observers are registered : writeChannel newValOut
" This will be ignored " -- Create a channel to get the value back on , and register it : obs1 <- oneToOneChannel writeChannel newObsOut ( makeSendAction ( writer obs1 ) ) --
Send in an update , and read the value back from our channel : writeChannel newValOut " First update " readChannel ( reader obs1 ) >>= liftIO .
putStrLn --
Add a second observer : obs2 <- oneToOneChannel writeChannel newObsOut ( makeSendAction ( writer obs2 ) ) --
Now send a few more updates : writeChannel newValOut " Second update ; should be printed twice " readChannel ( reader obs1 ) >>= liftIO .
putStrLn readChannel ( reader obs2 ) >>= liftIO .
putStrLn writeChannel newValOut
" Third update ; should be printed twice " readChannel ( reader obs2 ) >>= liftIO .
putStrLn readChannel ( reader obs1 ) >>= liftIO .
putStrLn --
Finally , shut the network down : poison newValOut >> poison newObsOut main :: IO ( ) main = runCHP_ $ do c <- oneToOneChannel d <- oneToOneChannel useObserver ( writer c ) ( writer d ) < ||> observer ( reader c ) ( reader d )
Our example code is quite artificial — the observer actions will almost certainly come from different processes running in parallel ( and thus the channel reads will be done in parallel ) , but I did n’t want to make the code too large and complex .
Note that we can read the values from the channels in either order , because the sends are done in parallel .
The observer does wait for all the sends to complete before it will offer to receive a new value ; we can fix this using forking , but that can again wait for another post .
One final note : constructing this example revealed a bug in CHP 1.5.0 ; runParallel and runParallel_ were deadlocking when passed an empty list of processes ( rather than instantly returning an empty list of results ) .
This is fixed in CHP 1.5.1 , which I have just uploaded to Hackage .
( With apologies to wherever the original came from . )
As I ’ve mentioned previously , I ’m currently writing a QuickCheck - based test suite for graphviz .
Overall , I ’m quite pleased with QuickCheck , especially since the amount of moaning from people that QuickCheck - 2 ( which I ’m using ) is too different from the version 1.x series .
The monadic usage of Gen for arbitrary means in most cases instances are just a matter of picking the right liftM function with multiple calls to arbitrary .
However , in the course of using it , I ’ve come across some observations / problems with QuickCheck .
Default Instances
Usually , it ’s great to see a library define instances of its own classes for the common data types ( that is , those available from the Prelude , etc. ) .
However , I ’m finding the the default instances of Arbitrary for lists ( and to a lesser but related extent Char s ) a pain .
Specifically , how the shrink method is defined : it not only tries to shrink the size of the list ( which is great ) but also individually shrink each element in the list .
My preferred behaviour ( which I ’ve defined a custom function that my code explicitly calls ) is to just shrink the size of the list , unless it ’s a singleton , in which case try to shrink that value .
The reason the default behaviour is so bad in my case is that I quite often have lists of custom data types , which can individually have lots of other sub - types in them , possibly with lists of their own .
As such , if I used the default shrinking behaviour on lists , this could result in a lot of attempts at shrinking .
Note that this is n’t really a problem of QuickCheck per-se : it ’s great that it defines an Arbitrary instance for lists ; it would be great ( but probably not type - safe , etc. ) if it was possible to override class instances in Haskell .
Why lists anyway ?
One of the problems with the shrinking behaviour of lists is due to the number of appends that occur ; whilst lists are nicer / easier to deal with , using something like Seq from Data .
Sequence might improve performance .
Getting big for its boots
In most of the tests that I ’ve done , the problems that occur are usually in printing and parsing Attribute s.
As such , at the start of my test suite I run a test on lists of Attributes ; to try and ensure that they ’re valid I run 10000 tests rather than the default 100 .
These extra tests , however , come at a price : QuickCheck keeps testing longer and longer lists , which means that each individual test takes longer and longer to run .
I ’d prefer to run even more tests which are individually smaller ( around the mid-point of what gets generated with 10000 tests ) ; as it is , 10000 tests take over half an hour here .
Documentation
Whilst the high - level details are explained rather well , there ’s parts of the QuickCheck documentation that is rather lacking .
First of all , how to use QuickCheck ; I was n’t aware that there was a community standard of starting the names of all properties with prop_ ( though Real World Haskell deals relatively well with how to use QuickCheck ) .
Also , it took me a while to dig through the ( relatively un-documented ) source to work out that a Result of “ GaveUp {...} ” is returned when too many values were discarded .
Keep going
You ’ve found a value that breaks the property ?
Excellent ( well , not in that it ’s great to have a bug , but it ’s great that it was picked up ) !
But ca n’t you please keep going and trying to find more ?
Edit : one of the reasons I would like this behaviour is for when the test is n’t actually a failure per-se , it ’s just a matter of my Arbitrary instances not being strict enough .
For example , if it generates a String value that is actually a number ( e.g. " 1.2 " ) and my data type can be either a Double or a String , then obviously this value should actually be parsed back as a Double ; this though breaks the print .
parse = id property in its most strictest sense .
As such , if quick Check kept going , then I could manually verify whether it is a bug or not and fix it ( so that an arbitrary String is n’t actually a number ) whilst it kept doing the rest of the tests .
Getting results
Related to the previous one : once quick Check has found a data value that breaks a property , the only way of getting that value to manually determine why the property is breaking is to copy / paste it : whilst the output can be redirected , it ’s an all or nothing affair of the entire output rather than just the data value itself .
Even better if the Result data type was parametrised so that it could return the value in its Failure constructor , so that in my code I can manually write it to file using my wrapper script around the QuickCheck tests .
Recursive values
In graphviz , I have a DotGraph data type which contains a DotStatement value ; this contains a list of DotSubGraph values , each of which contains a DotStatement value .
As such , my initial implementation of Arbitrary for these data types resulted in large , deeply recursive structures even for “ small ” sample values ; this resulted in making it almost impossible to track down the source of the problem that resulted in an error .
As such , to solve this I ’ve done the following :
Define an arbDotStatement :: Bool ->
Gen DotStatement function which will only have a non-empty list of sub graphs if the boolean is True .
function which will only have a non-empty list of sub graphs if the boolean is True .
The Arbitrary instance for DotStatement has arbitrary = arbDotStatement True ; that is , an arbitrary DotStatement value can contain DotSubGraphs .
; that is , an arbitrary DotStatement value can contain DotSubGraphs .
The Arbitrary instance for DotSubGraphs uses arbDotStatement False to generate its DotStatement ; that is , a DotSubGraph cannot have any DotSubGraphs of its own .
This results in an Arbitrary instance of any of these data types that wo n’t endlessly recurse and is thus easier to debug .
Brent Yorgey is doing work on testing functions that use recursive data types ; that should also help in the future .
Shrinking
I think the inclusion of shrinking into QuickCheck is great , in how it helps find a minimal common case for a bug .
I ’ve found , however , that for large data types you need to be very careful how you implement the shrink method : I ’ve found it useful to only shrink the sub-values that are most likely to have errors ( that is , the Attributes ) rather than checking every possible shrink of the integral node ID , etc .
How do you have 0.11043 of a shrink ?
With shrinking , however , what does QuickCheck mean when it says something like 0.11043 shrinks ?
Is it trying to say how deeply its shrinking ?
Note that this does n’t seem to be a real floating point number ; it seems to be treated as Int .
Int .

Product
Recall the construction of a cartesian product of two sets : .
We have functions and extracting the two sets from the product , and we can take any two functions and and take them together to form a function .
Similarly , we can form the type of pairs of Haskell types : Pair s t = ( s , t ) .
For the pair type , we have canonical functions fst :: ( s , t ) -> s and snd :: ( s , t ) -> t extracting the components .
And given two functions f :: s -> s ' and g :: t -> t ' , there is a function f *** g :: ( s , t ) -> ( s ' , t ' ) .
An element of the pair is completely determined by the two elements included in it .
Hence , if we have a pair of generalized elements and , we can find a unique generalized element such that the projection arrows on this gives us the original elements back .
This argument indicates to us a possible definition that avoids talking about elements in sets in the first place , and we are lead to the
Definition A product of two objects in a category is an object equipped with arrows such that for any other object with arrows , there is a unique arrow such that the diagram
commutes .
The diagram is called a product cone if it is a diagram of a product with the projection arrows from its definition .
In the category of sets , the unique map is given by .
In the Haskell category , it is given by the combinator ( &&& ) :: ( a -> b ) -> ( a -> c ) -> a -> ( b , c ) .
We tend to talk about the product .
The justification for this lies in the first interesting
Proposition
If and are both products for , then they are isomorphic .
Proof Consider the diagram
Both vertical arrows are given by the product property of the two product cones involved .
Their compositions are endo- arrows of , such that in each case , we get a diagram like
with ( or ) , and .
There is , by the product property , only one endoarrow that can make the diagram work - but both the composition of the two arrows , and the identity arrow itself , make the diagram commute .
Therefore , the composition has to be the identity .
QED .
We can expand the binary product to higher order products easily - instead of pairs of arrows , we have families of arrows , and all the diagrams carry over to the larger case .
Binary functions
Functions into a product help define the product in the first place , and function as elements of the product .
Functions from a product , on the other hand , allow us to put a formalism around the idea of functions of several variables .
So a function of two variables , of types A and B is a function f :: ( A , B ) -> C .
The Haskell idiom for the same thing , A -> B ->
C as a function taking one argument and returning a function of a single variable ; as well as the curry / uncurry procedure is tightly connected to this viewpoint , and will reemerge below , as well as when we talk about adjunctions later on .
Coproduct
The product came , in part , out of considering the pair construction .
One alternative way to write the Pair a b type is :
data Pair a b = Pair a b
and the resulting type is isomorphic , in Hask , to the product type we discussed above .
This is one of two basic things we can do in a data type declaration , and corresponds to the record types in Computer Science jargon .
The other thing we can do is to form a union type , by something like
data Union a b = Left a | Right b
which takes on either a value of type a or of type b , depending on what constructor we use .
This type guarantees the existence of two functions
Left :: a ->
Union a b Right :: b ->
Union a b
Similarly , in the category of sets we have the disjoint union , which also comes with functions .
We can use all this to mimic the product definition .
The directions of the inclusions indicate that we may well want the dualization of the definition .
Thus we define :
Definition A coproduct of objects in a category is an object equipped with arrows such that for any other object with arrows , there is a unique arrow such that the diagram
commutes .
The diagram is called a coproduct cocone , and the arrows are inclusion arrows .
For sets , we need to insist that instead of just any and , we need the specific construction taking pairs for the coproduct to work out well .
The issue here is that the categorical product is not defined as one single construction , but rather from how it behaves with respect to the arrows involved .
With this caveat , however , the coproduct in Set really is the disjoint union sketched above .
For Hask , the coproduct is the type construction of Union above - more usually written Either a b .
And following closely in the dualization of the things we did for products , there is a first
Proposition
If are both coproducts for some pair in a category , then they are isomorphic .
The proof follows the exact pattern of the corresponding proposition for products .
Algebra of datatypes
Recall from Lecture 3 that we can consider endofunctors as container datatypes .
Some of the more obvious such container datatypes include :
data 1 a = Empty data T a = T a
These being the data type that has only one single element and the data type that has exactly one value contained .
Using these , we can generate a whole slew of further datatypes .
First off , we can generate a data type with any finite number of elements by ( times ) .
Remember that the coproduct construction for data types allows us to know which summand of the coproduct a given part is in , so the single elements in all the 1 s in the definition of n here are all distinguishable , thus giving the final type the required number of elements .
Of note among these is the data type Bool = 2 - the Boolean data type , characterized by having exactly two elements .
Furthermore , we can note that , with the isomorphism given by the maps
f ( Empty , T x ) = T x g ( T x ) = ( Empty , T x )
Thus we have the capacity to add and multiply types with each other .
We can verify , for any types
We can thus make sense of types like ( either a triple of single values , or one out of two tagged pairs of single values ) .
This allows us to start working out a calculus of data types with versatile expression power .
We can produce recursive data type definitions by using equations to define data types , that then allow a direct translation back into Haskell data type definitions , such as :
The real power of this way of rewriting types comes in the recognition that we can use algebraic methods to reason about our data types .
For instance :
List = 1 + T * List = 1 + T * ( 1 + T * List ) = 1 + T * 1 + T * T * List = 1 + T + T * T * List
so a list is either empty , contains one element , or contains at least two elements .
Using , though , ideas from the theory of power series , or from continued fractions , we can start analyzing the data types using steps on the way that seem completely bizarre , but arriving at important property .
Again , an easy example for illustration :
List = 1 + T * List -- and thus List - T * List = 1 -- even though ( -) does n't make sense for data types ( 1 - T ) * List = 1 -- still ignoring that ( - ) ... List = 1 / ( 1 - T ) -- even though ( / ) does n't make sense for data types =
1 + T + T * T + T * T * T + ... -- by the geometric series identity
and hence , we can conclude - using formally algebraic steps in between - that a list by the given definition consists of either an empty list , a single value , a pair of values , three values , et.c .
At this point , I 'd recommend anyone interested in more perspectives on this approach to data types , and thinks one may do with them , to read the following references :
Blog posts and Wikipages
The ideas in this last section originate in a sequence of research papers from Conor McBride - however , these are research papers in logic , and thus come with all the quirks such research papers usually carry .
Instead , the ideas have been described in several places by various blog authors from the Haskell community - which make for a more accessible but much less strict read .

To time - compress a signal , the signal is first converted to a spectrum in which the intensity of each wavelength corresponds to the signal at a moment in time .
Then the spectrum is converted back to linear waveform by mixing it with a much shorter pulse .
Cornell researchers have developed an ingenious method to time - compress optical signals .
The process could enable optical communication systems to carry many more bits per second or could also be used to generate short bursts of light with complex waveforms needed to control chemistry and physics experiments where changes are induced by light ..
In tests , the researchers compressed a series of optical pulses carrying information at 10 gigabits per second ( Gps ) into a much shorter burst carrying the same information at 270 Gps .
The research is reported in the online edition of the journal Nature Photonics and in a forthcoming print edition .
Alexander Gaeta , professor of applied and engineering physics , calls the compression device a " temporal telescope . "
The " lenses " are two tiny optical waveguides on a silicon chip designed by Michal Lipson , associate professor of electrical and computer engineering , in which signals can be manipulated by a process called " four - wave mixing . "
A signal and a " pump " are combined inside a waveguide only 300x550 nanometers in cross section , smaller than the wavelength of the infrared light traveling through it .
( A nanometer is a billionth of a meter , about the length of three atoms in a row . )
In the confined space , the two light beams mix together to create a new , combined signal .
In the first waveguide a signal that varies in intensity over time -- in the demonstration case , a series of on and off pulses representing ones and zeros -- is combined with a pump pulse containing a broad range of wavelengths of light .
The output is a spectrum of wavelengths in which the intensity , or brightness , at each wavelength corresponds to the amplitude of the original signal at a particular moment in time .
The second waveguide combines this spectrum with another pump pulse that is much shorter than the original signal and reverses the process , creating a signal that varies in amplitude corresponding to variations in intensity across the spectrum .
The resulting output signal mirrors the original input , but is compressed to the length of the second pump pulse .
As Gaeta puts it , the " focal length " of the temporal lens is determined by the length of the pump pulse .
As with conventional glass lenses , putting two temporal lenses together creates a telescope .
In this case the system looks through the wrong end of the telescope , making things look smaller .
The demonstration was also done with more complex waveforms , including amplitude - and frequency - modulated signals .
Modulating light into complex waveforms over very short time scales is difficult and expensive , Gaeta said .
This process , he said , makes it possible to generate a signal on a long time scale using off - the - shelf methods , and then compress the result to the desired time scale .
The process also offers a new way to connect the relatively slow outputs of silicon electronics to photonic systems , he added .

Statement to the House Internal Security Committee by Donald Meinshausen , August 6 , 1969
Today I am to be the House Internal Security Committee 's major witness to testify on the workings of a " dangerous organization " : the Students for a Democratic Society .
During my membership in SDS , I learned of a much more dangerous organization , which has seized and destroyed more lives and property than SDS ever could .
I am speaking of the United States government .
Under the guise of relief and urban renewal , the government has destroyed the black people 's pride and any chance to form a stable community .
In the cause of the defense of freedom , it has aided tyrants in Greece , Spain , and Vietnam — and has exploited and oppressed people at home and abroad .
I did not receive my ideas from Marx , nor did some that I met in SDS receive their ideas from Marx but , rather , from the revolutionary American tradition of liberty as expressed by Jefferson , Daniel Webster , Thoreau , Josiah Warren , Benjamin Tucker , Lysander Spooner , Twain , and others .
Five years ago , I worked for the election of Barry Goldwater for president .
That work and working for a student insurrection are not contradictory .
Both seek to return power to the people .
I am still proud , along these lines , of being part of the struggle for student power at Essex County College in Newark , New Jersey .
I am against conscription , the war , the taxation which is bankrupting our people , and against laws governing consensual moral behavior .
I am not alone in such views , and there are many in SDS and in YAF ( a right - wing organization to which Mr. Ashbrook and Mr. Watson are advisors ) who agree with me .
Both of these organizations , and not SDS alone , suffer from authoritarian leadership .
If these authoritarians ever reached power they might be worse than our present power holders , but , with both liberals and conservatives , labor and big business , the military and the state today maintaining power for their interests , there seems to be little choice .
Power should not be won but destroyed .
No matter for what noble purpose new laws are passed , they will only benefit in the long run the people who can play politics — power politics — the best .
Demands for the limitation of government and decentralization , many of which are being made today by libertarians in both SDS and YAF , are consistent with liberty and the best of American revolutionary tradition with the Declaration of Independence .
On the other hand , this committee and the Congress of which it is part — with demands for more and tougher laws and government paternalism — are helping the growth of monster government .
In regards to this committee , which sent me to spy on SDS , I wish to quote Frank Chodorov , a respected author and commentator usually associated with the Old Right , but if he were alive would have much in common with the New Left :
And now we come to the spy hunt — which is in reality a heresy trial .
What is it that perturbs the inquisitors ?
They do not ask the suspects :
Do you believe in power ?
Do you adhere to the idea that the individual exists for the glory of the state …
Are you against taxes or would you raise them until they absorb the entire output of the country … are you opposed to the principle of conscription …
Such questions might prove embarrassing to investigators .
The answers might bring out the similarity between their ideas and purposes and those of the suspected heretics .
They too worship Power .
Under the circumstances they limit themselves to one question :
Are you or were you a member of the Communist Party ?
And this turns out to mean , have you aligned yourself with the Moscow branch of the church ?
[ " St. Paul and the Communists , " Out of Step ]
In regards to SDS , I admit that there is a growth of Stalinism , but it is noted and criticized by the noncommunist Left .
Even so , however , since the Stalinists have little power they are not as dangerous — not as dangerous as the real threats of a rampaging police power and imperialism .
And , yes , there is fascism on the Right , and this tendency also receives criticism from the responsible people there .
What is necessary from people of all sides is refraining from initiating the use of force , no matter what the goal .
If all people could only grant the same rights they reserve for themselves , the world would be a much better place to live in .
The tragic truth of the matter today is that it is the state itself , and not student dissenters , which has initiated and which perpetuates the use of force .
FacesOfLawsuitAbuse.org , which was formerly named IAmLawsuitAbuse.org , is a project of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform ( ILR ) .
ILR is a national campaign , representing the nation ’s business community , with the critical mission to champion a fair legal system that promotes economic growth and opportunity .
Good things come to those who wait .
But now that the Large Hadron Collider has restarted after undergoing more than a year of repairs , physicists are racing to analyse the data .
Just days after the first protons were smashed together at the LHC , the first paper on the results has been accepted to a journal .
The first collisions took place on Monday , 23 November ; by Saturday , a paper had been uploaded to the arxiv server , where physicists often publish their results prior to formal publication .
Three days later , it had been accepted by European Physical Journal C .
The paper came from researchers working on ALICE , one of six experiments at the world ’s most muscular particle smasher , which is located near Geneva , Switzerland .
“ It ’s probably a record , ” says David Evans of the University of Birmingham , leader of the UK contingent at ALICE .
“ Of course , it had a lot to do with the kudos of being first . ”

The speediness was only possible because the collaboration had approved the text of the paper in advance , leaving just a few gaps to fill in once the number - crunchers had analysed 284 of the first ALICE collisions .
The published result is a long way from evidence for the Higgs boson , or proof of the existence of supersymmetry , or hidden dimensions .
It is a measurement of a quantity known as pseudorapidity – “ basically a posh way of counting charged particles ” , says Evans .
Nevertheless , it will be useful .
The measurements agree both with theory and results gleaned from other accelerators at similar energies .
Evans says that gives the researchers confidence that their detector is working well as the LHC is ramped up to uncharted higher energies .

In fact , raising this issue only shows a lack of understanding on the part of those believing that the existence of modern apes is a stumbling block for evolution .
With the Islanders picking up a win in Atlanta last night , the New York Rangers have now fallen to dead last in the Atlantic Division , and are currently right behind the struggling Philadelphia Flyers in the standings .
While many of you may look at this as the end of the world , or just simply give up on the team all together , I am looking at this with a bit of a different attitude .
I am looking at this as an opportunity to regain confidence and get back on the winning track .
Call me crazy , but I truly believe the fact that the previously 30th place rival Islanders have now pulled ahead of the Blueshirts will benefit the Rangers , rather than hurt them .
Put yourselves in the Rangers ' shoes , or skates I should say , for a minute .
Now imagine watching the same team that had the first round draft pick this past June , the same team that you have finished ahead of in the standings for consecutive seasons now , the same team that enjoys nothing better than defeating you and playing a superior product of hockey to yours now passing you in the standings .
You are now the cellar dwellers , you are now the team in which its very own fans are giving up on you , and you are the team that has a boatload of pressure bearing down on you .
Well , how would that make you feel ?
What I am saying here is that the tables have turned .
The Islanders have slowly but surely crept out of the shadow that is casted on them by their rivals from Manhattan .
Now , whether this scenario will be true for the entire season or not , I cannot predict , but for the time being , this Ranger team has to be outraged .
At the same time , you must give credit to the Isles as much as it may hurt you to do so .
They have an unbelievable work ethic and that is what is propelling them in this time of over achievement .
In my eyes , yes , the Blueshirts lack skill in specific areas of the game , but a lot of this slump is due to poor mentality and lack - luster effort .
Once losses begin to mount and players do not score and the bounces are not going their way , the overall confidence level decreases drastically .
It is a possibility that these mixed emotions may turn to anger with what has went on over the past week ; from teammates being waived to rivals surpassing them in the standings .
That being said , I am not a player on the team and cannot just predict what is going through their heads .
However , assuming that these players have the mentality of any other normal human beings , there is a good chance that there is that feeling of shame right now , which can also translate into motivation and a state of desperation in which they will do anything to again be the leaders of New York Hockey .
John Tortorella has not gotten a 100 percent effort from his entire squad , but Gordon has , and as you can see , it makes a big difference .
So maybe the Rangers can take some pointers from their interstate foes , and begin to out - work teams night in and night .
Even if you 're losing , that is still a respectable style of hockey and a way to get this team on the same page .
I am just trying to stay positive during these difficult times .

CHEYENNE —
The grace period for Cheyenne ’s new ordinance that bans using hand - held cellphones while driving is over , and motorists now face a $ 750 fine if caught .
Cheyenne police say they issued more than 40 citations during the grace period that ended last week that was intended for public education and to allow time for placement of signs at city entrances .
A petition to put the ordinance to a citywide vote has been turned into the city clerk ’s office .
A Marine reservist was charged with attacking a Greek Orthodox priest he said he thought was a terrorist .
The reservist , Lance Cpl. Jasen D. Bruce , is accused of hitting the Rev. Alexios Marakis over the head with a tire iron and chasing him for three blocks on Monday evening before Tampa police officers intervened .
Father Marakis , a Greek Orthodox priest visiting from Crete , told the police he had stopped to ask for help after getting lost .
Mr. Bruce told the police he heard Father Marakis yell , “ Allahu akbar ! ”  Arabic for “ God is great , ” said a police spokeswoman , Laura McElroy .
Father Marakis , however , does not speak Arabic , Ms. McElroy said ; he speaks Greek .
Lance Corporal
Bruce ’s lawyer said his client was the one attacked .
Oct. 31 , 2009  --
An Iraqi immigrant who fled the country after allegedly running over his 20 - year - old daughter to punish her for becoming " too Westernized " and rebuffing the conservative ways he valued is in an Arizona jail today , facing assault charges .
The 10 - day manhunt for Faleh Hassan Almaleki , 48 , who fled from Peoria , Ariz . , on Oct. 20 , ended Friday when he was arrested by U.S. Marshalls in Atlanta after he arrived at the airport there , sent back to the country from London .
His daugher , Noor Faleh Almaleki , 20 , remains hospitalized in critical condition after her father allegedly hit the young woman and her boyfriend 's mother with his Jeep Cherokee on Oct. 20 in the parking lot of the Department of Economic Development in Peoria .
Noor Faleh Almaleki is in " life - threatening condition , " Peoria Police spokesman Mike Tellef told ABCNews.com last week soon after the incident .
Her boyfriend 's mother , 43 - year - old Amal Edan Khalaf , is also still hospitalized , but with non-life threatening injuries .
" It occurred because her not following traditional family values .
We 've been told that by everybody , " Tellef said .
" He felt she was becoming too westernized and he did n't like that . "
Calls to the Almaleki family were n't returned .
After the incident , Faleh Hassan Almaleki fled to Mexico and abandoned the Jeep Cherokee in Nogales , where police there eventually found and seized it , according to Peoria police .
Almaleki made his way to Mexico City , where he boarded a plane to London , but U.K. authorities refused to allow him into the country , and after U.S. officials were contacted , he was put on a plane back to the United States , the Peoria police said .
He was arrested late Friday afternoon when he arrived in Atlanta , and was returned to Arizona today .
He was booked on two counts of aggravated assault and is currently being held in the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office 4th Avenue Jail in Phoenix , police said .
Noor Almaleki had backed out of an arranged marriage about a year ago , police learned , and had been living with Khalaf and her son in a nearby town .
Tellef said the young woman dressed in American clothing and was wearing typical Western attire when she was struck .
The family were all American citizens , though Tellef said he believes the parents were born in Iraq .
He said it was unclear if Faleh Almaleki intended to kill his daughter , but " it was definitely intentional that he ran them down . "
While Tellef had heard of so - called " honor killings " in other parts of the United States , this was the first such crime in Peoria .
Honor Killings Unfairly Cast Negative Light on Islam
The notion of an honor killing -- Muslim men murdering female relatives for dishonoring the family by violating Islamic tenets -- made the news over the summer when 17 - year - old Rifqa Bary ran away from her parents in Ohio and turned up in the Florida home of Christian pastors Blake and Beverly Lorenz .
Rafqa Barry claimed that her Muslim father had threatened to kill her for converting to Christianity .
Rifqa made tearful television appearance , crying on the Lorenzes shoulders , describing how she had to sneak around to attend church .
" They have to kill me because I 'm a Christian .
It 's an honor [ killing ] .
If they love me more than God , then they have to kill me , " she told ABC's Orlando affiliate WFTV last month .
Blake Lorenz pointed to other honor killings , including the January 2008 murders of two Texas sisters who were believed to have been murdered by their Muslim father in a religion - fueld rage .
But Rifqa 's father , Mohamed Bary , denied the accusation and said that while he preferred his daughter be a Muslim , she was free to practice whatever religion she chose .
" I do n't believe my daughter would say this , " Bary told " Good Morning America . "
" She 's completely being coached -- I mean trained , influenced by these people .
It 's so sad . "
A Florida judge this month said he planned to send Rifqa back to Ohio after determining there was no evidence that her life was in danger .

Running the Table
Afghanistan
We need a surge in Afghanistan .
It worked in Iraq !
Nope .
Take it from Gen. David Petraeus himself : " We cannot just take the tactics , techniques , and procedures that worked in Iraq and employ them in Afghanistan . "
Afghanistan has lower rates of literacy , little experience with central government , a far more complex tribal structure , and a homegrown insurgent movement that remains largely a mystery to Western policymakers and military planners .
In any event , to do counterinsurgency effectively , most strategists believe that a ratio of at least 25 troops per thousand local residents is necessary .
Even if President Obama complied with Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s reported full request for 40,000 new troops , that would bring the ratio up to only 12.5 per 1,000 .
Counterinsurgency also requires a legitimate central government , which given Hamid Karzai ’s botched re-election , seems near impossible to achieve in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is Obama ’s Vietnam !
Pretty unlikely .
As AfPak channel editor Peter Bergen wrote last summer , the number of Taliban is likely in the tens of thousands , compared with the superpower - backed force of half a million that the U.S. military faced in Vietnam .
While the 298 U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan this year represents a disturbing increase , at least that many Americans were dying nearly every week at the height of the Vietnam War .
Thanks to the end of the draft , the domestic political debate on the war is far less contentious than in the late 1960s as well .
None of this is to say that the task wo n’t be brutal and painful , but America ’s favorite antiwar analogy just does n’t withstand scrutiny in this case .
Afghanistan will turn into an al Qaeda safe haven unless more troops are sent !
That ’s debatable .
First of all , most of al Qaeda ’s senior leadership is likely across the border in Pakistan .
Secondly , it ’s far from clear how much al Qaeda still needs large swathes of territory in order to operate .
Since 2001 , the terrorist has largely transformed from a coherent centralized organization into a disaggregated network of cells that , if they communicate with the central leadership at all , do so online rather than at training camps in Afghanistan .
Eight years of fighting in Afghanistan has succeeded in pushing Osama bin Laden and his core followers underground , but their message is still spreading to a willing audience .
In any case , even if we could turn Afghanistan into Switzerland , the world is full of ungoverned spaces where terrorists could operate .
Just look at Somalia or Yemen .
There ’s no reason for the war in Afghanistan .
We should pull out now !
No .
The consequences of leaving Afghanistan to its own devices are vastly more serious than advocates of immediate withdrawal often like to admit .
The Taliban would likely overrun the tottering Western - backed government , which could conceivably lead to a full - on civil war between Taliban - supporting Pashtuns and anti-Taliban non-Pashtuns in the north of Afghanistan .
Pulling out would constitute an abandonment of Afghanistan ’s population — particularly its women — to the whims of the Taliban .
Even if most Americans can live with that , they probably can’t live with the boost that an Afghan victory would give to the Taliban and various other militant groups in neighboring Pakistan — a nuclear armed state where the geopolitical stakes are even higher .
Israel
Israel is trying to cooperate .
We should put more pressure on the Palestinians !
It wo n’t work .
While Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s announced partial settlement freeze as “ unprecedented , ” it still allowed for the continued construction of 3,000 units – about average construction for a year – and excluded East Jerusalem .
More than 40 percent of the land in the West Bank is currently in the municipal jurisdiction of the settlements — though only 2 percent has been developed — and without a firm permanent freeze on settlements , Palestinian cooperation on achieving the two - state solution is unthinkable .
The Palestinians are trying to cooperate .
We should put more pressure on Israel !
That wo n’t work either .
Obama ’s credibility in Israel is sinking like a stone .
His “ trust ” rating among the Israeli public is below 10 percent , compared with the 70 - 80 percent that Bill Clinton and George W. Bush enjoyed .
The Palestinian leadership has never before made a complete settlement freeze an absolute precondition for talks and by continually hammering away at this point , Obama would only be reinforcing the perception that he cares more about Muslim public opinion than the interests of the staunchest U.S. ally in the Middle East , undermining the U.S. standing as an honest broker and further isolating Israel .
Iran
Diplomacy is failing .
We need to bomb Iran before they can build nukes !
Good luck with that .
Since Iran likely has multiple unknown nuclear sites under development , a military strike by the U.S. or Israel could potentially only delay , rather than destroy , the Islamic Republic ’s nuclear hero .
Meanwhile , it would strengthen the hand of anti-Western hardliners in the Iranian government , increase President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s folk - hero status in the greater Middle East even farther , and drive up the price of oil , the regime ’s main source of income .
Additionally , zealots though they may be , the ayatollahs have always demonstrated a healthy interest in self - preservation and there ’s little to suggest that the basic rules of nuclear deterrence would n’t apply if Iran were to get the bomb .
The threat of Iran giving nuclear technology to terrorist groups is real , but the global nuclear black market , which gets far less attention than rogue states like Iran and North Korea — is probably a larger threat on that front .
There ’s no proof Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons .
What are we worried about ?
Plenty .
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei has always carefully stated that there is no proof that Iran is working on a nuclear - weapons program , but there was no proof of the secret enrichment facility at Qom until its existence was recently revealed .
Iran only disclosed the existence of the site after it became clear that Western intelligence agencies already knew about it and then delayed for nearly a month before allowing inspectors to tour it — not exactly the behavior of someone with nothing to hide .
The inspectors who toured the site said that with only 3,000 centrifuges , it was too small for a civilian nuclear enrichment material but could potentially be used to make fissile material for bombs .
Even the normally diplomatic ElBaradei described Iran as being on the “ wrong side of the law ” when it came to the plant .
Health Care
America has the best health care in the world !
Sorry .
Contrary to what opponents of U.S. health - care reform will tell you , there are no wait times for emergency procedures in Canada ; Britons do have the right to pay for private care ; and government panels in such countries do not decide which patients live and which ones die .
Yes , there is “ rationing “ of care in government - run systems , but it does n’t differ significantly from decisions on the allocation of medical resources made by private insurers in the United States .
It is simply not true , as Republican Senator Chuck Grassley claimed , that 77 - year old Edward Kennedy would not have been treated for brain cancer under the British system .
In the World Health Organization ’s ranking of global health - care systems , the U.S. came in 37th .
Every country in Europe has created a single - payer system !
Nope .
European countries have variety of systems for paying for citizens ’ medical care .
Britain ’s National Health Service is , indeed , government run , but doctors and hospitals are private in France and Germany .
Switzerland and the Netherlands have public - private hybrid systems similar to what is being considered in the U.S.
It ’s also not true that the quality of care always improves when the government guarantees it .
Brazil ’s creation of a public option for health insurance 20 years ago was followed by an overall decline in quality of the country ’s health - care system as more and more middle - class Brazilians purchased private insurance , creating a two - tiered system of medical care .
Wild Card
If conversation starts to slow at the table , try these off - the - beaten - path topics from recent Foreign Policy articles to dazzle your dinner companions :
The Balkans : Radovan Karadzic ’s trial wo n’t heal Bosnia ’s ethnic divisions ; it will only increase Serb resentment .
Bioterror :
The risk of an accident from the U.S. bioterrorism research program is greater than the risk of a bioterror attack .
The EU :
The appointment of low - key figures Herman van Rompuy and Catherine Ashton to EU leadership positions show that the European Union is n’t ready to have a louder voice on the international stage .
Green China :
There ’s a lot less than meets the eye to China ’s efforts to get emissions under control .
Tips For Creative Food Storage in Limited Spaces Guest Post From Lee Flynn
There are many reasons to store food for emergency situations .
This can give you the peace of mind to know that you and your family can survive if any type of disaster strikes .
Having rations of food in your home makes sense , both for small and large scale catastrophes .
Not everyone , however , has lots of room to store food .
What if you live in a small cabin or perhaps a city apartment ?
Fortunately , even when you have limited space there are still ways to store emergency food .
When your space is limited , you have to get creative and make best use of whatever space you do have .
Do n’t confine yourself to traditional storage spaces such as kitchen cabinets .
While you should certainly make use of these , you will also have to think beyond this .
There is no reason why you ca n’t use any room in your home or apartment for storage .
First of all , you should keep all of your extra food in boxes or containers that maximize your space .
Individual cans or packages of food are awkward to store .
Boxes or milk crates , on the other hand , are easy to stack .
Grains can be kept in large , airtight barrels or buckets .
Making Use of Closets , Bedrooms and Furniture
This is a fairly obvious place for storage , but many people do n’t make optimum use of closet space .
There are various ways to add more space to closets .
You may have to first do some de-cluttering .
You can add shelves where cans and boxes of food can be stored .
You could keep some storage boxes on the floor of your closet .
In addition to bedroom closets , you can store food under large beds .
If you have a captain ’s bed with drawers , this is an ideal place for storing items out of sight .
Any bed that has space under it can be used for storage as well .
Some furniture has more storage than appears on the outside .
You can find tables , for example , that have drawers or other storage .
Using a steamer trunk as a coffee table supplies you with plenty of storage space .
Another place to store food is behind large pieces of furniture such as couches or bookcases .
Rent a Storage Unit
If you find that even making creative use of your space is n’t enough , you may want to consider renting a storage unit .
This is a bit of an expense and inconvenience , but it will give you plenty of additional space for your food .
There are now storage units all over and even a smaller unit will allow you to stock many boxes of food .
If you do this , however , do n’t just forget about the food .
Make sure you make visits to the storage unit , use up some food and replace it regularly .
Additional Food Storage Guidelines
Wherever you store your food , you should make sure you have a good selection of essentials , including extra water .
The most efficient way to store food is to consume it and rotate it .
Otherwise , your stored items will eventually spoil if they are n’t used up .
After all , you hope there never will be an emergency where external food supplies run out .
That ’s why you should choose items that are tasty and nutritious , so you can live off them and rotate your stock .
Make sure you have a variety of food items at your disposal .
This is essential for balanced nutrition .
Have all of the essential food groups , including carbohydrates , protein , vegetables and even some snacks and desserts .
Do n’t forget staples that are necessary for cooking , such as oil , yeast and spices .
Food storage is a wise investment in your security .
Even if you never need it , it ’s always reassuring to know that you are prepared for anything that might happen .
You will also never run out of food staples if you ever need them for everyday cooking .
Picture Credit - Pixabay Planning For A Garden
Preparing a spring garden is a joy that provides exercise , access to fresh air , and delicious fresh vegetables .
Taking three easy steps can produce a successful garden for anyone who wants to try it , and it is easier than it may seem to prepare a plot , plant the seeds , and nourish the crops .
Even a beginner can have a garden that is a source of pride , and the vegetables that it produces are abundant , delicious , and nutritious .
Preparing a Garden Plot
A plot that is 15 feet on each side creates 225 square feet of garden space , small enough not to require an extensive amount of work and large enough to grow five different vegetables .
The hardest part of starting a garden is removing the grass or weeds and turning the soil .
A small tiller is the best tool for preparing a plot , but a sharp hoe can remove the growth on top of the soil .
Turning the soil with a shovel is laborious , but it is the best tool if a tiller is not available .
A rake can level the soil and remove any remaining traces of weeds or grass from the garden plot .
An application of fertilizer enriches the soil and prepares it to receive the seeds .
Planting the Seeds
The pleasure of putting a seed in the ground is hard to imagine .
Using a finger to poke a small hole in the ground gets dirt on the hands , a sure sign that a gardener is doing the right thing .
Planning for the size of a plant when it reaches maturity is necessary , and instructions on seed packets indicate the space that is needed between plants .
Many plants need support to help them sustain the weight of vegetables that grow abundantly in the spring and summer sun .
Some vegetables that are easy to grow include tomatoes , yellow squash , cucumbers , okra , and green onions .
Okra produces a sturdy stalk that can stand alone , and the pods are not heavy enough to require support .
Green onions grow rapidly from sets that are available at garden shops , and they are a better choice than seeds that take a long time to mature .
Squash , cucumber , and tomato plants each need a tall stake that can support vines that are tied to them with soft strips of cloth .
Nourishing the Crops Vegetables have high water content , making it essential to provide a constant supply during the growing season .
A misting system is simple to erect , but a sprinkler that is attached to a garden hose can keep plants wet enough .
An occasional dose of fertilizer provides the nutrients that plants absorb along with water to produce plump and firm vegetables .
Part of providing nourishment of crops includes monitoring the condition of each plant to remove insects .
Careful inspection is usually necessary to find pests whose color matches the leaves of plants .
Keeping a Supply of Food On Hand
The abundance of vegetables that a spring garden produces provides enough to can or freeze for future use .
Fresh tomatoes make excellent spaghetti sauce that freezes well , and cut okra or squash in freezer bags are tasty additions to soups or casseroles .
Cucumbers and onions are best to use fresh , and neighbors welcome gifts from a garden .
If the thought of preparing a garden plot , planting seeds , nourishing plants , and finding a way to store vegetables does not appeal , there is a better alternative .
Emergency food storage offers freeze dried and dehydrated fruit , vegetables , beef , and chicken in their own containers .
A garden produces nutritious food , but it is time - consuming .
Soils that are not naturally rich require supplements that are expensive , and some climates are not suitable for a vegetable garden .
Stocking a supply of professionally prepared and packaged dairy products , fruits , vegetables , meat and proteins , grains , and ready - to - eat meals makes it easy to have nutritious meals available throughout the year .
Food Storage Picture Pixabay Emergency Food Packet Manufacturing
For manufacturers of emergency food packets , standards have to rise to an unrivaled level of excellence .
The companies that package the packets must operate under the assumption that conditions requiring emergency rations are likely to be extreme and challenging .
Fill levels are among the most important aspects of safe , dependable food - packet manufacturing .
Inspecting and monitoring those levels is a central step in guaranteeing a safe and reliable product that can stand up to the critical task of surviving an emergency .
The Importance of Fill Levels Emergency food packets are often used in the most extreme environments and climates , and are subjected to dramatic temperature fluctuations .
Those fluctuations result in freezing , thawing , expansion and contraction of liquids , and overall product degradation .
If fill levels are even marginally inaccurate , package rupturing or contamination can destroy an otherwise useable product .
An Alternative to Check Weighing
Whether emergency food packets come in metal cans , plastic bottles , composite containers or glass bottles , fill level monitoring is almost always superior to the check - weighing protocol .
It is far more accurate , despite changes in weight or container shape .
When it comes to speed - which directly impacts cost - there is no comparison .
According to Peco-Inspx.com , fill level monitoring can fly through 2,400 containers per minute , compared with 600 - 800 with the check - weighing protocol .
Flexibility and Adaptability Fill level inspection machines provide a wide array of different functions for manufacturers of emergency food packets .
A single device can provide assurance for labeled contents in beverages , verify the minimum head space in canned foods for thermal processing , and calculate the average fill level .
Because of temperature changes and motion or shaking , overfilling or under - filling are among the most hazardous pitfalls associated with the manufacturing of emergency food packets .
Fill - level inspection and monitoring can assure the right levels .
Beyond Fill Levels
Fill levels are just one important aspect of manufacturing emergency food packets .
The high demands placed on rations in survival situations requires superior durability and preservation .
From ideal cook temperatures to proper handling procedures , the United States Dept. of Agriculture outlines a range of specific and consistent standards regarding the packaging of emergency foods .
Emergency - food manufacturing standards are high because rations are crucial to surviving extraordinary situations .
The stresses and demands of emergencies require special attention to be paid to fill levels in packaging .
Appropriate fill levels are crucial to maintaining integrity under radical pressure and temperature swings .
No matter what product you ’re packaging , remember that the uniform guidelines laid out by the USDA apply to most emergency food production systems .

Massacre : Japanese fishermen use a sickle to drag dead dolphins into their boat
How the dolphins being massacred to satisfy a food fetish are poisoning the Japanese who eat them
By Danny Penman
05th September 2009
At the heart of a Japanese nature reserve , a horror story is unfolding .
Over the coming months , thousands of dolphins - some only a few days old - will be hacked to death .
Hundreds more will be sold into captivity , where they will die lingering deaths from stress and disease .
The dolphins are captured and slaughtered just off the southern Japanese fishing village of Taiji .
Every autumn , tens of thousands of the creatures gather there to feast on the abundant fish .
And once they have eaten their fill , one of the world 's greatest wildlife spectacles unfolds as the dolphins socialise and play .
Thousands of the creatures can be seen leaping through the air playing the dolphin equivalent of tag .
As far as the eye can see , dolphins race this way and that , blowing huge plumes of seawater into the air - just for the fun of it .
If you are lucky enough to be on a boat , the creatures will ride your bow wave or even leap straight over the top of you .
But Japanese fishermen see this event rather differently .
For them , the dolphins are a source of cheap meat - and pests to be exterminated .
And they kill them with a ferocity seen nowhere else on earth .

Asked whether he plans to enter politics or public life , Mr bin Laden said : " I do not believe that I would be a good politician – I have a habit of speaking the truth , even when it does not serve me well .
But I would like to be in a position to promote peace .
I believe that the United Nations would be ideal for me . "
Together with their 53 - year - old mother , the brother and sister then took the trolley into the supermarket .
But the OAP came round and followed them to the cheese counter .
The early Victorians were the first generation to see themselves through the camera lens , but the idea of photography , the possibility of making an exact reproduction of visual experience , was one – like flight and the philosophers ' stone – that had haunted the imagination of inventors for centuries .
The " camera obscura " or " dark room " that could project images on to a blank surface was known in antiquity , but a long hiatus followed .
Then , at the end of the 18th century it was found that paper coated in silver nitrate would retain the image of an object placed on it for a tantalising moment before it faded .
As the Georgian age came to an end , the enthusiasm for light shows and spectacles of all sorts reached fever pitch – as if photography were being willed into existence by sheer popular demand .
London and Paris were full of novel experiences with enticing names – panoramas , cycloramas and , in Leicester Square , Philip de Loutherbourg 's Eidophusikon , in which pulleys , mirrors and sound effects conjured up a plausible storm at sea .
The building that housed one of the most successful of the light shows , the Diorama , still exists in Regent 's Park .
In a kind of early Imax , the audience sat in a rotating drum to watch clouds , apparently , pass over the moonlit ruins of Holyrood .
Its inventor was the artist Louis Daguerre , who was first across the line with a true photographic process in 1839 , in France .
The sensation caused by his breakthrough prompted William Henry Fox Talbot , who had been working quietly in Wiltshire at his home , Lacock Abbey , to unveil his own version , which he called the calotype .
In his early prints , the Gothic tracery of Lacock shimmers , ghostly , into being , fragile and mysterious beside the pin-sharp immediacy of the daguerreotype .
From the beginning , photography could be many things .
One thing it always was , was popular .
It never entirely left the show business world from which it had emerged .
By October 1839 the Adelaide Galleries in Pall Mall were already offering daily demonstrations of the daguerreotype process .
These had to compete for attention with the galleries ' famous – and ear - splitting – steam gun , which went off every hour , as well as a 40in electric eel from South America out of which Michael Faraday was able to get a " most intense " spark .
By the mid-century , technical improvements had made photography cheap enough for a mass market .
The 1861 census recorded 2,879 professional photographers in England and there were many more keen amateurs .
While the movement of Victorian society as a whole tended to make class divisions ever more rigid , photography managed to be classless .
Cumbersome puns in Punch about dustmen having their " cart de visite " photographed reflected the speed with which the " lower orders " seized on a chance to sit for the sort of portrait the middle and upper classes had been commissioning for centuries .
Photography was also , from the beginning , considered a suitably genteel pastime for women , who produced some of the most enduring portrait studies of the 19th century .
The camera at times perhaps allowed them to express ideas that a lady might hesitate to put into words .
Julia Margaret Cameron 's study of Tennyson made the laureate look , he thought , like a " dirty monk " , and he was pleased with it .
Lady Alice Mary Kerr 's darkly glamorous vision of the poet and serial seducer Wilfrid Scawen Blunt transports his erotic appeal in full force across a century and a half .
Questions were asked , of course , the same questions that are usually asked about new technologies – notably " is it art " and " is it a threat to society as we know it " – and as usual many of the answers were wrong .
The history painter Paul Delaroche 's immediate response , " from today painting is dead " , turned out to be premature , while the Times 's confidence that photography would never replace the " completeness " of the painted panorama was also misplaced .
But the popularity of photography did not , at first , alienate those who saw themselves as guardians of high culture .
Ruskin , as an architectural artist , reassured his elderly father that " photography is a noble invention , say what they will of it .
Anyone who has worked , blundered and stammered as I have done [ for ] four days , and then sees the thing he has been trying to do so long in vain , done perfectly and faultlessly in half a minute , wo n't abuse it afterwards . "
Charlotte Brontë , who seems to have been the first novelist to use " daguerreotype " as a verb , was also an enthusiast .
In Shirley , published in 1849 , Caroline Helstone , encountering her would - be lover unexpectedly , finds his image is " struck on her vision with painful brightness . . . as vividly as if daguerreotyped " .
The implication is that somehow the photographic image would be even more real , more intense , than his physical presence .
It was this truthfulness , the potential of " nature 's own transcript of herself " , to offer a moral purity beyond human fallibility that appealed to the more thoughtful early Victorians .
Of its social effects , the art critic Elizabeth Eastlake spoke for many in heralding it as an invention " made for the present age " .
The age was one of railways and expanding empire , and it wanted , she believed , a supply of " cheap , prompt and correct facts " to aid its steam - driven progress .
This was what , to some extent , it got .
Journalism was transformed as engravings of photographic images and then photographs themselves were used in magazines and newspapers .
The Crimea soon provided an occasion for the first war photographs .
Photographic images show Nelson 's Column going up in the 1840s and the Vendome Column coming down under the Paris commune .
But news pictures were not the most popular , and it was decades before anyone thought seriously of using a camera to document social conditions .
Landscapes , historic sites , celebrities , especially Dickens , and endless pictures of themselves were what the Victorians liked best .
It was not long before the supposed objectivity of the camera came into question .
As a sceptical Mark Twain pointed out : " You ca n't depend on your eyes if your imagination is out of focus . "
Besides Eastlake 's vision of ever expanding truth and Charlotte Brontë 's endorsement of the emotional force of the image , there was always another , more shadowy , reality .
Fakes , mistakes , tricks and lies were endemic in photography from the beginning , and grew in number and variety as photographic techniques improved .
EP Loftus Brock was an early , if inadvertent , demonstrator of its limits as a scientific method when he used it at Stonehenge to further his investigations of the alignment of the stones .
Having engaged a photographer to observe with him the sunrise at midsummer in order to test the popular belief that the sun rose directly over the Heel Stone , he reported back to the British Archaeological Association that this fact was now " verified beyond all question " .
Since the sun actually rises slightly to the north , either Brock 's camera or his imagination must have been out of focus .
Nor was moral purity guaranteed .
It was not a coincidence that the Obscene Publications
Act of 1857 followed shortly in the wake of new developments in photography .
The wet collodion process , which introduced glass instead of paper negatives , was published without patent protection in 1851 .
Shorter exposure times and cheaper prints were achieved soon afterwards and a booming market for pornographic pictures was one immediate unintended consequence .
In response , the Society for the Suppression of Vice campaigned effectively for the new law .
It was less effective , however , in defining obscenity .
It was over dirty pictures , rather than more elevated questions about craftsmanship and intention , that the debate about whether or not photography was art became interestingly heated .
It first came to a head at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition , where OG Rejlander showed his enormous photographic composition The Two Ways of Life .
Printed from 30 separate negatives , it featured groups of allegorical figures , among whom the vices were portrayed by naked women .
Despite Rejlander 's robust defence of his work as art – the groups , he argued , were entirely based on classical sources – the picture caused a scandal .
When the Scottish Photographic Society later put it on display , it was forced to take it down on " moral grounds " – though the objectors had the wind taken out of their sails by Queen Victoria , who clearly thought The Two Ways was art and bought a print for Prince Albert .
He hung it in his private suite at Windsor .
Victorian erotica today looks for the most part as monumental and unexciting as Victorian furniture .
The 19thcentury pictures that give us most pause , like Lewis Carroll 's studies of young girls , were in their day quite unexceptionable .
Perhaps still more disturbing are the documentary images of " natives " , " lunatics " and criminals by which it was hoped that science , first as physiognomy and later as eugenics would open the way to a systematic understanding of human nature .
The shudder of hindsight should n't blind us to the sincerity or the nobility of the 19th century 's belief in the power of its new medium to scan the soul .
Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals used images of mental patients taken by the neurologist Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne at the Salpêtrière hospital .
Yet even at the time there were those who noticed that studies of " hysteria " and " megalomania " mainly serve to underline how little of the mind the face reveals .
As the century wore on , a certain disillusionment set in .
Trollope thought the photograph much less useful to the novelist than Charlotte Brontë had .
" Let daguerreotypers do what they will , " he wrote in Barchester Towers , " they will never achieve a portrait of the human face divine . "
Ever the pessimist , Thomas Hardy , who thought that Darwin 's discoveries had destroyed all hope of happiness for the over - evolved species that was mankind , saw in photography the potential for positive malevolence .
In his A Laodicean , of 1880 , Paula Powers loses faith in her lover , Somerset , when shown a picture of him apparently exhibiting " the wild attitude of a man advanced in intoxication " .
This kind of manipulation of the image , achieved in Hardy 's story by Somerset 's enemy William Dare , was already , Hardy noted , a popular jape with " certain facetious persons of society " .
Joke pictures of the German emperor in a screaming rage or of the pope dead drunk did a brisk trade .
A more calculated manipulation of images towards the end of Victoria 's reign was responsible for the rash of cloudy spirit photographs , veils of ectoplasm and hovering hands that convinced Conan Doyle and many others that the camera could record the dead as truthfully as the living .
As embarrassing in their way as the erotica , the faked images of seances make a telling counterpart to the hundreds of images taken over the same period to celebrate the queen 's diamond jubilee in 1897 .
The jubilee saw photography reach its apogee as an instrument of imperial triumphalism .
It would record , people believed , for " after years " Great Britain 's work of " civilising , of governing , of protecting life and property , and of extending the benefits of trade and commerce " across the world .
What the images reveal now , as they settle back into the lengthening history of photography , is the extent to which every Victorian certainty was shadowed by an equally profound doubt .
For each confidently posed picture of a tiger hunter or the royal family there is a joke in dubious taste , a stocky nude or a fragile hope of life after death .
As photography found its place in culture and society , no longer a technical novelty or a lever to prise open the moral truths of humanity , it gave back to the Victorians what they brought to it .
Now it passes them on to us in ways that would have surprised them .
" A photograph is a most important document , " said Mark Twain , " and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity . "
The Victorians are not damned by their photographs , but they are revealed , in ways that would surprise them , telling truths they hardly knew themselves .
Points of View : Capturing the 19th Century in Photographs is at the British Library until 7 March 2010
There ’s something eerie and amazing about the way that Tom Coleman travels in his wheelchair .
You see , Tom is n’t paralyzed and yet he ’s not using his body to control his movement .
He thinks about saying commands to his chair … and then the chair moves .
Tom and Michael Callahan are the founders of Ambient Corporation , makers of the Audeo , a device which reads nerve impulses in the neck to help people speak and even control an electronic wheelchair .
Designed to help people suffering from diseases like ALS which erode muscle control over time , Audeo has received numerous awards .
Audeo Basic , the system which allows someone to speak only using nerve signals , is already available on a limited basis for trials .
Check out Callahan ’s presentation of how audeo can be used with cell phones , and video of Coleman in the chair after the break .
This sort of “ nerve reading ” technology is n’t unique .
We ’ve seen Braingate use motor neuron signals in the brain to move a wheelchair and computer cursor .
Cyberdyne uses surface sensors to detect muscle commands to help guide the movements of their HAL exoskeleton .
Audeo is somewhat of a blend of the two .
It does n’t require you to have gold wires in your brain , like Braingate , but it can control remote objects , and it reads surface signals , like HAL , but for both motor movements and language .
Taken as a group , we ’re seeing an amazing trend in being able to read nerve signals like computer commands .
Whether those commands allow us to talk , roll , or lift heavy objects , is just marketing .
As nerve signal reading becomes more sophisticated , we ’ll see an increase in the range of devices you can control , and the number of disabilities that can be overcome with the technology .
Go to 1:25 to skip explanation :
When you speak , your brain sends signals to your vocal cords , lungs , and mouth to help you shape and sound out words .
With some forms of muscle degeneration , the lungs and the mouth may cease to function , but the signals to the cords can still be used .
That ’s where Audeo comes in .
With just three tiny pill sized sensors around the neck , the device can pick up electrical signals from nerves .
Those signals are filtered and amplified by the device , sent to a PC for decoding , and then spoken as words out of speakers .
As is clear in the videos , there ’s a significant lag time between subvocalizing words and commands and actually have the computer speak or wheelchair move .
The current rate is something near 30 words per minute , about one fifth the normal rate .
Hopefully as the Audeo program is developed further , the processing speed of the signals will be improved .
Of course , no matter how good the program is , it takes a little time to get used to .
While wheelchair commands are fairly simple ( Coleman says he can get people moving around in ten minutes ) , the speech recognition is n’t as easy .
Audeo should be able to distinguish all 40 +
English phonemes ( the sounds we make when we speak ) but it takes time for users to become accustomed to “ pronouncing ” the correct sounds in the new system .
Still , judging by Callahan ’s performance in the first video , with familiarity comes a pretty cool mastery of speech .
It ’s hard to get over the straight - faced completely still bodies of Coleman and Callahan as they demonstrate the capabilities of Audeo .
Those are the placid faces of “ mind- control ” .
Eventually , it would be amazing to see this technology adapted into the SixthSense system from MIT or even keyed into a humanoid robot .
While the ability to overcome ALS and similar illnesses is a wonderful short term benefit , the long term possibilities for the general public are just as amazing .

Building upon last month ’s historic release of nearly 500 White House visitor records , today the White House releases more than 1,600 records of visits to the White House in response to another month ’s worth of requests .
You can view all the records in a searchable database in our Disclosures section .
We announced earlier that in December the White House would -- for the first time in history -- begin posting all White House visitor records under the terms of our new voluntary disclosure policy .
As part of that initiative , we also offered to look back at the records created before the announcement of the policy and answer specific requests for visitor records created earlier in the year .
Today ’s production of records is in response to over 300 requests from the public during the month of October .
Those requests have yielded over 1,600 responsive records .
Consistent with our earlier announcement that we will only release records that are 90 days or older , this group of records covers the time period between January 20 , 2009 to August 31 , 2009 .
All of these have been added to the online database of published visitor records in an accessible , searchable format for anyone to browse or download .
Today ’s release advances the President ’s historic commitment to increasing government transparency and openness .
This Administration ’s concrete commitments to openness include putting up more government information than ever before on data.gov and recovery.gov , reforming the government ’s FOIA processes , providing on - line access to White House staff financial reports and salaries , adopting a tough new state secrets policy , reversing an executive order that previously limited access to presidential records , and webcasting White House meetings and conferences .
The release also compliments our new lobbying rules , which in addition to closing the revolving door for lobbyists who work in government have also emphasized expanding disclosure of lobbyist contacts with the government .
Several of the most frequent White House visitors in today 's release are , not surprisingly , Administration officials who come to the White House as part of their daily work .
For example , Tom Perrelli and Spencer Overton - each an appointed official in the Administration - have visited the White House many times .
Finally , as we noted last month , sometimes rather than providing clear information transparency can have confusing or amusing results .
With an average of 100,000 White House access records created each month , many White House Visitors share the same name as celebrities .
In October , requests were submitted for the names of some notable figures ( for example Michael Jordan and Michael Moore ) .
The famous individuals with those names never actually came to the White House , but we have included the individuals that did visit and share those names .
Happy Thanksgiving !
Norm Eisen is Special Counsel to the President for ethics and government reform
It is late afternoon ; the light is softening and young people have gathered at the harbour in Banda Aceh to play music , buy an ice cream and just hang out .
Suddenly the tranquillity of the scene is shattered when two black pick - ups arrive and discharge a dozen men and women in olive uniforms .
The officers approach a couple sitting in the shade .
One says : " We 're here to enforce local regulation 14 .
Are you married ? "
Shamefaced , the boy and girl shake their heads .
The officers examine their identity papers , then order them to leave .
The couple ride off on their motorbike , flushed with embarrassment .
It 's all in a day 's work for the Wilayatul Hisbah , a special unit established to enforce sharia in the staunchly Muslim province of Aceh , on the western tip of Indonesia 's Sumatra island .
The unit patrols several times a day , looking out for people drinking alcohol , gambling , unmarried couples , and women wearing tight clothes or not wearing an Islamic headscarf , a jilbab .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Aceh – known as the " Veranda of Mecca " because Islam entered Indonesia there centuries ago – won the right to implement sharia law in 2001 , after the province was granted semi-autonomy as part of efforts to end a decades - long separatist war .
In recent years , the law has been enforced with increasing rigour , with dozens of public canings carried out .
In September the provincial parliament approved a new criminal code that includes a provision for adulterers to be stoned to death .
The move was condemned by human rights groups , and has alarmed local businessmen , who fear it will harm Aceh 's attempts to attract investment following the tsunami five years ago .
The provincial governor , Irwandi Yusuf , has refused to sign the new code , so for now it remains in an uncomfortable limbo .
That has not prevented the Wilayatul Hisbah , sometimes compared with Saudi Arabia 's notorious " vice and virtue " police , from pursuing their task with zeal .
And Aceh is not alone .
Across Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim nation , dozens of local governments – given wide scope to enact their own laws under a decentralised system – have adopted Islamic regulations on dress and behaviour .
The trend threatens to undermine Indonesia 's reputation for fostering a moderate brand of Islam , yet the creeping fundamentalism is not widely endorsed .
At elections earlier this year , support for Islamic parties plummeted , at national level and also in Aceh .
Many Acehnese abhor the stoning penalty , although few are prepared to criticise it publicly for fear of being labelled bad Muslims .
Observers say a radical Islamist minority is being allowed to hijack the agenda , and in Aceh that minority is certainly making headway .
In October , clerics denounced an Acehnese woman who failed to wear a jilbab while competing in a national beauty pageant .
From 1
January , tight trousers will be banned in one district .
Iskandar , head of the Wilayatul Hisbah , or " Wi - Ha " , as it is known colloquially , applauds such measures .
" In our religion , it 's forbidden to wear tight clothes , because they can show the body shape and arouse men's desire to do things with women , " he explains .
" It 's all about protecting women and increasing respect for them .
Before sharia law , women were dressing impolitely and getting pregnant outside marriage .
That has all decreased now . "
At Wi-Ha 's dilapidated headquarters in central Banda Aceh , Iskandar is in charge of 62 officers , including 16 women .
" Right now three of them are pregnant , " he confides , adding hastily : " All are married , of course . "
For the dusk patrol , six women and six men set off in the two vehicles , men in front , women following .
They cruise slowly towards the harbour , then suddenly veer off sharply to the right .
Two young couples have been spotted behaving suspiciously .

It turns out that they are just sitting together in a public place .
But Kuzri , the patrol leader , gives them a stiff warning nonetheless .
" It 's preventative action , to make sure nothing else happens , " he says .
" We told them that to be together in a romantic way if not married can be dangerous and is actually forbidden .
It can lead to bigger things , and on to adultery . " ( " Adultery " , in Aceh , means any kind of illicit sex . )
Further on , a girl and boy take off on a motorbike as soon as the sharia police arrive .
" Actually we 're brother and sister , but we were leaving anyway , " says the boy .
Another couple , who are fishing off some rocks , say they are married .
Kuzri believes them .
" You can tell whether people are married , " he says .
" First the location : married people do n't need to find a secluded place to spend time with their spouses .
Unmarried couples will try to find a place out of sight .
Also , they sit next to each other , very close .
People who are married do n't do that . "
It may seem semi-farcical , yet those who transgress the moral code can be caned , even if the stoning law has yet to be enacted .
Critics say the code discriminates against women and poor people ( since rich couples can go to a hotel ) , intrudes into private lives , encourages vigilantism and violates the Indonesian constitution .
Iskandar receives about 20 anonymous tip - offs a day .
A man is spotted going into a hair and beauty salon ; he is suspected of visiting prostitutes .
An unmarried couple are seen entering a house at 7 pm and not leaving until dawn .
" What do you think they were doing all that time ? " asks Iskandar .
He laughs .
" Just sleeping or talking ? "
But he insists that Aceh is " very different from Afghanistan " , and says no one has been caned since he took over last year .
" I prefer to give people advice , maybe call in their parents .
I think caning is not a good solution . "
He leans forward conspiratorially .
" Actually , I hate caning , " he says .
While there is support for sharia , particularly in socially conservative rural areas , many Acehnese have reservations .
Lindawati , a seamstress , says : " Women are dressing more modestly now , and there are fewer cases of adultery , which is good .
But as for the stoning regulation , I do n't know how I would feel if one of my family had to suffer that kind of punishment . "
Back at the harbour , a woman selling barbecued sweetcorn by the roadside is displeased to see Kuzri 's team .
" To be honest , most people do n't like the sharia police , " she says .
One of her customers , a young man , agrees .
" I got a warning for being out with my girlfriend , " he says .
" It 's annoying .
We were n't doing anything wrong . "
But the Wi-Ha is happy in its work .
" There are two advantages of our job , " says Herman .
" We get to carry out our duties , and we also get blessed by God because we 're strengthening Islam . "
USC 's streaks of seven straight BCS bowls , 11 - win seasons and top - four AP poll finishes ?
Those are all finished .
The Trojans ' Pac - 10 dominance over the past seven years ?
It 's all but over after Stanford paved the way for a new West Coast champion .
Gerhart took time on the Coliseum field to savor the moment after rushing for 178 yards and three touchdowns in Stanford 's ( Not rated BCS , No. 25 AP ) 55 - 21 victory Saturday over the Trojans ( No. 9 BCS , No. 11 AP ) , who allowed the most points in school history .
" To do that against a storied program , a perennial power , it 's the greatest feeling in the world , " said the Pac - 10 rushing leader , whose Heisman Trophy hopes are gaining momentum .
" It was just will .
The offensive line just moved people .
We got after them and got downhill , and it was just a good offensive day . "
How good ?
The loss was the Trojans ' worst since a 51 - 0 defeat at home against Notre Dame in 1966 .
Coach Pete Carroll lost in November for the first time at USC after 28 straight victories .
And for the second time in three weekends , Carroll endured the worst loss of his nine seasons .
" I 'm not sure I have the right words to describe being humbled like this , " Carroll said .
" I do n't really know where to put it .
...
We have fallen apart and given our opponents the opportunity to do whatever they want , but you have to give Stanford a lot of credit . "
Andrew Luck threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score for the Cardinal ( 7 - 3 , 6 - 2 Pac - 10 ) , who followed up their surprising rout of Oregon last week with a strong start and a big finish at the Coliseum .
The Trojans ( 7 - 3 , 4 - 3 ) have n't lost to any other opponent at home since 2001 , going 47 - 2 .
Richard Sherman returned an interception 42 yards for a score with 11:41 to play , part of a 27 - point fourth quarter for the Cardinal .
After the postgame handshsake , the Cardinal raised their helmets and raced to their cheering section for their second celebration at the Coliseum in three years .
Stanford 's 24 - 23 victory as a 41 - point underdog in 2007 was a major shocker , yet this win barely even qualified as an upset .
That might be the most incredible thing of all about the Trojans ' downward slide , which will end with a minor bowl berth -- and with more than two losses -- for the first time since 2001 .
" We came out there , and there was something wrong , " USC safety Taylor Mays said .
" It is very disappointing .
It 's almost sickening .
To be a senior and leave a legacy like this , it 's sickening . "
Luck soundly outplayed fellow freshman quarterback Matt Barkley , while Gerhart steamrolled the once - vaunted USC defense .
Stanford piled it on late , scoring four touchdowns in the fourth quarter after leading 28 - 21 .
And the Cardinal did it on USC 's homecoming , no less , in front of 90,071 somnolent fans .
" We were just consistent , " Luck said .
" Starting fast in both halves really helped us .
Once we got rolling , we kept doing good things . "
Two weeks after USC's 47 - 20 loss at Oregon , the Trojans ' defense was again embarrassed , giving up 469 yards .
Barkley went 21 of 31 for 196 yards with three interceptions in his third straight unimpressive game for the Trojans .
Carroll has stuck with the freshman all season , but Barkley made turnovers on USC 's first two drives to put the Trojans in an early 14 - 0 hole .
When Sherman jumped on Barkley 's short pass and returned it down the USC sideline to put the Cardinal up 42 - 21 , Coliseum fans headed for the exits with unfamiliar emotions .
" This is n't what we grew up watching , " Barkley said .
" I 'm not used to this .
... I do n't know what to think right now . "
Joe McKnight rushed for 142 yards and a score for the Trojans , who fell behind 21 - 7 at halftime without top receiver Damian Williams , who has a sprained ankle .
Brice Butler caught a scoring pass among his six catches for 96 yards , but USC 's offense rarely found a rhythm after its first drive ended in a fumble by Barkley deep in Stanford territory .
Although USC kept it close through three quarters , the fourth was a long celebration for the Stanford band , a small cheering section and the players who already are bowl - eligible for the first time since 2001 .
After Gerhart 's third touchdown , Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh even attempted a 2 - point conversion , but USC stopped the try at the goal line .
Harbaugh 's explanation for trying to pile on a couple more points : " I just honestly thought there was an opportunity coming off the ball , the way our backs were running and the way we were playing . "
Said Carroll : " I do n't know what they were thinking with that , but in that situation , they get to do whatever they want . "
Few of the Cardinal 's key players remain from their 2007 upset .
Tavita Pritchard , the backup quarterback who led that 2007 victory , watched most of this game wearing a headset before playing the final minutes of the blowout .
The 2007 Cardinal could n't even manage a winning season , but these Cardinal still have a shot at the Rose Bowl .
Stanford finishes its Pac - 10 season against California next weekend and would need some help to take the title .
" It 's just an overwhelming feeling now , " Luck said .
A ruling that allowed a prisoner to sue former Bush administration attorney John
Yoo for devising the legal theories that justified his alleged torture threatens to " open the floodgates to politically motivated lawsuits " against government officials , Yoo 's lawyers say .
In papers filed late Monday with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , Yoo 's new team of private lawyers argued that a judge 's refusal to dismiss a suit by inmate Jose Padilla injected the courts into the political arena .
" Threatening executive branch lawyers with personal liability for reaching allegedly incorrect legal conclusions regarding the constitutionality of a president 's wartime actions would infringe on the core war - making authority that the Constitution reserves to the political branches , " said attorney Miguel Estrada .
Yoo , a UC Berkeley law professor , was a Justice Department lawyer from 2001 to 2003 and wrote a series of memos on interrogation , detention and presidential powers .
The best known was a 2002 document that said that rough treatment of captives amounted to torture only if it caused the same level of pain as " organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death . "
The memo also said the president may have the power to authorize torture of enemy combatants .
Another
Yoo memo said that U.S. military forces could use any means necessary to seize and hold terror suspects in the United States .
Padilla was arrested in Chicago in 2002 and accused of plotting with al Qaeda to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb . "
He was held as an enemy combatant in a Navy brig for three years and eight months , then was taken out of the brig and charged with taking part in an unrelated conspiracy to provide money and supplies to Islamic extremist groups .
He was convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison .
Padilla 's suit against
Yoo covers his time in the brig .
He says the government detained him illegally , denied him contact with the outside world for nearly two years , kept him for lengthy periods in darkness and blinding light , subjected him to temperature extremes , confined him in painful stress positions and threatened him with death .
Padilla says
Yoo , a member of a Bush administration planning group known as the " war council , " reviewed and approved his detention in the brig and provided the legal cover for his abusive treatment .
His suit seeks a token $ 1 in damages , plus legal fees .
In his June 12 ruling , U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco said government lawyers , like any other officials , are " responsible for the foreseeable consequences of their conduct . "
He said Padilla had a right to sue the " alleged architect of the government policy " on enemy combatants .
The Justice Department , which had represented Yoo in the case , then withdrew and was replaced by private attorneys .
They argued in Monday 's appeal that Yoo , as a legal adviser to the president , had not been responsible for the decision to detain Padilla , for the conditions of his confinement , or for " any alleged violation of Padilla 's rights . "
In response , Padilla 's lawyers said Yoo 's arguments were the same ones
White had already rejected .
" Lawyers can't aid and abet their clients ' crimes , " they said in a statement .
" And they can't aid and abet their clients ' involvement in torture . "
The appeals court has not set a hearing date in the case .

Retail spending climbed when the effect of falling car sales was ignored
US retail sales fell in September by the largest amount in 2009 , driven by car sales plummeting at the end of the country 's scrappage scheme .
The Commerce Department said sales slid 1.5 % , not as bad as expected , but the biggest drop since December last year .
Car sales dropped by 10.4 % but when vehicles were stripped out , retail sales actually rose by 0.5 % , better than the 0.2 % which had been forecast .
Consumer spending makes up more than two thirds of US economic activity .
A late Labor Day holiday helped retailers last month because consumers purchased some items in September that they would normally have bought in August , analysts said .
' Expected '
The 1.5 % drop in September 's retail sales followed a 2.2 % rise in August , which was revised down from an earlier estimate of 2.7 % .
That came as demand for new cars surged in August as buyers took advantage of the final month of the government 's incentives of up to $ 4,500 to trade in old models for more fuel - efficient cars .
The Commerce Department figures showed that sales in furniture stores jumped 1.4 % , reflecting the rebound in the housing industry .
Meanwhile , sales at general merchandise stores such as Wal - Mart and Target , rose 0.9 % .
" Certainly the numbers were better than expected , " said Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James Associates .
" You did see a big drop in vehicle sales as cash for clunkers expired , which was in line with expectations . "
From Reuters :
Shares of U.S. health insurers rose on Wednesday after efforts to overhaul the health system moved away from creating a government - run insurance plan long viewed as damaging to the industry .
However , gains may have been held back as analysts said new measures that would expand the Medicare government plan to younger adults and require insurers to spend a certain amount of premiums on medical costs presented new potential risks .
Senate Democratic healthcare negotiators agreed late on Tuesday to replace a government insurance option with a scaled - back non-profit plan .
The S&P Managed Healthcare index ( ^GSPHMO – News ) of larger U.S. health insurers rose 1.3 percent , compared to a 0.6 percent drop for the broader S&P 500 index ( ^SPX – News ) .
UnitedHealth Group ( NYSE : UNH – News ) increased 1.7 percent , Aetna Inc ( NYSE : AET – News ) rose 1.3 percent and Humana Inc ( NYSE : HUM – News ) climbed 1.1 percent .

WASHINGTON – After days of secret talks , Senate Democrats tentatively agreed Tuesday night to drop a government - run insurance option from sweeping health care legislation , several officials said , a concession to party moderates whose votes are critical to passage of President Barack Obama ’s top domestic priority .
In its place , officials said Democrats had tentatively settled on a private insurance arrangement to be supervised by the federal agency that oversees the system through which lawmakers purchase coverage .
Additionally , the emerging agreement calls for Medicare to be opened to uninsured Americans beginning at age 55 , a significant expansion of the large government health care program that currently serves the 65 - and - over population .
At a hastily called evening news conference in the Capitol , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , declined to provide details of what he described as a “ broad agreement ” between liberals and moderates on an issue that has plagued Democrats ’ efforts to pass health care legislation from the outset .

With it , he added , the end is in sight for passage of the legislation that Congress has labored over for months .
The officials who described the details of the closed - door negotiations did so on condition of anonymity , saying they were not authorized to discuss them publicly .
At its core , the legislation would expand health care to millions who lack it , ban insurance companies from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions and rein in the rise of health care spending nationally .

The developments followed a vote on the Senate floor earlier in the day in which abortion opponents failed to inject tougher restrictions into sweeping health care bill , and Democratic leaders labored to make sure fallout from the issue did n’t hamper the drive to enact legislation .
The vote was 54 - 45 .
Taken together , the day ’s developments underscored the complexity that confronts the administration and Reid as they seek the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican opposition and pass a bill by Christmas .

Despite their reluctance , some senators had talked openly and in detail earlier in the day about the progress of the negotiations .
The provision in the legislation to be dropped under the emerging agreement provides for a government - run insurance option to be available to consumers , with individual states permitted to drop out .
Liberals have long sought such as arrangement , as a means of forcing competition on insurance companies .
One participant in the talks , Sen .
Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , told reporters he did n’t like the deal , but he added , “ I ’m going to support it to the hilt ” in hopes of securing passage of the health care bill .

Another senator involved , Sen. Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , issued a statement saying , “ I do not support proposals that would replace the public option in the bill with a purely private approach .
We need to have some competition for the insurance industry to keep rates down and save taxpayer dollars . ”
But he did not rule out voting for the measure .
In his comments to reporters , Reid said the emerging compromise “ includes a public option and will help ensure the American people win in two ways : one , insurance companies will face more competition , and two , the American people will have more choices . ”
It was n’t clear what he meant by a “ public option , ” the Medicare expansion or another as yet unknown element .
It was unclear , for example , what fallback steps would be included in case private insurance companies declined to participate in the nationwide plan envisioned to be overseen by the Office of Personnel Management .
One possibility was for the agency to set up a government - run plan , either national in scope or on a state - by - state basis , but no confirmation was available .

Under the tentative agreement , liberals lost their bid to expand Medicaid , the federal - state program that provides health care for the poor , elderly and disabled .
But they prevailed on the Medicare expansion , and the negotiators appeared ready to maintain a separate health care program for children until 2013 , two years longer than the bill currently calls for , according to officials familiar with the details .
Additionally , there was consensus support for a requirement long backed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , and other liberals for insurance companies to spend at least 90 percent of their premium income providing benefits , a step that supporters argue effectively limits their spending on advertising , salaries , promotional efforts and profits .
The BNP is bracing itself for potentially fresh embarrassment tomorrow when details of the party 's rank and file UK membership are expected to be posted on the internet .
The list , which purports to be a snapshot of the party 's support in April this year , includes the names , addresses , postcodes and telephone numbers of people who have signed up to the far - right group , including the grade of membership assigned by the party – standard , family , family plus , gold , OAP , and unwaged .
This list was leaked to a website , which insisted today that it was genuine , and that it intended to publish the information tomorrow .
Today the BNP seemed unaware of the potential disclosure and said it appeared to have been timed to undermine the party ahead of the appearance of its leader , Nick Griffin , on Question Time on Thursday .
Today the political row about the BBC 's decision to invite him on to the programme intensified , with the corporation refusing to bow to pressure from a cabinet minister to cancel Griffin 's appearance .
The apparent disclosure of a membership list will add to the controversy surrounding the party .
The Guardian has seen the list , but could not verify its authenticity .
It appears to show that :
• The BNP had 11,560 members as of April this year .
• The party appears to have benefited from a surge in female recruits – one in eight party members are now women .
• The highest concentrations of members are in Leicestershire , Lancashire , Derbyshire and Lincolnshire .
If the document is authentic , it will be the third time the party 's membership data has been made public in recent years .
In November 2008 , a list of members ' names contact details and sometimes jobs and hobbies was leaked by disgruntled members said to have become frustrated that the party had become too soft under Griffin .
That list was widely circulated on the internet and last month 37 - year - old former BNP member Matthew Single , appearing before Nottingham magistrates , admitted leaking the data and was fined £ 200 for breaching the Data Protection Act .
In December 2006 , an undercover investigation by the Guardian revealed that the organisation 's members included Simone Clarke , then a ballerina for the English National Ballet .
A spokesman for the website which is proposing to publish the list said today it wanted to reveal it in order to provoke a debate in the UK about why people want to become members of the BNP .
A BNP spokesman said it considered any publication of its internal membership data to be a criminal offence under the Data Protection Act .
" This is an example of the perpetual hatred and vilification we face , " said BNP deputy chairman Simon Darby .
Yesterday the Welsh secretary , Peter Hain , called on the BBC to withdraw Griffin 's Question Time invitation because the BNP is currently " an unlawful body " after the party told a court last week it would have to amend its whites - only membership rules to meet discrimination legislation .
The last time BNP data was published , it emerged that teachers , policemen and former members of the Conservative , Labour and the Lib Dem parties had signed up .
Several dozen admitted to being members and were named in the press .
The latest list suggests that at least 19 of those members have now left the party .
Meanwhile , former military chiefs today warned that the armed forces were in danger of being hijacked by far - right groups .
The Times reported that former generals had written a letter warning that political extremists had no right to share the armed forces ' proud reputation .
The letter , signed by former heads of the army , General Sir Mike Jackson and General Sir Richard Dannatt , among others , said far - right groups were " fundamentally at odds " with the values of the British military .
The move follows the BNP 's tactic of using images of Winston Churchill and wartime insignia during recent European election campaigns .
The letter reads : " We call on all those who seek to hijack the good name of Britain 's military for their own advantage to cease and desist . "
• This article was amended on 20 October 2009 .
We said that the purported BNP membership list includes one peer .
This was wrong .
It arose from confusion over similar surnames .
This has been corrected .

Advertisement The Galileo satellite - navigation system is coming .
After all the wrangling , the delays and the furore over cost , Europe 's version of GPS is finally starting to take shape .
In an industrial cleanroom in southern England , engineers are reaching key milestones in their preparation of four satellites .
It will be these In - Orbit Validation ( IOV ) models which will prove the Galileo concept .
Due for launch in pairs in late 2010 and early - 2011 , the " pathfinders " will form a mini-constellation in the sky .
They will transmit the navigation signals that demonstrate the European system can become a reality .
The rest of the network should then follow soon afterwards .
Galileo will eventually comprise some 30 satellites , to inform and guide users the world over .
" Even with just a few Galileo spacecraft in orbit - if you had a GPS and Galileo - compatible receiver , you would begin to see a difference , simply by virtue of having more satellites in the sky , " explained Dr Mike Healy from EADS Astrium .
The company 's Portsmouth cleanroom is responsible for assembling the IOV payloads .
Its engineers have been sent sat-nav components from across Europe .
This equipment is being installed in 1.5 m - by - 1.5 m - by - 3 m boxes .
On a level
The critical elements of an IOV include its two passive hydrogen - maser atomic clocks , the ultra - precise time - pieces on which Galileo 's performance depends .
GALILEO UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A European Commission and European Space Agency project
Up to 32 satellites to be launched in batches in coming years
Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real - time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety - critical roles where lives depend on service
Q&A : Europe 's Galileo project
" The main thing is maintaining their accuracy , " said Peter Hollands , the payload project manager .
" You have to protect them from magnetic fields , from shock and vibration , and from thermal excursions .
So the variation in temperature of the clocks on the IOVs is controlled to within about a degree [ Celsius ] to keep them stable . "
The payloads must also carry signal generation units .
These complex processing centres take the " ticks " from the clocks and turn them into the all - important navigation signal .
That signal then goes through amplifiers before being transmitted to users on the ground via an antenna .
All of these elements have to be integrated and tested .
The first complete payload is due to go out the door in a matter of weeks .
The box will be sent to Thales Alenia Space in Rome , Italy , where it will be attached to the main spacecraft bus , incorporating a propulsion system , avionics and solar panels , etc , before being shipped to Europe 's spaceport in French Guiana .
A Russian Soyuz rocket has been entrusted with the deployment in orbit .
Difficult project Galileo will work alongside GPS .
It is expected to improve substantially the availability and accuracy of timing and navigation signals delivered from space .
Users should get quicker , more reliable fixes and be able to locate their positions with an error of one metre compared with the current GPS - only error of several metres .
Of course , Europe 's single biggest space services project should have been operational by now .
Political and financial uncertainty have hindered progress ; the collapse in 2007 of the private consortium invited to build and run the network came very close to delivering a knock - out punch .
But there have been technical challenges , also .
European industry has had to develop some novel equipment for Galileo , and getting them all to interact seamlessly and robustly at a systems level has taken time .
That there had been slippage on such a major endeavour should not have been a surprise , argued Dr Healy .
" When we make telecoms satellites , they are essentially a variation on a theme and we can now do them to a very consistent timescale , " he explained .
" But when we have to do significant developments , as in the case of Galileo , these spacecraft are bound to take longer and there will be a degree of uncertainty on timescales .
" Remember , Europe has never done navigation before . "
Contract awards
This week sees the deadline for the consortia competing to build the remaining Galileo satellites to submit their final prices to the project 's leaders , the European Commission ( EC ) and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
Contracts for up to 22 Full Operational Capability ( FOC ) spacecraft are expected to be awarded before the year 's end .
EADS Astrium and Thales Alenia Space may have built the IOVs but they are not guaranteed to get the next batch .
Certainly , not all of them .
There has been wide speculation in Europe that the EC and Esa will hand some of the FOC order to a rival consortium led by OHB of Germany .
Whatever the outcome , payload integration will be undertaken in the UK - if not in Astrium 's Portsmouth cleanroom then at Surrey Satellite Technology Limited ( SSTL ) in Guildford .
SSTL is a key partner in the OHB consortium .

Federal authorities Thursday moved to seize an array of U.S. - based properties , bank accounts and religious sites that they charged in court documents were funneling money to an Iranian bank involved in that country ’s suspected nuclear weapons program .
Prosecutors sought the forfeiture of assets that included Islamic centers and mosques in California , Maryland , New York City and Houston , as well as land in Virginia .
They also took steps to seize financial control of a 36 - story office tower at 650 Fifth Ave. in Manhattan that they said was part of a business empire controlled by the Alavi Foundation .
Prosecutors alleged that Alavi has been illegally “ providing numerous services to the Iranian government ” -- as well as a large amount of funds .
The properties and bank accounts being sought by the government in a civil lawsuit are worth more than $ 500 million and represent one of the largest attempted seizures of assets allegedly linked to Iran .

“ As today ’s complaint alleges in great detail , the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran , ” U.S. Atty .
Preet Bharara said in a statement .
“ For two decades , the Alavi Foundation ’s affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials , including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations , in violation of a series of American laws . ”
Tenants and occupants of the properties “ remain free to use the properties , ” said Yusill Scribner , a spokeswoman for Bharara ’s office .
“ There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants . ”
Daniel Ruzumna , a lawyer for Alavi , issued a statement late Thursday that said the foundation was “ disappointed that the government decided to bring this civil forfeiture action .
The foundation has been cooperating fully with the government since the investigation began .
The foundation intends to litigate the government ’s claims and expects to prevail . ”
One U.S. official in Washington , who requested anonymity when discussing the case , said that the forfeiture action was not coordinated with the White House .
It comes at a time when President Obama is stepping up diplomatic overtures to Iran in an attempt to get it to abandon its nuclear program .

In court documents , prosecutors said Alavi and a related entity were sending money to Bank Melli , which the Treasury Department alleged is owned by the Iranian government and being used to help build its weapons program .
U.S. citizens , banks and businesses are barred from using Bank Melli .
A U.S. law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , authorities said , allows properties to be seized as proceeds of violations of money - laundering statutes .
Thursday ’s action appeared to be the latest move in a long and muddy case against Alavi that began unfolding last year with a grand jury investigation into the foundation ’s relationship with Bank Melli .
The move was criticized by the Council on American - Islamic Relations , or CAIR , which said that a government effort to seize mosques was “ unprecedented ” and likely to have 1st Amendment implications .

“ Whatever the details of the government ’s case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide , ” CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said .
But others said a move by the government to take ownership of a mosque was not likely to raise a legal challenge .
UC Berkeley law professor Jesse Choper cited instances in which the Supreme Court upheld seizures of bookstores or theaters because they were said to be linked to crimes .
“ Whether it is seizing a mosque or seizing a bookstore , it does n’t mean there is a special 1st Amendment scrutiny , ” or protection , Choper said .
By nightfall Thursday , authorities had served papers on numerous locations .

In the Northern California town of Carmichael , authorities visited the Qoba Foundation , whose website described it as a Muslim organization “ caring for spiritual needs of the community with a range of religious programs and educational activities . ”
The center said it performs Islamic marriages and burial services and provides certification of conversion to Islam , as well as family counseling .
The Alavi Foundation , according to its website , is a nonprofit organization formed in 1973 that makes contributions to nonprofits in the United States “ that support interfaith harmony and promote Islamic culture and Persian language , literature and civilization . ”
Most of the group ’s money , the website said , comes from rental income from its Manhattan skyscraper .
The building houses a variety of offices and shops , including Juicy Couture ’s flagship clothing store .
Some counter - terrorism and nonproliferation officials hailed the enforcement action , saying it was part of a multifaceted administration effort to force Iran to the bargaining table over its nuclear program .

“ What the U.S. government is doing with its relationship to Iran is mixing it up , like a boxer using different kinds of punches , ” said Jonathan Winer , a State Department official during the Clinton administration who helped lead economic sanctions programs .
“ They are telling Iran that if you want to talk seriously to us , we are there to talk .
And if you want to continue proliferation , we ’re there to stop you . ”

Major negative surprises by virtually all retailers with two exceptions , indicate that the consumer is becoming increasingly tapped out into the holiday season .
Black Friday sales which were not too bad are likely merely another unsubsidized ( yet ) Cash For Clothing program with substantial demand being pulled forward : at this rate December sales will likely be an even greater negative surprise .
Retailer commentary from Goldman Sachs :
Retailers reported weaker November same - store sales results , with Kohl ’s and Limited Brands being the only companies to beat expectations .
Unseasonably warm weather in the first part of the month offset mostly strong holiday weekend sales around Black Friday .
Most retailers posted positive same - store sales growth , with Macy ’s , J.C. Penney , and Target being the outliers to the downside .
However , a focus on inventory as well as cost - control initiatives are expected to continue to help margins , with Gap specifically pointing to stronger margins versus last year .
J.C. Penney pointed out that although it had strong online sales for the post - Thanksgiving period through Cyber - Monday , those sales will be recognized when merchandise is shipped and thus reflected in December sales figures .
Macy ’s and TJX both reaffirmed guidance for the fourth quarter , although this guidance is below current consensus estimates for both companies .
The best relative performers on November SSS were Kohl ’s and Limited Brands , with both exceeding expectations by 2.4 % and 5.5 % , respectively .
For Limited , the beat was driven by better - than expected sales in the Victoria ’s Secret segment , which was up 3 % compared with consensus estimates of down 5.3 % .
Macy ’s had the weakest performance on a relative basis , missing consensus estimates by 3 % .
You have probably heard of Nepomuk , the semantic desktop technology we 've been shipping for a while as part of the KDE Platform .
However , so far , you may not have noticed it really doing very much useful for you .
So what is this thing called Nepomuk , what can it do for us now and what will it bring us in the future ?
We asked two of the driving forces behind Nepomuk , Stéphane Laurière and Sebastian Trüg of Mandriva , to tell us about the real Nepomuk features that are already available in KDE software and those that have been introduced with Mandriva Linux 2010 .
The people
Stéphane has been working for Mandriva since 2004 and is working on a variety of projects related to collaborative knowledge management .
One of those is " the integration of the Nepomuk technologies into the Mandriva distribution and on the writing of the specifications of the next features " .
He lives in Paris and met Ansgar Bernardi ( of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ) and Stefan Decker ( of the Digital Enterprise Research Institute in Ireland , author of the seminal paper The Social Sematic Desktop ) in Luxembourg in 2005 .
This led to Mandriva , DFKI , the DERI and others to devise the Nepomuk project and apply for European funding .
The project was selected and work began on 1 January 2006 .
For Stéphane , Nepomuk is very much a reality today : " as a user , I switched entirely to Nepomuk for managing my personal notes and the links I maintain between projects , contacts , organizations , ideas etc " .
Stéphane is working on setting up new research projects to " ride the semantic wave that is coming :-) " .
Sebastian is best known for the CD burning application K3 b which he has been developing since 1998 .
He lives in Freiburg ( and seems to like it : " if you ever lived in Freiburg you probably still are - or got forced to another place " ) .
In 2007 he was seeking employment working on KDE technologies and Mandriva , having sponsored him already for K3b , was his first choice : " that is how I met Stéphane who pulled me into the amazing world of the semantic desktop " .
Since then he 's been working on the " first semantic desktop technology in a large free software community , sorry , THE large free software community " .
In the original research project , Sebastian 's role was to make Nepomuk part of the KDE Platform - an integrated , unobtrusive technology that allows application and workspace teams to make their products get smarter in the way they handle your information .
He has now taken on a lot of new responsibilities : " I am maintaining pretty much every part of Nepomuk , desperately - but not really successfully - trying to find new recruits to do all my work for me " .
An overview of the current status
Nepomuk search in Dolphin Nepomuk search in Dolphin
So , where are we at with Nepomuk now , compared to where we want to be ?
Stéphane explains that " Nepomuk initially aimed at two main achievements : 1 ) the ability to interlink data semantically on the desktop across the applications , 2 ) the ability to share semantic information with other desktops " .
The first is " getting mature from the infrastructure point of view " and he believes that Mandriva Linux 2010 gives a good insight into the improvements it can bring to the user , but much remains to be done .
The design of the framework for the second main objective started only recently : " a workshop took place in Freiburg early November and resulted in a first draft of the Nepomuk Sharing Ontology , and in a set of sharing use cases " .
Ultimately , it should be possible to share semantic information everywhere from mobile handsets to enterprise servers so that " the sky 's the limit " .
Nepomuk is already there in ways that you hardly notice - when you tag an image in Dolphin that tag is also visible in Gwenview .
Obvious right ?
Well of course , but that is Nepomuk in action behind the scenes .
Using Nepomuk today to find your files
Assuming your distribution has enabled Nepomuk , files can be already be tagged and rated from Dolphin and searching is possible by typing in to the address bar a query such as :
nepomuksearch : / tag: semanticweb tag : project
If it 's a search you use a lot you can add the search results to your Places panel , just like a normal folder .
However , complex searches can require quite a lot of knowledge of the correct terminology - consider :
nepomuksearch:/?sparql=select
?r where {{ ?r nao: hasTag < nepomuk:/ semanticweb >} UNION {?r nao: hasTag < nepomuk:/ p2p>}}
.
Stéphane acknowledges this : " easier ways to interact with the Nepomuk knowledge base are essential " .
He notes that Alessandro Sivieri is adding ' faceted browsing ' capabilities to Dolphin : " this means you will navigate across your files by selecting a combination of filters graphically .
For instance : display all pictures that were taken during last Summer , tagged with Italy and where Kate is present " .
Preview of the new search interface Preview of the new search interface
With version 4.4 of the KDE Platform there will be a new Nepomuk query API to make it " very easy for application developers to create query interfaces " and so we should begin to see more use of the Nepomuk capabilities in the applications .
Peter Penz is integrating an improved query interface for Dolphin that should debut with release 4.4 of the KDE Software Compilation .
Full faceted browsing based on Alessandro 's work is expected in Software Compilation 4.5
But enough of the future features .
The bottom line is that you can already use Nepomuk for simple searches from the Dolphin address bar and , with the correct knowledge , far more complex searches are also possible .
As Stéphane notes , the introduction of Virtuoso as the default storage technology has increased performance significantly so that it is now " possible to perform live queries , updating search results as the user types or proposing query completion at the same time " .
This is all part of the process of transforming Nepomuk from a research project to something that is actually usable in the real world .
Stéphane and Sebastian recognize how important the KDE community is in this process : " integration of the Nepomuk APIs in KDE software checks it against the effective needs of the users , makes testing more distributed and more efficient , and offers a perfect place for collaborative creativity " .
They wanted to express " a big thank you to the KDE community for giving Nepomuk a chance - this shows the real power of open - source in general and especially KDE " .
All the code ( except a few patches specific to Mandriva integration ) is maintained within the KDE SVN so it 's easy for anyone to contribute and test .
Nepomuk features debuting in Mandriva Linux 2010
In its latest release , Mandriva has packaged a number of new applications and features based on Nepomuk .
These are also developed within the KDE community but are not yet integrated in the KDE Software Compilation although it is intended that they will be at some point in the future .
Other distributions are of course free to integrate these experimental features .
Let 's have a look at them .
Task Manager and Nepomuk shell
The Mandriva task manager is a general application for managing items that relate to particular tasks , for example files , contacts , emails and web pages .
Actions can be launched from the context menu associated to each item .
For instance , an email can be sent to all contacts associated with the selected task .

The Nepomuk shell is an application dedicated to the visual management and easy annotation of semantic resources .

Task browsing integrated in Dolphin and Konqueror
Typing nepomuktree :/ in the Dolphin address bar displays all the tasks and their subtasks , and makes it possible to navigate across the task contents .
Task browsing in Dolphin Task browsing in Dolphin
You can also browse the tasks using a hypertext based interface in Konqueror :
Browsing items via hyperlinks in Konqueror Browsing items via hyperlinks in Konqueror
Konqueror task plugin
There is also integration with web browsing in Konqueror : a " task button " is provided to let you quickly associate a web page with a task .
Easy tagging in Konqueror Easy tagging in Konqueror
Task Switcher
The Mandriva Linux 2010 workspaces include a widget called Task Switcher from which you can select tasks and create new ones .
It lets you see all your active tasks and choose one of them as the current task .
Task Switcher widget Task Switcher widget
Making tagging easier
Sebastian and Stéphane recognize that " the long term success of Nepomuk hinges on the ease to link and to annotate documents : the cost of adding metadata to documents must be made negligible compared to the productivity gain " .
With this in mind , they have worked on making tagging as easy and automated as possible in Mandriva Linux 2010
Assisted manual tagging
From Dolphin , right clicking on a file or a Nepomuk resource ( such as a file ) and selecting the entry " Action > Annotate " makes it possible to annotate the item .
For example , let 's say you have a contact " John Smith " .
Typing " John " in the annotation field will propose to link the selected file with your contact John Smith .
A modified KMail package , kmail - nepomuk , provides the ability to easily tag emails too .
Automation of tagging
An exciting , but early stage , technology being trialled in Mandriva Linux 2010 is automation of tagging using Scribo , a research project sponsored by the [ email protected ] competitiveness cluster .
Stéphane and Sebastian see Scribo as " a natural continuation of Nepomuk : it completes the annotation infrastructure " .
They imagine a scenario in which you receive an email titled " Scribo meeting at Nuxeo office 10/12/2009 " .
Using Scribo and Nepomuk , " KMail could offer to add en event to your calendar that is automatically linked to the Scribo project , the Nuxeo company , the map of the Nuxeo office in Paris and to the Scribo participants " .
Scribo - assisted tagging Scribo - assisted tagging
Scribo can analyze text files and suggest relationships via Nepomuk based on the words found .
It can also recognize ( using Tesseract ) text in images so that Nepomuk can suggest linking the image to items that are related to the identified text .
These features can be tested in Mandriva Linux 2010 by right clicking on a text file , and selecting " Actions > Run semantic analysis " .
For an image it is " Actions > Annotate " .
Future Scribo - based technologies
Scribo is designed to learn from the user interaction with the system , so that suggestions get better over time .
Mandriva is teaming up with research organizations that have expertise in the natural language processing technologies .
There are some far reaching possibilities such as " routing technical queries to the appropriate documentation or discussion thread " , using Open Collaboration Services .
Summary
If you would like to check out some of the Nepomuk features present in Mandriva Linux 2010 then their guide should get you up and running .
Nepomuk is a whole new approach to managing information intelligently and the transformation of pure research into useful and robust tools obviously takes time .
However , Nepomuk is already working behind the scenes in KDE software in ways you may have used without noticing and some advanced searching features are already available if you know how to use them .
Stéphane , Sebastian and the wider KDE community will be working on integrating Nepomuk capabilities into applications in a more user - friendly and discoverable manner , now that the technological foundations are in place .
A friendly Nepomuk based search interface is expected to debut with Dolphin in release 4.4 of the KDE Software Compilation and full browsing capabilities based on Nepomuk are aimed for inclusion in 4.5 in the form of faceted browsing .
Wider integration of some of the other capabilities showcased in Mandriva Linux 2010 will follow .
Abstract Food waste contributes to excess consumption of freshwater and fossil fuels which , along with methane and CO 2 emissions from decomposing food , impacts global climate change .
Here , we calculate the energy content of nationwide food waste from the difference between the US food supply and the food consumed by the population .
The latter was estimated using a validated mathematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten .
We found that US per capita food waste has progressively increased by ∼ 50 % since 1974 reaching more than 1400 kcal per person per day or 150 trillion kcal per year .
Food waste now accounts for more than one quarter of the total freshwater consumption and ∼300 million barrels of oil per year .

Introduction Recent spikes in food prices have led to increasing concern about global food shortages and the apparent need to increase agricultural production [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
Surprisingly little discussion has been devoted to the issue of food waste .
Quantifying food waste at a national level is difficult because traditional methods rely on structured interviews , measurement of plate waste , direct examination of garbage , and application of inferential methods using waste factors measured in sample populations and applied across the food system [ 3 ] – [ 6 ] .
In contrast , national agricultural production , utilization , and net external trade are tracked and codified in detailed food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) [ 7 ] .
The food balance sheets provide a comprehensive assessment of the national food supply , including alcohol and beverages , adjusted for any change of food stocks over the reference period [ 8 ] .
Since 1974 , there has been a progressive increase in the per capita US food supply .
Over the same period , there has also been an increase of body weight as manifested by the US obesity epidemic .
We sought to estimate the energy content of food waste by comparing the US food supply data with the calculated food consumed by the US population .
Energy from ingested food supports basal metabolism and physical activities , both of which are functions of body weight .
Surplus ingested energy is stored in the body and is reflected by a change of body weight .
Because the average body weight of the US population has been increasing over the past 30 years , it is not immediately clear how much of the increased food supply was ingested by the population .
Quantifying the food intake underlying an observed change of body weight requires knowing the energy cost of tissue deposition and the increased cost of physical activity and metabolic rate with weight gain .
Here , we develop and validate a mathematical model of human energy expenditure that includes all of these factors and used the model to calculate the average increase of food intake underlying the observed increase of average adult body weight in the US since 1974 as measured by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) [ 9 ] .
Results Figure 1A shows the increase of average body weight among US adults over the past 30 years ( Δ ) .
Assuming no change of physical activity , Figure 1B shows our model predicted average food intake ( solid curve ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( dashed curves ) underlying the observed weight gain ( see Methods for model details ) .
Figure 1B also plots the US food supply data from the FAO food balance sheets ( ○ ) [ 7 ] and the US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) food availability data adjusted for wastage ( ▪ ) [ 10 ] over the period 1974 –2003 .
Figure 1C shows the progressive increase of per capita food waste in America ( solid curve ) calculated by subtracting the model predicted average food intake from the FAO per capita food supply data .
In 1974 approximately 900 kcal per person per day was wasted whereas in 2003 Americans wasted ∼ 1400 kcal per person per day or ∼ 150 trillion kcal per year .
Figure 1C shows that our estimate of the increasing energy content of US food waste is corroborated by the parallel increase of the per capita annual mass of municipal solid food waste ( ▴ ) calculated from data supplied by the US Environmental Protection Agency [ 11 ] .
Municipal solid food waste accounts for ∼ 30 % of the total wasted food energy assuming that solid food from the US diet has an energy density of 1.9 kcal / g [ 12 ] .
Figure 1D shows that food waste has progressively increased from about 30 % of the available food supply in 1974 to almost 40 % in recent years ( solid curve ) whereas the USDA estimate of food waste ( calculated by subtracting the USDA food availability data adjusted for spoilage and wastage from the FAO food supply data ) was an approximately constant proportion of the total food supply ( ▪ ) .
While the USDA estimate of food waste was within 5 % of our calculation in 1974 , it was ∼ 25 % too low in 2003 .

Discussion
The calculated progressive increase of food waste suggests that the US obesity epidemic has been the result of a “ push effect ” of increased food availability and marketing with Americans being unable to match their food intake with the increased supply of cheap , readily available food .
Thus , addressing the oversupply of food energy in the US may help curb the obesity epidemic as well as decrease food waste , which has profound environmental consequences .
Assuming that agriculture utilizes about 70 % of the freshwater supply [ 13 ] , our calculations imply that more than one quarter of total freshwater use is accounted for by wasted food .
Furthermore , given that the average farm requires 3 kcal of fossil fuel energy to produce 1 kcal of food ( before accounting for energy requirements of food processing and transportation ) [ 14 ] , wasted food accounts for ∼300 million barrels of oil per year representing ∼ 4 % of the total US oil consumption in 2003 [ 15 ] .
In addition to this wasteful consumption of fossil fuels and their direct impact on climate change , food waste rotting in landfills produces substantial quantities of methane [ 16 ] – a gas with 25 fold more potent global warming potential than CO 2 [ 17 ] which would have been the primary end product had the food been eaten and metabolized by humans .
Our food waste estimate resulted from subtracting the calculated average food energy intake from the food supply of the US population .
Thus , there are two potential sources of error in our food waste estimate .
First , the FAO food balance sheets were the source of our estimate of the US food supply [ 7 ] .
The accuracy of food balance sheets has been questioned , especially for developing nations with a relatively high reliance on subsistence farming whose products rarely enter the marketplace and are therefore are difficult to account [ 8 ] , [ 18 ] .
While such issues are certainly less problematic for affluent nations like the US , there remain significant uncertainties regarding the absolute energy content of the food supply [ 8 ] , [ 18 ] .
However , our results rely primarily on the observed progressive increase of the food supply rather than its absolute level .
Thus , unless the uncertainties of the US food supply data are systematically biased to progressively overestimate food supply at later dates , then our conclusions about the progressive increase of food waste remain valid .
The second source of error in our calculation of food waste results from our mathematical model estimates of average food intake .
The fact that average body weight of the US population has increased in parallel with the increasing food supply raises the question of how much of the additional available food was actually ingested by the population .
Without an accurate mathematical model of human metabolism , we could not determine how increasing food intake quantitatively translates into a change of body weight .
Figure 2A demonstrates that our model accurately calculated the energy intake changes underlying the observed weight gain in two controlled over - feeding experiments [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] and Figure 2B shows that our model accurately predicted the relationship between weight change and energy expenditure in longitudinal data from a cohort of Pima Indians after a 3.6 year follow - up [ 21 ] .
Compared to the 30 year time course of the NHANES data , we acknowledge that our model validation results are somewhat limited .
Nevertheless , our model includes all of the main contributors to how food intake impacts body weight and we tested the robustness of our conclusions to uncertainties of the assumed parameter values by Monte Carlo sampling over parameter sets ( see Methods ) to generate the 95 % confidence intervals ( dashed curves in Figure 1 ) .
Furthermore , our estimate of a ∼ 50 % increase of per capita food waste over the past 30 years is paralleled by a similar increase of per capita municipal solid food waste as depicted in Figure 1C thereby providing independent corroboration of our findings .

Our estimates of food waste likely represent lower bounds since we did not simulate the effects of a progressive decrease of physical activity that may have contributed to the US obesity epidemic [ 22 ] .
However , some investigators contend that physical activity has not declined in the past few decades [ 23 ] which is in accordance with our model assumption .
We have also not corrected the per capita adult food availability given that children consume less food than adults on an absolute basis .
Accounting for both of these factors would increase the calculated food waste and therefore our estimates are conservative .
Our calculation of food wasted by the US population does not rely on direct measurements of waste produced by small groups that often know they are being investigated [ 6 ] nor individual assessments of food intake which are known to significantly underestimate actual food consumption [ 24 ] .
Furthermore , inferential methods are prone to cumulative errors when using assumed food waste factors applied to various stages along the food system [ 3 ] – [ 5 ] .
Previous estimates of food waste using these traditional methods have typically concluded that about one third of food mass is wasted [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
The USDA estimate that 27 % of food is wasted is acknowledged to be an underestimate [ 4 ] .
Therefore , the USDA food availability data is known to overstate the amount of food that people actually ingest [ 25 ] .
Our results imply that the assumption of a roughly constant proportion of food waste calculated by the USDA has become progressively worse over time .
The principle of energy conservation implies that the energy content of food is closely related to the energy requirements for agricultural production as well as the methane and CO 2 emissions produced by decomposition of wasted food .
Thus , the energy content of wasted food may be a more important environmental index than the mass of wasted food as determined by more traditional methods .
Nevertheless , traditional methods of measuring food waste provide important information about the types of foods wasted and the relative contribution of waste along various points of the supply chain from farm to fork .
Because our methodology calculates food intake by the population and tracks food energy and not food types , we cannot address such issues .
Nevertheless , the progressive deviation of our calculated wasted food energy compared with the USDA adjustment for wastage suggests that traditional methods are increasingly missing large quantities of food waste in America .
Methods
The basis of our mathematical model is the energy balance equation where the rate of change in stored body energy is given by the difference between the metabolizable energy intake rate I and the energy expenditure rate E ( 1 ) where BW is the body weight , and ρ is the energy density of the change in the body weight .
We can express the energy expenditure rate as ( 2 ) where K is a constant , γ FFM = 22 kcal / kg/ day and γ F = 3.2 kcal / kg / day are the regression coefficients relating resting metabolic rate versus fat - free mass ( FFM ) and fat mass ( F ) , respectively [ 26 ] .
Physical activity energy expenditure is proportional to body weight for most activities [ 27 ] and δ represents the level of physical activity .
The parameter β accounts for the adaptation of energy expenditure during a diet perturbation ΔI and is 180 kcal / kg and is 230 kcal / kg account for the biochemical cost of tissue deposition [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] assuming that the change of FFM is primarily accounted for by body protein and its associated water [ 30 ] .
We note that FFM , F , I , BW , T and δ are all functions of time .
Consider a population where each individual 's weight change obeys equation ( 1 ) with their own individual intake and expenditure functions .
We take a sample sum over ( 1 ) to obtain ( 3 ) where each subject is indexed by i , N is the number of subjects in the population , and is the rate of change of energy stored in the body .
Dividing both sides of equation ( 3 ) by N , gives us the sample mean of the population for all terms of the energy balance equation ( 1 ) : ( 4 ) Since FFM = BW–F , we can rewrite equation ( 4 ) as ( 5 ) For the first NHANES phase from 1971 – 1974 , we assumed that people were approximately weight - stable corresponding to a state of energy balance .
Using the fact that and , energy balance implies that the following equation must hold when the system is in an initial state of energy balance such that : ( 6 ) Therefore , assuming that the covariance of physical activity and body weight and the covariance of the parameter β with changes of food intake are approximately constant , substitution of equation 6 into equation 5 gives : ( 7 ) where the average value of the parameter β = 0.24 was determined using under - feeding studies [ 29 ] .
To estimate the rate of change of stored energy we consider fat and fat - free mass changes separately : ( 8 ) where = 9400 kcal / kg and = 1800 kcal / kg are the energy densities for changes in fat and fat - free masses , respectively [ 30 ] .
The relative change of FFM and F can be described by the Forbes theory of body composition change : ( 9 ) where C = 10.4 kg is a parameter describing how body composition changes as a function of the initial body fat mass , F 0 [ 31 ] .
To calculate the value of the parameter α we required an estimate of the initial average body fat mass which was not directly measured in NHANES .
We therefore estimated initial body fat mass from the body mass index ( BMI ) via the equations published by Jackson et al . [ 32 ] for men and women : ( 10 ) where the mean values are taken over the men and women populations respectively .
The population mean for the fat mass is then given by a weighted average of that of the men and women , , where is the proportion of women in the NHANES population .
This initial average fat mass is then used in equation ( 9 ) to calculate α = 0.54 .
Equation 9 implies that : ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) Therefore , substituting equations 11 and 12 into equation 7 gives the change of energy intake underlying the observed increase of average body weight : ( 13 ) Using the nominal parameter values and assuming no change of physical activity , equation 13 can be represented as : ( 13 )
The first term of equation 14 evaluates to < 10 kcal / d for the NHANES data since the rate of change of average body weight was only ∼ 9.5 ×10 −4 kg/d .
The second term evaluates to ∼ 220 kcal/d for the NHANES data since the change of average body weight was ∼ 10 kg between 1974 and 2003 .
Our mathematical model was previously demonstrated to give accurate results in situations of underfeeding and body weight loss [ 29 ] .
In the context of weight gain , we validated our model by predicting the changes of energy intake in the controlled feeding experiments of Diaz et al . [ 20 ] and Bouchard et al . [ 19 ] who overfed subjects by 1500±400 kcal/d and 840 kcal / d for 42 and 100 days , respectively .
Figure 2A shows that using the observed weight changes , our model predicted that energy intake was increased by 1700±370 kcal/d and 750±230 kcal /d for the Diaz and Bouchard studies , respectively , which corresponds well with their actual intakes .
While these results give us some confidence in the validity of our model in response to weight gain , we note that the controlled over - feeding experiments were conducted in a small number subjects over a relatively short period of time .
We could only find one study that measured longitudinal changes of energy expenditure with weight gain over extended time periods [ 21 ] .
In that study , Weyer et al. investigated a cohort of Pima Indian subjects with an average 3.6 year follow - up and Figure 2B plots the best - fit regression line to the measured changes of energy expenditure ( via indirect calorimetry ) versus weight change [ 21 ] .
Figure 2B also shows our model predictions ( ♦ ) of energy expenditure change as a function of body weight change in response to 3.6 years of over - and under - feeding to various degrees .
While the model results correspond well with the regression line fit to the indirect calorimetry data , it is apparent that the model predicts a slightly greater slope than was indicated in the best - fit regression line .
We hypothesize that the discrepancy is due to the limited physical activity of the study subjects during the measurement period inside the indirect calorimetry chamber .
Since physical activity energy expenditure is proportional to body weight , decreased physical activity would result in a decreased slope of the relationship between energy expenditure versus weight change .
To calculate the absolute level of energy intake corresponding to the NHANES data , we assumed that the average initial energy intake was = 2100 kcal / d calculated using the energy requirement equations of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [ 33 ] for a sedentary population corresponding to the average demographics of the initial adult NHANES population .
The initial value for also closely matched the USDA estimated per capita food availability in 1974 adjusted for spoilage and wastage [ 10 ] .
Our estimate of the food waste was given by : ( 14 ) where FA is the per capita food energy availability as estimated from US food balance sheets provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization [ 7 ] .
To investigate how our calculation of food waste compares to current USDA estimates , we compared our estimated energy intake , , with the USDA per capita food availability corrected for spoilage and wastage .
To calculate the confidence intervals of our calculations , each model parameter value was randomly selected from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviations given in Table 1 .
The parameter ranges were estimated using the reported uncertainties of the measured parameter values , where available .
In the case of the Forbes constant , C , and the physical activity parameter , δ , we chose a 50 % uncertainty to reflect the potential for high variability of these parameters across the population .
We performed 105 simulations and report the mean and 95 % confidence intervals for the predicted food intake and waste calculations .

Obama blocks climate change agreement
18 November 2009
In the course of his current trip to Asia , US President Barack Obama has insured that the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference , due to take place in Copenhagen December 7 - 18 , will be nothing more than a talk shop .
An estimated 40 world leaders and representatives of 190 nations are due to take part in the Copenhagen conference , which has the task of producing a new agenda for tackling global warming to replace the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 .
Last Sunday , Obama gave his consent to a plan worked out at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Singapore that delays any binding agreements on climate change until next year at the earliest .
The deal was supported by many of the world ’s leading greenhouse gas emitters , including the United States , China , Russia , Japan , Indonesia and South Korea .
According to figures published by the International Energy Agency , China was the leading emitter of carbon dioxide in 2007 , closely followed by the US .
When it comes to carbon dioxide emission per head of the population , however , the US is far ahead of any other country , with 19.1 tons , dwarfing China ’s 4.6 tons .
As was the case with the Kyoto Protocol — which expires in 2012 and was never ratified by the American government — the US is playing the main role in undermining any binding agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
Obama has adopted the Bush administration ’s policy of demanding that China accept binding targets before the US takes any measures .
The hypocrisy of Obama when it comes to the issue of climate change is brazen .
In September , Obama addressed a United Nations conference , proclaiming “ the historic recognition on behalf of the American people and their government [ that ] we understand the gravity of the climate threat . ”
Aside from a change in rhetoric , however , Obama ’s policy differs little from that of his predecessor , on climate change as with everything else .
After his talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Monday , Obama declared that the United States and China were seeking a deal at the Copenhagen summit that would “ rally the world . ”
The agreement struck in Copenhagen should have “ immediate operational effect , ” he added .
In fact , just one day previously Obama had struck a deal with the Chinese president at the APEC meeting that robs the Copenhagen summit of any substance .
This is how the US administration seeks to “ rally the world . ”
Obama has still not confirmed whether he will attend the conference in Copenhagen .
While leading industrial nations pointedly refuse to undertake measures to tackle climate change , environmental experts and scientists are warning of the grave consequences of a failure to curb greenhouse emissions .
At an international climate change conference held in Oxford , England at the end of September , the German climatologist , Stefan Rahmstorf , declared that a one - meter rise in sea levels was likely this century .
If world governments do not arrive at effective agreements to halt global warming , the rise in sea levels will be even more dramatic .
A sea level change of just one meter will have an enormously disruptive impact on a large portion of the world ’s population that resides in coastal areas .
Low - lying coasts and islands will be submerged , dispossessing tens of millions of people .
A two - meter sea rise will flood or submerge entire cities .
In the case of the United States , such an increase in sea levels will wipe out parts of urban areas in San Francisco , Los Angeles , New Jersey and New York .
Rising temperatures and the associated disruption of weather patterns will have devastating consequences for agricultural production , water distribution and disease management worldwide .
As always , the poor will feel the effects most acutely .
The inability of the major capitalist powers to agree to any effective countermeasures is rooted in two factors , both inherent in the capitalist system .
First , though climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution , international cooperation is prevented by the conflicting interests of different nation - states .
These conflicts have been intensified by the economic crisis .
Despite the efforts by Obama to put a positive gloss on his talks this week with President Hu , the differences between the two countries are considerable and continue to mount .
China is Washington ’s leading creditor , as America ’s budget deficit soars to a record $ 1.42 trillion .
The US and Chinese administrations accuse one another of maintaining cheap currencies to further their interests , and both countries are involved in tit - for - tat punitive trade sanctions .
Similar rivalries are growing between other leading world economies .
Every major power fears that any concession with regard to environmental protection could disadvantage its domestic business interests in the furious struggle for the domination of world markets .
Second , a rational , scientific response to climate change is blocked by the subordination of every aspect of economic and social life to the principle of private profit and the interests of the corporate and financial elite .
In a report dealing with the issue of developing vitally needed renewable nontoxic energy sources , the UN estimated that governments worldwide would need to invest $ 500 - 600 billion per year .
While this sum is large , it is still a fraction of the funds made available by the US government to bail out its banks ( as much as $ 23 trillion by one account ) .
Across the globe , capitalist governments , following the lead of the US , have made clear that their priority is profit returns for big business and the banks , not a healthy planet .
The option favored by Obama himself is a free market approach to global warming , involving “ cap and trade ” measures , whereby the government would provide huge incentives to corporations to modestly reduce carbon emissions , while turning pollution into a tradeable commodity .
The failure of major capitalist nations to undertake any serious measures to combat growing environmental dangers is an indictment of the capitalist system .
It is also a blow to all those environmentalists and “ Greens ” who argue that it is possible to pressure capitalist governments to undertake “ environmentally friendly ” policies .
Climate change and other pressing environmental problems can be solved only through the utilization of mankind ’s intellectual , productive and financial resources as part of a rationally organized , democratic effort carried out on an international scale .
This requires the socialist reorganization of society .

Part of the BBC Christmas 2009 season .
The health bill that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is bringing to a vote ( H.R. 3962 ) is 1,990 pages .
Here are some of the details you need to know .
Anyone who has seen Hunger , Steve McQueen 's harrowing film about the Maze prison hunger strike , will have some idea of just how horrific it is to die by starvation .
Bobby Sands , a fit 27 - year - old man , survived 66 days without food .
Aminatou Haidar , a delicate 42 - year - old , is on the 29th day of her hunger strike ; with a perforated ulcer and a constitution weakened by years of imprisonment and torture , there are fears that she will not survive much longer .
She is now too weak to stand , and the director of Lanzarote hospital , Domingo de Guzmán , has warned that Haidar 's life expectancy is now " hours or days rather than weeks " .
Listing her symptoms as hypotension , nausea , anaemia , muscular - skeletal atrophy and gastric haemorrhaging , Dr Guzman believes she is nearing an irreversible deterioration that could result in her death even if she were to abandon the hunger strike .
But abandoning her strike is not something Haidar , a human rights activist nominated for the Nobel peace prize , will countenance unless her single demand – to be allowed to return to her country – is met .
Haidar has been on hunger strike in Lanzarote airport since being deported there from her home in Western Sahara on 15 November .
Two days earlier she had flown back to Laayoune , the largest city in Western Sahara , from New York , where she had picked up the Train Foundation 's Civil Courage human rights award .
On her arrival in Laayoune she wrote her address on her landing card as being in " Western Sahara " rather than " Morocco " .
As a Saharawi , she has never recognised Moroccan sovereignty over her native land which has been occupied by Morocco in breach of international law for over 34 years .
In the past Morocco has chosen to overlook her numerous " landing card protests " , but on this occasion she was interrogated , stripped of her passport and expelled to the volcanic Canary Island which lies less than 80 miles off the African coast .
Spain offered to give Haidar refugee status or Spanish citizenship so she could be allowed to return home , but she rejected both options on the grounds that she did not want to become " a foreigner in her own land " .
According to Human Rights Watch , her forced expulsion breached Article 12 ( 4 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) , ratified by Morocco , which makes it clear that no one can be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter their own country .
In addition , by preventing her return to Western Sahara , Spanish authorities may have breached both Spanish national law and Article 2 of Protocol 4 of the European convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
Article 12 ( 2 ) of the ICCPR also stipulates that everyone shall be free to leave any country .
On 4 December , perhaps after having been made aware of the legal situation , Spain laid on a private aircraft to carry Haidar back to Laayoune .
As she boarded the plane with Agustin Santos , of the Spanish foreign ministry , it seemed as if Haidar had won a significant victory .
However , celebrations among Saharawis and campaigners around the world were short - lived when it emerged that the Spanish had not received any agreement from Morocco to allow her return .
In a hastily organised press conference held soon after tearful supporters had watched Haidar being stretchered back into the airport terminal , Santos claimed that Spain had attempted " to facilitate the exercise of her right to return to her country " and could do no more .
This statement was greeted with incredulity by the Spanish media , and the Zapatero government has come under increasing internal and international pressure to do more to resolve the crisis .
Indeed , today Hillary Clinton was due to discuss the issue with Spain 's foreign minister , Miguel Angel Moratinos .
Last week the UN secretary general , Ban -Ki moon , urged the Moroccan foreign minister to re-admit Haidar .
The European Union has also urged Morocco to " meet its human rights obligations " .
Morocco has taken a firm line on the matter , with the foreign minister , Taieb Fassi-Fihri , insisting that Haidar had " disowned her identity and her nationality " and " must accept , on her own , the legal and moral consequences which result from this behaviour " .
Morocco has also demanded that she offer an apology for questioning Morocco 's claim to sovereignty over what is a former Spanish colony – a claim that has not been recognised by a single nation and was rejected by the international court of justice .
Haidar 's deportation has been condemned by governments , civil society groups and human rights organisations across the world .
Her action has raised awareness of the forgotten injustice perpetrated against her people , but the cost may be high .
Imelda Gonzalez , one of many campaigners who travelled to Lanzarote to offer their support , is aware that Haidar is irreplaceable .
" Western Sahara has had so many martyrs , they do not need another .
Her death would be a tragic loss to the world and its leaders must act together and act quickly to save Aminatou . "
As high - level discussions take place around the world , Haidar is on the brink of death .

Majority of Britons say creationism SHOULD be taught in schools
More than half the population believes children should be told about creationism - the belief that God created the world - in school science lessons , a poll reveals today .
Some 54 per cent of Britons want biology teachers to discuss ' alternative perspectives ' on human origins alongside traditional explanations of evolution .
They also want children to be told about intelligent design , the idea that aspects of the universe are too complex to be explained by science and natural selection .
Critics say this is just creationism under another name .
The Creation of Adam : Around 21 per cent of Britons said just evolutionary theory should be taught in science lessons
The findings , in a survey commissioned by the British Council , come amid growing pressure from religious groups for schools to teach creationism .
Last year , leading science educationalist Michael Reiss lost his job as director of education at the Royal Society - Britain 's science academy - in a backlash from members after he said science teachers should address creationism in the classroom .
The Mori poll , which questioned nearly 1,000 Britons as part of a worldwide study of 10,000 people , was published by the British Council as as part of its Darwin Now programme , marking 150 years since the publication of Charles Darwin 's work On The Origin of Species .
Members of the public in Argentina , China , Egypt , India , Mexico , Russia , South Africa , Spain and the United States were also questioned .
Some 21 per cent of Britons said only evolutionary theory should be taught , while 54 per cent said children should hear rival explanations .
Britain 's support for teaching other theories alongside evolution was higher than in any of the other countries apart from Argentina and Mexico - but had the lowest proportion - at six per cent - believing that other theories should be taught in preference to evolution .
National curriculum guidelines say creationism has no place in science lessons .
Worldwide , the survey reveals just over four in 10 ( 43 per cent ) of people believe that evolution should be taught alongside other theories in science lessons , while a fifth ( 20 per cent ) said only evolution should be taught .
In the US , almost a quarter of those questioned ( 23 per cent ) said either other theories but not evolution should be taught , or that no theories should be taught .
This figure was 28 per cent in China and 21 per cent in South Africa .
Lewis Wolpert , emeritus professor of biology at University College London and vice - president of the British Humanist Association , told The Guardian : ' I am appalled .
' It shows how ignorant the public is .
Intelligent design and creationism have no connection with science and are purely religious concepts .
There is no evidence for them at all .
They must be kept out of science lessons . '
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at UCL , said : ' This shows the danger of religions being allowed to buy schools , hijack lessons and pretend that they have anything useful to say about science - which , by definition , they do not .
' The figure seems much too high , although no doubt there is a substantial minority that does think this .'

PRINCETON , NJ -- In Americans ' estimation , the top three political winners of 2009 are all women closely linked with the Obama administration : Michelle Obama , Hillary Clinton , and Sonia Sotomayor .
Among these , Michelle Obama has the broadest support with 73 % calling her a " winner " in U.S. politics this year and 21 % a " loser . "
However , Clinton 's rating is nearly as positive .
President Barack Obama , himself , also falls in the political winners circle , although the percentage calling him a political loser is somewhat higher than is seen for the three women .
The picture is quite different for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , whom half of all Americans identify as a political loser .
More than half say the same of Rep. Joe Wilson ( the representative who yelled " You lie ! " to Obama at a joint session of Congress ) , as well as Gov. Mark Sanford ( who is losing his wife and is under a state ethics investigation over an admitted extramarital affair ) , White House party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi , and the Republicans in Congress generally .
In between the clear - cut political winners and losers are a number of public figures with more mixed reviews .
Nearly half of Americans ( 46 % ) call Sarah Palin a winner , but slightly more ( 49 % ) call her a loser .
About equal numbers of Americans call Ben Bernanke ( Time magazine 's choice for person of the year ) and radio talk host Glenn Beck winners and losers , while a large segment has no opinion about either man .
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is more widely viewed as a loser than a winner , but not to as great a degree as Pelosi -- possibly in part because of his high " no opinion " rating .
It comes as little surprise that Americans ' perspective on this year 's political winners and losers is highly partisan .
However , beyond the basic pattern of Democrats being more likely to consider Democratic leaders " winners " and so forth , there are some interesting findings at the margins .
Democrats are much more unified in considering Michelle Obama , Hillary Clinton , and Barack Obama winners ( each called a winner by at least 90 % of Democrats ) than Republicans are in calling Sarah Palin a winner ( at 76 % among Republicans ) .
The partisan ratings of Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans in Congress are a near mirror image of each other .
However , Republicans and Democrats broadly agree on the classifications of Mark Sanford and the Salahi couple as political losers .
Identifying the " winners " and " losers " emerging on Election Day is clear cut , but a far more subjective assessment in the context of the political gamesmanship that goes on in between elections .
Now that the presidential election in which the McCain - Palin ticket was defeated is more than a year past , Sarah Palin is nearly as likely to be viewed as a political winner as a loser .
Hillary Clinton lost a bitterly fought primary for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination , but has been visibly filling her role as Secretary of State and has risen above the political fray in a way the president has not , with more viewing Clinton as a political winner than Barack Obama .
Survey Methods

Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
An amateur fractal programmer has discovered a new 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .
Daniel
White 's new creation is based on similar mathematics as the original 2D Mandelbrot set , but its infinite intricacy extends into all three dimensions , revealing fractal worlds of amazing complexity and beauty at every level of magnification .
White 's 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .

The Mandelbrot set ( top left ) and details you get when repeatedly zooming in .

The original 2D Mandelbrot set , named after Benoît Mandelbrot who discovered it in the 1970s , is arguably the most famous fractal of them all .
Unlike ordinary 2D shapes , whose outlines typically become smooth when you look at them closely enough even if they look crinkly at first , the Mandelbrot set displays the same level of complexity at every scale .
Zooming in on it is like going on a never - ending journey into hidden worlds .
This infinite complexity , together with a certain level of self - similarity — you can find copies of the original Mandelbrot set appearing again and again on smaller and smaller scales as you zoom in — is what earns the Mandelbrot set the name fractal .
An existing 3D version of Mandelbrot set .
There is fractal structure in the horizontal plane , but in the vertical plane the object is smooth .
Several ways of creating 3D versions of the Mandelbrot set already exist , either by modifying the original 2D version , for example spinning it around an axis , or by translating the underlying mathematics into higher dimensions .
But in most cases the " fractal - ness " of the resulting images does not extend into all three dimensions .
You will see fractal structures when you look across the object along certain directions , but along other directions what you see is disappointingly smooth .
White 's new Mandelbulb , however , does appear to have genuine fractal features no matter which way you look at it , so in terms of fractal - ness , it 's arguably got the biggest claim yet to being a true 3D analogue of the original Mandelbrot set .
The classical Mandelbrot set
So how did White produce his new beast ?
The classical two - dimensional Mandelbrot set is based on relatively simple mathematical objects : quadratic functions , like , for example ,
Rather than only considering ordinary real numbers for the variable , you allow it to also take complex numbers as values , that is numbers of the form , where .
The termis called the real part of the number , and the termis called the imaginary part of the number .
You can add and multiply two complex numbersandas you would ordinary numbers , grouping together those terms that haveas a coefficient :
Any real number doubles up as a complex number whose imaginary part is equal to 0 , for exampleSimilarly , a complex number can have its real part equal to 0 , for example .
( You can find out more about complex numbers in our teacher package . )
It now makes sense to consider a quadratic function like
Fixed points , cycles and escaping to infinity
as a function of a complex variableFor example , lettingyou getlettinggivesand lettinggives
But complex numbers also have a geometric interpretation : the number corresponds to the point on the plane with coordinates .
It 's this geometric interpretation that gives rise to the 2D Mandelbrot set .
Here is how it is generated :
Take any complex number and mark it on the plane as the point .
Now look at the quadratic function
and see what happens when you letand iterate the function : in other words , you look at the sequence , and so on .
First let 's start with , giving , which was our initial example above .
Here , so for the next step in the iteration you getand for the next step you getand so on : the point 0 is a fixed point of the function .
Now look at , soIn this case you getApplying the function again givesanother iteration givesfollowed bySo whileis not a fixed point of this second quadratic function , it does not go very far : after two iterations of the function , the sequence becomes trapped in a 2 - cycle , forever oscillating betweenand
This is in stark contrast to what happens for , where
Here we haveetc .
In this case the sequence of numbers does not become trapped anywhere , but moves further and further away from our initial point .
To phrase this in technical language , the orbit of 0 escapes to infinity .
It turns out that no matter which complex value you choose for , one of two things happen : either the sequence of numbers you get when you iterate the function
from the initial pointescapes to infinity ( as in the last example ) , or it remains confined to a bounded region of the plane ( as in the first two examples ) .
If you colour black all the pointsthat create bounded sequences , you get the Mandelbrot set .
( You can find out more in thearticle Unveiling the Mandelbrot set . )
So the secret of the classical two - dimensional Mandelbrot set lies in the fact that complex numbers , which can be added and multiplied , can also be visualised as points on the plane .
The addition and multiplication rules mean that it makes sense to look at functions like for complex numbers and , and the geometric interpretation means that you can mark on the plane those points for which the function behaves in a particular way .
The 3D version
A detail of White 's 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .

One way of creating a three - dimensional version of the Mandelbrot set is therefore to invent a new class of numbers , which correspond to points in three - dimensional space , rather than just the plane .
Then define some meaningful way of adding and multiplying these numbers , so that it makes sense to consider functions such as .
You can now play the same game as before .
Take a number , corresponding to a point in three - dimensional space , and see what happens when you iterate the function , starting from the initial value , corresponding to the point .
If the sequence of values you get from the iteration does not escape to infinity , your point lies in your 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .
White and Nylander 's formula for a 3D analogue of complex numbers Consider the points and in 3D space .
Define addition as follows :
The formula for raising a number representing the point to the power is where
It now makes sense to consider functions of the form where and represent points in 3D space .
The formula for raising a number representing the pointto thepower iswhere
It now makes sense to consider functions of the formwhereandrepresent points in 3D space .
This is exactly what White did , using a 3D analogue of complex numbers , and tinkering around with ways of defining addition and multiplication that are akin to addition and multiplication of complex numbers .
The initial results were slightly disappointing in terms of fractal detail .
" I scoured everywhere to find signs of the 3D beast , " says White , " but nothing turned up .
Pretty 3D fractals were everywhere , but nothing quite as organic and rich as the original 2D Mandelbrot set . "
Eventually the mathematician Paul Nylander came to White 's rescue .
He suggested to adjust the " squaring part " in the formula to a higher power .
Nylander and White struck gold with the power 8 , that is with the formula
The resulting three - dimensional Mandelbulb seems to exhibit fractal detail that would impress even the most stringent of fractal hunters .
It 's now a task for mathematicians to investigate the exact fractal nature of the beast , and to see whether it is of genuine mathematical interest , rather than just a stunning visual oddity .
The pretty pictures that arise in this area of mathematics conceal a variety of mathematical concepts that mathematicians are eager to explore further .
Many will argue that there is no single 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .
It all depends on what you want to generalise to higher dimensions — particular fractal structures , or other aspects underlying the mathematics of these dynamical systems .
Another detail of White 's 3D version of the Mandelbrot set .

Meanwhile , White 's quest continues .
Having to move all the way up to the eighth power to get the required intricacy is slightly unsatisfactory , and it suggests that one could do better by modifying the technique .
What 's more , White 's Mandelbulb still contains some " smeared - out " areas that are n't quite as intricate as one might wish for .
" As exquisite as the detail is in our discovery , there 's good reason to believe that it is n't the real McCoy , " he says .
" That means the biggest secret is still under wraps , open to anyone who has the inclination , and appreciation for how cool this thing would look .
For sure I 'll still keep looking . "

Tell me if this sounds familiar – you wake up , flip open your [ laptop | organizer | cell phone ] – and find dozens of unpleasant tasks staring you in the face :
Complete Project “ Motif ” For Jack
Follow up with Deb , Make Decision About [ random scribbles ]
Organize paperwork ( what does this even mean ? )
Have you been there – waking up to a bunch of items on your todo list , and you don ’ t know where to start ?
Imagine how much better you ’d feel if you could get started on it right away , and knock off a couple of those tasks – instantly , guaranteed .
Immediately crossing some tasks off my todo list every morning is one strategy I use to kick start my day .
If you ’ve got a todo list that does n’t seem to budge , it just might work for you too .
I call it using “ gimme ” tasks .
What The Heck Is A Gimme Task ?
In golf , players aim to hit the ball onto the green and then putt it into the hole .
In casual play , when one player ’s golf ball is close enough to the hole , he can elect to “ gimme . ”
If the other players agree , the player just picks up the ball and adds one stroke to his score .
Basically , there ’s no need to waste time lining up for a putt that a player will almost surely make .
A gimme task is along the same lines : it ’s a task that I am guaranteed to complete .
It ’s something that I know I can do , and regularly accomplish on a daily basis – but I put it on my todo list anyway .
My gimme tasks include :
Brush Teeth
Shave
Take Vitamins
Practice Guitar
This way when I start my day , I can immediately check a couple ( arguably productive ) things off my todo list – and then using that momentum , work on the rest of my task list .
Hey , Suddenly My Todo List Does n’t Look So Bad !
Part of it is a psychological trick too – if I wake up , and there are 40 items on my todo list that looks daunting .
If I immediately knock 10 of them off because they ’re gimmes , suddently 30 does n’t look so bad ( since I started out with 40 ) .

Multiple sources in the industry are reporting that it will be announced later today that David Richards ’s Prodrive operation will be acquiring the Renault F1 team .
The team will be known as Prodrive Renault for the next two years and then it is anticipated that the whole operation will be rebadged as Aston Martin .
The team was , of course , run by Richards back in the Benetton era .
He took charge of what was then Benetton Formula in September 1997 but departed a year later after failing to convince the Benetton Family to sell some of the shares in the team to Ford , in exchange for a factory supply of engines .
He went on to become the team principal of British American Racing until Honda took over at the end of 2004 .
Since then Richards has tried several times to get control of an F1 team and in 2006 Prodrive was granted an F1 entry for 2008 , with the plan being to buy a McLaren chassis and Mercedes - Benz engine .
A change in the rules that stopped this happening put an end to that project .
Prodrive is also believed to have considered applying for an entry last year but decide against the idea because it was not keen to use Cosworth engines .
Gordon Brown warned Hamid Karzai today that he needed to tackle corruption in Afghan politics to keep international support .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
During a meeting at No 10 with UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon , Mr Brown said : " These are important days for Afghanistan when the president is inaugurated .
" We will want him to make clear that he is going to take immediate action on corruption . "
Mr Karzai's victory was declared yesterday after Afghanistan 's Independent Electoral Commission decided to call off this weekend 's second - round presidential ballot , which was triggered by his failure to obtain 50 % of votes in an election in August which was marred by widespread fraud .
The ballot had effectively become meaningless following the withdrawal from the race on Sunday of Mr Karzai 's only remaining rival , former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , who claimed the run - off poll would not be fair .
Mr Brown said Britain wanted to see " a corruption - free government , an inclusive government and a government which will tackle the problem of bringing prosperity to the Afghan people " .
He said that if Mr Karzai was successful in tackling these issues and building up the Afghan military and police force , " that will allow British and other troops to come home " .
He acknowledged that Mr Karzai faced an " extremely challenging " task and said he looked forward to " further indications " from the President about how he would tackle corruption .
He also offered his condolences to the UN following the death of its staff in a recent bombing attack in Kabul .
He said : " We know that UN staff work in difficult and dangerous situations .
Their efforts and their work will never be forgotten . "
Asked if international aid would be conditional on seeing corruption eradicated , he said : " We 'll only give aid to projects we are sure are going to be delivered . "

Setting out the actions he expected the President to take , he said steps should be taken over corrupt officials and district officials must be " free of any stain of corruption " .
He said : " What we want and what he ( Mr Karzai ) now wants is action on corruption , building up the Afghan army and police force and showing that he can bring prosperity to the Afghan people by controlling the drugs trade . "
Mr Ban echoed the Prime Minister 's sentiments , saying : " I want him ( Mr Karzai ) to take all necessary measures to meet the expectations of the Afghan people and government and the international community . "
He said this would involve ensuring " good governance " , eradicating corrupt practices and controlling the drugs trade .
He also urged the returning President to " form a unity government reaching out to all ethnic groups , all political leaders and religious leaders " .
He said he had also met Mr Abdullah and urged him to " act as a responsible political leader " , who , he pointed out , had won a share of the votes in the first round of elections .
He described the attack on the UN base as " heinous " and thanked Mr Brown for his condolences .
But he said his organisation would not be deterred from supporting the Afghan people and their government .
He added : " Ensuring good governance by eradicating corrupt practices should be a key target for this government and that will be the key to earning trust from the international community . "

NOTE : The symbols in this article are broken and replaced with question marks .
I ’m trying to fix it …bear with us , and apologies .
When I was in high school , a friend of mine took it upon himself to chart out the entire timeline of the Back to the Future films in a spiral notebook .
He was a little OCD and worked on this for days .
The goal was not to prove the time travel logic of the film realistically sound –that would have been impossible .
Instead , my friend wanted to attempt to prove that the logic constructed within the movie was sound –that is , that the rules set up in the movie never contradicted themselves .
He ran into some pitfalls and pratfalls , but the proof was fairly compelling .
And even though the logic of photographs from the future slowly changing based on the probability theory is wildly unsound ( in reality ) , it seemed the movie managed to treat these incidents with the same made - up rules throughout all three films .
Good job , Bob Gale !
The entirety of my friend ’s arguments is too dense and complicated to effectively explore in this article .
Today , though , I wanted to bring up a question that came to me last night while watching the third Back to the Future movie .
It ’s a simple question , but one whose answer is surprisingly complicated .
How many Doc Browns exist in the Back to the Future universe ?
Now , we could do this for just about any character , even Marty .
While we only follow one version of our main character , every time the past is changed in any way , a new version of Marty must , in theory , split off .
For example : in Part 2 , our main character Marty drops a sandbag on a group of thugs ’ heads to keep them from mugging the past version of himself ( this is while he is onstage at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance in 1955 – an event originated in the first movie ) .
As Marty Prime ( the past version of our Main Character Marty ) walks off the stage , he sees the thugs onstage and sidesteps them .
This experience is new , so the Marty leaving the stage ceases to be our Main Character Marty in the past and becomes a totally new Marty .
We can assume that the events of his life will play out almost identical to the Marty that we follow throughout all three movies , but there is at least ONE memory that is different –something that never happened to our main character .
Therefore , by definition , there must be at LEAST two Marties in the world of Back to the Future .
Now let ’s move on to our original question .
The only way to do this , I think , is to walk through the entire trilogy of amazing films one at a time .
It all starts out simply enough .
Marty McFly is asked to partake in an experiment by an old and wizened scientist , Doc Brown .
We will call this “ Doc Brown α. ”
This Doc , unfortunately , is gunned down by Libyans just as he sends Marty back in time to 1955 .
In order to get Back … to the FUTURE !
Marty must enlist the help of the past version of Doc Brown ?.
According to the logic of the films , though , the second Marty shows up at 1955 Doc Brown ?’s home , the good Doc is altered immediately and ceases to be Doc Brown ?.
This new character , with a new set of memories triggered by Marty ’s presence , will be known as Doc Brown ß .
Now , for all intents and purposes Doc Brown ?
ceases to exist as the future in which he lived and worked is erased .
Marty has , in effect , erased an entire person .
When Doc Brown ß manages to send Marty Back … to the FUTURE ! , Marty runs to rescue his friend from the Libyans .
Luckily , this is no longer Doc Brown ?
but is Doc Brown ß , and this new Doc has taken measures to protect himself .
I know what you ’re thinking … how do we know that it was n’t Doc Brown ß the whole time , and he simply kept mum about meeting Marty in the past so as to ensure that a paradox did n’t occur ?
This argument would bring the rules of the series more in - line with conventional time - travel theory , but , alas , is not a reality supported by the film .
This is proven by the fact that Marty has significantly changed the future , altering Biff ’s personality and ensuring his father ’s success as a science - fiction author .
So the “ one - reality , one Doc Brown ” theory holds no water .
So far we have two distinct Doc Browns , and our main Doc Brown going into Part 2 is Doc Brown ß.
Doc Brown ß goes into the future and discovers that Marty ’s kids are in trouble .
Then he enlists Marty ’s help to go into the future and rescue them .
Throughout most of Part 2 we are dealing with only Doc Brown ß.
In the future scenes there is no question about the creation of a second Doc Brown because there is no Doc Brown in this time period ( we can assume he ’s dead , having been killed by Mad Dog Tannen in Part 3 … more on that later ) .
When Biff steals the time machine , he changes everything completely , and Doc Brown ß and Marty return to an alternate 1985 .
This is where things get messy .
Somehow there is no alternate Doc Brown within this time period .
You would think that if it were an alternate reality , a separate version of the Doc would exist with the memories of this wildly different world .
Alas , he does not , and I ’m not quite sure why .
Maybe my friend can explain it to me …
But for the purposes of this article , let ’s accept the fact that when Marty and Doc Brown ß travel back to 1955 ( for the second time ) , there is only one Doc Brown that still exists .
But that ’s all about to change .
With the end of Part 2 , Marty and Doc Brown ß again rewrite history in order to delete the alternate and hellish 1985 from existence .
Mainly , they have to steal the sports almanac from 1955 Biff .
In the process of doing this , Doc Brown ends up running into and having a conversation with his 1955 self .
With these new memories , 1955 Doc Brown ß becomes Doc Brown ? .
When Doc Brown ß gets sent into the past , it ’s Doc Brown ?
who helps
Marty travel into the old west to rescue his friend from being shot in the back by Mad Dog Tannen .
When Marty introduces himself in the old west , though , he changes the timeline of Doc Brown ß , and so Doc Brown ß ( who was to die from a gunshot wound ) is changed into Doc Brown ?.
What we would think of as Doc Brown ß ceases to exist in his pure form .
At this point , too , we can assume that Doc Brown ?
is wiped from existence because we are altering the events that MUST occur in order for him to exist .
He can no longer find his own gravestone ( which no longer exists ) and send Marty back to save himself .
So I ’m not really sure how this works in the grand scheme , or how , if he is erased from the future , he could have sent Marty to the past .
Again , issues my friend will have to explain someday .
Let ’s move on .
At this point we are dealing only with Doc Brown ? , and I believe that this Doc is the doc that finishes out the rest of Part 3 .
So the Doc Brown we end up with is actually three people removed with the Doc Brown who starts the series .
All the other three Doc Browns have been erased from existence .
And when you look at it like that , is n’t it a little sad ?
We all proclaim to love this character ( I know I do ) , and Marty goes out of his way to save the guy , but , on an existential level , he ’s actually destroying the man he proclaims to love and replacing him with a similar version .
I guess that ’s why Doc Brown decided that he never should have invented the infernal time machine to start with .
Then again , he goes right out and invents another steam - powered one just so he can show up at the end of Part 3 and give Marty a friggin picture frame … an event that probably erased three or more persons from the face of the space - time continuum .
But it was a nice keepsake , so I guess that ’s fine .
In the end , the audience is n’t thinking about the erased persons and the created versions .
They are n’t thinking about how many life choices and possibilities are deleted by gunning the DeLorean to eighty - eight .
Instead , they ’re just happy that Marty and Doc made it through everything safely .
The truth , though , is that they did n’t .
They were replaced with pod-people who have a different set of memories and behaviors .
These people believe themselves to be the “ real ” Doc Brown and Marty McFly , but they are n’t .
They ’re living with assumed identities .
So let ’s acknowledge the tragedy of the Back to the Future trilogy .
While we celebrate the life and times of Doc Brown ? , let us not forget the sacrifices of Doc Browns ? , ? , and ? , who gave up their existence ( against their wills ) to ensure that Doc Brown ? can jet around the STC with his beloved Clara .
As Marty would say , this is heavy .
UPDATE : There has been some serious discussion in the comments below about whether or not I have forgotten a Doc Brown–that is , the Doc who was committed to a mental institution in the hellish alternate Biff - run 1985 in Part 2 .
The reason for NOT including it was this .
In the original , Marty drastically changes the course of history including the events of his own life .
When he returns to 1985 , he finds himself with a different car and a very different life .
Despite all these changes , there is NO alternate Marty .
How , then , can I assume that there would be an alternate Doc Brown when he returns to another drastically altered 1985 in Part 2 ?
In the original , Marty is unaware of all the changes to his life events , but there is no other Marty .
This begs the question … who was living that alternate life ?
The same question can be asked of Doc Brown in 1985 hell .
We know he was committed to a mental institution , but is there actually a Doc Brown in the institution at the time that Doc returns to this alternate 1985 ?
The rules of the series say no .
I believe the filmmakers put Marty in boarding school and Doc Brown in a mental institution specifically to avoid this question–an unanswerable paradox they had set up with the first movie .
In the end , this can make no sense .
I agree that the intentions of the filmmakers were to imply that there was a doppleganger , mentally deranged Doc Brown in the alternate 1985 , but this does not fit in with the rules of logic set up in the first movie .
It ’s an impossible paradox , but as the Huey would say , “ That ’s the Power of Love . ”

awarded ?
The prize , administered by the
in scientifically controlled tests some form of paranormal power .
Will the $ 1,000,000 Randi Challenge Prize soon beJames Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) , is offered to anyone who can proveSo far , Randi 's prize has not been claimed , but rumour has it that under supervision of the JREF an elaborate telepathy test is being conducted with shocking results .
A JREF staff member , who wishes to remain anonymous , commented on the ongoing tests with the words “ I have never witnessed anything like this , this is deeply disturbing ” .
I subsequently spoke with several investigators involved in the tests , and there is no doubt that the claimants , Dr. Reid M. Bell and his wife Dr. Cora Bell - Tsirelson have accomplished something highly unlikely .
Are we witnessing a statistical glitch , an unlikely strike of luck , or are Mr. And Mrs.
Bell cheating ?
Or is perhaps something weird and unexplainable really happening ?
The JREF remains tight - lipped .
They have not announced any press releases , and also they have carefully refrained from mentioning the ongoing tests at their internet forum .
This so - far has prevented the news reaching a wider public .
Within a month , however , when the tests will be finalized , hell may break loose .
If the two quantum physics postdocs from the UK indeed manage to win the one million dollar prize , they will find themselves in the media spotlights to an extend that may well be unprecedented .
Currently , however , Cora and Reid continue to live a normal uneventful life in their apartment in London .
Two days ago , I managed to get in contact with this charming couple .
During the one - and - a - half hour interview , I became aware that neither Reid nor Cora were in any way surprised by the results obtained at the JREF tests .
Yet , the two revealed some truly spectacular feats .
Reid explains the tests being conducted : “ We have agreed with the JREF a very specific test protocol .
This protocol stipulates us being separated for the duration of the experiment , such that no communication is possible .
During this period of separation , we play a repetitive coordination game .
To be successful , we have to do so with a 100 % success rate .
The JREF has stated that accomplishing this without any communication , would require true magic and should be considered proof of telepathic powers .
We have succeeded in a preliminary test , and when we repeat the same 100 % success rate in a subsequent formal test , we will earn the million dollar prize . ”
Cora adds : “ The coordination game is fairly simple .
In each round of the game we both have to color cells of a 3x3 table with red and green colors .
I have to color three cells in a column such that they contain an odd number of red cells .
Meanwhile , Reid has to color a row of the same table such that an even number of red cells results for that row .
Which of the three columns I have to color is determined by a die handled by an official appointed by the JREF and standing right next to me .
Similarly , a die controlled by another JREF - appointed official next to Reid will determine which of the three rows he needs to be color . ”
Cora needs to create columns containing an odd number of red cells ( left ) , whilst Reid is tasked to color rows with an even number of red cells ( right ) .
Cora and Reid will disagree on the coloring of at least one cell ( in this example the lower right cell ) .
With Cora and Reid being separated , Cora can not inform Reid which column she is asked to color , and neither can Reid tell Cora which row he is been given .
Yet , each time the game is repeated , both have to specify the same color for the cell at the intersection of the column and row specified .
It should be clear that this task can impossibly be achieved repetitively without some form of communication between Cora and Reid .
Prior to the tests , Cora and Reid can make arbitrarily complicated and elaborate agreements on how to color the 3x3 table .
Whatever their agreements , it will not help them succeed : given a large enough number of rounds , they are bound occasionally to disagree on the coloring of a cell .
The reason being that a 3x3 table with even number of red cells for each row and an odd number of red cells for each column can not be constructed .
If such a table would exist , the total number of red cells would have to be even based on the row sums , and odd when based on the column sums .
A logical impossibility .
It follows that a coloring satisfying all requirements is not possible .
So Cora and Reid have to use two distinct coloring schemes : one for Cora that ensures odd numbers of red cells in each of the columns , and one for Reid that ensures even numbers of red cells for each of the row .
The best possible dual - coloring scheme accomplishes for eight out of the nine cells that Cora and Reid agree on the color .
Such an optimal scheme would yield an expected success rate of 8/9 or roughly 89 % , for each round of play .
Yet , Cora and Reid seem capable of realizing the impossible : a 100 % success rate .
In a preliminary test conducted end of October in London , the couple managed to play 40 rounds of the game without a single flaw .
To accomplish 40 flawless rounds in the absence of any communication ( i.e. by chance alone ) is estimated to be less than 1 % .
According to the protocol agreed with the JREF , and following the successful conclusion of the preliminary test , Cora and Reid will be subjected to an even more stringent test end of this month .
The JREF refers to this test as the formal test .
This test will be decisive on the award of the one million dollar prize .
During the formal test , Reid will be placed in a copper - cladded room at the JREF headquarters in California , whilst Cora will be placed in a bank vault in London .
Placing the couple far apart and surrounded by walls of metal is part of the elaborate precautions to prevent Cora and Reid from establishing any communication via physical means .
To ensure a successful result gives proof beyond reasonable doubt that the couple has telepathic powers , 100 rounds of the game need to be played .
J
“ It is all pointless , we will pass the test with flying colors ” Reid laughs .
“ It does n't matter where we are or how far apart , or how many rounds we need to play . ”
Cora smiles and remarks “ it is no coincidence that we are both physicists ” .
Reid grins but remains silent .
“ Why is that ? ” I ask .
Reid hesitates , and looks at Cora .
A short silence follows .
“ It all started as a kind of joke , and we 've contacted the JREF to explain them how it works ” Cora confesses .
“ It 's plain physics , straightforward quantum physics ” Reid adds .
He continuous : “ It is this infamous ' rule three ' out of the sixteen official rules governing the JREF challenge that prevented us to warn the JREF ” .
“ We did send them an e-mail , and even included a link to the Wikipedia page that explains the phenomenon . ”
“ However , based on their ' rule three ' the JREF had to ignore our explanations , and deleted these e-mails ” , Cora adds .
Another silence follows .
Reid breaks this silence : “ We thought long about it , but decided that if they do n't want to get warned , it is not wrong and nor is it immoral to go for the one million dollar prize .
We do n't cheat , and no tricks are involved .
Neither do we need telepathy or any other paranormal phenomena : quantum physics is weird enough .
What we do is no more than a demonstration of a well - known phenomenon in quantum physics .
But if the JREF considers our demonstration of quantum pseudo - telepathy a paranormal act , so be it .
It wo n't win us the Nobel Prize for Physics , but it seems we can't fail the Nobel Prize for the Paranormal administered by the JREF ! ”
Cora : “ We have only one thing remaining to sort out ” .
Cora looks at Reid , and continuous : “ what to do with a million dollars ? ”
Both start laughing .
Postscript
I have been wondering for some time how best to explain the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics in layman 's terms .
I landed on the scenario described above .
And yes , that means Cora and Reid and their dealings with the JREF are purely the product of my imagination .
However , the Quantum pseudo - telepathy part of the story is not made up .
The laws of physics allow the above to happen as described .
Quantum pseudo telepathy is real .
A physical reality as real as the existence of stable atoms , and like the stability of atoms , fully depending on the laws of quantum mechanics .
For quantum pseudo - telepathy to occur , for each round of the game , Cora and Reid both need to bring with them part of a physical system in an entangled quantum state .
They have to execute measurements on this entangled state , and decide how to color their cells based on the outcome of this measurement .
The non-local quantum connections ( also referred to as quantum entanglement ) between the components of an entangled physical system creates correlated measurement outcomes that are at the heart of the phenomenon of Quantum pseudo - telepathy .
It should be stressed here that quantum pseudo - telepathy does not allow for any ' hidden ' transfer of information , but rather eliminates the need to exchange information between the players .
A subtle but important distinction .
Why would anyone be bothered about telepathy , when living in a quantum world with entanglement being freely available ?
Oh Jeez .

Palin : Obama birth certificate ' a fair question '
Speaking to the conservative talker Rusty Humphries today , Sarah Palin left the door open to speculation about President Obama 's birth certificate .
" Would you make the birth certificate an issue if you ran ? " she was asked ( around 9 minutes into the video above ) .
" I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue .
I do n't have a problem with that .
I do n't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue , because I think that members of the electorate still want answers , " she replied .
" Do you think it 's a fair question to be looking at ? "
Humphries persisted .
" I think it 's a fair question , just like I think past association and past voting records -- all of that is fair game , " Palin said .
" The McCain - Palin campaign did n't do a good enough job in that area . "
McCain 's campaign counsel has said the campaign did look into the birth certificate question and , like every other serious examination , dismissed it .
Palin suggested that the questions were fair play because of " the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig is n't my real son -- ' You need to produce his birth certificate , you need to prove that he's your kid , ' which we have done . "
" Maybe we can reverse that , " she said , returning to Obama 's birth certificate , describing the type of thinking involved with a word that is n't clear in the audio .
Multiplayer
This is what made PC gamers upset , and I have to say , they have reason to be .
The game maxes out at 18 players — nine vs. nine — and instead of relying on dedicated servers , the game randomly assigns one of the players as the server during the match - making process .
It 's like Xbox Live invaded your PC .
This system is fine for consoles , but computer gamers are n't used to this lack of control over their experience .
There is no way to decide who hosts the game , and there is no way to keep yourself from hosting if the system decides you 're the best choice .
You do n't even see your ping , just how many bars you have showing the strength of your connection .
That 's frustrating when you 're used to being able to see your specific ping .
If you want to play with your friends without " pubbies , " you have to set up a private match , and , again , one of you will be selected to host the game .
If that player quits , the game will pause for five seconds while another player is selected to serve as host .
There is no way to upload maps , there is no way to modify the game outside of what the menu allows , and of course there is no console to tweak anything .
It 's odd to hit the tilde button and have nothing happen .
Unless they change this system extensively , it does n't seem like custom maps will be possible .
It 's frustrating to feel so controlled and boxed in , but the game itself remains fun .
You 'll be leveling up and unlocking new weapons and perks , and the expanded Killstreak bonuses add a whole new level to the game .
With just three kills in a row you 'll be able to check out enemy positions using an unmanned vehicle ; with 25 kills in a row you can drop a nuke and kill everyone on the board .
In between those two options are 13 other bonuses that can turn the tide of battle rather quickly .
There are also bonuses given if you die too often , which is a nice way to keep demoralized players from rage - quitting , but can make you feel ... somewhat special .
The game ships with 16 maps , and eight game modes from Free - For - All to Demolition .
You 'll see Capture the Flag , Sabotage , Domination ; these are all modes you 've played before , but the sheer variety provides a great deal of replay value .
The ability to level up and create a more powerful character through Perks and weapons also gives you more reason to stick with the game ; earning points by killing people online can get very addictive very quickly .
Thankfully , grenade spam does not to seem to have taken hold in the games I 've been playing .
You 'll be able to see who killed you and how via the kill cam , and everyone on the server gets to watch the last kill of the match , which can be a funny experience if something spectacular happened .
Also , with the proper practice , riot shields used correctly can open some interesting doors .
The person holding the shield can't fire , but can provide moving cover for someone else and bash people directly in front of them .
In case you were bored with all the stuff you could unlock in the first Modern Warfare , you 're in luck : there are more guns , more perks , more modifications to the weapons ; you 'll be grinding away happily for a long , long time .
There are also online playlists , such as 3rd Person Teams , that are only unlocked as you gain levels .
If you were addicted to the online play of the original Modern Warfare , you 'll find a lot to love here , and I have to admit I 've been having a good time getting my ass kicked by 13 - year - olds online .
The problem is , quite simply , lag .
Every time I get into a multiplayer game on the PC I find a few good servers where my ping is low , and make them my favorites .
Here , there is no way to do that , and every game is going to have differing amounts of lag .
Since the host changes so often , there is no way to make sure you get a consistent experience .
This is what we 'll miss with dedicated servers .
Without being able to set up a LAN or run a server with your own settings , the possibility of this game being embraced by competitive gamers is basically zero .
Infinity Ward wants to bring the console online experience to the PC , and it certainly did that .
The problem is that it comes with a host of problems that PC gamers are , understandably , upset about having to endure .
Are these things deal - breakers ?
That 's up to you .
Any complaints will probably fall on deaf ears , however , as the PC sales will be fraction of what the game enjoys on the consoles .
The PC version of the game is n't bad .
I only ran into one crash that I could n't reproduce , the graphics look beautiful if you have a high - end system , and the mouse and keyboard are a much better way to control the game ... it 's simply the multiplayer system which is so unsatisfactory .
Special Ops
If you 're looking for a more intimate online experience , the Special Ops missions are your answer .
Invite a friend ( the game notes that the player with the fastest CPU should host ) and you take on a series of different challenges .
You 'll be clearing the path for your friend from an elevated position , sniping targets , clearing out open areas and trying not to hit civilians ; these are short blasts of gameplay that stress speed , precision , and teamwork .
You 'll need to communicate to earn the maximum number of stars , and your skills will certainly be put to the test .
These missions may seem like an afterthought between the single - player game and the wider multiplayer offerings , but with a good friend they are a surprising amount of fun .
Many people are complaining about the short length of the single - player game , and the Special Ops missions certainly add a number of hours to the game .
How many ?
That depends on how much of a perfectionist you are .
In conclusion
The early reviews of this game were conducted at a hotel under Activision 's supervision , using the console version of the game .
The launch party in New York featured the 360 version of the game .
We were sent the Prestige Edition of the game the day of release for coverage .
Very few people at the company seem to care that yes , there is a PC port of the game .
Well , we care , dammit .
Call of Duty came from the PC gaming scene , and it was there that it was popularized .
Yes , consoles are now the dominant form of gaming from a financial standpoint , but it 's sad to see a game that has such a rich history on our favorite platform feel so neglected in its newest incarnation .
The port of the single - player campaign is strong ; the game looks , plays , and feels incredible on a capable gaming PC .
The Special Ops missions are perfect if you 're in the mood for a teeny - tiny LAN party ( although of course you 'll both need Steam accounts to play ) , but the multiplayer offerings feel like Infinity Ward is trying to cram a round peg into a square hole .
It 's not what we 're used to , it 's not what we want , and the changes made to the online matchmaking set - up and lack of dedicated servers negatively change the online experience .
It 's just that simple .
There is no easy verdict here , but I 'm going to say skip the PC version .
Why ?
The single - player is over quickly .
The Special Ops missions are great but there are better co-op games out there .
The multiplayer is going to be huge on consoles , but on the PC it 's just crippled .
There is a lot of fun to be had here , but there are way better ways to spend your money , especially with the $ 60 price .
The Good
Strong , disturbing single - player game
Looks , plays great on the PC
Killstreaks in multiplayer are a great addition
Online play is still addictive
Good selection of maps and game modes
Special
Ops missions extend the life of the game , great with a friend online
The Bad
Single - player is over quickly
The actual story is a little bit on the paranoid , gun-porn side of things
Console - style online play on the PC
$ 60 for a PC release ?
No thanks , guys
Both the company and retailers barely seems to care about the PC version
The Ugly
Huge design problems with the multiplayer version
The game is already in the expected places .
PC gamers will feel spurned and pirate , and Activision will claim they do n't support the PC better because of piracy
Verdict : Skip
For many in New York City , the Friday after Thanksgiving is a day to digest turkey , jostle with shopping hordes  and curse the fresh parking tickets tucked beneath untold thousands of windshield wipers .
Every year , a sleeping army of New Yorkers and their out - of - town guests forget that Friday is not a holiday and fail to move their cars for street cleaning .
But the city does not forget : Traffic agents give out parking tickets furiously , more than three times the number on a usual day .
The post - Thanksgiving bonanza of roughly 20,000 tickets is worth some $ 900,000 to the city .
But not this year .
Because of a quirk of the calendar , Friday was a city - recognized holiday after all : Id al - Adha , a Muslim celebration .
Alternate - side - of - the - street parking rules were suspended through Saturday , giving New Yorkers one more reason to offer thanks while depriving the city of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The intersection of American tradition , Islam ’s lunar calendar and the street - cleaning schedule made for a peculiar holiday mash - up that pleased car owners and imams alike .
“ On Id day we share the blessings with all New Yorkers , ” said Imam Shamsi Ali of the Islamic Cultural Center in Manhattan .
“ The blessing is that they have the opportunity to have free parking . ”
Hey Phil - you missed a paper ;
In his paper , Qing - Bin Lu , a professor of physics and astronomy , shows how CFCs – compounds once widely used as refrigerants – and cosmic rays – energy particles originating in outer space – are mostly to blame for climate change , rather than carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions .
His paper , derived from observations of satellite , ground - based and balloon measurements as well as an innovative use of an established mechanism , was published online in the prestigious journal Physics Reports .
“ My findings do not agree with the climate models that conventionally thought that greenhouse gases , mainly CO2 , are the major culprits for the global warming seen in the late 20th century , ” Lu said .
“ Instead , the observed data show that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays most likely caused both the Antarctic ozone hole and global warming .
These findings are totally unexpected and striking , as I was focused on studying the mechanism for the formation of the ozone hole , rather than global warming . ”
His conclusions are based on observations that from 1950 up to now , the climate in the Arctic and Antarctic atmospheres has been completely controlled by CFCs and cosmic rays , with no CO2 impact .
In bygone days , a bicycle dynamo struggled to generate enough energy to power a weak headlight for the lonely cyclist riding home on a dark night .
Back then it was the only electronic application that a cyclist needed because dynamos were first invented when riders still made calls from public telephone booths or stopped to read a map for directions .
But a new bicycle dynamo system called PedalPower + can help recharge the arsenal of battery - powered accessories modern cyclists ’ rely on for communications , navigation and entertainment - on the fly .
Devices like GPS units , mobile phones , digital cameras , MP3 players and mobile phones require 5V up to 600 mA , DC input to recharge them .
And if you ’re out on the road when they go flat , generally it ’s been too bad .
Until now .
“ Our range of products gives you a complete recharging system by generating energy while riding your bike and using that energy to recharge your devices while on your journey , " said PedalPower + managing director and the product ’s inventor , Nicholas Kidd .
" The excess energy that is generated by cycling can be collected and stored to charge devices at the end of the day after a long ride . "
Kidd said he came up with the idea for PedalPower + after much discussion and brainstorming .
“ Originally , I had an interest in energy and saw some hand dynamo torches which looked a bit painful .
Through brainstorming we came up with the bicycle idea to collect the energy , and then thought about applying it to the bicycle market , thinking about what could riders do if their phones and GPS units went flat , ” he said .
The problem with AC power
“ Dynamos give out an AC current and to charge a phone , MP3 player or GPS you need a DC unit .
It ’s easy at home with a wall unit because the current is constant , but not from a bike ’s dynamo where the current varies greatly depending on the speed you are going .
You need to be able to invert that current and regulate it in a way that does n’t burn out expensive equipment when riding fast .
It took us about three years to get it right , ” Kidd said .
“ We ’ve found a way to regulate the currently , making sure the voltage is consistent for phones and GPS units and , regardless of how fast the rider travels , the PedalPower + ca n’t go past that maximum safe level . ”
At the heart of the unit
The PP + has a storage unit called the V4 that is charged via the dynamo and in turn charges devices connected to it in a regulated manner .
“ The V4 has four sockets and can output a total of 500 mA which means it can output 125 mA per device per hour , which can either extend the interval between devices ’ battery charges or , for some devices , they will never go flat , ” he said .
He added that most riders charge their camera batteries or phones overnight from the V4 battery which will then trickle charge through the dynamo during the following day ’s ride .
Kidd said that most dynamos in the past wasted a lot of energy by creating heat but added : “ All our components are cold to the touch ; practically all the energy is captured to the maximum efficiency .
“ We ’ve tested that technology to over 100,000 km ( around 60,000 miles ) on the bench - which is no different to on the road - up to 100 kmh to 1 kmh ( 60 mph to .5 mph ) to the equivalent of three times round the world without one single hiccup . "
Kidd says other companies have since contacted him with the view of using his PP +
Universal Hub Dynamo Cable with their dynamos because the PP + has the intelligence built - in , meaning it will work with most other dynamos .
The company has a more expensive dynamic hub generator unit as well , which is aimed at the hardcore rider .
Installing the intelligent cable takes around five minutes , while the hub dynamo needs to be installed in a bike workshop because it needs re-spoking – and takes around 30 minutes .
“ By using our patented , small , modern technology , we have solved several major issues that enable a bicycle dynamo to be used to recharge small electronic devices safely . ”
According to Kidd the PP + cable is perfectly suited to AC dynamo hubs from Sram , Shimano , Schmidt , Suntour , Novatec and other manufacturers , meaning it can be used as a simple retrofit for those riders who already have hub generators .
PP + also has a portable solar panel that attaches to recharge the V4 unit .
The solar panels are designed for stationary use and will give some charge , but to charge the V4 unit from flat takes around seven to eight hours in good , constant sunlight .
Units are available online and the website has a good introductory video on the home page .
Hundreds of Canberrans have been convicted and fined for failing to vote in last year 's ACT election .
The Electoral Commission summonsed about 480 people who did not cast a vote on October 18 , 2008 .
Around 170 charges were withdrawn .
But over the last fortnight , nearly 300 people have been convicted and fined $ 50 .
None of them provided an explanation .
Another seven people have been fined $ 10 plus court costs of about $ 60 .
Some of the people told the ACT Magistrates Court they had been sick on election day or simply forgot .
Chief Magistrate Ron Cahill noted that most of the people charged appeared to be Australian born .
He said it showed that people who came to the ACT from overseas valued their democratic duty more than others .
Chief Magistrate Cahill said it is important that Canberrans vote and the court process is an example of democracy in action .
He said if people cannot vote on election day , they should let the Electoral Commission know .
Hard - line conservatives in the Republican Party have no intention of compromising as they consider which GOP candidates to back next fall , and they wo n't accommodate themselves to party leaders in Congress or the GOP establishment .
In fact , the core conservatives seem more intent than ever on nominating candidates who hew to conservative ideology and oppose President Obama at every turn .
These are some of the findings of a little - known series of focus groups conducted in suburban Cleveland and elsewhere this fall by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg 's research organization , Democracy Corps .
The findings are being discussed by GOP strategists because they provide a clear indication of the growing militancy of the hard right .
Republican leaders in Washington say the focus groups reveal an unsettling reality — that the conservative base of the GOP will try to jettison moderate or centrist Republican candidates in favor of ideological conservatives in primary elections across the country .
This happened a few weeks ago in a special election in upstate New York , and in the end the conservative candidate lost .
The fear in the Republican establishment is that this dynamic , if replicated across the country , would limit the opportunity of Republicans to field candidates who might appeal to moderates in many general elections .
" The self - identifying conservative Republicans who make up the base of the Republican party stand a world apart from the rest of America , according to focus groups conducted by Democracy Corps , " Greenberg and other survey directors said in a recent 18 - page memo to party insiders .
" These base Republican voters dislike Barack Obama to be sure — which is not very surprising as base Democrats had few positive things to say about George Bush — but these voters identify themselves as part of a ' mocked ' minority with a set of shared beliefs and knowledge , and commitment to oppose Obama that sets them apart from the majority in the country .
They believe Obama is ruthlessly advancing a ' secret agenda ' to bankrupt the United States and dramatically expand government control to an extent nothing short of socialism .
While these voters are disdainful of a Republican Party they view to have failed in its mission , they overwhelmingly view a successful Obama presidency as the destruction of this country 's founding principles and are committed to seeing the president fail . "
The crew regularly slept , slouched and listened to music on duty , investigators said US Navy investigators have placed the blame for a March 2009 collision in the Gulf on " ineffective and negligent " leadership of the submarine involved .
Fifteen sailors were injured when the nuclear - powered USS Hartford collided with the USS New Orleans , a navy ship .
Sleeping , slouching and a radio room with music speakers were tolerated on board the submarine , the report says .
Five submariners would routinely sleep on watch , and the navigator took an exam while listening to his iPod .
The report was obtained by the Navy Times newspaper under a Freedom of Information Act request .
According to the report , the crew of the USS New Orleans - which ruptured an oil tank in the crash in the Strait of Hormuz near Iran - bore no fault for the accident .
Five known ' sleepers '
" Correction of any one of nearly 30 tactical and watchstander errors , or adherence to standard procedures , could have prevented this collision , " said Adm John C Harvey , as he endorsed the investigation 's findings .
The USS Hartford 's commanding officer , Cmdr Ryan Brookhart , was relieved of his duties following the collision .
Several other crew members were punished .
The report states that the submarine had five known " sleepers " - sailors who would routinely take a nap on watch .
Two of the five were working when the collision happened , but there was no evidence they were asleep .
Helmsmen told investigators they would often " slouch in their seats with one hand on the controls " .
However , the report said most of the crew were nevertheless of a superb calibre , and were eager to restore their vessel 's standing .
The cost of repairs to the Hartford so far stands at more than $ 100 m ( £ 60 m ) , while $ 2.3 m ( £ 1.3 m ) worth of damage was caused to the New Orleans .

The ' No SQL ' Discussion Has Nothing to Do With SQL
Recently , there has been a lot of buzz about “ No SQL ” databases .
In fact there are at least two conferences on the topic in 2009 , one on each coast .
Seemingly this buzz comes from people who are proponents of :
• document - style stores in which a database record consists of a collection of ( key , value ) pairs plus a payload .
Examples of this class of system include CouchDB and MongoDB , and we call such systems document stores for simplicity
• key - value stores whose records consist of ( key , payload ) pairs .
Usually , these are implemented by distributed hash tables ( DHTs ) , and we call these key - value stores for simplicity .
Examples include Memcachedb and Dynamo .
In either case , one usually gets a low - level record - at - a - time DBMS interface , instead of SQL .
Hence , this group identifies itself as advocating “ No SQL . ”
There are two possible reasons to move to either of these alternate DBMS technologies : performance and flexibility .
The performance argument goes something like the following .
I started with MySQL for my data storage needs and over time found performance to be inadequate .
My options were :
1. “ Shard ” my data to partition it across several sites , giving me a serious headache managing distributed data in my application
or
2. Abandon MySQL and pay big licensing fees for an enterprise SQL DBMS or move to something other than a SQL DBMS .
The flexibility argument goes something like the following .
My data does not conform to a rigid relational schema .
Hence , I ca n’t be bound by the structure of a RDBMS and need something more flexible .
This blog posting considers the performance argument ; a subsequent posting will address the flexibility argument .
For simplicity , we will focus this discussion on the workloads for which NoSQL databases are most often considered : update - and lookup - intensive OLTP workloads , not query - intensive data warehousing workloads .
We do not consider document repositories or other specialized workloads for which NoSQL systems may be well suited .
There are two ways to improve OLTP performance ; namely , provide automatic “ sharding ” over a shared - nothing processing environment and improve per-server OLTP performance .
In the first case , one improves performance by providing scalability as nodes are added to a computing environment ; in the second case , one improves performance of individual nodes .
Every serious SQL DBMS ( e.g. , Greenplum , Asterdata , Vertica , Paraccel , etc. ) written in the last 10 years has provided shared nothing scalability , and any new effort would be remiss if it did not do likewise .
Hence , this component of performance should be “ table stakes ” for any DBMS .
In my opinion , nobody should ever run a DBMS that does not provide automatic sharding over computing nodes .
As a result , this posting continues with the other component , namely , single node OLTP performance .
The overhead associated with OLTP databases in traditional SQL systems has little to do with SQL , which is why “ NoSQL ” is such a misnomer .
Instead , the major overhead in an OLTP SQL DBMS is communicating with the DBMS using ODBC or JDBC .
Essentially all applications that are performance sensitive use a stored - procedure interface to run application logic inside the DBMS and avoid the crippling overhead of back - and - forth communication between the application and the DBMS .
The other alternative is to run the DBMS in the same address space as the application , thereby giving up any pretense of access control or security .
Such embeddable DBMSs are reasonable in some environments , but not for mainstream OLTP , where security is a big deal .
Using either stored procedures or embedding , the useful work component is a very small percentage of total transaction cost , for today ’s OLTP data bases which usually fit in main memory .
Instead , a recent paper [ 1 ] calculated that total OLTP time was divided almost equally between the following four overhead components :
Logging : Traditional databases write everything twice ; once to the database and once to the log .
Moreover , the log must be forced to disk , to guarantee transaction durability .
Logging is , therefore , an expensive operation .
Locking : Before touching a record , a transaction must set a lock on it in the lock table .
This is an overhead - intensive operation .
Latching : Updates to shared data structures ( B - trees , the lock table , resource tables , etc. ) must be done carefully in a multi- threaded environment .
Typically , this is done with short - term duration latches , which are another considerable source of overhead .
Buffer Management : Data in traditional systems is stored on fixed - size disk pages .
A buffer pool manages which set of disk pages is cached in memory at any given time .
Moreover , records must be located on pages and the field boundaries identified .
Again , these operations are overhead intensive .
If one eliminates any one of the above overhead components , one speeds up a DBMS by 25 % .
Eliminate three and your speedup is limited by a factor of two .
You must get rid of all four to run a lot faster .
Although the No SQL systems have a variety of different features , there are some common themes .
First , many manage data that is distributed across multiple sites , and provide the “ table stakes ” noted above .
Obviously , a well - designed multi-site system , whether based on SQL or something else , is way more scalable than a single - site system .
Second , many
No SQL systems are disk - based and retain a buffer pool as well as a multi- threaded architecture .
This will leave intact two of the four sources of overhead above .
Concerning transactions , there is often support for only single record transactions and an eventual consistency replica system , which assumes that transactions are commutative .
In effect the “ gold standard ” of ACID transactions is sacrificed for performance .
However , the net - net is that the single - node performance of a NoSQL , disk - based , non-ACID , multithreaded system is limited to be a modest factor faster than a well - designed stored - procedure SQL OLTP engine .
In essence , ACID transactions are jettisoned for a modest performance boost , and this performance boost has nothing to do with SQL .
However , it is possible to have one ’s cake and eat it too .
To go fast , one needs to have a stored procedure interface to a run-time system , which compiles a high - level language ( for example , SQL ) into low level code .
Moreover , one has to get rid of all of the above four sources of overhead .
A recent project [ 2 ] clearly indicated that this is doable , and showed blazing performance on TPC-C .
Watch for commercial versions of these and similar ideas with open source packaging .
Hence , I fully expect very high speed , open - source SQL engines in the near future that provide automatic sharding .
Moreover , they will continue to provide ACID transactions along with the increased programmer productivity , lower maintenance , and better data independence afforded by SQL .
Hence , high performance does not require jettisoning either SQL or ACID transactions .
In summary , blinding performance depends on removing overhead .
Such overhead has nothing to do with SQL , but instead revolves around traditional implementations of ACID transactions , multi- threading , and disk management .
To go wildly faster , one must remove all four sources of overhead , discussed above .
This is possible in either a SQL context or some other context .

You seem to leave out several other sub-categories of the NoSQL movement in your discussion .
For example : Google 's BigTable ( and clones ) as well as graph databases .
Considering those in addition , would that change your point of view ?
Dwight Merriman
Michael ,
It seems to me the denormalization that occurs with typical usage of a document - oriented database improves performance : a complex document with some nested objects and / or arrays might have been 10 rows in an RDMS instead of one contiguous piece of data .
Do you agree ?

Re Dwight Merriman 's comment :
I was careful to point out that NoSQL data bases might be advantageous in document repositories in my blog .
There are multiple reasons for this possibility , including denormalization ( your discussion ) , keyword retrieval , and semantic tagging .

Re Johannes Ernst 's comment :
I am a huge fan of " One size does not fit all . "
There are several implementations of SQL engines with very different performance characteristics along with a plethora of other engines .
Along with the ones you mention , there are array stores such as Rasdaman and RDF stores such as Freebase .
I applaud efforts to build DBMSs that are oriented toward particular market needs .
The purpose of the blog entry was to discuss the major actors in the NoSQL movement ( as I see it ) as they relate to bread - and - butter transaction processing ( OLTP ) .
My conclusion is that " NoSQL " really means " No disk " or " No ACID " or " No threading , " i.e. speed in the OLTP market does not come from abandoning SQL .
The efforts you describe as well as the ones in the above paragraphs are not focused on OLTP .
My blog comments were restricted to OLTP , as I thought I made clear .

You claim that scalable performance is available in " every serious SQL DBMS written in the last 10 years " , suggesting that I can just add more servers to scale both the total dataset size and the rate of OLTP - style transactions ( i.e. lots of little transactions , not a few increasingly - large transactions ) .
However , I have not able to find an example of a large - scale Web application that has been able to meet its needs with a single coherent RDMS system .
On the other hand , there are numerous examples of sites that claim to have run out of scalability and ended up partitioning their data across independent RDMS instances or building a NoSQL system ( Amazon , Facebook , Google , Yahoo , and Ebay , just to name a few ) .
Can you point us to a couple of success stories to counter the widespread belief that RDMBS systems cannot scale ?
CACM Administrator
My comment referred specifically to the data warehouse marketplace , where Greenplum , Asterdata , Paraccel , and Vertica all scale linearly .
Moreover , older systems including Teradata , Netezza and DB2 also scale linearly .
Microsoft will come out with their integration of DataAllegro with SQLServer this year .
It is reputed to scale linearly .
See the paper by Andy Pavlo et. al. in SIGMOD 2009 for some example numbers on Vertica and an unnamed major RDBMS vendor .
However , you asked about the OLTP market and not the data warehouse market .
Here , there are two considerations : shardability and collision frequency .
An application is shardable if there is a way to partition your data so MOST transactions are local to a single node .
Collision frequency refers to how often parallel transactions will touch the same data item .
The degenerate case is a one record data base , which will have a 100 % collision frequency .
If your data is shardable and there is a low collision frequency , then DB2 should scale linearly .
Similarly , the myriad of layers on top of both MySQL and Postgres , for example , EnterpriseDB , should do likewise .
If your data is shardable , regardless of collision frequency , VoltDB ( now in beta ; to go production next month ) has been shown to scale linearly .
If your data is not shardable , then everybody will slow down , dealing with distributed transactions .
Some systems do not support distributed transactions , which just pushes the problem into application logic , where the performance hit will be taken .
Most people I know deal with this issue by figuring out a way to rejigger their application to make it shardable .
EBay ( which you mentioned in your posting ) is a good example of an enterprise which has taken this approach .

Thanks for the response ; I have a couple of followup comments :
* I 'm confused : you say that your comment referred to the data warehouse marketplace , but my understanding is that the entire blog posting was actually about OLTP .
Quoting from the article : " we will focus this discussion on the workloads for which NoSQL databases are most often considered : update - and lookup - intensive online transaction processing workloads ( OLTP ) , not query - intensive data - warehousing workloads . "
Are the blog references to Greenplum , Aster Data , etc. relevant in the OLTP context ?
* Your response makes general arguments about why an RDMS might scale for OLTP , and they seem plausible , but what I 'd really like to see is a success story ( not vendor claims , but someone who will stand up and describe how their OLTP application actually did achieve high scale using a single RDBMS system spanning many nodes ) .
If RDMSes can scale ( under any plausible conditions ) surely there would be an example we can all look at , and I 'd guess that you are one of the people most likely to have heard about it .
Is there anything you can point us to ?
In the absence of a compelling success story many people are going to believe the naysayers who claim that RDMS 's can't scale for OLTP , particularly given the numerous examples of sites that could n't scale their RDBMS systems and switched to NoSQL .
By the way , I do n't think eBay qualifies as a success story under my definition : they partitioned their data to use multiple independent non-scaled RDBMS's , as opposed to a single scaled RDBMS , right ?

The main problem I see with SQL is that it is usually a batch - data transfer system , from server to client , requiring the locking of many records to ensure data integrity , which then also increases the likelihood of locking others out of records , records which may not even be being updated at that moment .
I guess this would violate atomicity .
To combat this , many SQL databases are programmed without update locks , which seems ok at the time because they think the likelihood of others trying the access the same information at the same time is low , however , the reality is that there are many types of records which get updated repeatedly .
This violates durability , because one persons updates are obliterated by anothers , at least to the point of leaving childless parent records , and parent - less child records .
Breaking data down into header and detail records further violates atomicity because items like sales order records , which belong as a unit whole , are divided up into many parts and then distributed over the disk drive and have to be reassembled to recreate a simple thing like a sales order .
Associative arrays can hold a sales order in one record , albeit with relational links to customer information like customer name , address , etc .
As complex as associative arrays can seem , multi-table joins can be even more complex and their output even more difficult to interpret because the relationships of the data are not transparent .
NoSQL relational databases can still provide relational links and a real database design without the need to always break the data out , or , indeed , to always have the data in associative arrays .
It gives freedom of design while providing a higher level of data integrity due to the ability to lock only the individual records one needs to lock .
It promotes using locking strategies in general because such strategies become practical .
Note that I am referring to the type of NoSQL which Pick is .
Note also that most Pick systems today also have a SQL interface for querying .
Most people prefer the TCL interface , however , when given the choice .
The other thing that some of these new NoSQL system have is hashed tables .
Pick / MultiValue has had these forever and they are a vast improvement over indexing .
Most Pick systems have indexing now , but it is not their primary access method and probably get used on the order of 1/100 or 1/1000 of the times that a regular SQL system does .
Given the notorious fallibility of file indices , this is a great advantage .
It also improves atomicity because the indices do not have to be updated when records are , at least not as often as in a SQL system .
I dont see any major difference , off the top of my head , between SQL and NoSQL in terms of consistency and isolation .
Im not really sure what they mean in this context .
In a relational NoSQL , which Pick is and not all are , data can be broken out to be shared and accessed in relation to different tables / files just like in SQL .
The main difference is the constraint of having to , which SQL constrains and Pick / MultiValue does not .
I find that associative arrays are a more real - world data model than header / detail arrangements of data .
Multivalues are much more common than SQL users would have you believe and in some applications multivalues and associations are the norm , not the exception .
Performance is one thing NoSQL and Pick often claim and we have found it to be true but the differences arent always that important .
The biggest differences come in improvements in data integrity with MultiValue / Pick / NoSQL databases over SQL , far fewer concurrency issues , easier querying , more understandable data results , a closer relationship between the data model and the real world , and the ability to have more flexible and imaginative database designs .
SQL has outstripped MultiValue in the market largely due to User Interface advantages that the SQL systems have usually possessed .
This has led to greater investment and system name recognition and marketability for SQL .
The UI advantages are closing , but SQL enjoys such a lead , especially in name recognition , that MultiValue systems have faced an uphill battle .
Even though there are many more applications written for MultiValue than any other database in the world ( some existing from as far back as the 1960s , still in use today ) , most have ancient UIs and it is so prohibitively expensive to remake the UI that many are slowly being abandoned .
Those of us able to provide UI solutions , such as AccuTerm and my BB4GL enjoy attention every time someone sees our products .
I just cant afford to market my products the way I would like .
The couple of times
Ive put out press releases
Ive gotten immediate enquiries and , were the current market to sustain new ventures , I would have customers , customers who are so busy just trying to keep their heads from sinking under the waves of the current economic hurricane , that they cannot entertain the new ventures .
I frequently get enquiries from around the world from people who just happen upon my rarely travelled website , which I cannot afford to promote on web directories , attention received even though it is infrequently travelled .
Ill read the Stonebraker article later this evening .
I just wanted to give you the perspective of someone ( me ) who has worked with both SQL and NoSQL systems over many , many years .
To me , NoSQL means Not -Only - SQL , more than No SQL at all .
In Pick , we have SQL phrases which allow access and handling of associative array data , so it isnt necessarily a one - or - the - other situation .
Logging : since more records and more data pages must be logged because header and detail records are broken up relative to combined records having associative arrays , more logging transactions must occur in SQL .
Locking : Like I already mentioned , more records must be locked when there are separate detail and header records , especially when detail records are distributed over multiple disk pages .
Latching : Again , since more individual records are involved in SQL , more latching must occur to manage these records .
Buffer Management : More data must be read from the disk drive to extract the same amount of data for the same net record set ( use my example of a simple sales order ; a sales order having 20 detail lines in an associative array requires one or two disk accesses , while it takes at least 21 to retrieve one in an SQL environment .
Finally , performance is not the chief advantage of a MultiValue system : data integrity , better concurrency , more easily understood querying , fewer complicated table joins , and the ability to create more flexible and imaginative database designs are much more important and are much better in a MultiValue system .
However , the MultiValue performance advantage exists and doesnt suck , if youll excuse my French !
John Racine
Also , the SQL view of atomicity is one of breaking the atom into electrons , neutrons , and protons , which violates the identity of the atom .
A MultiValue associative array of , using my previous example , a sales order , keeps the atom of the sales order together .
SQL would break this , not into atoms , but into electrons , etc. , which lose their identity .
Atoms have characteristics according to their make - up , electrons do not .
A sales order means a lot when held together , but its detail lines mean little when disassociated from the header and the other detail lines ( and their summation ) .
Those detail lines rarely mean anything to any other piece of data on the system except when associated with that header , and MultiValue provides ways of extracting that detail data very easily and in a useful way when and if such a rare occurence exists .
John Racine
P.S. -
If you are ignorant of Pick / MultiValue , one of the most widely used databases in the world today , it trades under many different names , including Sequoia ( pioneer of fault - tolerant systems ) , D3 , mvBase , mvEnterprise , AP , General Automation , Mentor , Ultimate , Revelation , OpenInsight , Reality , Microdata ( McDonnell Douglas ) , Applied Digital Data Systems ( also a popular terminal manufacturer ) , NCR , IBM U2 ( UniVerse & UniData ) , Rocket Software , Intersystems Cache , NorthGate , jBase , OpenQM , Maverick , ONWare , Prime Information Systems , and UniVision .
Half the universities and colleges in the US use the Datatel application , which is a MultiValue system , to run their administration , academics , scheduling , billing , etc .
The major banks of the UK use Pick as their main systems .
Hughes Supply , the largest industrial supply house in the US , uses Pick to run its operations .

A group of Senate Democratic leaders is set to announce Wednesday that they have decided to strip health insurers of their antitrust exemption .
According to a post on Twitter from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) this morning , Reid , Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , and Democratic Caucus Chairman Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) would make the announcement about the antitrust rules this morning .
Reid tweeted Wednesday :
Leahy , Schumer and I will announce today @ 11:30 am ET that we will strip the health ins industry of its exemption from antritrust laws
The move mirrors actions taken by House leaders to also include the change in antitrust rules in their version of health reform legislation .
The House and Senate Democrats ' jab toward insurers also comes after the industry had launched critical reports over the differing health bills , warning that the reform plans would result in higher premiums for consumers , were they to become law .
Reid 's words serve as confirmation that the Senate will move on the initiative , first floated by Leahy , after momentum appeared to move toward the new antitrust rule .

The May 2008 earthquake in Sichuan , China , surprised scientists
Many recent earthquakes may have been the aftershocks of large quakes that occurred hundreds of years ago , according to scientists .
In the journal Nature , researchers described a new pattern in the frequency of aftershocks that could explain some major quakes .
They found that , away from plate boundaries , echoes of past earthquakes can continue for several hundred years .
Here , in the middle of a continent , the earth takes longer to recover .
It 's something we had never spotted before , " said Seth Stein from Northwestern University in Illinois , US .
" Most big earthquakes happen at [ plate ] boundaries - like the San Andreas fault .
There is a lot of movement there and aftershocks go on for about ten years after a big quake . "
When the aftershocks have dissipated , scientists monitor regular movement of the earth to gauge the likelihood of a future quake .
The researchers gathered data from faults in the US But small earthquakes also occur where there is none of this regular movement , he explained .
" So if the ground has not been storing up energy for future earthquakes , these must be aftershocks . "
This , the scientists say , could explain the disastrous earthquake in 2008 in China 's Sichuan province .
The event shocked many scientists as this was an area where there had been hardly any earthquakes in the past few centuries .
But these " aftershock quakes " , the scientists say , get smaller over time .
" It even looks like we see small earthquakes today in the area along Canada 's Saint Lawrence valley where a large earthquake occurred in 1663 , " Professor Stein said .
" If you look at where they are - they 're on the fault plane of the big earthquake . "
He and his colleague , Mian Liu from the University of Missouri , found the same pattern repeated in seismic data from faults around the world .
Forecasting tremors
This discovery could help scientists to foresee the location of big earthquakes .
" Predicting big quakes based on small quakes is like the ' whack - a- mole ' game , " Professor Stein explained .
" You wait for the mole to come up where it went down .
" But we now know the big earthquakes can pop up somewhere else . "
He recommended that , instead of just focusing on the regions where small , regular earthquakes happen , scientists should use methods like GPS satellites and computer modelling to look for places where the earth is " storing up energy for a large future earthquake " .
Tom Parsons , a scientist from the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) in California was not involved in this study , but wrote an accompanying article in the same issue of Nature , explaining its significance .
He said that with a more comprehensive approach to studying earthquakes , researchers would eventually be able to " arrive at a practical solution " - balancing the available resources with the need to protect areas that were at risk .

This Sunday , December 6 is " Stand for Righteousness Sunday " as the final Sunday before early voting ends on the 8th and before Joint Runoff Election Day on Saturday , December 12 .
It has never been more important for pastors in Houston to raise the bar on how we assure maximum voter turnout in our churches .
Turnout would normally be projected at less than 10 percent – 1 out of 10 registered voters !
– and there is simply NO excuse for anywhere near that level coming from our churches .
With early voting convenience it should communicated from our pulpits that EVERY Christian should cast a prayerful , informed vote .
If you will take the following steps – your turnout WILL increase substantially and we urge you to execute each one of these steps on Sunday and throughout next week .
The question before us is very simple – do we care enough about our God , our families , our city and our future to take responsibility for who governs us ?
If we do , we will take every necessary step as outlined below .
Back in November , Pastor Dave Welch rallied the troops of the Houston Area Pastor Council with his battle cry that a lesbian mayor of Houston would be the end of society .
A real Christian message right ?
Also explain to me , because I ’m too stupid to understand , how a mayor can promote a gay agenda and pass civil rights laws .
Did I miss that part of the lesson in government class ?
Here ’s an excerpt
Also fact is that the gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender lobby fielded candidates in multiple races for Houston City Council to increase their numbers on that governing body .
Are we supposed to be lemmings and assume there is no agenda at play here ?
Please .
The " elephant in the room " of this mayoral campaign is Parker 's long and very public track record of advocating same - sex marriage , taxpayer - funded benefits for same - sex partners of city employees , elevating even " gender identity " to a protected class as well as every agenda item of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force .
Houston is not yet San Francisco , Chicago , Detroit or New York , and the voters here have repeatedly stated through city referendums that such policies are not welcome – and a supermajority voted to keep the traditional definition of marriage as only between one man and one woman .
Hundreds of pastors and thousands of citizens refuse to be silenced and keep the debate at the level of road repair , transportation infrastructure , city spending and other such fiscal issues , important as they are .
Nothing , I repeat , nothing is as important to the future of this city , state and nation as the protection and restoration of the nuclear family grounded in marriage , having both a mother and a father raising their children and committed to a healthy , nurturing home .
Myriad studies done regarding the physical , emotional , economic , educational and spiritual well - being of children confirm that the highest levels of each of these critical areas of protection occur within the confines of a strong marriage .
The radical agenda to " undefine " marriage directly through courts and legislatures has failed , but the " death by a thousand cuts " through elevating nonmarital same - sex or opposite - sex relationships to equal status in every other area of public policy as per California and Washington state is just as threatening .
Those of the clergy who believe in family and marriage as defined by God , recognized by centuries of our ancestors and affirmed as a vital institution of compelling state interest to promote for our own posterity , must exercise our right and duty to make sure the voters are well - informed and do their duty by voting those values .
Once again we are reminded that ballot measures are only a temporary solution to the true and foundational duty to elect leaders of strong faith , conviction and character to policymaking offices at all levels .
We cannot have it both ways – and whether we like it or not , we are charged with being politically active as a ministry to our God , our fellow man and our country .
This is an act of love , not of bigotry .
An act of love not bigotry .
That ’s so Christian of you .
Because you do n’t want Houston to be like Detroit , San Francisco , Chicago or any of those other heathen cities .
Kind of reminds me of Alabama Senator " Hurricane " Hank Erwin who said Katrina happened because New Orleans was a city of sin .
I know very little of Annise Parker and her platform to improve Houston , but I trust the judgment of those that I have talked to that she has the experience and is a good progressive .
I also would n’t mind this Pastor ’s Council having to eat some crow .
Oh and maybe some of them could lose their tax exempt status .
Just a thought .
Here ’s how you can help
The skateboard and BMX communities owe a lot to the iconic bridge connecting lower Manhattan and Brooklyn .
Sadly , its days as a skate and bike spot might be numbered .
Over the past four years , the Brooklyn Banks have enjoyed a wealth of success as a public , free , safe and progressive spot .
But beginning in December , reconstruction on the Brooklyn Bridge will lead to the closure of the Banks for an indeterminate period of time , with the space to be utilized as a staging area for trucks and construction equipment .
According to the New York City Department of Transportation , the massive reconstruction project has been in the planning stages since 2007 , when the New York State Department of Transportation deemed portions of the Brooklyn Bridge to be either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete .
The reconstruction includes the rehabilitation and widening of the approaches and exit ramps , and painting the entire bridge to prevent steel corrosion .
The project is expected to last until 2014 .

Towering above the East River , the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the world 's longest and oldest suspension bridges .
Upon its completion in 1883 , the bridge became an iconic addition to the New York skyline .
Culturally , it has been featured as a backdrop in a multitude of films , and beneath , the Banks have played host to a thriving skate and BMX scene in New York for more than 25 years .
Located at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side , the Brooklyn Banks are a dilapidated municipal park consisting of empty basketball and handball courts , chess tables and the sloping natural terrain of the bridge 's support work .
Constructed of brick , the Banks span the approximate length of a football field , running parallel and on a slight incline to the bridge overhead .
Near the bridge 's exit ramp , the slope of the Banks rises up a gradual , smooth bank to about 15 feet in height .
Littered across the park are assorted skate ramps , rails and random pieces of discarded furniture that have been repurposed into obstacles for bikes and skateboards .

Over the years , the Banks have acquired a wealth of obstacles , from straight - up quarters to grind boxes to a tight - trannied Jersey - style spine contraption .

Throughout the years , the Brooklyn Banks have become one of the most noteworthy and legendary skate and BMX spots in the world .
They 've been featured in countless skate and BMX videos , and more recently , they appeared on the HBO series " Bored To Death " as a backdrop for a scene featuring skateboarders .
Across the globe , the Banks are the spot of spots .
Skateboarders and BMXers the world over visit New York to skate and ride the Banks , and were they to have a guest book located near either of the two entrances , the list would be a veritable who 's who of skate and BMX past , present and future .

In 2001 , the role of the Banks changed drastically .
The smaller , less intimidating banks were cordoned off and relayered with grass , while the larger , more popular area of the Banks became makeshift weekday parking .
Almost overnight , the spot was shut down .
But that changed when 5 boro Skateboard 's Steve Rodriguez stepped in .
Rodriguez worked closely with the transportation and parks departments to ensure that the Banks would be returned to their former incarnation as a place for skateboards and bikes by organizing clean - up days and working diligently to fix up the area after it had fallen into disrepair .
Slowly , Rodriguez 's efforts paid off .
In 2004 , both sides of the Banks were fenced off from automobile traffic .
In 2005 , the Banks became a legal skate space .
According to Rodriguez , " [ The DOT ] said it would be for ' a year or so . '
Hopefully , we can work something out where they do the work in stages , allowing the Banks to open in the nice times of the year . "
For the sake of skateboarding and BMX in New York , let 's hope so .

Alistair Darling 's UK Election Give Away Budget Crippled by Debt and Liabilities
The Race is on , How Far Can Labour Boost the UK Economy Before it Goes Bust ?
On Wednesday Alistair Darling had hoped he could implement the next phase of Britain 's debt fuelled economic recovery in advance of the May 2010 General Election .
Unfortunately time is not on the Chancellors side as the exploding debt mountain far beyond the levels estimated by the Chancellor of a year ago ( as illustrated below ) has now crippled the Chancellors options in delivering a further big stimulus bounce into the General Election , as further reckless behaviour will likely send foreign investors rushing for the exit out of sterling assets .
Both Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown have made many noises during the past few weeks of cutting Britians budget deficit , including most recently announcing the intention of introducing a bankster 's bonuses tax .
However tomorrow we will find out if they Labour government will continue the forecast behaviour of May 2009 , that the Labour party had embarked upon a programme of bankrupting Britain into a May 2010 general election so as to deliver the Conservative Party a scorched earth economy .
So far every action the Labour government has taken rather than talked about doing has supported this outcome .
Therefore given the track record we can expect very little by ways of actually attempting to get a grip on the countries dire fiscal position .
Pre-Budget Report Analysis of Possibilities
Public spending cuts - Nothing of any significance as the public sector workers are traditional Labour voters , in fact we may even see a net increase in spending .
Though he may target the quango's .

Tax Rises -

Debt -
The Chancellor will probably estimate borrowing for the currently tax year up from £ 175 billion to £ 190 billion , a year ago he estimated it would be just £ 38 billion !
In summary
The poor and working class will be bought off and relieved .
The higher rate tax payers will be fuming and thinking of emigrating .
The Bankster 's will think of new ways to dodge paying their fair share of tax with representatives of the British Bankers Association doing the rounds on TV news channels with hankies out crying poverty .
Debt Fuelled Economic Recovery Heading for Double Dip Recession
The UK economy remains on track to bounce back into the 2010 election , as indicated by June 's in depth analysis , however this economic recovery is based purely on debt as shown by the graph below , as the Labour government 's strategy is to deliver the next Conservative government a scorched earth economy .
Alistair Darling 's forecast for government net borrowing for 2009 and 2010 in November 2008 totaled just £ 70 billion .
However , since the amount of projected borrowing has mushroomed to £ 350 billion , which is set against my November forecast of £ 405 billion for 2009 and 2010 alone , with continuing subsequent large budget deficits thereafter of well above £ 100 billion a year .
Whilst many economists were surprised by Alistair Darling 's April forecast that the UK Economy would grow by 1.25 % in 2010 and 3.5 % in 2011 .
However we need to consider the following in that 1.25 % growth on the annual GDP of £ 1.2 trillion equates to growth of just £ 15 billion and for 2011 ; 3.5 % growth equates to just £ 42 billion .
Therefore the government is borrowing a net £ 175 billion for 2009 and £ 175 billion for 2010 to generate £ 15 billion of growth , and then a further £ 140 billion for 2011 for £ 42 billion of growth .
Thus total net borrowing of £ 490 billion to grow the economy by just £ 67 billion , ( £ 595 billion my forecast ) which shows the magnitude of the scorched earth economic policy now implemented that literally aims to hand the next Conservative government a bankrupted economy that will be lumbered with the consequences of continuing huge budget deficits and therefore necessary deep cuts in public spending .
Whilst the OECD and other mainstream organisations / press have been busy in recent months revising their economic forecasts , my forecast remains as is and continues to project towards post general election tax hikes and deep public spending cuts that will in my opinion triggeras illustrated by the graph below .
Bankrupting Britain Debt and Liabilities
The total liabilities as a consequence of bailing out the bankrupt banks and debt fuelled economic recovery remains on target of £ 4.75 trillion by the end of 2013 / 14 , which confirms that Britain remains firmly on the path of a probable decade of economic stagnation coupled with high inflation i.e. stagflation .

On a cool spring eve , March 15th , 2009 , a bat , crippled and wistful , clung to the Space Shuttle Discovery as it was thrust toward the great beyond .
Goodbye and godspeed , my magnificent Spacebat .
Advertisement
At some point during the countdown , Spacebat — a Free - Tailed Chiroptera — was spotted latched to the foam of the external fuel tank , occasionally moving but never letting go .
Wildlife experts deduced that he had injured his wing and shoulder , leaving him with little chance of survival .
He remained on the tank until launch .
NASA 's cold report ?
The animal likely perished quickly during Discovery 's climb into orbit .
True !
But here 's how it should have read :
Bereft of his ability to fly and with nowhere to go , a courageous bat climbed aboard our Discovery with stars in his weak little eyes .
The launch commenced , and Spacebat trembled as his frail mammalian body was gently pushed skyward .
For the last time , he felt the primal joy of flight ; for the first , the indescribable feeling of ascending toward his dream — a place far away from piercing screeches and crowded caves , stretching forever into fathomless blackness .
Whether he was consumed in the exhaust flames or frozen solid in the stratosphere is of no concern .
We know that Spacebat died , but his dream will live on in all of us .

There you go , NASA .
Spacebat 's majestic final moment is pictured below .

The New York state
calls it “ Empire Gold , ” but many drivers lining up to buy new license plates next year may be reminded of the old yellow ones they had on their cars between 1973 and 1986 .
These plates — unveiled Tuesday by the DMV — wo n’t share the price of the older ones as the change is designed to raise $ 129 million in general fund revenue over two years .
Beginning April 1 , the state will require new license plates for every one of the estimated 10 million cars , trucks , trailers and ATVs registered in the state at a cost of $ 25 — a $ 10 increase over the current cost .
If you want to keep your same license plate number , it will cost another $ 20 .
In September , the state increased driver ’s license and registration fees 25 percent .
The governor ’s office has said the new licenses could make $ 129 million for the cash - starved state , which has a projected budget deficit next year nearing $ 5 billion .
The legislature last spring approved a measure authorizing the license plate plan .
Nearly 57,000 people have signed an online petition to protest the new license plan by St. Lawrence County Clerk Patricia Ritchie .
Oswego County Clerk George Williams has also mounted a petition drive against the new plates .
“ The county clerk has failed to provide any solution to the state ’s budget crisis and the revenue that this program would bring in , ” said Morgan Hook , a spokesman for Gov. David Paterson .
The DMV and the governor ’s office says reissuing plates is important for overall safety and law enforcement because plate visibility tends to decrease over time .
Well I have to say that one of my favorite Christmas gifts
for this year is an old CD released in 1993 : Mortal Kombat : The Album .
Upon first seeing it I figured it was just a nifty release of the in - game music , but
when I popped this in to my car I discovered what kind of ride I was really in for …
Just looking at the cover you expect this to be some heavy death - metal or something – but you would be disappointed , and then totally repaid in full .
Back in 1993 , the musical sensation was techno as it burst upon the world from the Belgian underground with heavy synth keyboard and percussion .
I would definitely not just call this album just techno either , it has a couple different styles to it , which I would compare more to artists than genres .
The initial track , “ Johnny Cage ( Prepare Yourself ) is a heavy beat based techno with Scooter - styled rapping of the lyrics .
It ’s pretty fantastic : the refrain being “ prepare yourself ” and “ Johnny Cage is not afraid to die ” .
I would definitely have to point out the fifth track on the album also , because opening shout of “ Mooortall Kombat ! ” became the rallying cry of Mortal Kombat fans everywhere .
The fantastic features of this album , besides some pretty catchy beats and keyboard melodies ( and piano on sub - zero ’s song ) are the unbelievably painful , yet great lyrics to each song that span the line of epic and bad so close that you have to choice but to love them .
Sonya ’s song is particularly notable for this .
All jesting and flinching aside , this album is still pretty bad ass and can get you pumped for some Halo any day .
The album was crafted by The Immortals , which is composed of Belgian ’s Maurice Engelen and Oliver Adams .
The pair are more well known as Lords of Acid , which is famous for their controversial techno songs stemming from their first album : Lust .
The goal of the album was to promote the games as they first came out on the SNES , Genesis , and Game Boy .
So if you ’re looking for a cheap last minute gift , a little piece of video game and techno history , maybe some nice gaming music , or just a fantastic collection of techno songs : Mortal Kombat : The Album is worth it .

“ Oh , my God !
You ’re actually getting married in a few hours !
I mean , everything ’s gonna be all different .
Carla , you never have to have sex again except for when you actually want to . ”
Elliot from Scrubs .
Husbands often complain about too little sex :
One in five couples , he says , have a sexless marriage ( having sex 10 or fewer times per year ) and that if they want to get out of this painful rut , they ’ll have to work together .
…
“ The man says ‘ Why do n’t we have more sex ? ’
And the woman says ‘ Why do n’t we have more intimacy ? ’ ” he explains . …
Most often , he says , the problem is much more mundane : “ The sexual charge no longer is there . ”
Well the charge must be there for him , or he would n’t ask .
So the charge is n’t there for her ; what does she want ?
The authors of Why Women Have Sex :
Women ’s sexual attraction tends to be far more nuanced .
It ’s affected by … how a man smells … sense of humor and confidence , social status … other women ’s judgments of how attractive he is … in addition to the visual cues .
…
Some women reported having sex to give someone else an S.T.D. or to extract revenge on someone who had wronged them .
…
Young women today … had sex just for the pleasure of it , … they wanted to be sexually experienced and add “ another notch on their belt ” ; they had sex because they were competitive with other women — they wanted to win ; and they were curious — they had sex just to see what it was like with men of different ages , ethnicities , careers , and penis sizes . …
I ’m personally betting on the “ Mr. Right Hypothesis , ” which suggests that women use sexual orgasm , in part , as a mate selection device .
Men who are attentive to the woman , sexually unselfish , take the time to learn what turns her on , etc. , tend to make good partners and possibly good dads .
…
Some women came to the conclusion , after being with one partner for several years , that they were just not very sexual creatures .
Then when they switched to a different partner , all of a sudden they started to blossom sexually .
…
Women are all different in their sexual needs .
Do n’t assume that what worked in the last relationship will be as effective in the next .
This complexity allows women to be honestly confused about what they want , but it can also hide motivated differences between what women say or think they want , and what really drives their choices .
For example , reduced sex might come from wives respecting husbands less than before , from seeing overly willing wives as lower in status , or from withholding sex to gain bargaining power on other issues .
The most emailed NYT article today is Elizabeth Weil ’s account of trying to improve her marriage :
Early in our marriage , when nearly everything was still up for grabs :
Where would we live ?
How much money was enough ?
What algorithm would determine who would watch the baby and who would go to the gym ?
Recently those questions had settled , and our marriage felt better for it . …
The competitive mind - set came roaring back , as I reasoned , unconsciously anyway , that any changes we made would either be toward Dan ’s vision of marriage and away from mine or the other way around .
Admitting too much satisfaction seemed tantamount to ceding the upper hand . …
A friend had recently told me that he thought I was the boss in my marriage .
Did I really want to negotiate my marriage anew and risk losing that power ? …
I thought I had avoided becoming one of those mothers who transferred all of her romantic energy from her husband to her children .
Apparently I failed .
But Dan , in my view … at times he ignored the kids .
…
Among our most longstanding fights was how much energy and money should go into Dan ’s cooking .
… I garnered no sympathy from our friends .
Still , Dan ’s cooking and the chaos it created drove me mad . …
I let Dan pick the first exercise , … “ reromanticizing . ” …
Step 1 : Complete this sentence in as many ways as possible : “ I feel loved and cared about when you ___ . ”
Dan quickly jotted down “ submit to kissing , clean the kitchen , tell me I look studly . ” …
For the next few weeks , even our sex was more intimate , more open and trusting .
Then I found myself recoiling .
… following intimate nights , I ’d walk up to our kitchen from our bedroom below and want to pretend it did n’t happen .
Dan would caress the small of my back .
I ’d squirm away . … I did start watching my reactions when Dan told me that I looked beautiful .
Did he mean it ?
What did he want from me ? …
Since the beginning of this project , Dan had been waiting for one thing : sex therapy . … I [ tried ] … to think , while we were making love , that Dan was not predictable … by telling myself I did not know what to expect , I wanted to move toward him , to uncover the mystery .
…
Now I was having the same sweaty feelings I had in my 20s , when I would let my psyche ooze into that of a new lover at the start of an affair . …
But by now I noticed a pattern : improving my marriage in one area often caused problems in another .
…
I spent a lot of time feeling bad about this , particularly the fact that better sex made me retreat .
[ HT to Tyler . ]
Let ’s review .
Dan wanted more sex , while Elizabeth wanted more money and time from him .
Each time they found a new pattern leading to better sex , she found herself pulling away .
And initially she noted , “ Admitting too much satisfaction seemed tantamount to ceding the upper hand . ”
The obvious interpretation here is that she had been unconsciously withholding sex to gain marriage power ; when better sex increased her unconscious fear of losing power , her unconscious pulled her away to regain that power .
Marriage is a deal men enter into part to get sex , but a time - inconsistency problem haunts this deal .
Most parts of the deal , such as who earns and spends how much , who does what chores , where they live , and so on , become entrenched in stable habits , which are hard to change from day to day .
But due to complex female sexuality , the man is supposed to accept the sex part of the deal fluctuating from day to day and year to year for unknown and unexplained reasons .
So the wife is less committed to her sex part of the deal than the husband is to most of his parts .
The wife can implicitly threaten to withhold sex for last minute demands , but even if he meets those demands she may still decline .
And if she is not in the mood there is little he can threaten to withhold at the last minute that is of comparable value .
Without kids he might threaten to leave the marriage , but that is a dangerous game to play .
Presumably overall this problem makes men less , and women more , willing to marry , though it may also make men more eager to marry to signal their confidence that this problem wo n’t befall them .
I see two general ways to avoid this time - inconsistency problem :
Obligatory
Sex – more explicit norms about the frequency and nature of sex , norms wives are expected to meet even when less in the mood .
Perhaps wives would have to do something unpleasant , like exercise lots , when there was no sex .
Nonobligatory
Other – remove something wives want lots from the usual set of stable husband contributions , so husbands can threaten to withhold that without being a pariah .
Perhaps the expectation that he sleep at home [ added : or maybe a big budget he could spend on extras for him or her ] ?
Both these approaches have been common in the past .
Either would make women less willing to marry .
Men wo n’t propose these because that would signal a lack of confidence , but women could propose them to signal they do n’t expect a sex problem .
Intuitively this seems unlikely , thought I ’m not sure exactly why .
Added 3 p : I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again : people express strikingly little sympathy for sex - starved men .

Yvo Schaap , a young Dutch application developer on Facebook , stumbled on a back door into any user account that accesses the application he ’s working on .
He discovered the exploitable mistake while trying to get around a function limitation on his application , and realized he could modify the accounts and that his illegitimate interventions into the account could n’t even be traced .
He immediately proceeded to notify Facebook and MySpace – the two social networks shared the same problem – and they fixed it .
But how did this came to be ?
The developer explains in his blog post that Flash applications run on a users ’ computer and are able to request data from another domain and load it into its environment .
Usually , a Flash application hosted on one domain ca n’t open a file on another .
But as this sometimes limits the capabilities of the flash application , “ Adobe introduced a “ crossdomain.xml ” file which could allow certain domains accessing another domain , leading to cross domain access by certain or all domains . ”
Facebook did block access through Flash from any non-facebook domain , but by simply changing the subdomain you can circumvent the barrier and access domain data :
“ This would n’t be a big deal if the subdomain only hosts images , but unfortunately this domain hosts the whole Facebook property , including a facebook user session .
If you have auto - login enabled on Facebook , you might recognize your fullname and the keys to do actions from the accounts credentials . ” writes Schaap .
Skipping to MySpace , there is again the same mistake :
farm.sproutbuilder.com , the domain in question , hosted an application builder that can ( among other things ) upload Flash applications .
“ All what has to happen is an active session , or a “ auto login ” - cookie and a URL which hosts a exploiting Flash file .
For example when accessed , a automatic “ post update ” could be made , that would lure friends of the user to access the exploit URL , and the exploit would spread virally .
An more invasive and hidden exploit could harvest all the users personal photo ’s , data and messages to a central server without any trace , and there is no reason why this would n’t be happening already with both Facebook and MySpace data . ” says Schaap .
It ’s a debate that goes well beyond France .
In the United States , Self magazine , which champions accepting one ’s “ true self , ” recently published a thinned - down photo of the singer Kelly Clarkson , with a headline pushing “ total body confidence . ”
Lucy Danziger , Self ’s editor , defended the photo as “ the truest we have ever put out there , ” but many disagreed .
There was also a fuss about a bizarrely retouched photo of the model Filippa Hamilton , whose waist was reduced to the width of her head , for a Ralph Lauren ad in Japan .
Brigitte , a popular German woman ’s magazine , decided last month that as of 2010 it would only use photos of “ ordinary ” women .
The editor , Andreas Lebert , said he was “ fed up ” with retouching photos of what he considered underweight models .
In France , Inès de La Fressange , a former model and clothes designer , calls Ms. Boyer ’s bill “ demagogic and stupid , ” arguing that the causes of anorexia are complex .
Dominique Issermann , a French fashion photographer , thinks that Ms. Boyer has not only misunderstood the problem , but also the nature of photography itself .
“ There is this illusion that photography is ‘ true , ’ ” she said .
But a camera can easily distort reality through the use of a different lens without any retouching .
“ As soon as you frame something you exclude something else , ” she said , adding that photographs are “ a piece of reality , but the reality of the world is different . ”
In family photos , for instance , “ Someone always says , ‘ That does n’t look like you at all . ’ ”
For Ms. Issermann , the problem is not photography , but a “ prepubescent style ”  a kind of adolescent androgyny , in which skinny , not very muscular young men are paired with skinny , not very curvaceous girls “ disguised as women . ”
Still , she said , digital pictures often need retouching “ to recreate the emotion that caused you to press the shutter in the first place . ”
She pointed to her well - known shot of Keira Knightley taken for Chanel .
Most people think the picture was retouched to enlarge Ms. Knightley ’s partly exposed breast , Ms. Issermann said , but in fact the retouching was done “ to add a bit on the thigh .
She ’s too thin there . ”

Research Box Title
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has made the deepest image of the universe ever taken in near - infrared light .
The faintest and reddest objects in the image are galaxies that formed 600 million years after the Big Bang .
No galaxies have been seen before at such early times .
The new deep view also provides insights into how galaxies grew in their formative years early in the universe 's history .
The image was taken in the same region as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ( HUDF ) , which was taken in 2004 and is the deepest visible - light image of the universe .
Hubble 's newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) collects light from near - infrared wavelengths and therefore looks even deeper into the universe , because the light from very distant galaxies is stretched out of the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum into near - infrared wavelengths by the expansion of the universe .
This image was taken by the HUDF09 team , which was awarded the time for the observation and made it available for research by astronomers worldwide .
In just three months , 12 scientific papers have already been submitted on these new data .
The photo was taken with the new WFC3 / IR camera on Hubble in late August 2009 during a total of four days of pointing for 173,000 seconds of total exposure time .
Infrared light is invisible and therefore does not have colors that can be perceived by the human eye .
The colors in the image are assigned comparatively short , medium , and long , near - infrared wavelengths ( blue , 1.05 microns ; green , 1.25 microns ; red , 1.6 microns ) .
The representation is " natural " in that blue objects look blue and red objects look red .
The faintest objects are about one - billionth as bright as can be seen with the naked eye .
These Hubble observations are trailblazing a path for Hubble 's successor , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , which will look even farther into the universe than Hubble , at infrared wavelengths .
The JWST is planned to be launched in 2014 .
The HUDF09 team members are Garth Illingworth ( University of California Observatories / Lick Observatory and the University of California , Santa Cruz ) , Rychard Bouwens ( University of California Observatories / Lick Observatory and Leiden University ) , Pascal Oesch and Marcella Carollo ( Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Zurich ( ETH ) ) , Marijn Franx ( Leiden University ) , Ivo Labbe ( Carnegie Institute of Washington ) , Daniel Magee ( University of California , Santa Cruz ) , Massimo Stiavelli ( Space Telescope Science Institute ) , Michele Trenti ( University of Colorado , Boulder ) , and Pieter van Dokkum ( Yale University ) .
Majnoon oilfield goes to Anglo - Dutch and Malaysian consortium in second auction of oil assets since 2003 invasion
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A consortium led by Shell has won the rights to develop the giant Majnoon oilfield at the second auction of Iraq 's oil rights since the 2003 invasion .
The auction for about a third of the country 's known reserves quickly surpassed last summer 's sale , with Majnoon the largest field on offer in the current round .
A group of oil companies led by China 's CNPC struck a deal to develop the Halfaya field .
There are 10 fields being auctioned over two days under tight security at the Iraqi oil ministry 's headquarters .
Last summer 's auction saw a single deal struck despite eight fields being on offer .
Shell and Malaysia 's state - run oil company , Petronas , beat another consortium consisting of France 's Total SA and China National Petroleum Corp for the rights to Majnoon , which has estimated reserves of almost 13bn barrels of oil , compared with 4.1 bn for Halfaya .
A total of 45 firms are vying for 20 - year contracts to develop the 10 fields , spanning from northern Iraq to major fields in the Basra region in the south .
Among the bidders are Britain 's BP , America 's Exxon Mobil and state - backed companies from Asia .
The deals are crucial for Iraq , which relies on oil for 90 % of its government budget and sorely needs international companies ' help in boosting production and revamping its dilapidated oil sector .
Iraq has the world 's third - largest known oil reserves .
Although the security situation has improved since the 2007 surge of US troops , the auction takes place against a background of attacks in Baghdad that killed at least 127 people on Tuesday and raised questions about the ability of Iraq security forces to stem the violence as US troops depart .
Opening the auction , Iraq 's prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , played down the significance of Tuesday 's attacks .
" There is no security deterioration in Iraq even if a security violation took place here , " he said .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , flew into Iraq to discuss security concerns .
In a meeting with Maliki he expressed his condolences for the Baghdad bombing and offered any assistance the country might need .
NO DARK and smoke - filled room greeted the man Prime Minister Kevin Rudd decries as part of a worldwide conspiracy of sceptics intent on sabotaging any new climate treaty .
Instead , a gathering of avowed '' sensible ' ' environmentalists listened closely in the plush surrounds of Melbourne 's Park Hyatt Hotel to a speech by Britain 's Lord Christopher Monckton , who dismissed as ' ' bogus ' ' fears of global warming .
Lord Christopher Monckton believes a treaty in Copenhagen next month would create a new tyranny in world affairs .

'' Those who have been fostering what is essentially a baseless scientific scam have being trying to make the obvious sound absurd and the absurd sound obvious , and we are now going to turn the tables on them , '' Lord Monckton said .
With a rapid - fire computer slide - show as counterpoint to the famed warnings by former US vice - president Al Gore , Lord Monckton set out to an Institute of Public Affairs conference what he called a litany of lies by the United Nations on climate change .
Most egregiously , Lord Monckton said , UN reports on climate change ignored evidence of global temperatures that were higher during medieval times than now .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Oprah Winfrey said on Friday that she will end her popular TV show in 2011 because it “ feels right in her bones ” after 25 years , and urged viewers not to believe rumors of why she ’s quitting .

“ This show has been my life and I love it enough to know when it ’s time to say goodbye .
Twenty - five years feels right in my bones , and it feels right in my spirit .
It ’s the perfect number , the exact right time , ” Winfrey said during Friday ’s show at her Chicago studio .
Winfrey , 55 , did not divulge her future plans .
But her production company Harpo Inc. said in a statement that once production ends on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” in 2011 , she “ plans to appear and participate in new programing for OWN ” , the Los Angeles - based cable TV venture she formed with Discovery Communications Inc .
Harpo said the launch date for OWN , or the Oprah Winfrey Network , which will be seen in more than 70 million homes , was now set for January 2011 .
During her long career atop the television talk show heap , Winfrey ’s fluctuating weight and personal relationships have become tabloid fodder , and commentators have wondered whether she was tiring of the grind -- only to see her slim down and revive her show ’s popularity .
“ Over the next couple of days you may hear a lot of speculation in the press about why I am making this decision now , and that will mostly be conjecture , ” she said .
Winfrey choked up once and wiped away a tear as she thanked viewers for having “ graciously invited me into your living rooms , your kitchens and into your lives .
“ So here we are , halfway through the season 24 .
And it still means as much to me to spend an hour every day with you as it did back in 1986 , ” she said .
Oprah delayed the 3 - 1/2 - minute announcement until the end of the show .
She began the show saying she would make an announcement at end , then went into a segment about a 5 - year - old girl who was murdered and raped .
She then probed for personal details in interviews with Gabby Sidibe , the star of the Winfrey - produced movie “ Precious , ” and comedian Ray Romano , who was promoting his new TV show about middle - aged men .
Her predominantly female audience gave her a standing ovation and then hugs when she stepped into the crowd .
“ The Oprah Winfrey Show , ” broadcast from Chicago on ABC stations across the United States and in more than 140 countries overseas , is one of the TV industry ’s biggest money - makers .
It is the top-rated U.S. daytime talk show , averaging 7.1 million viewers this year .
It has helped Winfrey , born in 1954 to a single mother in rural Mississippi , amass a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $ 2.3 billion and anchored an entertainment empire that produces television talk shows , movies , and the style magazine O , the Oprah Magazine .
Winfrey , who also earned an Oscar nomination for her supporting role in the 1985 film “ The Color Purple , ” is considered a major opinion - maker in the United States .
Her public backing of presidential candidate Barack Obama last year was considered a boost for the Democrat ’s campaign .
Her book and product choices have launched best - sellers and marketing bonanzas .
In a telling moment on the show , she noted Romano was at one time the best - paid actor on television and then told him : “ I do n’t make decisions based on money , and neither do you . ”
Winfrey ’s disarming style that endeared her to her viewers has encouraged such celebrities as Michael Jackson , Tom Cruise and Whitney Houston to unburden themselves on camera .
She promised more of the same in the coming 18 months , saying she and her staff will be “ brainstorming new ways we can entertain you and inform you and uplift you when we return here in January ” after a holiday hiatus .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Cambridge researchers have identified a group of traders consistently able to outperform the market , even during the credit crisis .
The study by John Coates and Lionel Page of the University of Cambridge offers a rare glimpse into how biology , experience and compensation schemes work together to make a profitable and - crucially - a prudent risk taker .
The study , published in the open- access journal PLoS ONE , builds on previous research by Coates and colleagues that found higher levels of testosterone , in both the male foetus and the adult , predicted higher profitability among so - called ' high frequency ' traders .
It also casts doubt on the Efficient Market Hypothesis .
In the current study Coates and Page examine a more subtle measure of performance than profits - a trader 's Sharpe Ratio .
This is the ratio between how much money a trader makes and the amount of risk taken in making that money .
According to Dr Coates , who previously ran a trading desk on Wall Street : " A trader making $ 100 million would normally be considered a star , but not if the trader could just as easily have lost $ 500 million .
A trader 's Sharpe Ratio is a better measure of skill than profits alone because it would expose this trader as reckless . "
The authors calculated the Sharpe Ratios for 53 male high - frequency traders in the City of London .
These are traders who buy and sell futures but hold their positions for only seconds or minutes .
They then compared the traders ' ratios for the period 2005 - 07 with the Sharpe Ratio of the Dax , the German stock market and the traders ' benchmark index .
They found that experienced traders in the study group ( those trading for more than two years ) had an average Sharpe of 1.02 , significantly higher than the Dax , which averaged 0.53 during the same period .
Importantly , in a follow - up they ascertained that the experienced traders performed on average even better during 2008 , a year in which many traders at other banks and hedge funds lost more money than they had made in the previous five years .
The out - performance of these traders is unlikely to be due to chance , say Coates and Page , because they also found that the Sharpe Ratios of these traders increased significantly the longer they had traded , indicating that they were learning to be more prudent risk takers .
The study casts doubt on the Efficient Market Hypothesis , which has over the past 20 years encouraged a laissez - faire attitude to the financial markets .
According to this hypothesis the markets are random , so no one can consistently achieve a higher Sharpe Ratio than the broad market , and no one can improve at trading , just as no one can improve at flipping coins .
The experienced traders in this study , however , were outperforming the market and were learning , implying that markets are not in fact efficient .
The study also sheds new light on Coates ' previous finding that a surrogate measure of pre-natal testosterone exposure , the second to fourth finger length ratio ( 2D:4D ) , predicts a high frequency trader 's lifetime profitability .
Coates and his colleagues could not say at that time if testosterone was affecting the amount of risk taken by the traders or the amount of money they made per unit of risk , i.e. their skill .
They now find that 2D:4D does not predict Sharpe Ratios .
Coates , now a research fellow in neuroscience and finance , says : " It seems testosterone affects the amount of risk traders take but not their skill . "
The study has practical implications for banks and hedge funds which need to know , when allocating capital and bonuses , whether a trader 's performance is due to skill or luck .
" Our study suggests a novel way of remunerating traders .
Banks could use an improving Sharpe Ratio over time as a measure which reliably indicates a trader has developed a skill worth paying for , " says Coates .
By paying bonuses on profits alone , however , the banks and hedge funds may have encouraged traders to maximize their risk , rather than Sharpe Ratios .
" The traders in our study , on the other hand , received no bonus , only profit shares .
They had therefore a strong incentive to lower , not raise , the variance of their profits , " added Coates .
The study shows how biology and management can work together .
Traders are risk takers so need a high tolerance for risk , a trait predicted by a measure of prenatal androgen exposure .
" However , this trait , like height or speed in sports , may count for little without proper training and the right incentives .
In trading , as in sports , biology needs the guiding hand of experience , " he concluded .

Sen . Barack Obama USA TODAY
Obama calls for universal health care WASHINGTON  Every American should have health care coverage within six years , Democratic Sen. Barack Obama said Thursday as he set an ambitious goal soon after jumping into the 2008 presidential race .
" The time has come for universal health care in America , " Obama said at a conference of Families USA , a health care advocacy group .
" I am absolutely determined that by the end of the first term of the next president , we should have universal health care in this country , " the Illinois senator said .
Obama was previewing what is shaping up to be a theme of the 2008 Democratic primary .
His chief rivals , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards , also are strong proponents of universal health care and have promised to offer their plans .
ON DEADLINE : Democrats embrace health care themes Obama said while plans are offered in every campaign season with " much fanfare and promise , " they collapse under the weight of Washington politics , leaving citizens to struggle with the skyrocketing costs .
He said it 's wrong that 46 million in this country are uninsured when the country spends more than any one else on health care .
He said Americans pay $ 15 billion in taxes to help care for the uninsured .
" We can't afford another disappointing charade in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , " Obama said .
" It 's not only tiresome , it 's wrong . "
Obama 's call was an echo of a speech he made last April when he said Democrats " need to cling to the core values that make us Democrats , the belief in universal health care , the belief in universal education , and then we should be agnostic in terms of how to achieve those values . "
His argument Thursday not only will be considered through the prism of the presidential campaign , but weighed against rival Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton 's ill - fated plan to overhaul the health care insurance system when she was first lady .
Even after leading that calamitous attempt in 1993 , Clinton remains in favor of universal health care and has made it a central theme of her presidential bid .
" One of the goals that I will be presenting ... is health insurance for every child and universal health care for every American , " she said at a community health clinic in New York Sunday , the day after entering the 2008 Democratic field .
" That 's a very major part of my campaign and I want to hear people 's ideas about how we can achieve that goal . "
On Thursday , she criticized Bush 's proposal to make health care more affordable through tax breaks , arguing that it would lead to less funding for hospitals .
Addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors , Clinton was self - deprecating in describing her own experience in the health care debate and joked that Bush would need some heavy - duty protection as he wades into the fight .
" I welcome his participation in the health care debate .
I 'm going to send him a suit of armor because I know anybody who puts a foot in the health care debate is gonna need that .
I 've got the scars and experience to show for it , " said the New York senator .
Another candidate , Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich , also backs universal health care .

Google likes to trumpet transparency and free expression , especially when it concerns the internet , part of its commitment to the corporate motto , " Do n't Be Evil . "
But despite the company 's recent online public policy posts espousing unfettered online expression , we are n't buying it .
The Mountain View , California , search and advertising giant said Wednesday , for example , that it was a " company that believes deeply in free expression " and that it was " determined to continue to do our part and make new , significant contributions to promote free expression in 2010 . "
But juxtapose those and other recent statements on its public policy blog with the real facts – facts that Google wo n't cough up .
We asked Google some simple questions about how much user data it turns over to the government .
These are questions at the heart of free expression , especially with a company that wants you to use its operating system , its browser , its DNS servers , its search service and its e-mail and phonecalling programs .
Google , however , declined to address the question adequately .
Here 's Google 's answer , as provided by spokesman Brian Richardson :
We do n't talk about types or numbers of requests to help protect all our users .
Obviously , we follow the law like any other company .
When we receive a subpoena or court order , we check to see if it meets both the letter and the spirit of the law before complying .
And if it does n't we can object or ask that the request is narrowed .
We have a track record of advocating on behalf of our users .
What is Google hiding ?
Are the numbers so big that Google might be seen as an agent of the government , or that people might rethink the wisdom of filling up 7 GB of free e-mail space ?
These are questions we 've been asking of Google since 2006 , when it launched its five - point plan to deal with censorship in China .
To be fair , no other tech company and no ISP publishes this data , either .
But there 's certainly no law against it .
Google prides itself on doing brave and innovative things that other companies would n't even consider doing , just because it 's the right thing to do .
But instead , Google has chosen to side with the rest of the industry and refuse , on principle , to be open with their customers .
That makes us think Google agrees with some peers that suggest that the public simply can't handle the truth .
Verizon , for example , recently told the government it might " confuse " the public if it released how much it charged the government to assist in collecting user data via pen register / trap - and - trace orders and wiretaps .
Yahoo said its pricing structure amounted to " confidential commercial information " and would " shock " consumers .
Verizon made its statements as it objected to a Freedom of Information Act request from graduate student Christopher Sogohian seeking its price sheet , and said the company receives " tens of thousands " of requests annually from law enforcement agencies for customer records and information .
Verizon did not intend for that number to be made public .
It announced the figure in a letter to the government that became public last week through a follow - up FOIA request by Soghoian .
Sogohian 's intention was to combine the price sheets , with government data on how much it spent on getting phone and net records , to figure out how many requests the feds sent per year .
We suspect , not unreasonably , that Google also receives " tens of thousands " of law enforcement and other requests each year for data – with most of them being lawful .
But we do n't have any sense of how often the government or others go on a wide - open fishing expeditions .
Google knows , but it 's not telling .
We do n't know how many subpoenas Google turned away ; how many sought search records ; and how many came in civil cases , such as a divorce where an unhappy husband wanted to see what 's in his soon - to - be ex-wife 's Gmail account .
Google defends its policy , saying it has a history of fighting for privacy .
It uses the example of its successful court fight to keep bulk search records from the feds .
What 's more , Google has belatedly become a leader in online advertising privacy , giving users the chance to see what the company 's behavioral advertising algorithms think of them , to delete categories and opt out entirely .
In fact , Yahoo liked the idea enough to launch its own version just weeks ago .
And Google on Wednesday deplored that an increasing number of governments are restricting access to information online , such as China blocking sites that could be viewed as anti-government .
Google also applauded this week a bill that would force the State Department to include more information in its human rights reports .
That 's laudable .
Yet Google retains information , and refuses to share data that could shed a bright light over how much the government and others potentially tread on online privacy .
Google has the chance to walk its talk , and set a standard – as it has so many times before – for the rest of the internet to follow .
If it does n't , should n't the company think twice about trumpeting transparency , when it wo n't come clean with its own users ?

A group of US students has created an entire orchestra out of separate iPhone applications .
As part of their studies , the group from the University of Michigan built the applications themselves and composed music for them .
While some of the applications sound similar to traditional instruments , others make unique noises .
The iPhone handsets are attached to speakers which the performers wear around their wrists .
A live concert of the students ' original compositions is planned for 9 December .
It will mark the end of their three - month course , run by Austrian computer scientist and musician Georg Essl .
He told BBC News that while the concept of using computers to make music was not new , the rise of smartphones had made the idea more practical .
" I come from this community of people who work on sophisticated ways of making sounds , " he said , " but they tend to be very handcrafted prototypes .
I realised that few people end up using them . "
" Now everybody has a smartphone , the question of how you get an instrument into people 's hands has disappeared . "
Starting from scratch Unlike traditional instruments , iPhones do not have to be physically modified for sound , Mr Essl said .
The in - built microphone can be transformed into a non-speech sensor , enabling students to blow into it in order to mimic a wind instrument .
The motion sensors can also be used musically - an application can be programmed to sound different when the device is tilted , for example - but the desired effect is down to the individual designer .
" In many ways , composition for us means composing the instrument as well as the music , " said Mr Essl .
" We can choose what a tilt will mean . "
He admitted that the new technology was a work in progress that would advance as the devices themselves became more sophisticated .
" It 's about playing with what you 're given , " he said .
" The piccolo is never going to play the bass line . "
Back to basics
Some traditional orchestras agree that smartphones have a part to play in making professional music .
There are lots of applications that are incredibly useful to musicians - our piano tuner uses the iPhone tuner application to tune Steinway pianos for our performances at City Hall
Stephen Duffy , Scottish Symphony Orchestra
" There are lots of applications that are incredibly useful to musicians - our piano tuner uses the iPhone tuner application to tune Steinway pianos for our performances at City Hall , " said Stephen Duffy , spokesperson for the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra .
" Every musician I know who has an iPhone uses that application . "
However , he added that most classical musicians did not take the instrument applications particularly seriously .
" Let 's face it , you 're not going to play a concerto on an iPhone .
It would be interesting to see what people do as a group - but applications will never replace the real thing . "

A 12 - year - old Timaru boy has rammed a police car during a chase that reached speeds up to 140 kmh in his parents ' people mover .
The chase , lasting 13 minutes early on Saturday , was one of three police pursuits around Timaru at the weekend .
Police spotted the boy in the seven - seater sport van on Evans
St with its lights turned off about 2.30 am .
Police attempted to pull the van over , but the boy drove into the centre of town in the Stafford , Church , Theodosia streets area before heading north .
The boy lost control of the vehicle after turning left in to Blair St on Hilton Highway and was boxed in by at least three police cars .
Sergeant Ian Howard said the young driver reversed into a patrol car , shunting it out of the way to escape .
He headed north on State Highway 1 to Temuka , and then drove through a number of stop signs .
His journey came to an end when he drove into no -exit Bridge St .
The boy then got out of the van and ran off .
He was chased down by a police officer .
A police communications centre spokesman said the pursuit reached speeds of 140 kmh .
The boy was taken back to the Timaru police station and his parents were called .
The boy can not be charged because of his age , but his parents ' details will be given to the police 's insurance company to recoup the cost of repairs to the patrol car , Mid South Canterbury area controller Dave Gaskin said yesterday .
The patrol car received damage to a front guard and wheel .
" There is nothing we can do with a 12 - year - old .
The parents are not criminally responsible , but perhaps civilly .
Perhaps the insurance company will make a civil claim , " Mr Gaskin said .
" I would hope the parents would be suitably ashamed of their son's actions . "
While there would be no legal ramification for the boy , Mr Gaskin expected issues relating to his care and protection would be raised , considering he was out driving at 2.30 am .
It was the second Timaru patrol car put off the road in recent weeks .
A fortnight ago an officer on the way to a serious domestic incident , drove through the North - Theodosia streets intersection with lights and sirens on .
An elderly driver drove into the police car .
The second pursuit occurred about 5.30 pm on Saturday , after police received several reports of bad driving involving a 2007 Mercedes Benz 4WD .
Valued at $ 120,000 , it had been reported stolen from Christchurch .
Police laid spikes on the Hilton Highway in an attempt to stop the vehicle , but the driver went into the Plar Lap Raceway .
Two 20 - year - old Christchurch men ditched the vehicle and ran towards State Highway 8 .
Police chased them through several private properties before apprehending the pair .
The men face a range of charges including burglary , possession of cannabis , theft , unlawfully getting into a vehicle and unlawfully taking a vehicle .
Police are still hunting the vehicle involved in the third pursuit .
A driver failed to stop for police on Otipua Rd about 12.40 am yesterday .
A police officer pursued the vehicle but gave up on Beaconsfield Rd due to the speed the car was travelling .
The vehicle was possibly a Holden Commodore with the registration plate beginning with the letters WM .
The New York Times ' hockey blog Slap
Shot is n't exactly the most respected hockey source , but Jesus , it 's still the New York freakin ' Times .
You'd think they would be better than this :
In last June ’s N.H.L. entry draft , N.C.A.A. players comprised only 3.3 percent of all players selected , as opposed to 21.3 percent from the Ontario Hockey League alone .
Ten years earlier , N.C.A.A. players made up 13.2 percent of the league ’s draftees .
Bolded even !
The truth is , 62 players who have played , or will play NCAA hockey were taken in last year 's NHL Draft which comprised 29.3 percent of all players selected .
Ten years earlier , the rules regarding age for the draft were vastly different than they are today .
Under the current rules , a player basically has to be a year ahead of his normal age group in school in order to be playing NCAA hockey during his first year eligible for the draft .
There are a total of four players in the NCAA this year that have n't already been eligible for the NHL Draft , while there are dozens who have already been drafted .
To imply there has been a drop for any other reason than not counting players already drafted prior to playing in the NCAA is absurd , especially when the number of former college players in the NHL - - nearly 300 played at least a game in the NHL last , almost a third of all NHL players -- has increased over that period of time .

After Obama ’s Afghanistan speech
German military pushes to overturn post - war constraints
By Peter Schwarz
3 December 2009
The escalation of the war in Afghanistan has plunged the second government of Angela Merkel ( CDU , Christian Democratic Union ) into a serious crisis .
Just four weeks after taking office , the highest - ranking general of the Bundeswehr ( Armed Forces ) , a senior civil servant and the country ’s former defence minister have been forced to go .
As always with such crises , one must differentiate between the immediate trigger and the deeper causes .
The immediate trigger was the cover -up of the Kunduz massacre , the bloodiest military action involving German soldiers since the end of the Second World War .
The deeper causes lie in the fundamental changes undertaken in the Bundeswehr :
After over six decades as a nominally defensive force , Germany ’s military is once again claiming the right to kill the inhabitants of other countries with impunity .
In view of Germany ’s history , such a change does not happen without creating tensions and upheavals .
The overwhelming majority of the population still opposes German soldiers being sent on war missions .
Following the terrible crimes of Hitler ’s Wehrmacht ( armed forces ) , Germany maintained no army of its own in the first ten years following the war .
In 1955 , at the highpoint of the Cold War , the German government created the Bundeswehr , over the bitter opposition of the population .
Its task remained limited to the defense of NATO territory ; it was practically never involved in any war missions .
That changed with German reunification and the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Germany regained its full sovereignty , and the ruling elite looked for ways to pursue its foreign policy interests , including by military means .
After several smaller missions under the auspices of the UN , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) - Green Party coalition in Berlin finally opened the way for the Bundeswehr ’s first large - scale war engagement : participation in the Kosovo war .
This was a war disputed in international law , in the course of which Serbia came under substantial bombardment .
Three years later in 2002 , the SPD - Green government dispatched the Bundeswehr to Afghanistan .
Because of continuing opposition to the use of the Bundeswehr in war situations , this deployment was presented as a peace mission or reconstruction operation .
The Bundeswehr , according to the official propaganda , is not engaged in a war and is also not an army of occupation ; rather , it is securing peace , stabilizing the country and thereby creating the necessary conditions for the construction of civil society and the country ’s infrastructure .
However , this fiction can no longer be maintained .
The war in Afghanistan has continued to escalate over the past months , and with the decision of President Obama to increase the number of American troops by a further 30,000 to 100,000 , it has taken on a scale similar to that of the Vietnam War .
The goal of this war is not to democratize the country or the destroy Al Qaeda , but to defend the hegemony of the imperialist Western powers in oil - rich central Asia .
The new German defense minister , Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg , expressed this openly in his inaugural visit to Washington , when he said , one must bid farewell to the “ romantic idea of the democratization of the entire country according to the Western model ” .
This development has led to considerable tensions in the Bundeswehr .
It is participating in a brutal war of occupation , in which soldiers daily risk their lives and the tally of civilian victims grows .
Despite this , the government is clinging firmly to its previous propaganda that Afghanistan is purely a security and policing mission .
In the eyes of the military , this not only robs the Bundeswehr of urgently needed public acknowledgment , it also results in German troops being subjected to civilian law .
If they kill Afghan civilians , they face investigation by German public prosecutors .
While American and British elite troops routinely kill alleged Taliban forces and destroy entire settlements with remote - controlled missiles , German soldiers must reckon with criminal investigations if they do the same .
It was in this situation that the massacre of Kunduz occurred .
It is still unclear what induced Bundeswehr Colonel Georg Klein to request an air strike on two kidnapped petrol tankers on September 4 , which according to NATO sources killed up to 142 victims , including numerous civilians .
What is certain is that the official presentation of the event is riddled with unexplained contradictions .
For example , it is still claimed that Klein called for the air attack without consulting his superiors .
That explanation lacks any credibility , if one considers that six hours elapsed between the hijacking of the two trucks and their destruction , during which they were under constant observation , were a considerable distance away from the German base and were bogged down in a sand bank — thus obviously presenting no direct danger to the German forces .
In the meantime , it is clear that Klein directly violated several of NATO ’s basic rules of engagement and misled the pilots of the American fighter - bombers that dropped the deadly munitions .
There was neither an acute threat nor any other direct enemy contact , without which Klein had no authority to unilaterally issue the instruction for the air strike .
Der Spiegel , which evaluated the official investigation report , arrived at the conclusion : “ Whoever reads the ISAF report carefully gains the impression that Klein wanted to kill . ”
The entire German government reacted to the Kunduz massacre by systematically hiding the truth and deceiving the public .
For days , Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung denied that there had been civilian casualties .
In parliament , Chancellor Merkel attacked all those who would “ prejudge ” the Bundeswehr .
And one month later , Jung ’s successor , Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg , continued to defend the air strike as militarily necessary .
In the end , the cover - up attempt failed because powerful forces within the military opposed this course of action .
Twelve hours after the bombing , the American ISAF commander General Stanley McChrystal visited the scene in person and criticized the actions of Klein .
The “ Initial Action Team ” that accompanied him came to the conclusion that there was a “ very great probability of civilian victims ” .
This information was also reported in the media , which supplied additional proof of the number of civilian victims .
With the German government finding itself increasingly boxed in , Bild - Zeitung published internal Bundeswehr reports and a video of the air strike from one of the combat aircraft involved .
They exposed the government ’s lies and led to the resignation of general - inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan , State Secretary Peter Wichert and the former Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung , who in the meantime was a minister in the department of labour .
It is not clear who passed on the incriminating material to Bild - Zeitung .
It could only have originated from within military circles .
According to Der Spiegel , there are rumors in the defence ministry that it came from those close to Jung ’s successor Guttenberg , in order to get rid of unpopular figures in the ministry of defence .
Although Guttenberg participated in the cover -up of the massacre , he has positioned himself as the mouthpiece of the military and strives to provide them with the necessary legal and political room for maneuver to conduct their international war missions .
In any case , the leading German authorities are now compelled to adopt a clear position .
The public prosecutor ’s office in Potsdam has handed over its case files on Colonel Klein to the Federal Prosecutor ’s Office .
Experts expect that this will be dealt with as a matter of international criminal law , which could have far reaching consequences .
Klein could only be punished if he had deliberately committed a war crime — of which the Federal Prosecutor ’s Office will surely not accuse him .
On the other hand , killing people in Afghanistan within the context of the ISAF mission would be legal .
The relevant penal code originates from 2002 .
It was enacted by the SPD - Green Party government shortly after the beginning of the Afghanistan war .
Publicly , it was presented as a means by which war crimes and crimes against humanity could be pursued even if they were committed by non-Germans outside Germany .
However , it also contains clauses regulating the responsibility of military commanders .
If Colonel Klein is acquitted based on these sections of the penal code , or if proceedings against him are halted , this would create a precedent .
The Bundeswehr would have been given a charter to kill as part of their foreign missions , without having to face any legal investigations .
This is something which the military has been demanding a long time .
They demand “ legal security ” , which includes the Afghanistan operation being called by its proper name — a war .
The new defence minister , Guttenberg , supported this demand on the day he was inaugurated by ditching the previous phraseology and describing the mission in Afghanistan as “ armed conflict ” and a “ non-international war ” .
The parliamentary defence committee , which convened Wednesday as a committee of inquiry , is also pursuing the goal of backing the Bundeswehr .
The object of its investigation is not the events in Kunduz but the “ communication breakdown ” in the ministry of defense , which should be avoided in future .
By holding the inquiry under the auspices of the defence committee , its deliberations can be held in secret , to avoid too much information reaching the light of day .
Its members are regularly briefed about current events and are obliged to uphold strict rules of secrecy — and to a certain extent are investigating themselves .
Moreover , all the Bundestag parties are deeply implicated in the Afghanistan war : the SPD and the Greens sent the Bundeswehr to Afghanistan ; the Christian Democrats and the Free Democratic Party want to increase the level of Germany ’s troop commitment ; and the Left Party calls for a “ departure strategy ” , but only after peace is brought to the country and the situation is under control .
If as a result of the Kunduz massacre the Bundeswehr is given a charter to kill , this would have far - reaching consequences .
Not only would it be able to act more ruthlessly against the insurgents in Afghanistan , resulting in more civilian victims , it could also participate more freely in the deliberate killings that are a hallmark of modern colonial wars .
Above all , the American , Israeli and British armies have for a long time deliberately liquidated those accused of being terrorism suspects .
Dubious intelligence or a denunciation suffices to carry out a death sentence , without the accused ever needing to face a public prosecutor or a judge .
The sentence is usually carried out by remote - controlled missiles .
Debates have taken place on an international level for years concerning the legal gray area in which these slayings occur .
The participation of German soldiers in such actions has far reaching historical implications .
During the “ vernichtungskrieg ” ( war of extermination ) on the Eastern Front , Hitler ’s armed forces committed war crimes on an almost unimaginable scale .
Since then , the German military has had its hands bound .
The removal of such fetters has dangerous consequences for the international and German working class .
They argue that the mustangs are an integral part of the west 's ecosystem and that using helicopters to round them up – before they can be lassoed – could traumatise , injure and even kill the animals .
General Hammond summons Colonel Jack O'Neill out of retirement to embark on a secret rescue mission .
O'Neill confesses that he disobeyed orders to destroy the Stargate on Planet Abydos , and that scientist Daniel Jackson may still be alive .
Arriving on Abydos with his team , O'Neill meets up once again with the scientist , who has discovered a giant elaborate cartouche in hieroglyphics .
All signs point to the fact that this is a map of many Stargates that exist throughout the galaxy - a development that makes the dream of the SG - 1 team to travel throughout the universe in time a reality .

What were the key events of the decade ?
As we enter the last few weeks of the 2000s , the Magazine is asking readers to tell the story of the last 10 years , based on five themes .
Tim Footman , author of a book about the Noughties , recalls some of the decade 's significant news stories .
The decade was defined by two events that occurred seven years and a few blocks apart .
The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on 11 September 2001 , killed nearly 3,000 people and directly affected many more .
They also led to a chain of events that altered the lives of hundreds of thousands in Afghanistan and Iraq , Bali and Madrid , London and Mumbai , and throughout the world .
WHAT IS 'PORTRAIT OF THE DECADE ' ALL ABOUT ?
We want readers to help us to create a portrait of the decade people , news stories , objects and culture Each day this week we focus on a different theme - words and Readers can make their suggestions using the form below Try to be original
It is not a vote - an expert will pick 20 in each category
The final 100 things about the Noughties will be revealed on Monday , 14 December An artist will illustrate them on a colour poster for readers
Our guidelines for Portrait of the Decade The collapse of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 showed just how serious the financial crisis was , and symbolised the precarious nature of the economics that had underpinned material prosperity during the Noughties .
That said , the sight of stunned employees carrying away their cardboard boxes did n't encourage us to look any more kindly upon bankers .
But is n't that a very Western perspective ?
After all , far more people - about 230,000 - died in the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004 than perished on 9/11 .
Do we in the West disregard that catastrophe , and Cyclone Nargis in Burma , and the Bam earthquake in Iran , because they did n't happen in New York ?
Depending where you are in the world , did the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan have more impact on your life , or East Timor finally achieving independence ?
Cyprus joining the EU , or the retirement of Fidel Castro in Cuba ?
Maybe you ignored politics altogether , and the big news event of the decade was Lance Armstrong winning his seventh Tour de France , the Led Zeppelin reunion , the end of Concorde or the arrival of the final Harry Potter book ?
THANKS FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS
The contributions are now closed
We will publish a list of 20 of your news stories of the decade on Monday
The emotional impact of Michael Jackson 's death transcended geography , culture and age , although the compulsively weird spectacle of his funeral was a real only - in - America moment .
To identify the really big stories , we have to consider not just the interest they generated , but how much real impact they had on people 's lives ; although in some cases the jury will still be out as we enter 2010 .
Debate continues to rage over whether global warming is the single biggest threat to life on earth , or whether the Copenhagen Climate Summit will turn out to be a lot of fuss over nothing .
It may be too early to say whether the stuttering launch of the Large Hadron Collider or the election of President Obama will turn out to be false dawns .
By contrast , the election of George W Bush eight years before was more like a false start ; the closeness of the Florida vote - the so - called " hanging chads " controversy - delayed the final decision for weeks .
MEET THE EXPERT Tim Footman is the author of The Noughties : a Decade That Changed the World ( Crimson Publishing ) , as well as books about Leonard Cohen and Radiohead .
He has also written for The Guardian , Prospect and Mojo
The same fears were raised about the 2008 Olympics in Beijing , but it lived up to expectations , and not only as a sporting spectacle ; the event showed the extent to which China had been welcomed as a truly global power , with an economic heft that outweighed the private qualms that many governments had about its human rights record .
But I 've got a hunch that one of the really big stories of the decade went all but unreported at the time .
The launch of Wikipedia , on 15 January 2001 represented a fundamental shift in the hierarchy of information .
Along with Twitter , YouTube , Facebook , blogs and the other manifestation of Web 2.0 , it meant that the final judgement as to what was significant would never again be left to a self - appointed elite of media professionals .
The nature of news itself is changing .
What were the big events of the Noughties ?
You tell me , and that , in the long run , may turn out to be the biggest change of all .
We have now stopped accepting your suggestions , but thanks to all who have contributed .
The series continues all week and the Portrait of the Decade will be published on Monday

Wall Street traders are n't what they used to be - they 're not even on Wall Street anymore .
The days of swashbuckling backslappers on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange have given way to an era of trading dominated by analytical technical whizzes whose computers may be running from a town in deepest New Jersey or Texas .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
While street smarts and an ability to socialize were crucial to successful floor traders , today 's trader needs math and computer science , and quite possibly a PhD .
And that has to be coupled with coolness , organization and logic to sift through masses of trading data each day and think about how to shave microseconds off trades .
" The old markets were based on retribution - I knew who you were and you would trade with me again and again , and if you did n't treat me right I would n't trade with you , " said Al Berkeley , chairman of electronic brokerage company Pipeline Trading Systems and former vice chairman and president of the Nasdaq Stock Market .
" The difference is anonymity .
If you play a game with the same people over and over again , you reach an understanding about what 's acceptable .
If the game is completely anonymous , there are no rules between people , there are only rules imposed by the marketplace . "
The outsized growth of high - frequency trading , dark pools of liquidity and high - tech computer algorithms has fundamentally changed the game on Wall Street - and the psychology of those who work there .
Traditional floor trading " really is an alpha - male activity , " said Brett Steenbarger , and an associate professor of psychiatry at State University of New York at Syracuse and an expert in the psychology of trading .
" You get these highly competitive people taking a good amount of risk ...
It 's like being in a locker room .
In contrast , computer programmers are almost like a think tank . "
Now , with high - frequency trading representing some 60 percent of U.S. stock trades , the atmosphere appears to owe as much to Arthur C. Clarke and artificial intelligence as to Gordon Gekko and the 1987 movie " Wall Street . "
" They are introverts , some are socially awkward , and they do n't seek publicity .
They are the type of guys you would see at a Star Wars convention , " said Sang Lee of Aite Group .
High - frequency traders are practical , problem - solving people with an engineering background .
" It 's a very intellectually challenging field -- it 's extremely exciting to develop a strategy , implement it and see it make money , " Steenbarger said .
And it can be very lucrative , with a programer typically making 10 per cent commission on the money his model generates , said Irene Aldridge of Able Alpha Trading , a one - time quantitative specialist at CIBC in Toronto who has a forthcoming book on the practicalities of high - frequency trading and algorithmic strategies .
The best programmers can make tens of millions of dollars a year .
That was even the case during last year 's financial crisis , as great volatility offered both risks and opportunities for high - frequency traders .
" It 's a highly technical , mathematical game , " Berkeley said .
" They are playing a very precise game of statistically estimating and predicting over the next three to five seconds whether there is going to be any liquidity in that stock and where it is .
And how they can take it without being seen and without leaving any tracks . "
Low key and somewhat awkward , these introverted but brilliant traders look up to James Simons , the Renaissance Technologies fund manager known as the " King of the Quants . "
A media - shy mathematics professor , the 71 - year - old Simons has made billions of dollars by making the right bets on technical trading strategies .
In January he will retire from his firm , which manages $ 17 billion ( £ 10.2 billion ) in assets , but will leave an indelible mark on the industry .
In fact , the Simons model has made " PhD " some of the most common letters seen following the names of today 's top traders .
Expert mathematicians , physicists , computer scientists , engineers and economists have used technical skills to excel in trading .
Among new recruits , Wall Street experience is n't valued nearly as much as programing aptitude .
" These are not your Harvard B - school grads , per se , " said Robert Olman , president of Alpha Search Advisory Partners , an executive search firm for hedge funds and proprietary trading shops .
" They often have dual degrees , bachelors and masters .
One degree is going to be computer science , and the other degree might be financial engineering , math , physics , " he said .
Traders have discovered that mathematical techniques can help them gain more control over their trades , said Berkeley .
They hunt for trading venues that give them the fastest trades at the best price without exposing their strategies to rivals .
An obsession with milliseconds has led high - speed traders to focus on " co-location , " where trading shops try to place themselves as close as possible to an exchange 's data centers .
High - frequency trading shops that focus on options have sprung up in Chicago , near the options exchanges , and in New Jersey , where trading venues like BATS and Direct Edge are located and where the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange house their data centers .
" High - frequency traders use the computer and the speed of the computer to take control of the situation , " said Pipeline 's Berkeley .
" It 's just like having a high - speed fighter airplane versus a slow - speed one .
If I can turn inside your turning radius , and if I 'm faster than you are , I can win every time . "
The essence of algorithmic trading , Berkeley says , is to avoid trading at a bad price .
Traders get as much control as possible over how to enter an order , cancel an order , change the size of an order , or find out any other information that will help them stay ahead .
" It is all about converting the fact that you have very high speed and very precise control of your order into an advantage , " Berkeley said .
" If you do n't get the trade you want , your order is canceled .
You do n't sit there even for a nanosecond . "
However , high - frequency traders ' computer programs are not foolproof .
John Malitzis , vice president of market surveillance at the New York Stock Exchange 's oversight body , told a conference in September that he has seen examples , both in U.S. markets and elsewhere , of computer algorithms malfunctioning .
He calls them " algos gone wild . "
High - frequency traders are also often discreet and secretive .
Proprietary trading shops and banks spend millions developing complex algorithm strategies and want to keep them in a black box well away from their competitors .
" The social skills traditional traders have needed to serve clients are disappearing , " said Aldridge , herself an ex-trader at a " prop shop . "
" There was a lot more interpersonal communications on the trade floor , " she said .
" You see little of that at all anymore , because most of it is by computer . "
And that can be a risk in itself , some say .
While the computer traders are more coolly analytical , proprietary shops have had to put in control mechanisms to rein in the brilliant programmers who are sometimes so immersed in their reams of data that they lose perspective .
" They are so immersed in the market activity they do n't really have a panoramic ( view ) , " Steenbarger said .

Its seems that every animal has it own little intricacies .
Take for example a cow , the cow actually eats grass , brings it back up and then eats it again .
To that we all say , " That 's nasty ! "
Rabbits are not an exception to the weird animal behavior .
Have you ever seen a rabbit eating its own poop ?
As disgusting as it may sound , this is actually healthy for the rabbit .
Rabbit Dropping Types
Rabbits produce two types of droppings and they are very different .
The one most often seen is the fecal dropping .
These are the hard round ones that are seen in the dropping trays .
The rabbits do not eat these .
The other type of dropping is known as a cecotrope .
Sometimes it is referred to as the night droppings .
They actually resemble a small cluster of grapes .
In the picture at the right you can see their size in comparison to regular droppings .
Unlike fecal droppings these droppings are soft .
The Benefit of Cecotropes
Cecotropes are produced in the cecum which is a part of the rabbits digestive system .
Inside the cecum are bacterias that are essential nutrients to the rabbit .
It is believed that the cecotropes can protect the rabbit from harmful pathogens .
The rabbit will eat them as they are leaving their body .
Generally they do this late at night or in the early morning hours .
That is why they are sometimes called night droppings .
Since they are usually eaten , it is rare to see them in the dropping tray .
Conclusion
So the next time you see your rabbit eating its poop , although it sounds gross , is actually a very important part of the rabbits health .
Maybe they eat it at night , because they understand how gross we think it is ?
Giant pet rabbit that thinks he 's a dog after copying behaviour of family 's cocker spaniel
A pet rabbit has had an identity crisis after spending too much time with the family cocker spaniel and now believes he is a dog .
The Giant Poobah rabbit - also named Poobah - has gone barking mad and spends hours cuddled up with spaniel puppy Scout in his dog basket .
He has also started rejecting his green food and will only eat treats bought for Scout - including his wet dog food .
Barking mad : Poobah has started adopting canine behaviour since his family bought a cocker spaniel named Scout eight months ago
Taking over :
The giant rabbit has asserted himself as top- dog and often dominates the dog basket
The confused rabbit has copied Scout 's behaviour to such an extent that he even gets up on his hind legs and begs for snacks .
But Poobah has asserted himself as top - dog in the house and is piling on the weight from all the dog biscuits he is eating .
The three - year - old rabbit first began adopting the canine behaviour after Scout was introduced to the family home in Perranporth , near Newquay , Cornwall , eight months ago .
The furry friends both belong to 12 - year - old schoolboy Keiran Kent .
Choirboy Keiran , a pupil at the independent Truro School , said : ' Poobah and Scout hit it off immediately .
' Their friendship blossomed and Poobah began emulating Scout eating his dog biscuits . '
Best of friends : Kieran Kent 's games of fetch with Scout are often interrupted as Poobah tries to join in
Keiran 's grandmother Heather Anderton said the rabbit had recently taken his strange behaviour a step further and begun trying to join in when Scout plays catch with a stick or ball .
Heather , 74 , said : ' The rabbit is so funny he will actually go up on his hind legs and beg for biscuits like the dog .
When Keiran is lying down on the floor he will go over and groom him .
' The problem is he 's also taken - over the dog basket .
If Scout is sat in there he will go and sit on top of him .
' He 's eaten so much dog food he 's got really big , so he 's much bigger than Scout .
' We try to keep him on the dry food but he wolfs down dog biscuits and then just lies around the house , so he just keeps growing .
' Poobah even tries to get involved in the doggie games like catch but he gets tired much quicker than Scout . '

Unlike every other academic field , computer science uses conferences rather than journals as the main publication venue .
While this made sense for a young discipline , our field has matured and the conference model has fractured the discipline and skewered it toward short - term , deadline - driven research .
Computer science should refocus the conference system on its primary purpose of bringing researchers together .
We should use archive sites as the main method of quick paper dissemination and the journal system as the vehicle for advancing researchers ' reputations .
In his May 2009 Communications Editor 's Letter , 2 Moshe Vardi challenged the computer science community to rethink the major publication role conferences play in computer science .
Here , I continue that discussion and strongly argue that the computer science field , now more than a half - century old , needs to adapt to a conference and journal model that has worked well for all other academic fields .
Why do we hold conferences ?
To rate publications and researchers .
To disseminate new research results and ideas .
To network , gossip , and recruit .
To discuss controversial issues in the community .
The de facto main role of computer science conferences is the first item : rating papers and people .
When we judge candidates for an academic position , we first check the quality and quantity of the conferences where their work has appeared .
The current climate of conferences and program committees often leads to rather arbitrary decisions even though these choices can have a great impact particularly on researchers early in their academic careers .
But even worse , the focus on using conferences to rate papers has led to a great growth in the number of meetings .
Most researchers do n't have the time and / or money to travel to conferences where they do not have a paper .
This greatly affects the other roles , as conferences no longer bring the community together and thus we are only disseminating , networking , and discussing with a tiny subset of the community .
Other academic fields leave rating papers and researchers to academic journals , where one can have a more lengthy and detailed reviews of submissions .
This leaves conferences to act as a broad forum and bring their communities together .

A Short History of CS Conferences
The growth of computers in the 1950s led nearly every major university to develop a strong computer science discipline over the next few decades .
As a new field , computer science was free to experiment with novel approaches to publication not hampered by long traditions in more established scientific and engineering communities .
Computer science came of age in the jet age where the time spent traveling to a conference no longer dominated the time spent at the conference itself .
The quick development of this new field required rapid review and distribution of results .
So the conference system quickly developed , serving the multiple purposes of the distribution of papers through proceedings , presentations , a stamp of approval , and bringing the community together .
With the possible exception of Journal of the ACM , journals in computer science have not received the prestige levels that conferences do .
Only a fraction of conference papers eventually get published in polished and extended form in a journal .
Some universities insist on journal papers for promotion and tenure but for the most part researchers feel they have little incentive for the effort of a journal submission .
As the field went through dramatic growth in the 1980s we started to see a shift in conferences .
The major CS conferences could no longer accept most qualified research papers .
Not only did these conferences raise the bar on acceptance but for the papers on the margin a preference for certain subareas emerged .
Researchers from the top CS departments dominated the program committees and , not necessarily consciously , helped set the agenda with areas that helped their faculty , students , and graduates .
Over the years these biases became part of the system and unofficially accepted behavior in the community .
As CS grew the major conferences became even more selective and could not accept all the quality papers in any specialized area .
Many new specialized conferences and workshops arose and grew to capture these papers .
We currently have approximately a dozen U.S. - based conferences in theoretical computer science alone .
The large number of conferences has splintered our communities .
Because of limitations of money and time , very few conferences draw many attendees beyond the authors of accepted papers .
Conferences now serve the journal role of other fields , leaving nothing to serve the proper role of conferences .
Other disciplines have started to recognize the basic importance of computation and we have seen strong connections between CS and physics , biology , economics , mathematics , education , medicine and many other fields .
Having different publication procedures discourages proper collaboration between researchers in CS and other fields .
Back to Top
The Current Situation
Most CS researchers would balk at paying significant page charges for a journal but think nothing of committing well over $ 1,000 for travel and registration fees for a conference if their paper were accepted ( not to mention the time to attend the conference ) .
What does that monetary commitment buy the author ?
A not particularly fair review process .
With the tremendous almost continual growth in computer science over the past half - century combined with the desire of each conference to remain small and " competitive , " even with the increase in the number of conferences we simply have too many papers chasing too few conference slots .
Each conference has a program committee that examines submissions and makes decisions on which papers will appear at a conference and which will not .
The great papers almost always are accepted and the worst papers mostly get rejected .
The problem occurs for the vast majority of solid papers landing in the middle .
Conferences cannot accept all of these papers and still maintain their high - quality reputations .
Even if the best decisions are made , several good papers will not make the cut .
A variety of factors make the process imperfect at best :
Being on a program committee ( PC ) requires a large time commitment because of the number of papers involved .
With the increase in conferences , many researchers , particularly senior scientists , cannot serve on many of these committees , leaving these important decisions mostly to those with less experience .
As our research areas continue to become more specialized a few to none of the PC members can properly judge the importance of most results .
These specialized areas have a small number of researchers , meaning the appropriate PC members know the authors involved and personal feelings can influence decision making .
PC members tend to favor papers in their own areas .
The most difficult decisions are made by consensus .
This leads to an emphasis on safe papers ( incremental and technical ) versus those that explore new models and research directions outside the established core areas of the conference .
No or limited discussions between authors and the PC means papers often get rejected for simple misunderstandings .
Various conferences have implemented a number of innovative and sometimes controversial ideas to try to make the process more fair ( author information removed from papers , author responses to initial reviews , multilevel program committees , separate tracks for areas and quality , higher / lower acceptance ratios ) but none can truly avoid most of the problems I 've outlined here .
In the extreme many of the best scientific papers slip through the cracks .
For example , nearly half of the Gödel Prize winners ( given to the best CS theory papers after they 've appeared in journals ) were initially rejected or did n't appear at all in the top theoretical computer science conferences .
We end up living in a deadline - driven world , submitting a paper when we reach an appropriate conference deadline instead of when the research has been properly fleshed out .
Many also just publish " least - publishable units , " doing just enough to get accepted into a conference .

The Road Ahead
How do we move a field mired in a long tradition of conference publications to a more journal - based system ?
Computer science lacks a single strong central organization that can by itself break the inertia in our system .
The Computing Research Association , in its 1999 tenure policy memo, 1 specifically puts conference publications above journals : " The reason conference publication is preferred to journal publication , at least for experimentalists , is the shorter time to print ( 7 months vs. 12 years ) , the opportunity to describe the work before one 's peers at a public presentation , and the more complete level of review ( 4 - 5 evaluations per paper compared to 2 - 3 for an archival journal ) .
Publication in the prestige conferences is inferior to the prestige journals only in having significant page limitations and little time to polish the paper .
In those dimensions that count most , conferences are superior . "
A decade later the CRA should acknowledge that the growth in computer science and advances in technology changes the calculus of this argument .
Quick dissemination via the Web makes time to print less relevant and two or three careful journal referee reports give a much more detailed level of review than four or five rushed evaluations of conference reviewers .
The CRA needs to make a new statement that the current conference system no longer fully meets the needs of the computer science community and support the growth of a strong journal publication system .
This will also encourage chairs and deans to base hiring and promotion more on journal publications as it should be .
Many of the strongest computer science conferences in the U.S. are sponsored by ACM and the IEEE Computer Society .
These organizations need to allow special interest groups and technical committees to restructure or perhaps eliminate some conferences even if it hurts their publication portfolio and finances in the short term .
How do we move a field mired in a long tradition of conference publications to a more journal - based system ?
But most importantly , leaders of major conferences must make the first move , holding their conferences less frequently and accepting every reasonable paper for presentation without proceedings .
By de-emphasizing their publication role , conferences can once again play their most important role : Bringing the community together .
Back to Top
Conclusion
Our conference system forces researchers to focus too heavily on quick , technical , and safe papers instead of considering broader and newer ideas .
Meanwhile , we have devoted much of our time and money to conferences where we can present our research that we can rarely attend conferences and workshops to work and socialize with our colleagues .
Computer science has grown to become a mature field where no major university can survive without a strong CS department .
It is time for computer science to grow up and publish in a way that represents the major discipline it has become .

Filippo Menczer
I could not agree more , as I already mentioned in response to Moshe Vardi 's editor 's letter .
As program chair of an ACM conference I can attest to the many flaws
of the conference review process , in spite of everyone 's best efforts .
Time constraints , concentrated load , difficulty of holding a relaxed
rebuttal phase , competition among authors and referees , pressure to go
with average ratings , financial concerns ( attendance ) , and other
factors --- all bias and weaken the process in important ways .
And as an interdisciplinary researcher , I experience first - hand how
our conference - driven publication practices hurt us in terms of
impact , reach , and visibility .
Computing journals have very low impact
factors and very long dissemination times , compared to other science
disciplines .
Conferences hurt the viability of journals because top
researchers are busy refereeing conference papers .
The time
constraints of conferences make us submit papers in a rush before they
are ready , or impose long delays .
And competition for the top
conferences , as has been noted by others , means that many good papers
do not get the attention they deserve .
I propose a simple solution : abolish conference proceedings .
Then
papers will be submitted to journals instead .
Journals will receive
more and better papers .
Refereeing resources will shift naturally from
conferences to journals .
As a result , journals will gain impact ,
improve quality , and speed up their processes .
With our full
attention , they will become viable once again and the review process
will be more rigorous , effective and timely .
Deadlines will no longer
be concentrated and we can submit better work , revise it until it is
ready , and profit immediately and directly from reviewer 's feedback --
the same referee can judge improvements to a paper .
I could go on but
it seems the many advantages are obvious .
We would still hold conference , of course .
In many cases where
conferences and journals are nicely aligned , presentations can be
selected and invited among the best papers published in the previous
year .
For newer areas and groundbreaking work , a conference or
workshop can still accept submissions --- but it should not publish
proceedings ; publication is the job of journals .
ACM should take the lead in such a transition because it publishes the
proceedings of most top computing conferences , as well as many of the
top computing journals .
Therefore ACM has everything to gain from
leading the way .
ACM is also the only body that could successfully
shepherd such an undertaking .
The switch would not be easy , but with careful planning we could
manage a phased transition over a few years and catch up to the rest
of the scientific community .

I also agree .
Recently a journal editor asked me to expand an otherwise acceptable paper since " it could have been published in a conference " .
As a first step , it would be good if journals were to encourage original submissions , as well as those that have survived conferences .
My own , light - hearted , take on the difficulties of reviewing to a deadline are in " How to reject a paper you do n't like , but do n't know why " available at www - staff.it.uts.edu.au/~cbj/Publications/paper_rejection.pdf .

It 's nice to see this piece joining a growing chorus questioning the way we conflate the distinct concerns of disseminating knowledge , establishing professional reputation , and building community .
This problem is not unique to computer science , but we are certainly in a position to lead by example in addressing it .
In an age where distribution is nearly free , I agree that we should move the filtering role from content publishers to content consumers .
There 's no economic reason today why scholarship ( or purported scholarship ) should n't be published online .
Of course , the ability to publish digital content for free ( or close to free ) does not imply anyone will ( or should ) read what you write .
The blogosphere offers an instructive example : the overwhelming majority of blogs attract few ( if any ) readers .
I suspect that the same holds true for arXiv.org .
Of course , peer - reviewed content may not fare that much better , particularly given the proliferation of peer - reviewed venues .
Regardless , it makes no sense for publishers to act as filters in an age of nearly - free digital distribution .
That brings us to the question of how researchers should establish their professional reputation -- and , in the case of academics , obtain tenure and promotion .
Today , they have to publish in peer - reviewed journals and conferences .
Even if we accept the weaknesses of the current peer - review regime , we should be able to separate content assessment from distribution .
The peer - review process ( and review processes in general ) should serve to endorse content -- and ideally even to improve it -- rather than to filter it .
Finally , conferences should primarily serve to build community .
I find the main value of conferences and workshops to be face - to - face interaction , and I 've heard many people express similar sentiments .
Part of the problem is that so few presenters at conferences invest in ( or have the skills for ) delivering strong presentations .
But more fundamentally it's not even clear that the presentations are the point of a conference -- after all , an author 's main motive for submitting an article to a conference seems to be getting it into the proceedings .
Here are some questions I 'd like to suggest we consider as a community :
What if presentation at a conference were optional , and an author 's decision to present had no effect on inclusion in the proceedings ?
Would there be significantly fewer presentations ?
Would those fewer presentation be of higher quality ?
What if the process of peer - reviewing conference submissions required the submission of presentation materials rather than ( or in addition to ) a paper ?
Would the accepted presentations be of higher quality ?
Would researchers invest more in presentation skills ?
What would happen to strong researchers without such skills ?
Can we update the traditional conference format to foster more productive interaction among researchers ?
For example , should we have more poster sessions and fewer paper presentations ?
I 'd love to see the computer science community take the lead in evolving what increasingly feel like dated procedures for disseminating knowledge , establishing professional reputation , and building community .
I 've tried to do my small part , co-organizing workshops on Human - Computer Interaction and Information Retrieval ( HCIR ) that emphasize face - to - face interaction and organizing the SIGIR 2009 Industry Track as a series of invited talks and panels from strong presenters .
But I 'm encouraged to see " establishment " types like Moshe and Lance leading the charge to question the status quo .
David Karger
You 've described a problem that is dauntingly large and hard to solve .
We can make progress by tackling pieces .
The database community has one piece of the answer : their premier conference , VLDB , is now driven by a journal submission model ( http://www.jdmr.org/).
Authors submit to the journal , and a year 's worth of journal submissions are presented at each year 's conference .
The above url links to an excellent discussion of and rationale for their procedure .
You also highlight the way the proliferation of conferences has led to a breakdown in their value as tools for networking and drawing the community together .
For these , I propose a simple solution : colocation .
Take all those little conferences , and hold them all at the same time under one roof .
Let them keep their independence , but share their coffeebreaks and banquets .
Most importantly , allow anyone paid up at one conference to attend all of them --- after all , no matter how many conferences someone " attends " at the same time , they can only consume one human - being 's worth of resources .
The federated computing conference does this in large , but it would be equally affective for subfields of computer science to bring together all their sub-subfields .

I really like David Karger 's suggestion -- this way I have one place to send my students to where they will hear a large collection of interesting talks and hopefully deliver talks on their own research as well .
Right now , if a student 's paper is rejected from a " top " conference , I have to pay for them to go there to listen to interesting results and also pay for them to go to another conference where they might be presenting a paper .

Summits like Copenhagen can be frustrating because , by necessity , they place all the cards for positive ( and negative ) change in the hands of world leaders and delegates .
The rest of us can only watch as our path to the future is pulled apart , rearranged and stuck back together .
And when it all goes wrong , we feel more disenfranchised and powerless than ever .
But we do have power – and furthermore , we have the capacity to make meaningful change on an international level .
Recently , I was inspired to act by Tristram Stuart ’s Waste , an amazing narrative that uses reams of data to put our food wastage in a global context .
In the West , 10 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from producing food that is never eaten .
In the UK , 752,290 tonnes of CO2 is used to produce our waste food , and 87,767 hectares of our land .
Personal profligacy is obviously a factor , and it clearly never hurts to keep an eye on how we all purchase , store and consume food .
But it is a drop in the ocean compared to the waste generated by our major supermarkets .
Currently , supermarkets submit their suppliers ( farmers and manufacturers ) to restrictions that encourage waste on a large scale , including last - minute orders , take - back clauses , exclusivity clauses and in a final insult , leaving those suppliers with the responsibility and cost of disposing of the surplus .
And this surplus is gargantuan and , to consumers and the media , essentially invisible , so the supermarkets can carry on as they please – without ever revealing the true extent of their wastage
Part of the battle is just telling the supermarkets what we want – for example , as a consumer , I do n’t care if the shelves are empty at the end of the day , and I am happy to write to the supermarket chains I frequent to tell them as much .
But it ’s also about transparency and oversight of their waste practices , and that is where a supermarket ombudsman would come in .
We are in a unique position to demand this from the supermarkets – unlike many other companies , they cannot relocate to a more ‘ favourable ’ regulatory climate – they have to be where their consumers are , and their consumers are right here .
Last week Ed Miliband said “ the most important thing is that we do n’t lose heart and we do n’t lose momentum . ”
The momentum may not be as we had hoped , but it is here .
Let ’s use it .
Sign my petition for a supermarket ombudsman , and stop the supermarkets from using energy that could be used more productively elsewhere .

The East Anglia Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) revelations come as no real surprise to anyone who has closely followed the global - warming saga .
The Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) thesis , to give it its semi-official name , is no stranger to fraud .
It is no real exaggeration to state that it was fertilized with fraud , marinated in fraud , stewed in fraud , and at last served up to the world as prime , grade - A fraud with nice side orders of fakery and disingenuousness .
Damning as they may be , the CRU e-mails are merely the climactic element in an exhaustively long line .
A short tour of previous AGW highlights includes :
The Y2K Glitch .
This episode involved the NASA / GISS team led by James Hansen , possibly the most fanatical and unrelenting of all warmists -- a man who makes Al Gore look like a skeptic .
( Among other things , Hansen has demanded that warming " deniers " be tried for " crimes against humanity . " )
While examining a series of NASA temperature graphs , Canadian statistician Steve McIntyre , himself not so much a skeptic as an anti-warming Van Helsing , uncovered a discontinuity occurring in January 2000 that raised temperatures gathered over widespread areas by 1 - 2 degrees Fahrenheit .
McIntyre had no easy time of it , since Hansen refused to reveal what algorithm he'd used to process the data , forcing McIntyre to perform some very abstruse calculations to figure it out .
Once notified , Hansen 's team promised to correct the error , stating that it was an " oversight . "
When the corrected figures were at last released , they rocked the church of warming from bingo hall to steeple .
Vanished was the claim that the past few years were " the warmest on record . "
Now 1934 took precedence .
A full half of the top ten warmest years occurred before WWII , well prior to any massive CO2 buildup .
No explanation has ever been offered .
We have a Y2 K glitch that behaves like no other computer glitch ever encountered , uniformly affecting a large number of sources distributed almost nationwide .
Although the incident trashed all recent data and raised uncomfortable questions about the warming thesis as a whole , NASA itself made no effort at an investigation or inquiry .
All that we 're ever going to hear is " oversight . "
I guess that 's how they do things at NASA / GISS .
The Arctic Ice Melt .
We 've been informed for the better part of a decade that Arctic ice was melting at an unprecedented rate , and that the North Pole would be ice - free in twenty , thirty , or forty years , depending in the hysteria level of the media platform in question .
In truth , ice thinning was due to a cyclical weather pattern in which winds blow ice floes south into warmer water .
Everybody involved knew that this cycle occurred , everyone had seen it happen previously since time out of mind .
But it was too good an opportunity to pass up .
Worse yet , when the weather returned to its normal pattern two years ago , large numbers of scientists put in considerable effort to suggest that the " new " ice was thinner than usual and would vanish in a flash as soon as the temperatures went back up .
The media went along with the joke .
The Germans have a phrase to cover such eventualities : " this crew should be stripped of their trade . "
( Several expeditions setting out for the Pole to " call attention " to the coming Arctic catastrophe had to stop short due to icy conditions .
In one case , both women involved suffered serious frostbite . )
The Poor Polar Bears .
Closely related is the saga of the polar bears , staring extinction in the face due to warming , while somewhere beyond the aurora , Gaia weeps bitter tears .
This was evidently inspired by a single photograph ( you 've seen it -- the entire world has at this point ) of a woebegone polar bear crouched on a melting iceberg .
That bear had to be sulking over allowing a nice , juicy seal to escape , because it was in no danger .
Out of the twenty major polar bear populations , only two are known to be decreasing .
Estimates of bear population ( there are no exact figures ) have increased over the past forty years , from 17,000 to 19,000 to the current number of 22,000 to 27,000 .
The bears are becoming pests in municipalities such as Churchill and Point Barrow ( as clearly shown here ) .
Despite all this , the bear was put on the U.S. " endangered " list just last year .
The Hockey Stick That Was n't .
The " hockey stick " is a nickname for a chart prepared by Michael Mann , a Pennsylvania State University professor and leading warmist .
The chart purports to show temperature levels for the past millennium , and consists of a straight line until it reaches the late 20th century , when it suddenly shoots upward , creating the " hockey stick " profile .
This chart was a major feature of International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) reports on global warming and is a commonly used media graphic .
This chart creates immediate doubt in anyone knowledgeable about the climate of the past millennium , which more resembles a roller coaster than a straight line .
It developed -- in yet another impressive McIntyre takedown , this time with an assist from Ross McKitrick -- that Mann was utilizing an algorithm that would produce hockey sticks if you fed it telephone numbers .
( Mann is the " Mike " mentioned in the CRU e-mails , and this is one of his " tricks . " )
Despite this disclosure , Mann has never withdrawn the chart , offered an explanation , or made a correction .
The chart remains an accepted piece of evidence among warmists .
Tree -Ring Circus .
Due to the fact that direct temperature measures for past epochs are lacking , climatologists utilize " proxy measures , " such as tree rings , glacial moraines , and lake sediments .
Tree rings have played an important part in the warming controversy as evidence backing the claim that temperatures have been consistently lower worldwide until recently .
A crucial series of measurements utilized by Mann , among others , involves trees located on the Yamal peninsula in Siberia .
How many trees were measured , you ask ?
A hundred ?
A thousand ?
Ten thousand ?
The answer is twelve : a number perfectly adequate to trigger international panic , overthrow the capitalist system , establish Green totalitarianism , and completely turn Western culture on its head .
But it turns out that further measurements were in fact made in the area , involving at least thirty - four other trees .
And when this data is added to the original twelve , then the warming evidence disappears into the same branch of the Twilight Zone as the grip of Mann 's hockey stick .
Another " oversight " , you understand .
We could go on to mention the automated U.S. weather stations chronicled by the tireless Anthony Watts , which were conscientiously placed next to air - con vents , atop sewage plants , in parking lots , and in one case , in a swamp ( as many as 90 % may be giving spurious high readings ) .
We could mention the glaciers that are vanishing worldwide ... except where they are n't , or the endless papers demonstrating that the coral reefs -- along with various birds , animals , insects , and plants -- are facing extinction even though no warming whatsoever has occurred for twelve years .
( And in the thirty years before that , the total rise was 1.25 degrees Fahrenheit , easily within normal variation . )
Powerful stuff , this warming -- it maims and destroys even when it 's not happening .
It 's within this context that the East Anglia e-mails must be judged .
The vanishingly small number of legacy media writers who are paying attention behave as if the messages comprise some kind of puzzling anomaly , with no relation to anything that came before .
In truth , they stand as the internal memos from the East Anglia branch of the Nigerian National Bank , which can save us from the horrors of global warming after payment of a small up - front fee .
There is always a deeper level to the damage caused by fraud .
It strains social relationships , generates cynicism , and debases standing institutions .
What has suffered the most damage from AGW is faith in the scientific method , the basic set of procedures -- it could be called an algorithm -- governing scientific investigation .
These procedures embody simplicity itself : you examine a phenomenon .
You gather data .
You construct a hypothesis to explain that phenomenon .
And then ...
Well , first , let 's cover what you do n't do .
You do n't manipulate data ( as CRU chief scientist Phil Jones stated he was doing in the now - famous " Mike 's trick " e-mail , not to mention throughout the now - famous source code ) .
You do n't fabricate data ( as one CRU scientist did while compiling weather - station data .
Running into problems , he states , " I can make it up .
So I did . "
He adds an evil smiley face .
This e-mail has gone under radar up until now .
It can be found in the comments on James Delingpole 's blog . ) .
You do n't deny data to other investigators ( as Hansen , Jones , and , it appears , everybody else in the warming community has done at one time or another ) .
You do n't destroy evidence ( as the members of the CRU did following a Freedom of Information request ) .
You do n't bury contradictory data ( as Jones and several colleagues did in an attempt to undercut the impact of the Medieval Warming Period ) .
You do n't secretly manipulate the argument from behind the scenes ( as the CRU staff did with the website Realclimate.org. , screening comments to allow only those that supported the warming thesis ) .
You do n't secretly undercut your critics ( as Mann advised the CRU to do concerning the scientific journal Climate Research : " I think we have to stop considering ' Climate Research ' as a legitimate peer - reviewed journal .
Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to , or cite papers in , this journal . " ) .
You do n't try to get a journal editor critical of your case fired ( as the CRU staff evidently succeeded in doing with an editor for Geophysical Research Letters ) .
What you do , if you are a serious scientist operating according to the established method , is attempt to thwart your hypothesis .
Test it to destruction ; carry out serious attacks on its weakest points to see if they hold up .
If they do -- and the vast majority of hypotheses suffer the indignity embodied in a phrase attributed variously to Thomas Huxley and Lord Kelvin -- " a beautiful theory slain by an ugly fact " -- then you have a theory that can be published , and tested , and verified by other scientists .
If you do n't , you throw it out .
None of this , amidst all the chicanery , fabrications , and manipulations , appears to have been done by anyone active in global warming research , the CRU least of all .
From this point , we are forced to conclude that AGW is not science , and that any " consensus " that can be drawn from it is a consensus of fraud .
( The late - breaking revelations of temperature manipulations at New Zealand 's NiWA institute -- another one of Mike 's tricks ?
-- merely underlines the lesson of CRU .
Now that the dam has busted , we 'll be hearing dozens of stories like this over the weeks and months to come . )
The West is a technological society .
Science is as responsible for making us what we are as any other factor , including our democratic system of government .
The two are in fact complementary , each supporting and encouraging the other across the decades since this country was established .
( And yes , I am aware that Britain and Germany were both centers of scientific progress , both of them nations liberalized by the example of the United States .
Even the utterly authoritarian Bismarck was forced to heed the voice of the people despite his inclination to do anything but . )
The technology developed from scientific research has created a world that would be unrecognizable to our forebears of even a century ago .
Technology has transformed diet , health , communications , and transportation .
It has doubled lifespans in advanced countries .
Prior to the modern epoch , few ever caught a glimpse of the world past their own farming fields .
India , China , and Africa were wild myths , the Pacific and Antarctica utterly unknown , the planets and stars merely pretty lights in the sky .
Technology opened the world -- not just for everyday men and women , but for invalids , the disabled , and the subnormal , who once lived lives of almost incomprehensible deprivation .
Technology was a crucial factor in the dissolution of ancient empires and the humbling of aristocracies .
As Paul Johnson has pointed out , a technological breakout appeared imminent at a number of points in the past millennium .
Consider the anonymous Hussite engineer of the 15th century who left a notebook even more breathtaking than any of Leonardo da Vinci's , or the revolutionary English Levelers of the 17th century who dreamed of flying machines and factories .
If a breakout had occurred at those times , the consequences would have been unimaginable .
But the Hussites were destroyed by the German princes , the Levelers by the reestablishment of the English crown .
It required the birth of a true democratic republic in the late 18th century to provide the setting for a serious scientific - technical takeoff , one that after two hundred years has brought us to where we stand today , gazing out at the galaxies beyond the galaxies , with the secret of life itself within reach .
It is this , and no less , that scientific fraud threatens .
This is no trivial matter ; it involves one of the basic elements of modern Western life .
When scientific figures lie , they lie to all of us .
If they foment serious distrust of the scientific endeavor -- as they are doing -- they are creating a schism in the heart of our culture , a wound that in the long run could prove even more deadly than the jihadi terrorists .
Such failings are not relegated only to climatology .
The apparent success of the climate hustlers has infected all areas of research .
Over the past decade , stem - cell studies have proven a hotbed of fraud .
Recall Dr. Hwang Woo Suk , the South Korean biologist who claimed to have cloned various higher animals and isolated new stem cell lines to worldwide applause .
Suk was discovered to have faked all his research , prompting the South Korean government to ban him from taking part in any further work .
Nor was he alone .
Researchers throughout the field have been caught fabricating and manipulating data , and at least one large biotech company has developed a habit of announcing grand breakthroughs to goose its stock prices .
A number of factors are responsible , among them the grant - making process , which rewards extravagant claims and demands matching results , and the superstar factor , in which media adulation creates a sense of intellectual arrogance -- as in the case of Dr. Suk -- unmatched since Galileo 's heyday .
But the major problem lies in politics , specifically as involves ideology .
In both major recent cases of fraud , science had become entwined and infected with ideology to a point where its very nature was transformed .
It was no longer science in the classic mold , boldly asking basic questions without fear or favor .
It had become an ideological tool , carrying out only such research as met with the approval of political elites .
Stem - cell research became enmeshed with the abortion question .
Embryonic stem cells , obtained by " processing " aborted babies , received the lion 's share of funding and attention despite their showing no potential whatsoever .
Adult stem cells , obtainable from bone marrow , skin cells , or virtually any other part of the body , were shunted aside despite extraordinarily promising research results .
This bias permeated the entire field and distorted all perceptions of it -- one of the reasons Dr. Suk was so wildly overpraised was his willingness to attack Pres.
George W. Bush for limiting embryonic stem - cell exploitation .
The climatology story is no different .
Environmentalist Greens needed a threat -- one that menaced not only technological civilization , but life on earth itself .
They have promoted an endless parade of such threats since the 1960s -- overpopulation , pollution , runaway nuclear power , and global cooling -- only to see them shrivel like old balloons .
They required a menace that was overwhelming , long - term , and not easily disproven .
With global warming , the climatologists gave them one .
In exchange for sky - high funding , millennial scientists -- the heirs of Bacon , Copernicus , and Einstein , men who bled and suffered for the sake of their work -- continually inflated the nature and extent of the CO2 threat by using the sleaziest methods available , as we now know .
The result has been complete intellectual degradation .
Scientists were once among the most trusted figures in Western public life -- similar to bankers , priests , and doctors , but in a real sense , standing above them all .
Scientists were honored as truth - tellers , aware that their reputation for veracity and seriousness was their only real asset .
And while exceptions existed ( read the story of Blondlot and his N - rays , for one example ) , the public took them at their own valuation .
That has ended .
The concept of unblemished scientific integrity is now one with the scholastic monasteries and the academy at Athens .
Scientists today are well on their way to becoming an amalgam of the cheap politician and the three - card monte dealer .
They are viewed by the less educated as a privileged class making alarming and impudent claims for their own benefit .
The better - informed find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of being unable to defend something we once admired .
The next set of questions in physics cannot be answered without equipment costing billions at the very least , and possibly much more .
Will a disbelieving public pay for that ?
We are facing serious dilemmas concerning breakthroughs in biology , not only in stem - cell technology , but also in neurology and synthetic biology -- breakthroughs that threaten to distort the very nature of humanity itself .
Should we leave the solutions up to people who want us to pick a card , any card ?
It takes a lot to shock Cosmo staffers .
But yesterday we came across something online that elicited Oh my Gods and No effing ways around the office .
It 's a line of necklaces .
But not just any necklaces .
These pendants are miniature sculptures of vulvas .
An artist on etsy.com ( a site for buying and selling homemade goods ) is offering " vulva portrait pendants . "
You send her photos , a description , and $ 23 , and you get a hand - sculpted image of your lady - parts to wear around your neck .
( If you do n't want to send in photos , you can opt for a generic Gina . )
Um WTF ?!?!
We 're all for vulva pride , but come on ... do you really want your boyfriend 's buddies and the cable guy and your boss to know what you 're working with down there ?
Scroll down for an image of these accessories .
Warning :
This picture is not safe for work .
What do you think of these vadge necklaces ?
Would you ever wear one ?

( CNN ) -- Aerosmith announced the cancellation of the remainder of its summer tour Thursday , more than a week after the band 's lead singer tumbled off stage in South Dakota .
Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler fell off stage August 5 while dancing to " Love in an Elevator . "
" Due to injuries Steven Tyler sustained last week when he fell from the stage during a concert in Sturgis , South Dakota , doctors have advised the lead singer to take the time to properly recuperate from the accident that resulted in a broken shoulder and stitches to his head , " the band said in a statement .
The accident happened August 5 during a concert at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in western South Dakota .
Tyler was dancing during " Love in an Elevator " when he fell .
He was airlifted to a local hospital for initial treatment before returning to Boston , Massachusetts , for treatment with his own doctors .
" Words ca n't express the sadness I feel for having to cancel this tour , " said guitarist Joe Perry .
" We hope we can get the Aerosmith machine up and running again as soon as possible . "
Do n't Miss Speculation over Tyler 's health status
Speculation over Tyler 's health status People.com : Tyler airlifted to hospital
" We never anticipated this tour coming to such a swift and unfortunate ending , " guitarist Brad Whitford said .
" Our thoughts and prayers go out to Steven for a speedy recovery and return to good health . "
Tyler 's fall was the second mishap for the lead singer during their tour with ZZ Top .
Five shows were postponed in July after Tyler sprained his leg .
The band said refunds will be issued for all canceled shows .

Facebook can be a double - edged sword , a Canadian woman learned when an insurance company cut her health benefits , claiming she was healthy after seeing pictures of her smiling in bikini at the beach .
Nathalie Blanchard , 29 , took long - term sick leave from her job at IBM in Bromont , Quebec , more than a year ago for severe depression .
She was receiving monthly benefits from her insurance company , Manulife .
ADVERTISEMENT
When Blanchard called Manulife to inquire why the payments dried up , the insurance company said that “ I ’m available to work , because of Facebook , ” she told CBC television .
She said that Manulife cited several pictures Blanchard had posted on her social networking website page , including some showing her enjoying herself during a male strip - tease show at a Chippendales bar , celebrating her birthday and bathing in the sun .
Based on these postings , the firm claimed Blanchard was no longer depressed .
Manulife declined to comment on the incident but said in a statement that “ we would not deny or terminate a valid claim solely based on information published on websites such as Facebook . ”
But the company did recognize that it uses such information to learn more about their clients .
FLIGHT STATUS Latest Glider Data
As of : 12/04/09 Days at Sea 221 days Distance 7409.60 km
LATEST NEWS 7 Fun Facts
About RU27 RU27 called home over 1000 times during the mission to report her location and send / receive data .
RU27 moved her buoyancy pump approximately 22,000 times , which allowed her to �
Complete approximately 22,000 inflections , 11,000 dives and 11,000 climbs .
The raw data shows that Scarlet traveled vertically approximately 2200 kilometers ( almost 1400 miles ) .
Explanation : Glider goes more forward then up and down when it is flying .
Almost 16 MB of data was transferred via satellite during the mission .
This is likely low for a 220 - day deployment but that is due to an energy / efficiency / surface risk habit .
Scarlet compared to a car : A gallon of gas has approximately 131,940,000 J of energy ; an efficient car can travel 30 miles on that gallon so approximately 4,398,000 J / mile .
Scarlet , with currents , did 4598 miles burning 27,898,182 J having an average of about 6,067 J / mile .
End result : Scarlet can cover 725 x more distance than a car with the same energy .
She is a 21,700 - mpg car equivalent ( remember though car much bigger and goes faster ! ) .
A car could only travel 6.3 miles on the same amount of energy that Scarlet Knight used to cross the Atlantic .
Scarlet compared to the Rockefeller Christmas tree : The Christmas tree at Rockefeller plaza used to use approximately 3,510 kilowatt hours / day meaning Scarlet 's energy used would last 3 minutes .
However , in 2007 they switched to LED diodes meaning that one could now power the tree for about 8.1 minutes or send glider across the Atlantic ocean .

Lil Wayne currently tops the US singles chart with Jay Sean track Down
US rapper Lil Wayne faces a year in prison after pleading guilty to gun charges arising from a 2007 arrest .
The 27 - year - old admitted attempted criminal possession of a weapon in a plea deal and will be sentenced at New York State Supreme Court in February .
The rapper - born Dwayne Michael Carter Jr - was arrested in July 2007 when a gun was found on his tour bus after a hip - hop concert in Manhattan .
His sixth album Tha Carter III was the best - selling album in the US in 2008 .
The record won best rap album at the Grammy awards in February , where Lil Wayne picked up three other prizes .

According to a spokeswoman at the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , the rapper would have faced more serious gun possession charges had the case gone to trial .
Lil Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in Arizona after drugs and a handgun were allegedly found on his tour bus in January 2008 .
The rapper has pleaded not guilty to the charges .
Lil Wayne cut a sombre figure on Thursday as he acknowledged he had had a .40 calibre semi-automatic loaded gun on his tour bus in 2007 .
Rapper Ja Rule was arrested after the same New York concert on gun possession charges .
The rap star , known to the court as Jeff Atkins , has pleaded not guilty .
He has a court date next month .
Suicidal adolescents who were prescribed an antidepressant medication during inpatient psychiatric hospital treatment were 85 percent less likely than others to be readmitted within a month after discharge , a new study found .
The results provide additional evidence that antidepressants may play a key role in helping improve the mental health of suicidal youth , said Cynthia Fontanella , co-author of the study and assistant professor of social work at Ohio State University .
The findings are especially important now , because antidepressant use dropped in 2003 after the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning that some antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal behavior for pediatric patients .
A black - box warning is the most serious type of warning in prescription drug labeling .
" We found that antidepressant treatment had a protective effect on readmission , " Fontanella said .
" Although the findings are preliminary , our results should be reassuring to child psychiatrists who may have been concerned about prescribing antidepressants since the FDA warning . "
But another key finding from the study showed that hospitalized youth who were prescribed three or more medications from different drug classes for mental health issues had a 3 - fold increased risk of being readmitted within a month of discharge .
Fontanella conducted the study with Ohio State researchers Jeffrey Bridge , assistant professor of pediatrics , and John Campo , chief of child and adolescent psychiatry .
Both are also associated with the Research Institute at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus .

The study appears in the December issue of The Annals of Pharmacotherapy .
The researchers did a retrospective study of 318 Medicaid - covered adolescents who were admitted to three major psychiatric hospitals in Maryland because of attempted suicide or suicidal behaviors .
They examined hospital medical records for the adolescents and recorded all medication changes -- including additions , discontinuations and changed dosages that occurred during the hospital stay .
The researchers then identified which patients were readmitted to any hospital in Maryland within 30 days of their discharge .
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are considered an indicator of quality of care , Fontanella said .
Most readmissions or post - hospitalization suicide attempts occur during that time period .

Fontanella said that this is the first study to investigate the effects of hospital medication changes and use of multiple medications on readmission of suicidal youth .
" We know little about how medication is being used to treat youth in inpatient care , " she said .
" This is a first step in figuring out what is effective and what is not . "
The study found that 78 percent of the inpatients had one or more changes in their medication , typically the addition of an antidepressant , mood stabilizer or antipsychotic .
About a quarter of the adolescents were prescribed three or more medications from different drug classes .
That 's particularly concerning since those prescribed three or more drugs were 2.6 times more likely to be readmitted within 30 days , Fontanella said .
Fontanella emphasized that the study does not address the appropriateness of the medication prescriptions given to any individual patient in the study .
However , she added that psychiatrists need to be " very judicious " in prescribing multiple drugs to adolescents , given the risks .
" What we 're advocating is more quality monitoring and help for clinicians in hospitals to weigh the risks and benefits to putting adolescents on multiple medications , " she said .
She noted that the researchers took into account a variety of clinical factors that may be related to the severity of illness for the adolescents in this study .
That means youth who received multiple drug prescriptions were n't necessarily more likely to be readmitted within 30 days simply because they had more severe illnesses than did other patients .
While multiple medications presented clear dangers to adolescents in this study , the use of antidepressants was clearly helpful to most patients .
The message for psychiatrists is that they should n't dismiss the use of antidepressants for troubled youth , despite the FDA warnings , Fontanella said .
Beginning in 2003 , several antidepressants have had to carry an FDA warning that states they may increase the risk of suicide for some users .
Since that warning has appeared , the use of some antidepressants has fallen or leveled off , and the suicide rate among adolescents has risen .
" Our study suggests that many adolescents can really benefit from antidepressants , particularly those who are severely depressed , " she said .
" We have to be very careful before deciding not to use these medications . "
One of the problems that hospital psychiatrists face is that they do n't have time to adequately monitor how their medication changes are affecting their adolescent patients , according to Fontanella .
The average stay for inpatients in this study was just 8 days .
" Because the treatment stays are so short , the psychiatrists and their teams are at a disadvantage .
They are n't given the time to monitor the medications to see if they are safe and effective for the individuals , " she said .
" We need better ways to monitor patients after they leave the hospital to look for possibly adverse effects and drug interactions , and to ensure the medications are effective . "
The study was supported in part by The Center for Health Care Strategies , Inc. , under tha Annie E. Casey Foundation 's Children in Managed Care Initiative .
Additional support came from the National Institute of Mental Health .
SANTA ANA – A former accountant and trustee was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing more than $ 500,000 in trust fund money and using it to buy a doll collection , county prosecutors said today .
Margot Jean Strawn , 58 , of Laguna Hills , was ordered to pay the money back in restitution to the victims , according to the Orange County District Attorney ’s office .
Strawn , a certified public accountant , was hired by the Pellissier family to manage the trust funds of siblings Michelle and Edmund Pellissier , prosecutors said .
She stole more than $ 500,000 between May 31 , 2001 , and Jan. 19 , 2007 by writing herself checks from the accounts and depositing them into her personal bank account , prosecutors said .
She failed to file tax returns for Michelle Pellissier ’s trust fund , and continued performing accounting work even though her license expired , prosecutors said .
In March 2007 , the fraud came to the attention of the Internal Revenue Service , which notified Michelle Pellissier , prosecutors said .
She and her brother checked their accounts and discovered most of their money had been stolen .
On Monday , Strawn pleaded guilty to two felony counts of grand theft with sentencing enhancements for aggravated white collar crime over $ 500,000 and property damage over $ 150,000 and $ 50,000 , prosecutors said .
Farrah Emami , a spokeswoman for the district attorney ’s office , said investigators discovered Strawn spent the money buying dolls online .
US President Barack Obama has hit out at Wall Street “ fat cats ” , expressing anger that banks bailed out by the government plan huge bonuses while millions of Americans battle poverty and unemployment .
“ I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street , ” Obama said Friday in excerpts of an interview with CBS television to be aired on Sunday .

With unemployment still hovering at around 10 percent , amid a recession triggered in part by the excesses of financial institutions , Obama voiced frustration that “ some people on Wall Street still do n’t get it . ”
Lavish pay and bonuses on Wall Street have been blamed for encouraging the excessive risk - taking that with the subprime mortgage housing crisis fueled the global maelstrom and brought the US financial sector to the brink of collapse a year ago .
That prompted the US administration to unveil a rescue package topping 700 billion dollars , in part to shore up troubled institutions .
A so - called pay czar , appointed by the government , has since reviewed compensation at bailed - out firms and in most cases has restricted salaries to 500,000 dollars a year .
But several of the nation ’s largest banks such as Bank of America have already repaid the billions of dollars they were given by the US Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP ..

Only two major banks still hold US government capital from the program : Wells Fargo , which received 25 billion dollars , and Citigroup , with some 45 billion dollars .
Obama told CBS he believed some banks had paid back all the bailout funds in order to escape government controls regulating such things as bonuses .
“ They ’re still puzzled why it is that people are mad at the banks .
Well , let ’s see .
You guys are drawing down 10 , 20 million dollar bonuses after America went through the worst economic year … in decades and you guys caused the problem .

“ These same banks who benefited from taxpayer assistance who are fighting tooth and nail with their lobbyists … up on Capitol Hill , fighting against financial regulatory control , ” Obama added .
On Friday , the US House of Representatives approved the most sweeping regulatory overhaul of the financial sector since the Great Depression of the 1930s , one of Obama ’s key goals .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lawmakers voted 223-202 to pass the 1,300 - page legislation , a package of measures Obama ’s Democratic allies crafted in response to the global financial meltdown of 2008 .
The legislation gives regulators the power to dismantle giant financial firms and lays out a systematic way to unwind them in case of collapse that ensures shareholders and unsecured creditors , not taxpayers , bear the losses .
It also reinforces the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission to detect irregularities that could provide an early warning of fraudulent investment schemes , like the fraud perpetrated by Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff .
ADVERTISEMENT
But the legislation is now expected to move to the US Senate in 2010 , where it faces stiff opposition from the financial industry and its Republicans allies , not one of whom voted in favor of the plan .
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described the measure as a clear warning to Wall Street that “ the party is over . ”
“ American families will no longer be at the mercy of Wall Street in terms of their jobs , their homes , their pension security , the education of their children , ” Pelosi said Thursday .
It has drawn fierce opposition though from the financial sector and Republicans , who accuse the bill of stifling innovation with weighty new rules .

The number two House Republican , Representative Eric Cantor , said the legislation “ frightens people and creates uncertainty in the American economy , preventing job growth . ”
But on Saturday , Obama blasted collusion between congressional Republicans and Wall Street lobbyists who he believes have forged an alliance to block stronger government regulation of the financial sector .
“ Just last week , Republican leaders in the House summoned more than 100 key lobbyists for the financial industry to a ‘ pep rally ’ , and urged them to redouble their efforts to block meaningful financial reform , ” the president said in his weekly radio address .
However , the Treasury Department told AFP on Friday it had no plans to follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and impose a one - off 2009 tax on bankers ’ bonuses .

Asked if the United States was planning to follow moves unveiled this week by Britain and France for “ community ” taxes on bankers bonuses , Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly said in an email : “ Not at this time . ”

On Saturday night , after a week of living off of conference centre snack bars , a group of us were invited to a delicious home - cooked meal with a real live Danish family .
After spending the evening gawking at their stylish furnishings , a few of us had a question : why are Danes so good at design ?
" We 're control freaks , " our hostess replied instantly .
" It comes from being a small country with not much power .
We have to control what we can . "
When it comes to producing absurdly appealing light fixtures and shockingly comfortable desk chairs , that Danish form of displacement is clearly a very good thing .
When it comes to hosting a world - changing summit , the Danish need for control is proving to be a serious problem .
The Danes have invested a huge amount of money co-branding their capital city ( now " Hopenhagen " ) with a summit that will supposedly save the world .
That would be fine if this summit actually were on track to save the world .
But since it is n't , the Danes are frantically trying to redesign us .
Take the weekend 's protests .
By the end , around 1,100 people had been arrested .
That 's just nuts .
Saturday 's march of roughly 100,000 people came at a crucial juncture in the climate negotiations , a time when all signs pointed either to breakdown or a dangerously weak deal .
The march was festive and peaceful but also tough .
" The climate does n't negotiate " was the message , and western negotiators need to heed it .
When a handful of people starting throwing stones and setting off sound grenades ( no , they were n't " gunshots " as the Huffington Post breathlessly reported ) , the marchers handled it themselves , instructing the people responsible to leave the protest , which they promptly did .
I was in that part of march and it barely interrupted my conversation .
Calling this a " riot " , as the Daily Telegraph absurdly did , really is n't fair to serious rioters , of which there are plenty in Europe .
Never mind .
The Copenhagen cops used a little shattered glass as the pretext for detaining almost a thousand people , hundreds of whom were corralled together , forced to sit on the freezing pavement for hours , with wrists cuffed ( and some ankles too ) .
According to organiser Tadzio Müller , these were not the people who threw rocks but " the treatment was humiliating " , with some of the detainees urinating on themselves because they were not allowed to move .
The arrests , part of a pattern all week , felt like a warning : deviations from the " Hopenhagen " message would not be tolerated .
Inside the official summit , delegates apparently gathered around flat screen TVs and watched the police breaking up the march and pushing groups of protesters against walls .
For some it must have felt familiar .
After all , that 's pretty much what the Danish government and other western powers have been doing here all week : trying to break up the G77 bloc of developing countries by using classic divide and conquer tactics , including pushing especially vulnerable states up against the wall with special offers .
Having learned nothing from the " leaked Danish text " , this evening featured a meeting of 40 invited states to hash out a deal ; the rest of the ministers from the 192 states represented have no idea what they decided – hardly the democracy promised by the UN .
The real test of Danish control issues will come on Wednesday , at the Reclaim Power action .
In the morning demonstrators are going to march to the Bella Centre to demand real solutions to the climate crisis , not the fuzzy maths and carbon trading on offer inside .
The delegates on the inside who feel the same way – and there are thousands – are being invited to join the demonstrators .
If all goes well , somewhere in the vicinity of the Bella Centre will be a " people 's assembly " , a chance to highlight some of the many common sense solutions that have been shut out of the official negotiations , including keeping Alberta 's tar sands in the ground , and paying climate " reparations " .
The organisers of Reclaim Power have stated clearly that they are committed to non-violent civil disobedience .
Even if attacked by police , they will not respond with violence .
Still , the spectre of unscripted dissent upstaging the official conference on Wednesday no doubt has our Danish hosts deeply freaked out .
Let 's hope they do n't deal with their control issues by trying to hoard everyone into pens : the protesters kept far from the Bella Centre ; the delegates locked inside .
Because this action – more than anything that has happened so far – has the potential to send a clear and much - needed message to the world : only a deal that is dictated by both science and justice will do .
So memo to our Danish hosts : sure , Copenhagen is your city , and we love you for your bicycles and windmills .
But it 's everyone 's our planet .
Stop trying to design us out of the picture .

Next time you spy the Big Dipper , keep in mind that there is another star , invisible to the unaided eye , contributing to this constellation .
According to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal , one of the stars that makes the bend in the ladle 's handle , Alcor , has a smaller red dwarf companion .
Newly discovered Alcor B orbits its larger sibling and was caught in the act with an innovative technique called " common parallactic motion " by members of Project 1640 , an international collaborative team that includes astrophysicists at the American Museum of Natural History , the University of Cambridge 's Institute of Astronomy , the California Institute of Technology , and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" We used a brand new technique for determining that an object orbits a nearby star , a technique that 's a nice nod to Galileo , " says Ben R. Oppenheimer , Curator and Professor in the Department of Astrophysics at the Museum .
" Galileo showed tremendous foresight .
Four hundred years ago , he realized that if Copernicus was right -- that the Earth orbits the Sun -- they could show it by observing the " parallactic motion " of the nearest stars .
Incredibly , Galileo tried to use Alcor to see it but did n't have the necessary precision . "
If Galileo had been able to see change over time in Alcor 's position , he would have had conclusive evidence that Copernicus was right .
Parallactic motion is the way nearby stars appear to move in an annual , repeatable pattern relative to much more distant stars , simply because the observer on Earth is circling the Sun and sees these stars from different places over the year .
Alcor is a relatively young star twice the mass of the Sun .
Stars this massive are relatively rare , short - lived , and bright .
Alcor and its cousins in the Big Dipper formed from the same cloud of matter about 500 million years ago , something unusual for a constellation since most of these patterns in the sky are composed of unrelated stars .
Alcor shares a position in the Big Dipper with another star , Mizar .
In fact , both stars were used as a common test of eyesight -- being able to distinguish " the rider from the horse " -- among ancient people .
One of Galileo 's colleagues observed that Mizar itself is actually a double , the first binary star system resolved by a telescope .
Many years later , the two components Mizar A and B were themselves determined each to be tightly orbiting binaries , altogether forming a quadruple system .
Now , Alcor , which is near the four stars of the Mizar system , also has a companion .
This March , members of Project 1640 attached their coronagraph and adaptive optics to the 200 - inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California and pointed to Alcor .
" Right away I spotted a faint point of light next to the star , " says Neil Zimmerman , a graduate student at Columbia University who is doing his PhD dissertation at the Museum .
" No one had reported this object before , and it was very close to Alcor , so we realized it was probably an unknown companion star . "
The team retuned a few months later and re-imaged the star , hoping to prove that the two stars are companions by mapping the tiny movement of both in relation to very distant background stars as the Earth moves around the Sun , in other words , by mapping its parallactic motion .
If the proposed companion were just a background star , it would n't move along with Alcor .
" We did n't have to wait a whole year to get the results , " says Oppenheimer .
" We went back 103 days later and found the companion had the same motion as Alcor .
Our technique is powerful and much faster than the usual way of confirming that objects in the sky are physically related . "
The more typical method involves observing the pair of objects over much longer periods of time , even years , to show that the two are moving through space together .
Alcor and its newly found , smaller companion Alcor B are both about 80 light - years away and orbit each other every 90 years or more .
Over one year , the Alcor pair moves in an ellipse on the sky about 0.08 arc seconds in width because of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
This amount of motion , 0.08 arcsec , is about 1,000 times smaller than the eye can discern , but a fraction of this motion was easily measured by the Project 1640 scientists .
The team was also able to determine the color , brightness , and even rough composition of Alcor B because the novel method of observation that Project 1640 uses records images at many different colors simultaneously .
The team determined that Alcor B is a common type of M - dwarf star or red dwarf that is about 250 times the mass of Jupiter , or roughly a quarter of the mass of our Sun .
The companion is much smaller and cooler than Alcor A .
" Red dwarfs are not commonly reported around the brighter higher mass type of star that Alcor is , but we have a hunch that they are actually fairly common , " says Oppenheimer .
" This discovery shows that even the brightest and most familiar stars in the sky hold secrets we have yet to reveal . "
The team plans to use parallactic motion again in the future .
" We hope to use the same technique to check that other objects we find like exoplanets are truly bound to their host stars , " says Zimmerman .
" In fact , we anticipate other research groups hunting for exoplanets will also use this technique to speed up the discovery process . "
In addition to Zimmerman and Oppenheimer , authors include Anand Sivaramakrishnan , Sasha Hinkley , and Douglas Brenner of the Astrophysics Department at the Museum ; Lynne Hillenbrand , Charles Beichman , Justin Crepp , Antonin Bouchez and Richard Dekany of the California Institute of Technology ; Ian Parry , David King , and Stephanie Hunt of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University ; Rémi Soummer of the Space Telescope Institute in Baltimore ; and Gautam Vasisht , Rick Burruss , Michael Shao , Lewis Roberts , and Jennifer Roberts of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology .
Project 1640 is funded by the National Science Foundation .
Nick Griffin , the leader of the British National Party , has paid a secret visit to a First World War memorial in Belgium – only to become embroiled in an angry confrontation with a 13 - year - old schoolboy , The Independent has learnt .
On Wednesday the pupil , William Robey , was in Ypres visiting the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing as part of a school trip .
It was built to commemorate the thousands of British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the Ypres Salient in 1914 - 17 , and its walls are inscribed with the names of 54,360 men who died for the British cause – including the 40th Pathans , an Indian infantry regiment which suffered great losses .
But as " The Last Post " was about to be played , the schoolboy spotted Nick Griffin surrounded by some of his supporters .
William told The Independent : " I asked him if I could take his picture , next to the memorial for Pathan Indians .
He reluctantly agreed , but as I went to take my photo I asked him , ' Is n't this against your party 's policy ? '
One of his supporters put his hand over the lens , told me to ' get my facts straight ' , and grabbed my arm .

" I took the picture but it 's very blurry .
I said to him , ' Your party 's built on hatred . '
He started shouting at me , pointing his finger .
The rest of his lot were all laughing and smirking .
I just felt a bit sick inside to see him there to be honest .
There they were with their poppies on , trying to put this respectable front on , yet they 're happy to confront a 13 - year - old at a war memorial to try and get their point across .
" He was just saying ' I 've got lots of Sikh friends ' when my teacher stepped in and took me away . "
A BNP spokesperson said Mr Griffin often visits War Memorials when he returns to the European Parliament .
He said the BNP leader " does n't recall any jostling , . " He also " It was n't one of Nick 's security entourage who put his hand over the camera .
It was someone else who was there . "
William 's mother , Lucy , said that since the incident her son had been approached by a number of people who wanted to congratulate him for " standing up against racism " .
She added that William was " very into his politics " and " knew his stuff " , hinting that he might have a career in public life ahead of him – although his talent for asking difficult questions of politicians suggests that a career in journalism might also beckon .

( CNN ) --
A new weekday political program hosted by CNN correspondent John King will replace Lou Dobbs , who announced his departure from the network on his show Wednesday night .
The network announced the new 7 p.m. ET time slot for King on Thursday , noting that the hour of political coverage will launch as the 2010 midterm elections approach .
" I 'm thrilled to have the opportunity , at this busy and consequential time , to have a platform to discuss and explore the big issues of our time , " King , chief national correspondent and anchor of the network 's Sunday program " State of the Union , " said in a statement released Thursday .
King is expected to move into the time slot early next year .
CNN did not announce the name of King 's new program and in the statement said he would " continue to anchor ' State of the Union ' until early next year . "
Dobbs , 64 , was the last of the 29 - year - old CNN 's original anchors still with the network .
He said Wednesday that he plans to seek a more activist role in the political arena .
" Over the past six months , it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us , " Dobbs said during his Wednesday broadcast .
" And some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem - solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible . "
Dobbs said he had discussed the issue with CNN President Jonathan Klein , who had agreed to a release from his contract " that will enable me to pursue new opportunities . "
His no-holds - barred , sometimes acerbic style brought him a loyal following , but also attracted controversy both to him and to the network , especially over the subject of illegal immigration .
In a written statement , Klein said King 's program " will reflect what CNN is all about : straight facts from our anchors and the widest range of opinions from across the political spectrum . "
" John has enthralled CNN viewers with his vast political knowledge , and he has spent the past year reporting from beyond the Beltway on pressing policy issues and the real people they impact , " Klein said .
" Every night , he 'll share his passion and his insights about what is really going on in Washington and across America . "

A Spanish region 's new approach to sex education has provoked anger by suggesting children be taught " self - exploration and self - pleasure " .
The government of Extremadura launched a campaign based around the slogan " pleasure is in your own hands " , which gives advice on masturbation .
The scheme has angered Spain 's Roman Catholics and conservative media .
But youth workers have also been angered by the row , saying their plans were taken out of context .
' Self esteem '
The education campaign included producing leaflets , a " fanzine " and conducting workshops with children aged between 14 and 17 .
" Extremadura should be pleased with itself , " Pilar Rahola , a columnist in the Barcelona - based La Vanguardia newspaper , wrote .
" It may have the most unemployed young people in Spain but they will be the best at masturbation . "
But Laura Garrido , president of Extremadura 's youth council , said the lessons would be valuable to adolescents , and were part of a much broader education than the mechanics of masturbating .
" The lessons are based on the concepts of self esteem , confidence and male and female anatomy and physiology , " she said .
Local media reported her as saying that press coverage of the lessons had been " manipulated and twisted " .
In order to get a charcoal production method that avoids emissions of methane during pyrolysis
is simple to build , even with small means
produces charcoal from the garden waste that is not easily added to the soil
makes a bit of atmospheric carbon reduction
supports the local ecosystem -- this simple backyard / allotment / home garden sized system can be used .
The unit consists of two steel barrels .
Only .
The smaller with no alterations a all .
It is filled with dry biomass and put upside down in the larger one .
In the larger one , holes are cut on the side , some centimetres ( an inch ) above the bottom , large enough to let in an ample amount of air .
The larger barrel shold reach at least ten centimeters ( 4 inch ) above the smaller vessel , to get a good " chimney " - effect , i.e. a strong draught from the air inlets , and a hot fire throughout the process .
Fill the smaller vessel with dry biomass .
The dryer it is , the easier it is to reach carbonisation temperaure .
( To get the best char for soil amendment , this tmperature should be 350 - 450 C. )
Put the smaller vessel upside down in the larger .
( Since there is no lid on it , you will need to put it on the ground , turn over the larger vessel upside down , and then turn everything back again . ) .
When the biomass starts pyrolysing , the gases will emit through the chink between the vessels .
Fill the space between the vessels with dry firewood and light it .
Since there is a good draught , it will start firing briskly , thus heating the biomass in the inner vessel .
Add more firewood even during the next phase to be sure of complete charring .
After about half an hour , the biomass starts emitting pyolysis gasses .
They will catch fire when they enter the burning firewood and the air on the outside , and further increase the heat of the biomass .
It is important that the pyrolysis gasses really catch fire , otherwise methane ( a 20 times worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ) will be emitted .
When the pyrolysis is over , i.e. the biomass has turned into charcoal , the fire will go out and the char will start cooling .
Wait for an hour , and then you have the char ready to be buried in the soil , in the compost , or used to adsorb urine .
In all the coverage of the AT&T Performing Arts Center 's opening this week ( and , remember , there 's a free open house Sunday ) , I 'd yet to see anything showing just how the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre interior morphs from intimate to epic , its key selling point .
Then I stumbled across this page from Theatre Projects Consultants , the Connecticut - based firm charged with actually designing the " versatile , multiform space that can be configured for up to 575 seats in proscenium , thrust , traverse , and flat floor arrangements . "
So happens , Theatre Projects hired Stewart Mayer to shoot some footage of the crew giving the theater a test - run two weeks ago .
Mayer , the local cinematographer behind Kickass Camera , put together a remarkable time - lapse video ; he and Theatre Projects were kind enough to let us offer it on Unfair Park .
( Update : the high def version is included below Though this is a temp file -- a high - def version is coming tonight .
So , for now , enjoy this one , featuring our Friday - morning musical selection circa 1927 , the Dallas String Band 's " Dallas Rag . " )
Mayer tells Unfair Park about the shoot : " It was fantastic .
The whole building is a giant Transformer .
It 's bad - ass .
It is absolutely amazing .
It was really cool to see . "
See for yourself .

After the fall of the Taliban everyone wanted to come and work for women ’s rights , they were proud to say they were here to help Afghan women .
Slowly , slowly this disappeared .
Maybe the international community saw that we had two or three women in the cabinet , and thought , it ’s ok , now they have their rights .
But we have lost everything , from those cabinet positions to the donor attention .
Women are not a priority for our own government or the international community .
We ’ve been forgotten .
— Shinkai Karokhail , member of parliament , Kabul , June 4 , 2009
The international Human Rights Watch has published a devastating 96 - page report on the situation for women in Afghanistan .
" We Have the Promises of the World " : Women ’s Rights in Afghanistan explores the reality of everyday life for Afghan women , somewhat improved since the Taliban was forced out of the government , but still rife with intimidation , forced marriage of young girls , rape , including gang rape , and murder , including assassination of high - level women activists .
Police and courts and other government machinery is still quite hostile to women , and not just in back - country areas or those where the Taliban has made a resurgence .
None of this should be a surprise in a country where vast numbers of women show up to vote clad in the burka , the attire many outsiders equate solely with Taliban rule , and where desperate women and girls are still routinely imprisoned for " running away from home . "
Rachel Reid , of Human Rights Watch , said the situation " could deteriorate " .
She added : " While the world focuses on the Obama administration ’s new security strategy , it ’s critical to make sure that women ’s and girls ’ rights do n’t just get lip service while being pushed to the bottom of the list by the government and donors . "
The horrendous situation for Afghan women , which conventional wisdom had placed in a positive light since the Taliban 's brutally misogynistic rule was overturned in 2001 , began coming to light again earlier this year when the Afghan parliament approved a law that amounted to sanctioning marital rape in the country 's Shia communities .
The furor over the Shia law highlighted the fragility of the gains made by Afghan women , human rights activists , and reform - minded politicians .
The dominant political factions of Afghanistan remain ideologically hostile to many of the rights that many women have started to enjoy since the fall of the Taliban , such as freedom of movement , freedom to work , and the right to education .
Many of the women interviewed for this report observed that the space for them to work as activists for change has diminished over the past few years , as the government has come to increasingly rely on conservative factions to maintain political control .
In the wake of the Shia law controversy , with the world looking closely again at the status of women in Afghanistan , many inside and outside the country are becoming aware again of just how few and fragile the gains have been and how steep the challenges remain .
Whereas the trend had clearly been positive for women ’s rights from 2001 - 2005 , the trend is now negative in many areas .
The Human Rights Watch report focuses on five areas : attacks on women in public life ; other violence against women ; child and forced marriage ; access to justice ; and girls ’ access to secondary education .
None of these makes for pleasant reading .
Here 's an excerpt from the section titled " Guilty on Arrival : Women ’s Access to Justice " :
A lawyer from Mazar -e - Sharif told Human Rights
Watch that women are particularly vulnerable to abuse when they have been accused of zina :
We have two main problems when a girl is arrested for adultery or zina .
When in police detention , police sexually harass them .
When the girl or women tries to stop this , they try to rape them .
If this does n’t happen , they prepare a statement for the girl , admitting zina , without the agreement of the suspect ,
and send a false statement to the prosecution without reading the statement to the girl .
A lawyer working in the Kabul region gave another example :
We worked with a girl who had run away from home .
She had terrible problems with her family , and she went to police .
The police immediately accused her of having committed zina .
She said she had n’t , but they insisted on performing an examination .
Three of them put her on the table and made her take off her clothes , and touched her , calling it a medical examination , and claiming to be doctors .
She was terrified .
What could she do ?
Nothing ever happened to these men .
Forced gynecological examinations are themselves a form of degrading sexual abuse , with particularly far reaching implications in a society with such deep taboos about women ’s chastity and sexuality .
Why this abuse by the police is so widespread comes into sharp focus when the numbers are taken into account .
Although there are 78,000 police on the payroll throughout Afghanistan , the United Nations puts the actual figure of serving policemen at 57,000 .
Of these , 550 are women .
Recruiting more is extremely difficult since anyone who signs up is considered a " bad woman , " with nothing left to lose .
What I love about The Venture Bros. are the pop culture references that spring up unexpectedly in each episode .
From comic books , music and film to viral videos and video games ; these often obscure references are what make this animated series a gem !
In the latest episode entitled ‘ The Better man , ’ a hell beast is unleashed upon The Triad and they are soon aided by a shadowy character on a flying hoarse .
The giant beast that The Triad battle is none other than Cthulhu , a cosmic entity created by author H.P. Lovecraft for pulp comics , Weird Tales .
The cloaked figure that came to the Triad ’s aid is The Outrider , a character that parodies Soloman Kane , created by writer Robert E. Howard , who is also noted for creating Conan The Barbarian .
Solomon Kane is a somber - looking man who wanders the world with no apparent goal other than to vanquish evil in all its forms .
His adventures , published mostly in the pulp magazine Weird Tales , often take him from Europe to the jungles of Africa and back .
Howard described him as a somber and gloomy man of pale face and cold eyes , all of it shadowed by a slouch hat .
He is dressed entirely in black and his weaponry consists of a rapier , a dagger , and a couple of flintlock pistols .
During one of his latter adventures his friend N’Longa , an African shaman , gave him a juju staff that served as a protection against evil , but could easily be wielded as an effective weapon .
It is revealed in another story , “ The Footfalls Within , ” that this is the mythical Staff of Solomon , a talisman older than the Earth and unimaginably powerful , much more so than even N’Longa knew .
In the same adventure with N’Longa , Kane is seen using a musket as well .
Cthulhu first appeared in the short story “ The Call of Cthulhu ” when it was published in Weird Tales in 1928 .
Cthulhu is one of the central Great Old Ones of the Lovecraft Mythos .
It is often cited for the extreme descriptions given of its hideous appearance , its gargantuan size , and the abject terror that it evokes .
Cthulhu is often referred to in science fiction and fantasy circles as a tongue - in - cheek shorthand for extreme horror or evil .
After its first appearance in “ The Call of Cthulhu , ” Cthulhu makes a few minor appearances in other Lovecraft stories .
August Derleth , a correspondent of Lovecraft ’s , used the creature ’s name to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors , the Cthulhu Mythos .
The title makes it sound like a bad 1980s BBC sitcom , but the this action comedy blockbuster , due out in summer 2010 , is probably Cruise and Diaz 's best chance to regain box - office cred
Take a look at any " most anticipated movies of 2010 " list online and you 'll see a familiar collection of sequels and remakes and adaptations .
But there 's one big summer movie that the list - makers seem to have ignored so far – the Tom Cruise / Cameron Diaz action comedy Knight & Day .
This would n't have happened a few years ago .
Earlier in the decade , the hype surrounding a high - kicking blockbuster starring Minority Report 's Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz from Charlie 's Angels would have been building since the moment it started filming .
As it is , the past three days have seen a poster and a teaser trailer launched to almost no fanfare whatsoever .
You do n't need to be a genius to see why Tom Cruise 's stock has fallen in recent years – Scientology , couch - jumping and films about one - eyed Nazis trying to blow up Hitler with bits of luggage have all helped to transform him from the biggest star in the world to a whooping , air - punching joke .
But Cameron Diaz has n't fared so well either .
There 's been an unsettling over - reliance on Shrek and its interminable spin - offs ( including next year 's Shrek Forever After , Shrek makes up about a third of her IMDb projects since 2001 ) peppered with gloopily sentimental Oscar - bait such as My Sister 's Keeper , generic comedies that she should have grown out of long ago ( see What Happens in Vegas ) and gormless thrillers like The Box .
She needs a hit just as badly as Cruise does .
So both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have a lot at stake here .
And although the signs are n't all positive – Knight & Day sounds like the title of a bad 1980s BBC sitcom , the teaser poster makes it look like Diaz has a penis , and the first - choice stars were apparently Chris Rock and Eva Mendez – it probably constitutes the nearest thing to a safe bet for them .
It 's a no-brainer for Tom Cruise .
His extended cameo in Tropic
Thunder proved that people do n't find him quite as unbearable when he 's being lighthearted – presumably because he 's easier to warm to when his boggle - eyed raving is intentional and not part of a leaked Scientology video about world domination .
Plus , the trailer suggests that he gets to save the world at the end , which quite clearly caters to his Napoleon complex .
And it could potentially play to Cameron Diaz 's strengths as well – it allows her the freedom to be at her funny and unselfconscious best , without the downside of having to star opposite Ashton Kutcher .
However , let 's not underestimate Tom Cruise 's capacity to balls things up yet .
Right now Knight &
Day looks like an inessential but fun crowd - pleaser that , if nothing else , could help to resolidify the box - office credentials of its leads .
But that 's only so long as Tom Cruise decides not to attend the premiere in a burning tank , or spend five hours shouting , " No , YOU'RE the man ! " at every single person who enters his eyeline , or fake - laugh his way through a billion eerie television interviews prior to its release .
It 's all his to lose , basically .
The other day , in an apparently idiosyncratic press statement , Ferrari poured doubts on the viability of the Manor , Lotus , USF1 and Campos Meta Formula 1 teams .
The Italian team said that just because the same number of teams were sitting around the table did not mean that they had the same quality .
In some respects that is a fair point but it hardly seems like something that the team that leads FOTA should be saying .
Surely , it is in FOTA ’s interest to talk up the new teams rather than talking them down ?
“ We must also wait and see just how many of them will really be there on the grid for the first race of next season in Bahrain and how many will still be there at the end of 2010 , ” Ferrari said .
Hmmm …
And then today Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo is again talking about teams running three cars .
What is that all about when there are , in theory at least , 26 cars on the grid next year ?
The answer is obvious if you ever study Machiavelli .
And it explains exactly what is going on at a political level in Formula 1 .
In the same statement Ferrari hinted that the reason that manufacturers are withdrawing from F1 is because of Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley .
Ferrari did not name names but the implication was thicker than icing on a wedding cake .
The team seems to believe that Mosley and Ecclestone drove the manufacturers out of the sport in an effort to break the power of FOTA .
With a group of strong manufacturer - led teams working together , FOTA was strong .
With a bunch of weak new teams , FOTA is not .
All it takes is one of the new teams borrowing some money from Ecclestone and he will have power to influence FOTA .
In the old days that was a role that was consistently filled by Flavio Briatore but the Italian started believing in the power of FOTA and saw an opportunity to take over from Ecclestone .
The end result of this was that he fell from a very great height because he got caught doing something wrong and suddenly found that he had no friends at all .
It was a long drop and a painful thud at the bottom .
The chances are that some of the new teams ( and perhaps even some of the older ones as well ) will end up being beholden to Mr E and that , therefore , is the danger for FOTA .
So , strange that it may seem , it is actually better for Ferrari and others to try to talk down the new teams so that they fail and thus do not get a voice in FOTA business .
If the numbers of cars falls too far , then three - car teams is the answer …
Are you following me ?
FOTA had no say in which new teams were picked for 2010 .
However there are ways of dealing with the weak and feeble that the Spartans employed centuries ago : there was no coddling , if a child was weak it was left out at night on a hillside .
Only the strong survived .
Children were treated harshly to toughen them : they were beaten , made to march without shoes and forced to go without food .
To survive they had to be tough .
Clearly this is Ferrari ’s belief .
Watch out too for the teams moving closer to the FIA .
The federation has a new boss and he has campaigned saying that he will make the sport better and stronger .
This means that ultimately he will try to get more money flowing into the sport and less going out .
CVC Capital Partners is taking 50 % of F1 ’s income and is giving it to banks .
They are in it for the money and they have taken plenty already .
They want more .
The problem they face is that at the end of the new Concorde Agreement in 2012 the teams are pretty keen to cut back CVC ’s take from 50 % to around 15 % , which is a much more sensible figure .
The only way that CVC can hope to keep its current slice of the pie is if the teams are divided and conquered and so it is fair to suggest that the primary goal of CVC and its lieutenants in the next few years will be to break the power of the teams .
The teams know this and they understand the dangers .
In the circumstances they need to accept the losses that happen ; they need to avoid getting allied with weaklings and they need to find strong new friends .
Looking into the crystal ball , I see the teams and the FIA working together to win the sport back from the financiers …
Convoluted ?
No , just business .
China has issued new Internet regulations , including what appears to be an effort to create a " whitelist " of approved websites that could potentially place much of the Internet off - limits to Chinese readers .
BEIJING - China has issued new Internet regulations , including what appears to be an effort to create a " whitelist " of approved websites that could potentially place much of the Internet off - limits to Chinese readers .
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ordered domain management institutions and internet service providers to tighten control over domain name registration , in a three - phase plan laid out on its website ( www.miit.gov.cn) late on Sunday .
" Domain names that have not registered will not be resolved or transferred , " MIIT said , in an action plan to " further deepen " an ongoing anti-pornography campaign that has resulted in significant tightening of Chinese Internet controls .
Only allowing Chinese viewers to access sites registered on a whitelist would give Chinese authorities much greater control , but would also block millions of completely innocuous sites .
The rules did not specify whether the new measure applies to overseas websites , but local media reported the risk that foreign sites that have not registered could also be blocked .
" If some legal foreign websites could not be accessed because they have n't registered with MIIT , it would be a pity for the Internet which is meant to connect the whole world , " the Beijing News said on Tuesday .
Chinese Internet controls currently follow a blacklist strategy , whereby censors block sensitive sites as soon as they discover them .
Earlier this summer , MIIT tried to require that all new Chinese computers be shipped with the Green Dam filter software , but partially backed off after an international outcry .
TWITTERERS ' REVENGE
The anti-pornography drive since this summer has also netted many sites with politically sensitive or even simply user - generated content , in what many see as an effort by the Chinese government to reassert control over new media and its potential for citizens sharing information and organizing .
" One interpretation is that all foreign websites would need to register in order not to be blocked in China , " said Rebecca MacKinnon of the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong .
" These are the folks who brought us Green Dam so anything is possible .
They are people with a track record of emitting unreasonable schemes . "
The registration requirements could constitute a barrier to trade , if Chinese citizens are prevented from accessing legitimate overseas businesses , added MacKinnon .
China banned a number of popular websites and Internet services in 2009 , including Google 's Youtube , Twitter , Flickr and Facebook , as well as Chinese content sharing sites , including sites popular for music and film downloads .
Angry Chinese Twitter users flooded a Twitter look - alike service ( t.people.com.cn ) launched by the official People 's Daily on Tuesday , causing it to be immediately shut down .
Many virtual private network , or VPN , services used to get around Web restrictions have also become harder to use from China , while 20 million people living in the frontier region of Xinjiang have been cut off from the Internet and international telephone services since deadly ethnic riots in July .
" What usually happens when suddenly compiled rules appear without warning is that they are rarely enforced .
My gut reaction is that this is yet another of those cases , " said Beijing - based technology commentator Kaiser Kuo .
Rentable Christmas trees , which have been tried in Oregon and a smattering of other places over the years , are a perfect match for Los Angeles , he said , where Christmas trees have “ an image issue , ” and escaping a drive through traffic with a tree strapped to a car roof is especially welcome .
“ You can try anything here , and no one will tell you it ’s a bad idea , ” said Mr. Martin , who is 30 and grew up in the South Bay here , where as a teenager he delivered trees for a nursery .
“ California is more attached to the green movement , so they are more willing to try this service here . ”
To rent a tree , a customer visits Mr. Martin ’s Web site , livingchristmas.com , picks out a tree from among several varieties and then awaits delivery .
Delivery days are determined by geography , to save time and gas .
Prices range from $ 50 , for a two - to - three - foot number , up to $ 185 for something bigger .
While two weeks is the recommended length of stay for a live tree in a house , Mr. Martin lets his customers keep them for three .
The tree is then picked up to join its evergreen cousins ; they will summer together on industrial properties where Mr. Martin rents space for pennies on the dollar to house his inventory .
People who want the same tree next year ask for it to be tagged with their name , so it might return next December , taller .

Listen to Rep. Ron Paul on the Iran sanctions bill ( MP3 ) .
Last week the House overwhelmingly approved a measure to put a new round of sanctions on Iran .
If this measure passes the Senate , the United States could no longer do business with anyone who sold refined petroleum products to Iran or helped them develop their ability to refine their own petroleum .
The sad thing is that many of my colleagues voted for this measure because they felt it would deflect a military engagement with Iran .
I would put the question to them , how would Congress react if another government threatened our critical trading partners in this way ?
Would we not view it as asking for war ?
This policy is pure isolationism .
It is designed to foment war by cutting off trade and diplomacy .
Too many forget that the quagmire in Iraq began with an embargo .
Sanctions are not diplomacy .
They are a precursor to war and an embarrassment to a country that pays lip service to free trade .
It is ironic that people who decry isolationism support actions like this .
If a foreign government attempted to isolate the U.S. economically , cut off our supply of gasoline , or starve us to death , would it cause Americans to admire that foreign entity ?
Or would we instead unite under the flag for the survival of our country ?
We would not tolerate foreign covert operations fomenting regime change in our government .
Yet our CIA has been meddling in Iran for decades .
Of course Iranians resent this .
In fact , many in Iran still resent the CIA ’s involvement in overthrowing their democratically elected leader in 1953 .
The answer is not to cut off gasoline to the Iranian people .
The answer is to stay out of their affairs and trade with them honestly .
If our operatives were no longer in Iran , they would no longer be available as scapegoats for the regime to , rightly or wrongly , blame for every bad thing that happens .
As bad as other regimes may be , it is up to their own people to deal with them so they can achieve true self - determination .
When foreigners instigate regime change , the new government they institute is always perceived as serving the interest of the overthrowing country , not the people .
Thus we take the blame for bad governance twice .
Instead , we should stay out of their affairs altogether .
With the exception of the military - industrial complex , we all want a more peaceful world .
Many are hysterical about the imminent threat of a nuclear Iran .
Here are the facts : Iran has never been found out of compliance with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) they signed .
However , being surrounded by nuclear powers one can understand why they might want to become nuclear capable if only to defend themselves and to be treated more respectfully .
After all , we do n’t sanction nuclear - capable countries .
We take diplomatic negotiations a lot more seriously , and we frequently send money to them instead .
The non-nuclear countries are the ones we bomb .
If Iran was attempting to violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty , they could hardly be blamed , since U.S. foreign policy gives them every incentive to do so .
Mérida , December 18th 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – The South African Communist Party SACP gave its highest award , the Chris Hani Peace Prize , to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez this week in recognition of Chavez ’s leadership in the worldwide struggle against imperialism and for socialism .
Chavez was chosen to receive the award because he is “ a principal fighter in the anti-imperialist struggle , the Bolivarian Revolution , and for his commitment to the struggle for the peace , solidarity , and socialism of the working class , ” said SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande .
Nzimande presented the award to Venezuelan Ambassador to South Africa Antonio Montilla during a SACP conference in Polokwane , South Africa .
Upon accepting the prize before a crowd of party members and other leaders and activists from the African National Congress ( ANC ) , Montilla said Chavez “ would accept with humility and much gratitude the recognition of a party that forms part of the governing tripartite alliance of South Africa , ” and that the award “ would undoubtedly be received as a challenge and a motivation . ”
The award is named after former SACP General Secretary Martin Thembisile , who was known as Chris Hani and was assassinated in 1993 .
Current South African President Jacob Zuma of the governing ANC party attended the conference and congratulated Chavez for the award .
The Chavez government has strengthened diplomatic relations with South Africa and many other African countries in recent years .
In September , Venezuela hosted the Africa - South America Summit , during which countries from the two continents increased economic cooperation and created the Radio of the South , which has the mission of unifying revolutionary and anti-imperialist struggles among Global South countries .
Pakistan ’s Foreign Ministry rejected with anger as information about President Barack Obama ’s plan to escalate drone strikes against Pakistani territory , a somewhat - secret addendum to his Afghanistan escalation , continued to emerge today and a top Congressmen confirmed the move was “ under discussion . ”
The foreign ministry cautioned that the attacks would only serve to inflame anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and that the government ’s cooperation with the US had limits .
Representative Adam Smith , the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on terrorism , said that secret talks had been ongoing about the currently “ limited ” operations against Pakistani territory .
He would confirm no details .
But other sources say that the talks have centered around expanding the attacks further south into Pakistani territory , as well as into the Balochistan Province .
The US has repeatedly threatened to attack Balochistan , despite Pakistani objections .
The US has claimed the Taliban leadership was secretly hiding in the Baloch capital of Quetta , and has threatened to go so far as to send ground troops into the major city .
The Pakistani military has vowed to stop the US from striking Balochistan , but has quietly supported US attacks against North and South Waziristan .

A double impact basin may be the site of some of the most recent volcanism Mercury is even more of an " iron planet " than scientists had previously supposed .
Richer concentrations of iron and titanium have been seen on Mercury 's surface by Nasa 's Messenger probe .
Previous Earth and spacecraft - based observations had detected only very low amounts of iron in the silicate minerals covering the innermost world .
Because of its immense density , scientists have already assumed much of Mercury 's interior contains iron .
Messenger sees the surface iron bound up in oxides with titanium .
The mission 's principal investigator , Sean Solomon , said the new observations would keep theoreticians busy .
PLANET MERCURY
Closest planet to the Sun ; smallest in Solar System Visited by Mariner 10 in 1970s ; by Messenger currently Diameter : 4,880 km , about one - third the size of Earth Second densest planet in Solar System ; 5.3 x that of water Caloris basin is largest known feature ( 1,300 km in diameter )
Possibility of water - ice in permanently shadowed craters
Huge iron core takes up more than 60 % of the planet 's mass Surface temperatures swing between 425C and - 180C
Has an extremely thin atmosphere ( exosphere )
Only inner planet besides Earth with global magnetic field
Q&A : Mercury space probe " The iron is in a form that we do n't normally encounter in other planetary situations and so it 's going be a volley back to our geochemists and petrologists to come up with a scenario that 's consistent with everything we are measuring now at Mercury , " he told reporters .
Theories on how the planet formed would also have to take the information into account , he added .
Some of these propose that Mercury is predominantly the remnant core of a body which lost its outer layers in a mighty collision early in its history .
The new data was returned on Messenger 's third and final flyby of the planet in September .
The pass , just 228 km from the surface , was intended as a brake manoeuvre , using the planet 's gravity to help slow the spacecraft enough to enable it to enter into orbit in 2011 .
The spacecraft acquired only about half the data it was expected to because of a power " hiccup " just before closest approach .
Nonetheless , Messenger 's cameras and instruments collected many high - resolution and colour images , unveiling another 6 % of the planet 's surface never before seen up - close .
Messenger has now viewed about 98 % of the surface at various resolutions .
New features observed in the pass include a region with a bright area surrounding an irregular depression , suspected to be volcanic in origin .
Messenger is on course to enter into orbit in March 2011
It also spied a very young double - ring impact basin approximately 290 - km across .
" However , to a planetary geologist , ' young ' is a billion years or so .
But compared to most of the basins on Mercury , those are three billion years older that .
So in a relative sense it is very geologically young , " explained Brett Denevi , a member of the probe 's imaging team from Arizona State University in Tempe .
The low numbers of superposed impact craters and marked differences in colour across the basin suggest that the smooth area within the innermost ring may be the site of some of the most recent volcanism on Mercury , she added .
Messenger also made new measurements of Mercury 's " atmosphere " , the extremely tenuous cloud of atoms which is lifted off the surface by solar activity and micro-meteorite impacts .

President Obama takes aim at " fat cat bankers " and their aggressive
lobbying efforts to defeat financial reform in an upcoming 60 Minutes
interview set to air Sunday evening .
" I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street , " Obama tells 60 Minutes '
Steve Kroft .
" What 's really frustrating me right now is that you 've got
these same banks who benefited from taxpayer assistance who are
fighting tooth and nail with their lobbyists ... up on Capitol Hill ,
fighting against financial regulatory control . "
Efforts by the banking industry to avoid reform may have paid off ( financial - services interests spent $ 344 million on lobbying in the first three quarters of 2009 ) .
While the version of the major financial reform bill passed by the House on Friday
does create a consumer financial protection agency and limits on
derivatives trading , some say that it also includes loopholes .
The bill
does not include measures that would break up big banks or address the
mixing of commercial and investment banking by giant firms like
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs .
President Obama cheered the House action Friday .
" This legislation
brings us another important step closer to necessary , comprehensive
financial reform that will create clear rules of the road , consistent
and systematic enforcement of those rules , and a stronger , more stable
financial system ... " he said in a statement .
On the topic of executive pay , Kroft asks Obama if he thinks that
bailed out banks repayed TARP money just to avoid government oversight
on compensation and pay .
" I think that in some cases , [ to be able to
pay bonuses ] was the motivation , " Obama responds .
" Which I think tells
me that the people on Wall Street still do n't get it ... They 're still
puzzled why it is that people are mad at the banks .
Well , let 's see .
You guys are drawing down 10 , 20 million dollar bonuses after America
went through the worst economic year ... in decades and you guys caused
the problem , "
Kroft also questions Obama about the nation 's new strategy in
Afghanistan .
The president weighs in on the timetable of a withdrawal
and acknowledges that the U.S. needs more help from Pakistan .
The full interview is set to air Sunday , Dec. 13 , at 7 p.m. ET / PT on CBS .
A 59 - year - old Brazilian man has surprised his family by turning up at his own funeral , local media report .
Relatives of Ademir Jorge Goncalves , a bricklayer , had identified him as the victim of a car crash in southern Parana state the previous day .
Police told O Globo newspaper that relatives had trouble identifying the corpse because it was badly disfigured .
It emerged that Mr Goncalves had spent the night drinking a rum - like liquor called " pinga " with his friends .
He did not get word of his funeral until it was already happening on Monday morning , his niece Rosa Sampaio said .
She said some family members - including herself and the man 's mother - had doubts , but an aunt and four friends had positively identified the body .
" What were we to do ?
We went ahead with the funeral , " she told O Globo .
A police spokesman welcomed the happy ending : " Before long , the walking dead appeared at the funeral .
It was a relief , " the unnamed officer told the paper .
The body was correctly identified later , he said , and buried in another state .
Oklahoma ’s Tom Coburn is an old - school conservative , and an old - school Senator .
How traditional can Dr. Coburn get ?
Politico reports that Coburn wants to read Harry Reid ’s ObamaCare bill before he casts a vote on it — and to make sure he has the time to do it , Coburn plans to force the bill to be read in its entirety on the Senate floor :
Sen .
Tom Coburn , the Oklahoma Republican who developed a close friendship with President Obama when they served together in the Senate , is threatening to have the entire health care bill read on the Senate floor .
Senior Senate Democratic aides had heard Coburn was considering having potentially thousands of pages read aloud in effort to stall passage .
“ If he did this it would be even outrageous for a guy who ’s become known as Dr. No around here , ” one of them told POLITICO .
Coburn ’s office confirmed that he is indeed thinking about having the bill read .
This could create even more problems for Harry Reid in getting the bill out the door .
Unlike in the House , Reid has n’t been able to do a jam - down on his version of ObamaCare .
While a few Democrats still hold out hope for action on the bill by Christmas , some are now setting a target of the State of the Union address at the end of January as more realistic .
If Coburn and other Republicans force floor readings of the bill , that may drift into March or April .
If Coburn insists on a floor reading every time the bill gets amended , it may be summertime before they can get around to it .
The Senate has other business to conduct , which would interrupt floor readings that would take at least several straight days of floor time to complete for a bill that will run into the thousands of pages .
And all it takes is one Senator to withhold the unanimous consent necessary to dispense with floor readings .
In effect , it would allow Coburn to have the bill filibuster itself .
Publicity stunt ?
Sure .
But Coburn ’s action would give people plenty of time to find the ridiculous aspects of a bill that would quasi-nationalize 1/6th of the American economy — its reach , its taxes , its mandates , and its intrusion onto the personal choices and freedoms of Americans .
The more people have seen these bills , the less they have liked them .
That ’s why Pelosi ’s trying to jam down her bill this weekend , and why Reid ca n’t afford to let anyone read his bill , let alone the Senate clerk doing it aloud .
When eaten in moderation , bacon could be considered a superfood .
Almost half the fat content is monounsaturated , which is known to lower cholesterol levels .
And its monounsaturated content comes from oleic acid , the same " good " fat found in olive oil .
Cheddar cheese
It may not be great for your waistline or your heart - your recommended daily intake of saturates is contained in just three sandwich - size slices .
However , it is good for your teeth , and not just because it 's high in calcium .
A cube of cheddar after a meal will neutralise the acids in your mouth , thus helping to prevent tooth decay .
Ice cream A scoop of ice cream can give your mood a noticeable lift .
A study by the Institute of Psychiatry in London has found out why - because eating ice cream can light up the brain 's pleasure zones .
Just once lick is enough to stimulate the orbitofrontal cortex , the main processing area and the part of the brain associated with the pleasures of sex and eating .
Potatoes
When kept away from the fryer , the humble spud packs a nutritional punch .
American scientists have identified 60 different types of phytochemicals and vitamins in potato skins - many of which help lower cholesterol and protect against heart disease - while researchers at the Institute for Food Research have found they contain blood - pressure lowering molecules called kukoamines .
Coffee Gym bunnies , take note : sinking an espresso boosts the fat - burning potential of cardiovascular exercise .
Caffeine dilates blood vessels , thus increasing the flow of blood and oxygen to muscles .
A post - workout americano can reduce aches , too .
Coffee also stimulates the release of cholecystokinin , a hormone which inhibits cholesterol build - up in the gallbladder .
And , of course , chocolate
With its ability to boost " feel - good " endorphin levels , chocolate has long been used as a mood - lifter .
But it can also improve the brain 's ability to do mental arithmetic .
A team of volunteers found that mathematical equations became easier after they ate dark chocolate , which is rich in flavonoids which improve the function of blood vessels and promote oxygen flow to the brain .
If you needed another excuse to eat it , chocolate might also help you lose weight .
Last week , a new brand of chocolate was launched which claims to trick your brain into believing you are n't hungry .
Called Lola , the sweets are cholesterol - free , and are said to help digestion by boosting a healthy level of intestinal bacteria .
Its Spanish inventors recommend that you eat one or two chocolates before a meal , to help you feel full .
The only drawback - apart from the price ( pounds 5 for a box of five ) and the fact that it 's only available in Spain - is the slight green tinge , which comes from its special ingredient spirulina , a nutrient - rich algae .
And red wine Prepare to raise your glass to some cheering news .
Last week , a study found that moderate alcohol consumption can protect against heart disease .
The report showed that drinking up to 30 grams of alcohol a day , the equivalent of one large glass of red wine , reduced the risk of heart disease by half .
The effect was not seen for all forms of alcohol .
Increasing consumption does not improve the protective effect , and raises the risk of cancer , accidents , mental health problems and liver cirrhosis .
Drinking up to two glasses of red wine a day has also long been thought to improve your brain power .
Dr Clinton Wright , professor of neurology at Columbia University , New York , found that moderate drinkers score higher in mental acuity tests than those who never touch alcohol .
It is known that resveratrol , a compound found in grape skins , promotes healthy blood flow to the brain .
Studies suggest that it also boosts your immune system .
While too much alcohol is linked to high blood pressure , liver problems and infertility , resveratrol has been variously linked to fighting cancer , obesity , diabetes , and even the signs of old age .
Results from a new laboratory study , published earlier this month , suggest it may also slow the formation of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer 's disease .
Bad for you , actually Tofu Tofu ( bean curd ) is assumed to be the healthiest of foods , as it is low in calories , relatively high in protein and iron and has no saturated fat or cholesterol .
However , like other soya products , research suggests it may be harmful to male fertility .
Orange juice
It is packed with vitamins and count towards your five - a- day .
But the high sucrose content of orange juice attacks the enamel on your teeth and can increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes .
Wholemeal bread Fibre - packed wholemeal bread could also be laden with sugar .
Professor Peter Whorwell , an expert on irritable bowel syndrome , says that fibre - rich foods should also be reconsidered as key elements of healthy diets .
" Adding a bulking agent in the form of fibre gives the bowel more work to do , so if you 're constipated it is likely to worsen symptoms .
" Smoothies
The fruity goodness may be outweighed by the number of calories as smoothies are loaded with natural sugar .
Yoghurt
This healthy snack can be damaging to the teeth .
Bacteria in the milk can react with sugars in the food , triggering acid production and enamel erosion .
Apples
An apple a day may well keep the doctor away , but it will also keep the dentist busy .
Eating apples can contain the equivalent of four teaspoons of sugar .
Sushi Loading
Oily fish such as salmon and tuna are rich in healthy omega 3 , but they may also be high in mercury .
London Telegraph
Blinking temporarily switches off parts of your brain , according to a study published in the latest issue of Current Biology .
The University College London ( UCL ) team found that the brain actively shuts down parts of the visual system each time you blink , even if light is still entering the eyes .
Their findings could explain why you do n’t notice your own blinks .
Scientists from the UCL Institute of Neurology designed a special device to study the effects of blinking on the brain .
The device , made with fibre optic cable , was placed in the mouth of volunteers wearing light proof goggles and lying in a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain scanner .
The optical fibre illuminated the eyeballs through the roof of the mouth with a strong light , making the head glow red .
Thus , light falling on the retina remained constant even when the volunteers blinked , enabling scientists to measure the effects of blinking on brain activity independently of the effect of eyelid closure on light entering the eye .
The study , funded by the Wellcome Trust , found that blinking suppressed brain activity in the visual cortex as well as parietal and prefrontal areas which are usually activated when people become conscious of visual events or objects in the outside world .
Davina Bristow of the UCL Institute of Neurology says : “ Blinking is necessary to keep the surfaces of the eyes moist .
Most people blink around 15 times a minute and a blink lasts on average 100 - 150 milliseconds , which means that overall we spend at least 9 days per year blinking .
“ We would immediately notice if the outside world suddenly went dark , especially if it was happening every few seconds .
But we are rarely aware of our blinks , even though they cause a similar reduction in the amount of light entering the eye , and this gives us an uninterrupted view of the world .
“ Transiently suppressing the brain areas involved in visual awareness during blinks may be a neural mechanism for preventing the brain from becoming aware of the eyelid sweeping down over the pupil during a blink and the world going dark . ”
In short , the authors suggest that when we blink , the brain may just miss it .

Parkersburg , West Virginia ( CNN ) --
At nearly $ 12.1 trillion , the U.S. national debt has reached a size that is incomprehensible to most people and as intangible as the ' " Big Bang " or bipartisanship .
But it is real in West Virginia , where a small , nearly anonymous group of government accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day , living a mathematic nightmare and number cruncher 's dream .
At a large desk in Parkersburg , Jaime Saling watches over roughly 6,500 pieces of data and trillions of dollars each day .
Her title takes up a few characters itself : Saling is the debt accounting branch manager for the Bureau of Public Debt .
She and a division of just 15 people quietly and relentlessly work to account for every penny of the national debt .
It is tedious and potentially overwhelming work , but Saling acts as if she flies jet fighters .
" I get very excited , " the petite and energetic Saling says , " They call me a nerd , several times ; I think it 's because I get very excited about all the work we do . "
That work happens in a simple one - story , brick building in Parkersburg , some 300 miles from Washington .
The public debt offices landed there thanks to heavyweight home - state Sen. Robert Byrd .
The bureau 's offices are tucked into a corner of town that 's easy to miss .
A brown hill and train track sit on one side , parking lots for county offices on the other .
The locale is still a surprise to some .
" Every now and then we get a comment , ' Where are you ?
Parkersburg ? ' "
Saling says .
The public debt building has become a number nerds ' paradise .
Employees say they balance their checkbooks at least weekly , some daily .
A big happy - face sign marks progress on a recent audit .
A written goal is taped to a Nerf - sized football .
And the security guards brag that someone brings in a cake about every other day .
Inside , Saling 's office is pin-neat , but her computer screen is cramped .
A full - screen photo of Saling 's 4 - and 5 - year - old children is covered by dozens of icons for spreadsheets and documents , so that glimpses of bright blonde hair poke out from under a field of white data squares .
" I need to clean it out right now , " Saling says with a shrug , then laughs .
She then calls up the brain of the debt - management system , a software program called PARS , or Public debt Accounting and Reporting System .
The acronym is a pun only an accountant would love .
" Par value " means " stated value " in the field .
PARS is a custom program , designed in the early '90s to check and double - check the constant buying and selling of U.S. debt .
Thanks in part to the debt software , what used to take 100 people a month to compute now is done by 15 people in a day .
Even so , the program looks like it's from another time , with a black screen and neon - colored letters that recall computer monitors of the " War Games " era .
" It is outdated , " Saling says of the font .
But she insists the program itself still operates well .
Annual government reviews of PARS back that up .
And the division overall has a remarkable record of 13 straight years of unqualified audits , the accounting gold standard of accuracy .
That brings a massive smile to Saling 's face ; you see how someone so enthusiastic can be called a nerd .
" Things like that make me very excited . "
( Her favorite report , by the way , is the " schedules of public debt " . )
Each day , to check the funds flowing in and out of the public debt , Saling types in five - digit codes into PARS and checks a slew of accounts .
She knows about 50 of those codes by heart .
In general , there is a scale to this work that would disrupt most minds .
" Most people do n't have a sense of it until they come here and see it , " said accounting director Mike Linder , who is Saling 's boss .
" Most calculators do n't handle what we do . "
And almost no one sees the debt as they do .
" A lot of people , I do n't think realize what the debt's made of , " Saling put forth .
" In that $ 12 trillion you have both debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings . "
In other words , the debt held by those outside the government and debt the government owes to itself , such as money borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund .
At the end of November , $ 7.7 trillion was debt held by the public and $ 4.4 trillion was intragovernmental holdings .
Saling sees a heartbeat in the numbers .
" It 's actually helping us operate government . "
And never has government been larger .
But Saling and these accountants of the people are careful on that note .
" It 's not that we 're saying this is the right thing to do , " she states matter - of - factly .
" A lot of times we 're saying , ' If they pass this , how are we going to account for it ? '
A lot of times that takes a lot of meetings . "
Saling is right , in the age of deficits and debt , all of that literally keeps government operating .
Yet those trillions of dollars are overseen by a small division that works without contractors and is content with a software system that may look clunky , but which they insist works more than well .
There is an irony here .
These self - proclaimed nerds oversee the very symbol of big government but exude sobriety and restraint .
Saling and her staff are nearly anonymous but deeply significant .
And they are more than happy that way .
Top Dem to Obama : ' There Ain't Going to Be Money for Nothing if We Pour It All Into Afghanistan ' Rep Obey digs in over the war ; promises to demand a tax if more troops are sent .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 23 , 2009  --
The powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee has a stark message for President Obama about Afghanistan -- sending more troops would be a mistake that could " wipe out every initiative we have to rebuild our own economy . "
" There ain't going to be no money for nothing if we pour it all into Afghanistan , " House Appropriations Chairman David Obey told ABC News in an exclusive interview .
" If they ask for an increased troop commitment in Afghanistan , I am going to ask them to pay for it . "
Obey , a Democrat from Wisconsin , made it clear that he is absolutely opposed to sending any more U.S. troops to Afghanistan and says if Obama decides to do that , he 'll demand a new tax -- what he calls a " war surtax " -- to pay for it .
" On the merits , I think it is a mistake to deepen our involvement , " Obey said .
" But if we are going to do that , then at least we ought to pay for it .
Because if we do n't , if we do n't pay for it , the cost of the Afghan war will wipe out every initiative we have to rebuild our own economy . "
Obey 's opposition to funding a troop increase in Afghanistan without a new tax would pose a significant problem for Obama if he decides to send more troops ( a decision the White House says the President could make as early as November 30 ) .
As Appropriations Committee chairman , Obey was a key player in securing money for the war when the last war funding bill narrowly passed the House in June .
His demand for a new war tax echoes a similar call by Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , also a Democrat , who recently told Bloomberg 's Al Hunt that he favors a new tax on Americans earning more than $ 200,000 a year to pay for sending any additional troops .
Obey argued that the tax should be paid by all taxpayers , with rates ranging from 1 percent for lower wage earners to 5 percent for the wealthy .
The White House wo n't be able to count on Obey 's support the next time the president seeks funding for the war .
" I want the president and every American to think ahead of time about what it means if you do add to our involvement in Afghanistan , " Obey told ABC News .
" I am no military strategist , but I do n't believe we have the tools to accomplish our mission in Afghanistan because you have to have functioning , effective government and there is n't one in Afghanistan .
There is n't one in Pakistan either . "
High War Costs Will Doom Obama's Domestic Initiatives , Obey Says
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , has requested an additional 40,000 troops .
According to Obey , that would bring the cost of the war up to approximately $ 90 billion a year , or $ 900 billion over 10 years -- virtually the same as the cost of the Democratic health care plan .
Such a high war cost , he warns , will make it impossible to pay for any of Obama 's major domestic initiatives .
" That 's what happened with the Vietnam War , which wiped out [ President Lyndon Johnson 's social program ] the Great Society , " Obey said .
" That 's what happened with the Korean War , which wiped out Harry Truman 's Square Deal .
That 's what happened with the end of the progressive movement before the ' 20s when we went into World War I .
In each case , the cost of those wars shut off our ability to pay for anything else . "
I ’ve been laughing for the past 3 minutes about this .
SoJones family , if your sibling gets on your very last nerve and you have some juicy blackmail material on them , what do you do ?
The picture below explains everything , but let me tell you what happened in short :
Chris hides beer in his bedroom ( we assume he ’s underaged ) .
Sister snitches on him .
“ asian parents are [ f*ing ] strict ” as he explains , and they subsequently ground him for three months .
Infuriated and looking to get back at his sister , Chris subsequently discovers her very graphically detailed notes entitled “ My hook up list ” which describes her goals and aspirations for getting down with 10 different individuals , some of whom are crossed off aka “ mission accomplished ” .
So what does dear brother do with this scandalous material ?
He of course scans and posts it on his Facebook account .
Tags hella people on it , including named “ targets ” who quickly find and comment on .
And now , for my personal highlights of this whole fiasco :
1. Adrian ’s response - It ’s one thing to hear a rumor of a girl liking you , but to see your admirer ’s hook up list , then REJECT her by saying “ note to self : do not hook up with Katie , ” well that ’s a bigtime fail !
2 . The deadline– Katie wants to get all the bow - chicka - wow - wow done by April 2010 .
Who ’s in charge of project managing this deadline ?
Even hoes have ambitions !
3 . “ If he cuts his hair I ’ll give him a blowjob ” – Nothing like a quick cut and BLOW dry .
Heh .
4. Brother Chris ends the commenting exchange with “ I < 3 facebook like you < 3 cock ” – Katie ca n’t say anything to that even if she tried .
Chris FTW !
Katie , I hope you find peace after being publicly humiliated .
Unfortunately , this caper will linger around you like a bad smell through high school and college .
It will find you during job interviews and will hang on your leg like the bad guy in a movie as you climb the career ladder .
Your future husband will see it and probably your kids too .
A lesson for the rest of us on Facebook : do n’t leave evidence of your freaky ways lying around or else lock your room !
What would you do if your brother or sister did this to you ?
Let ’s hear your comments of revenge and karmic retribution in the comments !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Cuban musician barred from the United States by the Bush administration performed in Washington on Thursday and had lunch with a White House official in a new sign of a thaw in U.S. - Cuba relations .
Singer - songwriter Carlos Varela , whose songs capture the disenchantment of young Cubans , was given a three - week visa by the Obama administration , which has sought to improve ties with Cuba ’s communist government .
Varela met the White House official for lunch at a Washington restaurant , according to the organizers of his trip , the Center for Democracy in the Americas , a liberal group that seeks the lifting of the U.S. travel ban and trade embargo .
The group did not identify the official .
Varela also met with two members of Congress , Democratic Representatives Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and John Tierney of Massachusetts .
“ We do n’t have 80 television channels in Cuba , so we have nothing else to do but sing to each other about what we do , ” Varela , 46 , said at a church where he gave a talk on Cuba ’s musical culture and performed several songs .
He said Cuba ’s radio stations did not play his more critical songs about the frustrations and dreams of his generation .
He also criticized the travel restrictions between the two countries that began before he was born .
Varela , who last visited the United States in 1998 , hopes to bring his band on a U.S. tour next year .
Next week at Jackson Browne ’s studio in Los Angeles , he plans to mix his eighth album , which he recorded at his home in Havana and produced in Canada .
In 2004 , the Bush administration severely restricted cultural exchanges with Cuba , and denied Varela a visa to perform in Miami , even though 1,700 tickets had been sold .
Relations between Washington and Havana soured after Fidel Castro came to power in a 1959 revolution and aligned Cuba with the Soviet bloc .
President Barack Obama has lifted travel restrictions for Cuban - Americans and restarted migration talks with Havana , but he says the 47 - year - old trade embargo will stay in place until democratic reforms are seen in Cuba ’s one - party state .

This so - called Climategate is really getting out of hand , is n’t it ?
Steve McIntyre has published allegations – twice now – that an internal IPCC authors ’ debate about the inclusion of Briffa ’s tree -ring reconstruction in a key figure from the 2001 WG1 Third Assesement Report was driven by concern about the post - 1960 “ decline ” in tree - ring widths , a decline that showed a marked divergence with the instrumental tempertaure record .
The Climategate Letters show clearly that the relevant context is the IPCC Lead Authors ’ meeting in Tanzania in September 1999 at which the decline in the Briffa reconstruction was perceived by IPCC as “ diluting the message ” , as a “ problem ” , as a “ potential distraction / detraction ” .
[ Emphasis added ]
McIntyre even claims that lead author Michael Mann worried that showing the series with this decline would give “ fodder ” to “ skeptics ” .
But even a cursory examination of the emails in question shows that the discussion was really about other aspects of the reconstruction , specifically obvious discrepancies between Briffa ’s reconstruction and the other two under consideration over the major part of the reconstruction ’s length .
Thus , once again , McIntyre ’s speculations are shown to be utterly without foundation .
Even worse , McIntyre left out intervening sentences within the actual proffered quotes in what appears to be an unsophisticated attempt to mislead .
McIntyre first raised this canard back on November 26 :
The relevant IPCC 2001 graph , shown below , clearly does not show the decline in the Briffa MXD reconstruction .
Contrary to Gavin Schmidt ’s claim that the decline is “ hidden in plain sight ” , the inconvenient data has simply been deleted .
The reason , as explained on Sep 22 , 1999 by Michael Mann to coauthors in 938018124.txt , was to avoid giving “ fodder to the skeptics ” .
[ Emphasis added ]
Yesterday , after two weeks of due deliberation , McIntyre elaborated :
IPCC Lead Authors met in Arusha , Tanzania from September 1 to 3 , 1999 … at which the final version of the “ zero - order ” draft of the Third Assessment Report was presented and discussed …
No minutes of this meeting are available , but Climategate correspondence on Sep 22 - 23 , 1999 provides some contemporary information about the meeting .
Mann noted that “ everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that the [ decline in the Briffa reconstruction ] was a problem ”
McIntyre goes on to selectively quote from emails in the same post - meeting thread to support the above assertion that the post - 1960 “ decline ” in Briffa ’s reconstruction was the “ problem ” being discussed , although he fails to find any actual reference to it .
Sample :
IPCC Chapter Author Folland of the U.K. Hadley Center wrote to Mann , Jones and Briffa that the proxy diagram was a “ clear favourite ” for the Summary Policy - makers , but that the existing presentation showing the decline of the Briffa reconstruction “ dilutes the message rather significantly ” [ Emphasis added ] :
A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary .
But the current diagram with the tree ring only data [ i.e. the Briffa reconstruction ] somewhat contradicts the multiproxy curve and dilutes the message rather significantly …
This is probably the most important issue to resolve in Chapter 2 at present ..
( Folland , Sep 22 , 1999 , in 0938031546.txt ) [ sic ]
Well , so far , there ’s no actual evidence , except McIntyre ’s say so , that the “ decline ” or the “ hiding ” thereof is being discussed .
Those devious IPCC authors have managed to “ hide ” the “ hiding ” .
It ’s even worse than we thought !
Seriously , any time one sees McIntyre using elipsis it ’s a good idea to check it out .
So let ’s follow the dots and take a look at Chris Folland ’s email , which is first in the chain of three emails that McIntyre quotes ( although McIntyre jumps back and forth in a way that obfuscates what is really going on ) .
It ’s worth quoting in full :
A proxy diagram of temperature change is a clear favourite for the Policy Makers summary .
But the current diagram with the tree ring only data somewhat contradicts the multiproxy curve and dilutes the message rather significantly .
We want the truth .
Mike thinks it lies nearer his result ( which seems in accord with what we know about worldwide mountain glaciers and , less clearly , suspect about solar variations ) .
The tree ring results may still suffer from lack of multicentury time scale variance .
This is probably the most important issue to resolve in Chapter 2 at present .

How can anyone read this and possibly come to the conclusion that what is being discussed is the “ decline ” in the late instrumental period ?
And what word comes to mind for someone who would deliberately remove the fact that the “ issue ” Folland raises is the lack of multicentury variance for the Briffa reconstruction as a whole ?
Equally misleading is McIntyre ’s characterization of a subsequent statement of Mann ’s ( which occurs after the “ problem ” quote given before ) :
Mann went on to say that the skeptics would have a “ field day ” if the declining Briffa reconstruction were shown and that he ’d “ hate to be the one ” to give them “ fodder ” [ Emphasis added ] :
So , if we show Keith ’s series in this plot , we have to comment that “ something else ” is responsible for the discrepancies in this case .
… Otherwise , the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and , thus , can undermine faith in the paleoestimates .
I do n’t think that doubt is scientifically justified , and I ’d hate to be the one to have to give it fodder !
Once again , let ’s go follow the dots and see what lies behind , emphasizing the part that McIntyre apparently does n’t want you to read :
… But that explanation certainly can’t rectify why Keith ’s series , which has similar seasonality * and * latitudinal emphasis to Phil ’s series , differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that Phil ’s does from ours .
This is the problem we all picked up on ( everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a potential distraction / detraction from the reasonably concensus viewpoint we ’d like to show w/ the Jones et al and Mann et al series .
So , if we show Keith ’s series in this plot , we have to comment that “ something else ” is responsible for the discrepancies in this case .
Perhaps Keith can help us out a bit by explaining the processing that went into the series and the potential factors that might lead to it being “ warmer ” than the Jones et al and Mann et al series ??
We would need to put in a few words in this regard .
Otherwise , the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and , thus , can undermine faith in the paleoestimates .
I do n’t think that doubt is scientifically justified , and I ’d hate to be the one to have to give it fodder !
[ Emphasis added ]
So the “ problem ” was that Briffa ’s reconstruction was warmer in “ large part ” than Mann in periods where the Jones reconstruction was cooler ( i.e. “ opposite direction ” ) .
And when in the reconstruction did the “ cooler ” Jones periods occur ?
Well , certainly not in the 20th century where Mann and Jones were virtually identical ( and Briffa ’s “ decline ” was cooler ) .
Rather the Jones reconstruction was cooler than Mann ’s in the 17th and 19th centuries , as shown in the final Figure 2.21 from TAR below , and so this is where the major discrepancies needed to be explained .
Finally , it should be noted that this problem of the overall discrepancy between Briffa ’s reconstruction and the other two appears to have been largely resolved in a quaint manner – subsequent scientific research !
( That ’s something McIntyre and his supporters should consider some time ) .
For the reconstruction discussed in the emails ( based on tree ring width in Briffa et al 1999 ) was superceded by a subsequent study ( Briffa 2000 , based on tree - ring density ) as seen in the final figure above .
In this period , Briffa was also working on methods to preserve low - frequency information , and this may have also led to improved reconciliation with the Jones reconstruction .
Update , December 12
Here is the original figure from the TAR “ zero - order ” draft , as presented by Steve McIntyre at ClimateAudit :
Figure 1 . IPCC Third Assessment Report Zero-Order Draft Figure 2.3.3a Comparison of millennial Northern Hemisphere ( NH ) temperature reconstructions from different investigators ( Briffa et al , 1998 ; Jones et al , 1998 ; Mann et al , 1998; 1999a ) …
All the series were filtered with a 40 year Gaussian filter .
The problematic Briffa reconstruction is the yellow series .
This may well be the Briffa series that Chris Folland questioned as evincing a “ lack of multicentury time scale variance ” in the first of the chain of three emails at issue .
( See Michael Mann ’s email here to see the three in reverse reply order ; chronological order may be somewhat clearer ) .
However , that issue is somewhat moot given Briffa ’s reply shortly thereafter :
The latest tree - ring density curve ( i.e. our data that have been processed to retain low frequency information ) shows more similarity to the other two series– as do a number of other lower resolution data ( Bradley et al , Peck et al . , and new Crowley series – see our recent Science piece ) whether this represents ‘ TRUTH ’ however is a difficult problem .
[ Emphasis added ]
The “ recent Science piece ” was a reference to :
Science 7 May 1999 :
Vol. 284. no. 5416 , pp. 926 – 927
DOI : 10.1126/science.284.5416.926 CLIMATE
WARMING : Seeing the Wood from the Trees
Keith R. Briffa and Timothy J. Osborn
Here is the portion of Briffa ’s Figure 1 covering the millenium from 1000 to 2000 :
Comparison of NH temperature reconstructions , all recalibrated with linear regression against the 1881 - 1960 mean April - September instrumental temperatures averaged over land areas north of 20 ºN .
All series have been smoothed with a 50 - year Gaussian - weighted filter and are anomalies from the 1961 - 90 mean .
Instrumental temperatures ( 1871 -1997 ) are in black , circum - Arctic temperature proxies [ 1600 - 1990 , from ( 2 ) ] are in yellow , northern NH tree - ring densities [ 1550 - 1960 , from ( 3 ) , processed to retain low - frequency signals ] are in pale blue , NH temperature proxies [ 1000 - 1992 , from ( 4 ) ] are in red , global climate proxies [ 1000 - 1980 , from ( 5,6 ) ] are in purple , and an average of three northern Eurasian tree - ring width chronologies [ 1-1993 , from ( 10 ) ] is in green .
Although representing a much more restricted spatial coverage than the other series , the last of these ( also processed to maintain low - frequency climate information ) is included here because of its extended length and because it suggests relatively cooler summer temperatures ( at least across northern Eurasia ) before A.D. 1000 .
The above caption is the original but with the three series of interest highlighted namely Briffa ( 3 , in blue ) , Jones et al ( 4 , in red ) and Mann et al ( 5,6 in purple ) .
We can see , as noted above , that the Briffa series is “ warmer ” than Jones in the 17th and 19th centuries .
And , indeed for most of the 19th century , the two present in opposite variation from Mann et al ’s multi-proxy reconstruction .
So Briffa had already published a series that partially , if not entirely , addressed Mann ’s concerns .
Comparing once again to the final figure , we see that little changed from this point on :
What is absolutely clear is that the post - 1960 decline was not the “ issue ” or “ problem ” being discussed here .
And that Briffa ’s series as used in the final version of TAR was very similar to one he had already published ( including , of course , its termination in 1960 ) .
The only question now is how far this nonsense will go in the contrarian echo chamber .
So with that in mind , here ’s a little poll for your edification and entertainment .
I will be updating this post from time to time with links to major “ echoes ” of this particular “ Climategate ” meme .
I hope the list will be short .
( Dates in bold indicate the original date of the link ; square brackets indicate the date added to the list ) .

December 12 :
An 18 year old Starcraft player has been reported as attacking a 15 year old girl .
The gamer became angry when his internet connection would n't work and picked up a kitchen knife and headed into the street .
When there he came into contact with a 15 year old girl who was on her way home from a party and laughing with a friend .
He attacked her with the knife but despite several stabs her injuries were not life threatening .
The troubled teenager has now been sentenced to psychiatric care by the Nacka court for these actions , his first offense .
The gamer 's thoughts apparently grew dark as a result of his internet connection problems not allowing him to play Starcraft .
The prosecutor , Jennie Söderberg , attempted to have him tried for attempted murder but the court classified the knife attack as attempted manslaughter as the case had a psychiatric component to it and he apparently did not leave his house with intent to kill the girl .
The incident took place on the 9th of August .
The news article portrays the story as one of the game leading to the boy 's wish to harm / kill which seems an indirect point at best .

Rich APIs
OneBusAway offers a suite of application programming interfaces ( APIs ) that facilitate the support the development of a wide range of third party applications , based on actual vehicle locations and on scheduled and predicted arrival times .
Tens of millions of the world 's poor will have their food rations cut or cancelled in the next few weeks because rich countries have slashed aid funding .
The result , says Josette Sheeran , head of the UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) , could be the " loss of a generation " of children to malnutrition , food riots and political destabilisation .
" We are facing a silent tsunami , " said Sheeran in an exclusive interview with the Observer .
" A humanitarian disaster is unrolling . "
The WFP feeds nearly 100 million people a year .
Food riots in more than 20 countries last year persuaded rich countries to give a record $ 5 bn to the WFP to help avert a global food crisis brought on by record oil prices and the growth of biofuel crops .
But new data seen by the Observer show that food aid is now at its lowest in 20 years .
Countries have offered only $ 2.7bn in the first 10 months of 2009 .
The US , by far the world 's biggest contributor to food aid , has so far pledged $ 800 m less than in 2008 ; Saudi Arabia has paid only $ 10 m in 2009 compared with $ 500 m in 2008 ; and the EU has given $ 130 m less .
Britain 's promise of $ 69 m ( £ 43.5 m ) this year is nearly $ 100 m ( £ 63 m ) less than 2008 , and , if nothing more is given , will be its lowest contribution since 2001 .
" Even under our best scenarios , we will end the year $ 2bn short , " said Sheeran .
" Many of our funders do not feel that they need to give on the level of last year .
They think the world food crisis is over , but in 80 % of countries food prices are actually higher than one year ago . "
World food supplies are under increased strain this year following a succession of droughts , typhoons , floods and earthquakes that have destroyed crops in Africa and south - east Asia .
But human needs are also greater because the financial crisis has led to widespread unemployment .
In addition , the remittances from foreign nationals living in rich countries to their families at home are 20 % lower than last year .
Last month the UN said that the number of hungry people in the world had increased by more than 150 million in a single year to more than one billion .
Aid agencies last week warned of severe food shortages in southern India after heavy floods damaged hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of crops .
" There is a silent tsunami [ of hunger ] gathering .
You can not see or hear it , but it's in all these villages , killing people just as hard .
This is the worst food crisis since the 1970s .
We will lose a generation .
Children will never recover , " said Sheeran .
More than 40 million people could be affected by the WFP 's enforced scaling back of its food rations .
Countries most likely to be hit include Bangladesh , where the budget is likely to be cut by as much as 50 % , and Kenya , where similar cuts will worsen the plight of millions of extra people made destitute by a long drought .
The new rations , which are reserved for people who have no access to food , will fall below what aid agencies consider a survival ration and will provide , at most , one meagre meal a day .
" We are making hard choices over who to feed .
We are very aware that as we dismantle [ feeding programmes ] it may take out the underpinning of society and leads to political destabilisation , " said Sheeran .
Aid agencies last night urged rich countries to pledge more .
" We are very concerned about the large budget shortfall faced by WFP , which means the programme has to cut the food rations to millions of people who rely on this assistance for their very survival , " said Fred Mousseau , Oxfam 's humanitarian policy adviser .
" This will translate into more child deaths , with more than 16,000 children already dying from hunger - related causes every day . "
The Return of Bullz - Eye ’s TV Power Rankings
Ever since the writers ’ strike , the television industry has been in a state of flux .
Most networks still can’t figure out what works from what does n’t , while the current economic climate has forced others to simply give up .
Whether or not “ The Jay Leno Show ” is a success for NBC is debatable , but by surrendering the 10 p.m. time slot , they ’ve greatly decreased their chances of bringing in new viewers .
We would be exaggerating if we said the decision affected Bullz - Eye ’s latest edition of the TV Power Rankings , but our Winter 2009 list does seem suspiciously familiar .
Still , it is n’t without its surprises , as a longtime favorite returned from an extended hiatus to claim the top spot , while buzzworthy rookies like “ Glee ” and “ FlashForward ” also made impressive Top 10 debuts .
At the end of the day , however , the real winner is HBO , who walked away with three of the four top spots , thus reestablishing themselves as the best network around .
A few examples from the piece :
5. Glee ( Fox ) :
There is n’t a show on this list that we love and hate with the same enthusiasm that we have for “ Glee . ”
It contains some of the best - drawn characters in Fox ’s history ( aspiring diva Rachel Berry , adorable germaphobe Emma Pillsbury , cantankerous alpha female Sue Sylvester ) , and the iTunes chart - burning musical numbers , lip synching aside , are deliriously fun .
Imagine , then , if they did n’t make these characters jump through such ridiculous hoops .
Will ’s wife is actually going to take her fake pregnancy to term ?
Emma agrees to marry Ken , but only as long as they never tell a soul ?
( Those plot threads brought to you by Bad Idea Jeans . )
Yet for each blunder the show makes , they come up with something as brilliantly funny as Finn ’s technique for not climaxing ( he thinks about the time when he hit the mailman with his car ) , or the drama queen freak show that is Sandy Ryerson ( a pitch - perfect Stephen Tobolowsky ) .
Getting Josh Groban to do a cameo as a horndog version of himself , meanwhile – and hit on Will ’s drunk mother – was a moment of “ Arrested Development ” - style genius .
Yes , it ’s made mistakes , but “ Glee ” gets a spot in our Top Five because no other show on TV sports dialogue like “ mentally ill ginger pygmy with eyes like a bush baby . ”
But man , it would be a wonderful world if they did .
– David Medsker
15 . Dexter ( Showtime ) : Like “ The Sopranos , ” Dexter always has a theme that is explored within a season as a backdrop to the episodic progression of the show .
Last season , it examined friendship within the context of Dexter ’s secret world , and Jimmy Smits was brilliant as his first and only pal .
This year explores the facets of intimate relationships , and balancing work and the rest of your life as it relates to it .
Dexter ( played with brilliant sincerity and conviction by Michael C. Hall ) is struggling to find balance between his work as a blood splatter analyst , a new dad of an infant , stepfather to his wife ’s kids , and his hobby of killing and dismembering other bad guys , while his entertainingly foul - mouthed sister Deb implodes the most stable relationship of her life when she sleeps with returning lover and retired FBI agent Frank Lundy .
John Lithgow is also scary good as the Trinity Killer , the latest object of Dexter ’s attention .
When Trinity kills Lundy and wounds Deb while making it look like another killer ’s signature , Dex is commanded by the ghost of Harry to seek revenge , making this season as entertaining as any in the past – no easy feat considering how consistently good this show has been .
– R. David Smola
Honorable Mention – Cougar Town ( ABC ) : Yeah , yeah , we know : the title ’s a bit dodgy .
But Bill Lawrence , who co-created the show with Kevin Biegel , has said , “ The roll of the dice I ’ve made is that the title is noisy and that people will be aware of this show . ”
True enough , though the fact that the series stars Courtney Cox would ’ve probably done a pretty decent job of putting it on people ’s radar , anyway .
The pilot alone was strong enough to suggest that “ Cougar Town ” could prove to be the perfect series for female viewers who ’ve outgrown “ Sex and the City , ” but with enough of a dysfunctional family element to fit perfectly into the closing slot in ABC ’s new Wednesday night comedy line - up .
Although the show continues to hone its comedic formula , the trio of Cox , Christa Miller and Busy Philipps clicked immediately ( particularly the latter two , with their characters ’ diametrically opposed personalities ) , and the relationship between the teenaged Travis and his man-child of a father rings true with its blend of unconditional love and complete embarrassment .
Now that Jules ’s fling with Josh is over , however , we ’re curious to see who ’ll be next on her slate to date — and how long this one will last .

Returning in 2010 – Lost ( ABC ) :
Here we are , folks .
After five seasons of confusing viewers with one of the most elaborate mythologies on television , “ Lost ” is finally in the home stretch .
Want to know what the heck that smoke monster really is ?
How about the weird statue ?
Heck , what about the Dharma Initiative itself ?
All will supposedly be revealed in the sixth and final season of one of the smartest , most fearless shows network television has ever bothered to offer .
Of course , this being “ Lost , ” we still have something to bitch about – namely , that the goddamn Olympics will interrupt the show ’s final 18 episodes – but if we ’ve waited this long to determine the ultimate fate of our favorite island castaways , what ’s a few weeks of curling and cross-country skiing ?
We ’ve all had our issues with the way “ Lost ” has unfolded over the years , and the show is n’t the phenomenon it was in its first couple of seasons .
To cop one of the fall ’s most popular phrases , though , this is it – and if there ’s ever been a serialized drama with the guts to stick the landing and make its finale truly count , we ’re betting it ’s “ Lost . ” – Jeff Giles

One possibility for the source of Martian methane has been ruled out
The methane found on Mars is not brought to the planet by meteor strikes , scientists say .
Meteoritic material subjected to high temperatures did not release enough methane to account for the amount believed to be released on Mars .
The researchers argue that the methane must therefore be created by geologic or chemical processes , or it is a by - product of microbial life .
The work appears in Earth and Planetary Science Letters .
The origin of the methane on Mars has remained a mystery since it was first detected in 2004 .
Because methane has a limited lifetime in the Martian atmosphere before degrading , some process must be pumping hundreds of tonnes of it into the Martian atmosphere annually to keep it at the levels that have been detected .
Scientists at Imperial College London say they have now ruled out the possibility that the methane is being constantly deposited by meteorites landing on the planet .
They heated meteorite fragments to 1,000C , quantifying the gases produced by measuring how much they absorbed an infrared laser .
Sunlight quickly breaks down methane in the Martian atmosphere
They then calculated , based on estimates of how many meteorites impact Mars annually , how much methane would be released .
They found that just 10kg of methane is produced from meteors each year , in contrast to the 100-300 tonnes that must be produced to keep the atmospheric concentration at its current levels .
That suggests that a number of other possibilities , many of which are based on chemical reactions of the rocks that form the planet 's crust .
Alternatively , the gas may be produced by volcanoes or life that survives beneath the crust - or it may be trapped in chemical cages , having been produced long ago .
" As Sherlock Holmes said , eliminate all other factors and the one that remains must be the truth , " said study co-author Mark Sephton .
" The list of possible sources of methane gas is getting smaller and excitingly , extraterrestrial life still remains an option .
Ultimately , the final test may have to be on Mars . "
The US space agency Nasa will launch the Mars Science Laboratory in 2011 , which will be able to study the methane more closely .
In November , the European and American space agencies signed an agreement to collaborate on Mars missions that will return to the planet , starting in 2016 .

One of my great regrets is that , when I was super famous ( back in the Swatches - on - jacket years ) , I did n't get to do one of these bizarre Japanese commercials .

A Nigerian man tried to ignite an explosive device aboard a trans -Atlantic Northwest Airlines flight as the plane prepared to land in Detroit on Friday , in an incident the United States believes was “ an attempted act of terrorism , ” according to a White House official who declined to be identified .
The device , described by officials as a mixture of powder and liquid , failed to fully detonate .
Passengers on the plane described a series of pops that sounded like firecrackers .
Federal officials said the man wanted to bring the plane down .
“ This was the real deal , ” said Representative Peter T. King of New York , the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee , who was briefed on the incident and said something had gone wrong with the explosive device , which he described as somewhat sophisticated .
“ This could have been devastating , ” Mr. King said .
The incident is likely to lead to heightened security during the busy holiday season .
It was unclear how the man , identified by federal officials as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , managed to get the explosive on the plane , an Airbus A330 wide - body jet carrying 278 passengers that departed from Amsterdam with passengers who had originated in Nigeria .
A senior administration official said that the government did not yet know whether the man had had the capacity to take down the plane .

FINAL SCORE 118.1
Recently I 've tried to bring some attention to Atom - based servers for private web - hosting .
There were many skeptical about this idea : " How can cheap netbook processor work in a server ? " .
Now some companies provide collocation for atom - based nettops for a reduced price ( ~30 $ , usual price for 1U server is around 100 $ ) , and I wanted to share my experiences after using such server for a month .
Server configuration : Acer Aspire Revo 3600 on nVidia Ion platform , Intel Atom 330 ( 2 physical cores , 64 - bit ) , 4Gb DDR2 - 800 RAM ( Ubuntu 64 managed to see just 3.2 Gb , looks like BIOS issue ) , SSD OCZ Vertex 30 Gb .
I had several SSD optimizations applied : noatime mount , disabled access - logs , disabled swap – all this to extend drive life , but this is a topic for a separate article .
BTW , during first month of usage I ’ve spent around 0.5 % of the drive resource .
I ’ve left server at Agava company for collocation .
" Free " features are unlimited traffic ( with some restrictions ) , free 1 hour / day KVM , free reboots .
Here goes UnixBench 4.1 WHT results :
Before comparing to other VDS servers , you should consider that unixbench does not care how much memory you 've got .
Also , some VDS gives you " bursted " CPU during idle - hours and you will get too high results .
As you might noticed , the weakest point of Intel Atom is dual precision math - fortunately it is very rarely used in web - server - related software .
Probably Intel just emulated dual precision math to save some silicon .

Conclusion
Future
I ’ve installed Apache2 + MySQL5 +PHP
5.3+APC , nginx on the server .
Apache2 was set in prefork mode with 4 child processes : less than 4 processes were unable to produce 100 % system load , and therefore less performance .
More than 4 processes – also slightly lower speed .
( I.e. optimal child count – number of CPU cores with hyper - threading ) .
Nginx handles request queue , and he is very efficient at this task .
MySQL was set up to eat around 0.7 Gb of RAM .
PHP sessions are in memcached .
So , under any load Apache + MySQL+PHP does not takes more than ~1 Gb of RAM .
During data import into MyISAM table with 400'000 rows and 2 indexes MySQL was handling 1000 separate insert requests per second from PHP .
Load tests were done on my home page http://3.14.by/ru/
- 6 SQL queries , light PHP ) , and on PhpBB 3.0.6 forum , with APC opcode caching .
PHP / MySQL / Apache2 / nginx were manually optimized .
Requests were sent from separate server in the same city ( 45 concurrent requests ) .
For comparison I ’ve used shared hosting server at night ( with ~0 load , eu107.activeby.net ) , with clustered MySQL on separate servers .
12 Gb of RAM , Xeon E5410 ( 4 cores ) , 2.33 Ghz .
Apache2 , PHP5.2 , eAccelerator , nginx .*RPS – requests per second
Why Atom won ?
Local MySQL + large caches in RAM for just a couple of sites , not thousands .
Manually tuned software .
Some might still argue the usability of Atom - based servers , but here is the fact : my server works ideally , lightening fast , A LOT of RAM , absolutely no any disk slowdowns ( which is often on VPS ) , fast network ( separate 100 M bit/s connection to router ) , low pings ( 0.4 - 4ms on Moscow , 20 ms to Belarus ) .
But , you should remember that it might get broken – hardware likes to do that in the night when no one is looking .
There is just 1 mechanical piece ( CPU fan ) , so this should be theoretically more reliable than usual servers .
From the other side , if something happens – you always know when exactly your problem is going to be fixed .
This is a nice example of technological progress slowing : today even low - end solution might be perfect at good fraction of tasks : light web - server , file - server ( even for 1 G bit /s ) , static files serving ( even for 1 G bit /s ) , media streaming ( even for 1 G bit / s ) .
Personally , I am absolutely satisfied with my Atom - based serverNext year ( 2010 ) we will see next generation of Atom processors : Pineview ( 32nm ) .
It ’s main feature would be integrated single - channel memory controller .
No sure what is better , integrated single channel ( probably limited to 2 Gb of RAM ) , or dual channel in chipset .
Definitely it would have lower power consumption , but not sure it Is going to be perfect small server processor .
What I would really want to see is mass - produced ARM - based small servers .
For example , Cortex - A9 MPCore already looks awesome in terms of power consumption , performance and price / speed .
It is not a problem to run a server on ARM architecture , as servers are on Linux mainly , which runs on ARM perfectly now ( Ubuntu have official ARM version for example ) .
Probably without SIMD to save space , not sure it gives reasonable performance gains on server apps .
Also , probably it is worth to have emulated FPU .
Also , it would be great to have ALOT of RAM slots in mid-end servers – 2 Gb modules are going to be the cheapest ones for quite a long time , why ca n’t we have 8 - 16 slots in low - cost systems ?
Why so many ?
Because RAM is cheap , and we need to cache as much as possible .
On x86 there is a monopoly , on ARM you have much more freedom to do this Dell is not sleeping .
Looks awesome , but a little expensive ( 400 $ in bulk ) !
On Thursday afternoon , a radicalized Muslim US Army officer shouting , “ Allahu akbar ! ” ( “ God is great ! ” ) committed the worst act of terror on American soil since 9/11 .
And no one wants to call it an act of terror or associate it with Islam .
What cowards we are .
Political correctness killed those patriotic Americans at Fort Hood as surely as the Islamist gunman did .
And the media treat it like a case of nondenominational shoplifting .
This was a terrorist act .
When an extremist plans and executes a murderous plot against our unarmed soldiers to protest our efforts to counter Islamist fanatics , it ’s an act of terror .
Period .
When the terrorist posts anti-American hate speech on the Web ; apparently praises suicide bombers and uses his own name ; loudly criticizes US policies ; argues ( as a psychiatrist , no less ) with his military patients over the worth of their sacrifices ; refuses , in the name of Islam , to be photographed with female colleagues ; lists his nationality as “ Palestinian ” in a Muslim spouse - matching program and parades around central Texas in a fundamentalist playsuit — well , it only seems fair to call this terrorist an “ Islamist terrorist . ”
But the president wo n’t .
Despite his promise to get to all the facts .
Because there ’s no such thing as “ Islamist terrorism ” in ObamaWorld .
And the Army wo n’t .
Because its senior leaders are so sick with political correctness that pandering to America haters is safer than calling terrorism “ terrorism . ”
And the media wo n’t .
Because they have more interest in the shooter than in our troops — despite their crocodile tears .
Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan planned this terrorist attack and executed it in cold blood .
The resulting massacre was the first tragedy .
The second was that he was n’t killed on the spot .
Hasan survived .
Now the rest of us will have to foot his massive medical bills .
Activist lawyers will get involved , claiming “ harassment ” drove him temporarily insane .
There ’ll be no end of trial delays .
At best , taxpayer dollars will fund his prison lifestyle for decades to come , since our politically correct Army leadership would n’t dare pursue or carry out the death penalty .
Maj .
Hasan will be a hero to Islamist terrorists abroad and their sympathizers here .
While US Muslim organizations decry his acts publicly , Hasan will be praised privately .
And he ’ll have the last laugh .
But Hasan is n’t the sole guilty party .
The US Army ’s unforgivable political correctness is also to blame for the casualties at Fort Hood .
Given the myriad warning signs , it ’s appalling that no action was taken against a man apparently known to praise suicide bombers and openly damn US policy .
But no officer in his chain of command , either at Walter Reed Army Medical Center or at Fort Hood , had the guts to take meaningful action against a dysfunctional soldier and an incompetent doctor .
Had Hasan been a Lutheran or a Methodist , he would ’ve been gone with the simoom .
But officers fear charges of discrimination when faced with misconduct among protected minorities .
Now 12 soldiers and a security guard lie dead .
At least 38 people were wounded , 28 of them seriously .
If heads do n’t roll in this maggot ’s chain of command , the Army will have shamed itself beyond moral redemption .
There ’s another important issue , too .
How could the Army allow an obviously incompetent and dysfunctional psychiatrist to treat our troubled soldiers returning from war ?
An Islamist wacko is counseled for arguing with veterans who ’ve been assigned to his care ?
And he ’s not removed from duty ?
What planet does the Army live on ?
For the first time since I joined the Army in 1976 , I ’m ashamed of its dereliction of duty .
The chain of command protected a budding terrorist who was waving one red flag after another .
Because it was safer for careers than doing something about him .
Get ready for the apologias .
We ’ve already heard from the terrorist ’s family that “ he ’s a good American . ”
In their world , maybe he is .
But when do we , the American public , knock off the PC nonsense ?
A disgruntled Muslim soldier murdered his officers way back in 2003 , in Kuwait , on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
Recently ?
An American mullah shoots it out with the feds in Detroit .
A Muslim fanatic attacks an Arkansas recruiting station .
A Muslim media owner , after playing the peace card , beheads his wife .
A Muslim father runs over his daughter because she ’s becoming too Westernized .
Muslim terrorist wannabes are busted again and again .
And we ’re assured that “ Islam ’s a religion of peace . ”
I guarantee you that the Obama administration ’s nonresponse to the Fort Hood attack will mock the memory of our dead .

The " Subaru " engine powered the Coloni chassis during the 1990 season .
Like most F1 engines the project was a badged project , the design and manufacture being done by Motori - Moderni and the end result blessed by Subaru who funded the project .
For 1990 the Coloni team itself was 51 % owned by Subaru and 49 % by its founder Enzo Coloni .
They fielded only 1 car and it was driven by Belgian Bertrand Gachot .
Some facts about the car .......
Subaru Coloni C3B
Sponsor - Subaru
Designer - Paul Burgis
Team Manager - Enzo Coloni
Engine con fig - flat 12
Bore x stroke - 84 mm x 52.6mm
Capacity - 3498cc
Compression ratio - 11.5:1
Estimated power - 600 bhp @ 12,500rpm ( compare this to the Honda V10 in the McLaren which is quoted as 690bhp )
Max rpm - 13,000

The car is described in the 1990 / 1 Autocourse as " Coloni - Revised C3B chassis powered by a flat - 12 Motori Moderni - designed Subaru engine , with transverse gearbox from the same company .
An over weight and extremely ungainly makeshift machine . "

Arrows Ford Cosworth V8
Benetton Ford HB V8
Ferrari V12
McLaren Honda V10
Minardi Ford Cosworth V8
Tyrrell Honda V10
and Williams Renault V10 .
There were 39 drivers in all trying to qualify for the 26 grid positions .
This brought about the need for pre-qualifying .
The lower teams started their weekend early Friday morning , and only the top four going onto qualifying and the other 9 packing up after only an hour of action ( or in some cases less than a lap ) .
Being a small team with no points from the previous season , Subaru Coloni were forced into pre-qualifying with the likes of Euro Brun , AGS , Life , and Larrousse .
Summary of the season , the positions given are for the pre qualifying times ..... they did not get through very often .
United States GP - Phoenix
As Gachot accelerated out of the pits for pre-qualifying the gear linkage on the car broke and pre-qualifying ended for the team before a lap had been run .
Brazil - Interlagos
Clutch trouble .
7th in pre-qualifying with a time of 1 min 34.046s .
Pole time was 1 min 17.277s .

Car went on a diet and lost 21kg over the Brazil car !
Unfortunately a vapour lock problem caused time to be lossed , shortening running time .
Just missed the cut with 5th in pre-qualifying and a time of 1 m 33.554s .

There was an interview with Peter Colins of Lotus before the race at Silverstone , with Murray Walker commenting on how many different engine configurations and manufacturers there were .
Collins was asked about the new V12 Lamborghini engine fitted in the Lotus .
He made some interesting comments on the different configurations , with the Lambo and Ferrari V12 being good for ultimate top end power , the V8 Fords and Judds being very compact allowing the chassis to be designed to the optimum at the sacrifice of some power , and the V10 Honda and Renault being a good compromise between the two .
On the Life W12 he kindly commented " interesting concept " .
It was replaced by a Judd V8 by the end of the year .
He mentioned the Subaru at length as it was a 12 cylinder like his own teams Lambo but a flat 12 .
He said that the idea was to get the centre of gravity low , but this then results in a very wide engine at the detrement to bodywork and aerodynamics .
He also pointed out that the engine could not be placed that low ( we are talking F1 here remember ) as the exhausts had to come out somewhere , necessitating it to then be raised !
July - Subaru retire from F1 .
The team is sold back to its name sake .
The Coloni continues on unsuccesfully with a Ford Cosworth DFR V8 replacing the flat 12 .
The chassis is rebuilt with a lengthened wheel base after it is written off in Germany .
Further improvements are made in Hungary .
It finally pre-qualifies in Italy , Portugal , and Spain , but to no avail as it then fails to qualify for the races .
Japan and Australia were a bit different as the other pre-qualifiers failed to turn up so the Coloni had a free pass into the qualifying , but failed as usual to get into the race itself .
Other notes on the season :-
Silverstone was the race where Mansell retired from the race in his Ferrari to then announce his retirement from F1 .
Eddie Jordan announces he is to embark into F1 in the following year .
Italy was the race where Derek Warwick 's Lotus was involved in an enormous accident at the exit of the Parabolica on lap 1 .
Spain was the race where Martin Donnellys racing career as a driver ended in a massive qualifying accident .
Japan was the site of the famous 1st bend coming together by Prost and Senna .
By this time Mansell had unretired himself with a new contract to drive for Williams .
... and in the same year the Sierra ( Saphirre ) 4x4 Cosworth is getting rave reviews in all the press .... Lancia Delta Integrale takes the World Rally Championship for manufacturers and Carlos Sainz wins the drivers title in a Toyota GT4 .

I recently acquired a copy of my old friend Clifford Pickover ’s new tome , The Math Book , a really attractive and reasonably priced volume with 250 full page color illustrations , each illustration accompanied by a single - page description .
In Pickover ’s words , “ My goal in writing The Math Book is to provide a wide audience with a brief guide to important mathematical ideas and thinkers , with entries short enough to digest in a few minutes . ”
[ Breather Pseudosphere , Copyright ( C ) 2006 by Paul Nylander .

One of my favorite images in The Math Book is Paul Nylander ’s rendition of the so - called Breather Pseudosphere .
The idea behind this surface is that it has a constant curvature of - 1 , as opposed to a sphere , which might have a constant curvature of +1 , and also as opposed to a plane , which has a constant curvature of 0 .
You ’re supposed to ignore the ribs , and you need to accept that the surface intersects itself along a circle , which is clearer in the image below , by Xah Lee .
You can rotate this image on Xah ’s site .
[ Segment of a Breather Pseudosphere , Copyright 2006 by Xah Lee . ]
From the arcane math references that I ’ve consulted — see for instance the Wikipedia “ breather ” page — I gather that the breather pseudosphere can in fact “ breathe ” in the sense that , by diddling a certain parameter , someone ( not me anymore ) could create a sequence of images of it and then assemble these into a video in which this negatively curved object will pulsate like some omnivorous space squid from Dimension Z .
If any of you ultra - math - and - CS maniacs out there has access to such a video — or feels the urge to create one — share the link with us via a comment on this post !
[ A traditional Beltrami pseudosphere , Copyright ( C ) 2006 by Richard Palais and the the 3DXM consortium . ]
As Pickover ’s book explains , the notion of pseudospheres was invented in 1868 by the mathematician Eugenio Beltrami , who formulated the more familiar “ double trumpet ” model , as shown above , created by the 3DXM Consortium .
( 3DXM is a graphics program , now called 3D - XplorMath . )
You can find further images of various kinds of pseudospheres ( these images by Xah Lee , Luc Bernard and other members of the 3DXM consortium ) on the Gallery of Pseudospherical surfaces at the Virtual Math Museum .
This page includes an essay “ About Pseudospherical Surfaces , ” which explains ( amid much gnarly math ) that , at least when depicted in our normal 3D space , any surface of constant curvature - 1 will include “ singularities ” in the forms of self - intersections or cuspy lines where the surface has a crease in it — like those ribs in the breather pseudosphere or like the edge where Beltrami ’s two trumpets meet .
But you can smoothly embed pseudospheres into 4D space , I believe .
As I was discussing in an earlier post , another way to create a negatively curved space is to start with a disk of some ductile material , and the keep stretching the disk all over , but without overly stretching the outer edge .
The inside of the disk acquires more area than one would find in a regular flat disk .
The extra room is there because the interior is now a negatively curved surface .
And I think this surface is something like a pseudosphere .
( A different approach is to stretch the outer edge of the disk to infinite length , and this is a different model of negatively curved space called the Poincaré plane . )

Some knitters and beaders have crafted physical objects like the edge - stretched pseudosphere , some of which appear among a wild Crochet Reef show in 2009 .

When I was snorkeling near Palau a few years ago , I noticed that many naturally occurring soft corals are indeed negatively curved surfaces .
It ’s worth remembering , by the way , that if you ’re living in a very small house , it might be nice to have negatively curved space inside …
KHOST , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - Afghan security forces put down an attack by Taliban fighters , including suicide bombers , in a volatile southeastern town on Monday while parliament debated President Hamid Karzai ’s new cabinet choices .

The Taliban attack in the town of Gardez , 100 km ( 60 miles ) southeast of Kabul , showed the Afghan insurgency had not abated despite a gradual resolution of a long political impasse following a fraud - tainted presidential poll in August .
The militants , some wearing suicide vests packed with explosives , attacked a key police building in Gardez before they were surrounded in a market , a local official and residents said .
“ The fighting is over .
All of the assailants have been killed , ” Rohullah Samoon , a spokesman for the governor of Paktia province , said by telephone without indicating how many attackers there had been .
Earlier he said at least three had been killed .
A Taliban provincial commander said five of the Islamist group ’s fighters , equipped with suicide vests and heavy weapons , had launched the assault .
Attacks in Afghanistan this year have spiraled to their highest levels since the Taliban were overthrown by U.S. - backed Afghan forces in late 2001 .
Washington is sending 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in an attempt to stem the mounting violence , with NATO allies also contributing thousands more .
Civilian and military casualty tolls have reached record levels this year .
“ LITTLE CHANGE ”
The mounting violence has coincided with a long period of political uncertainty .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai was confirmed last month as the winner of the August 20 vote despite a U.N. - backed panel finding widespread fraud in his favor .
Karzai presented his cabinet nominations to parliament on Saturday , a list which kept most of the technocrats in key ministries but changed or reshuffled lesser portfolios .
Parliament must approve Karzai ’s 23 nominations but a vote is not expected before the weekend at the earliest .
While largely praised by Western leaders who want to see Karzai act more vigorously against endemic corruption , the cabinet nominations disappointed many Afghans who said it showed little evidence of change .
Karzai has hit back at his critics , saying his choice of ministers is representative of all Afghanistan .
But the list highlights his need to placate a wide range of forces in a country still largely divided on ethnic and regional lines .
Karzai retained power after key regional chieftains , some with dubious human rights records , threw their support behind him , often to the dismay of Western leaders and diplomats who feared he had made deals in return for their support .
Western leaders with troops fighting in Afghanistan , and who pump billions of dollars of aid into the country , became more critical of government corruption after Karzai ’s election win .
POLICE , CIVILIANS WOUNDED
Seven civilians and four policemen were wounded during the Gardez clashes , which lasted for nearly four hours , Samoon said .
Residents near the scene said the main road linking Gardez with neighboring provinces and the capital had been closed .
Small - and heavy - arms fire was heard in the heart of the town after the insurgents attacked the police building close to other government offices , residents said .
Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in the center of the town , a frequent target of Taliban militants .
In July , nine people were killed when Taliban gunmen and suicide bombers , some dressed as women , launched a similar attack .
A spokesman for NATO - led forces in Afghanistan said he had no information about the incident and could not say whether foreign troops were involved .
There are already some 110,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan battling the Taliban - led insurgency , which is strongest in the south and east but has spread this year into formerly peaceful areas in the north and west .
The Taliban often target Afghan and foreign security forces in an attempt to overthrow the Afghan government and drive international troops out of the country .
Head over heels !
The Giant Panda who did a roly - poly in his sleep
It was a perfectly executed forward roll - even better for the fact that this panda managed it in his sleep .
The animal , called Tai Shan , was sitting in his zoo enclosure when he began to doze off , his eyes flickering open and shut before he succumbed to sleep and slumped forward .
The sleepy panda could have fallen flat on his face .
But instead he popped his head between his legs and turned head - over - heels before landing on his back .
It 's been a long day !
Giant Panda Tai Chan takes a doze in the midday sun
If pandas can look surprised , then four - year - old Tai Shan certainly did at that moment .
Tourists at the National Zoo in Washington DC , who saw the four - and - a - half - year - old panda roll off the kerb only to recline in the grass , were delighted by his impromptu gymnastic skills .
Easy does it !
Tai Shan leans his head on the ground and then performs a perfect roly - poly
The classic moments were caught on camera by visitor Judy Young , 61 .
Judy said : ‘ A lot of people were watching him when he just suddenly fell forward and performed this forward roll . ’
British tourist Mary Taylor , 36 , said : ‘ He kept closing his eyes to the point where he nodded off .
Close up !
Tai Shan bears his claws as he rolls off the edge of the paving
‘ He then slumped forward and I thought he was going to land flat on his face .
‘ But he must of woken himself up at the last moment because he turned it into this perfect roly - poly . ’
Eye opener : The Giant Panda wakes up to a slightly different view
Tai Shan is the only panda born at the zoo that has survived .
His parents Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were donated to the zoo by the China Research and Conservation Centre for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province .
Surrender ?
Tai Chun looks literally bowled over - but pleased to give in
His mother was artificially inseminated in 2005 after natural mating between her and Tian Tian failed .
After Tai Shan , whose name means Peaceful Mountain , was born in July 2005 , the conservation centre issued 13,000 free entry tickets for people to see him .
The tickets were all snapped up within two hours and some sold on eBay for as much as £ 300 each .
Unperturbed : Tai Chan reclines against the kerb

Pomuch ( México ) , ( EFE ) .-
Los muertos de la comunidad maya de Pomuch , en el sudeste mexicano , regresan cada año al mundo de los vivos gracias a una tradición extraña y de origen confuso por la que sus seres queridos los desentierran , limpian y miman con distintas ofrendas para mostrarles su amor y veneración .
En una insospechada vuelta de tuerca a la ya de por sí peculiar relación de los mexicanos con el más allá , esta población de 8.000 habitantes ubicada en el estado de Campeche esperaba esta semana con ilusión la llegada de la festividad del Día de Muertos , que en México se celebra los días 1 y 2 de noviembre .
" Si no lo hacemos es como olvidarnos de los nuestros , como que no existen " , afirmó a Efe Manuel Canché , un anciano de 70 años , que defiende el ritual como una muestra de amor sincero hacia sus familiares fallecidos .
Canché recuerda cómo desde niño su padre lo llevaba al cementerio para desempolvar y sacar brillo con brochas y paños a los cráneos , fémures y clavículas de sus abuelos .
Una vez aseados , los huesos son depositados en osarios o cajas de madera que ellos mismos elaboran y cuyo contenido exponen con orgullo en los distintos recovecos del cementerio de esta comunidad tropical , ubicada a 45 kilómetros al noreste de Campeche capital .
Para exhumar los cadáveres , los pobladores de Pomuch , además de guardar luto , deben esperar a que pasen tres años del fallecimiento de sus parientes .
Cumplida esa condición los orean a cielo abierto - en ocasiones después de desollarlos - y los guardan en las urnas .
Las labores de aseo , que se realizan a diario del día 26 al 31 de octubre , comienzan con el lavado de las criptas y las cajas que contienen las osamentas , seguido del recambio del mantel que envuelve los restos , cuando estos ya han sido desenterrados en años anteriores .
La tela suele llevar bordado el nombre del difunto .
Después de pulir los huesos y devolverlos a su lugar , los visitantes se preparan para compartir con sus muertos las ofrendas que les han llevado , los tradicionales tamales y el pibipollo ( mezcla de distintos tipos de carne de ave de corral envueltos en tortilla ) .
" El mantel viejo se tira y con el nuevo se cubren otra vez ; ya estando ahí , se les reza a los que ya se fueron " , explica María Candelaria López , una mujer que prepara dulce de coco como negocio ... y para sus muertos .
" Ellos también los comen " , sentencia .
Más que en ningún otro cementerio , en el de Pomuch , palabra maya que significa " lugar donde se tuestan los sapos " , se respira profundamente la muerte , aunque el hedor no es tan fuerte como uno podría imaginar pues muchas exhumaciones se llevan a cabo en distintos días del año y no solamente en estas fechas .
El origen de la tradición es incierto .
De acuerdo con los ancianos , comenzó hace décadas , en una ocasión en que el panteón se saturó con los muertos causados por una epidemia .
Otros creen que se trata de una muestra más de sincretismo entre el cristianismo y la civilización maya , que se desarrolló en el sudeste de México y parte de Centroamérica del 2.000 antes de Cristo al siglo XV .
En todo caso , hoy la exhumación de los cuerpos y su posterior colocación en urnas ofrece más espacio a los que están por morir .
Un espacio cada vez más escaso por la saturación del camposanto .
Jorge Coox Wicap , de 78 años , limpia los restos de su padre , madre y hermano , acompañado de su esposa y su nieta .
" Mi madre Eleuteria murió a los 104 años y desde hace muchos años vengo a cuidarla y a limpiarla .
Mire usted , los huesos de mi madre se están desgastando pero aquí se ve la fractura de su brazo " , dice emocionado Coox Wicap , mientras muestra la osamenta de su progenitora , que ordena con paciente cariño .
Para él este acercamiento con la muerte es natural en Pomuch , un colorido pueblo colonial que fue una importante enclave comercial a mediados del siglo XX por el paso del tren pero que hoy prácticamente permanece aislado .
" No nos da miedo , es nuestra tradición .
Aquí nadie olvida a sus muertos " , afirma .
" Aquel que no cuida a sus muertos , que no los envuelve en manteles nuevos y limpios , no es pomuchense " , considera María Escamilla en maya .
Su nieta la traduce al español .

CIA Operated Aerial Spraying Plane Carrying " Mutated " Virus Shot Down in China
Reports circulating in the Kremlin today are stating that a US government contracted airplane piloted by American CIA agents and carrying a cargo of a " mutated " swine flu virus intended for aerial spraying was shot down at China 's Shanghai Pudong airport by a saboteur team of what are believed to be Israeli Mossad soldiers seeking to prevent an American attack upon one of their Central Asian bases located in the Central Asian Nation of Kyrgyzstan .
According to Chinese media reports on this incident the stricken Zimbabwean MD - ll plane , owned by the CIA linked Avient Aviation company operated by a former British military officer named Andrew Smith and registered in the UK , killed 3 American CIA agents and injured 4 other personal who are reported to be from United States , Indonesia , Belgium and Zimbabwe .
Most interesting to note in these reports on the victims of this plane shootdown is that the Indonesian man currently being treated for his injuries has confessed  to Chinese secret police forces that he is a technician employed by the United States Navy at their mysterious Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 ( NAMRU - 2 ) located in Indonesia that Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono had previously called for the closing of because its operations were too secretive and were incompatible with Indonesias security interests . 
Even more interesting to note about this US Navy secret bio-weapons base in Indonesia ( the Worlds largest Muslim Nation ) was its establishment in cooperation with the Rockefeller Institute , especially with it being the main center for the Americans Viral Diseases Program ( VDP ) they describe as the research of epidemiologic and laboratory research on viral hemorrhagic fevers , influenza , encephalitis , and rickettsioses  and the head of this institute , David Rockefeller , long calling for a massive reduction in our Worlds population .
And to the agenda currently underway to radically change our World through the mass death of its population we need look no further for its explanation than David Rockefellers own words he spoke before the secretive Trilateral Commission in June , 1991 , when he said :
 We are grateful to The Washington Post , The New York Times , Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years .
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years .
But , the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries . 
To the United States employing planes to spread a mutated swine flu virus around the World we have further reports from China , and as we can read :
 June 26 Suspicious aircrafts were forced to land .
A US operated AN - 124 changed its call sign from civillian to military which then triggered a response from the IAF upon entering Pakistani air space , the plane was forced to land in Mumbai while the second one was forced down by Nigerian figther jets that also arrested the crew .
According to reports China ( Chinas Peoples Liberation Army Air Force ) contacted the Indian and Nigerian intelligence officials about the presence of these US operated Ukranian aircrafts amidst growing concern that the United States were spreading biological agents  in the Earths atmosphere also which some Chinese officals believed to be a attempt to mass genocide via the spread of h1n1 swine flu .
The strange thing about these reports and arrests as well as the forcing down of the planes were that these aircrafts were carrying waste disposal systems that could spray up to 45000 kg or 100 pounds of aerial type mist from sophisticated network of nano pipes that led throughout the trailing edges of the wings thereby dispersing whatever was in these tanks through a mist . 
Reports of these US planes over Ukraine have been reported as well , and as we can further read :
 Authorities in the town of Kiev , Ukraine denied any spraying of aerosolized medication by aircraft over the city .
This after it was reported that light aircrafts were seen flying over the forest market area that sprayed a aerosol substance to fight h1n1 or swine flu .
5 Sources confirms this and the local newspapers of Kiev also received hundreds of phone calls from residents and business owners close to the area the planes were spraying the suspicious substance .
Not only that but local businesses and retailers were advised to stay indoors during the day by the local authorities .
As if that is not enough , the government authorities also pushed the radio stations in Kiev to deny the reports .
Online on forums , websites and blogs reports came in about eye witness accounts that confirms this .
There was also reports of helicopters spraying aerosols over Kiev , Lviv , Ternopil and throughout Ukraine . 
Most disturbing of the effects of the spraying of this mutated swine flu virus over the Ukraine is the devastating toll it has taken on the people of that country , and as we can read :
 Almost 40 000 people got infected since yesterday in the Ukraine by what we still call the  Ukraine plague  but doctors have said recently that this is a stronger case of h1n1 or swine flu that has mutated and has that affect on the lungs where it destroys the lungs and fills it with blood . 
But , to the most horrible outcome of this mutated swine flu virus is the World Health Organization now reporting that it is killing people in France , Norway , Brazil , China , Japan , Mexico , Ukraine , and the United States as the death toll from this Global Pandemic is now reported to be nearing 8,000 and China now reporting that this deadly disease has now crossed over into dogs .
Important to also note in these reports is that the US spray plane shot down in China was reported to be targeting a secret Israeli base located in the Central Asian Nation of Kyrgyzstan , which many Ashkenazi Jews ( Ashkenazi Jews make up approximately 80 % of Jews Worldwide ) consider their spiritual homeland  after their long exile their under Soviet Communist rule , and where Russian Intelligence Analysts report the Israelis are nearing the end of their decades long deciphering of the ancient Epic of Manas manuscript ( with close to half a million lines the Epic of Manas is twenty times longer than Homers Odyssey and Iliad combined ) that they believe contains our Worlds oldest warning to our present age and which ( coincidentally ? ) agrees with the ancient Mayan peoples that the year of 2012 will see the ending of our present age .
To the final outcome of these events it is not in our knowing ; other than to state the obvious , that the truths of these things are continued to be ignored , even scoffed at , by the very people whose extermination has been longed planned by these monsters and is now being carried out , and who still have no idea whatsoever how truly easy it has become for them to be controlled by their propaganda masters .
One can only hope that they awaken before all is lost for them , the facts suggest they wont .
Writing in the Vatican newspaper , the astronomer , Father Gabriel Funes , said intelligent beings created by God could exist in outer space .
Father Funes , director of the Vatican Observatory near Rome , is a respected scientist who collaborates with universities around the world .
The search for forms of extraterrestrial life , he says , does not contradict belief in God .
Just as there are multiple forms of life on earth , so there could exist intelligent beings in outer space created by God .
And some aliens could even be free from original sin , he speculates .
Earlier this year the Vatican issued a statement acknowledging that Darwin 's theory of evolution was compatible with Christian theology .
Now the Vatican 's chief astronomer has postulated that extraterrestrial life is possible .

In the depths of northeastern India , within sight of the India - Bangladesh border , in one of the wettest places on earth , bridges are n’t built — they ’re grown .
The southern Khasi and Jaintia hills are humid and warm , crisscrossed by swift - flowing rivers and mountain streams .
On the slopes of these hills , a species of Indian rubber tree with an incredibly strong root system thrives and flourishes .
The Ficus elastica produces a series of secondary roots from higher up its trunk and can comfortably perch atop huge boulders along the riverbanks , or even in the middle of the rivers themselves .
The War - Khasis and War - Jaintias , two closely related tribes in Meghalaya , long ago noticed this tree and saw in its powerful roots an opportunity to easily cross the area ’s many rivers .
Now , whenever and wherever the need arises , they simply grow their bridges .
In order to make a rubber tree ’s roots grow in the right direction — say , over a river — the people of southern Meghalaya have used several different strategies .
Sometimes , the roots of the trees are simply pulled , tied , twisted , and encouraged by hand to merge with each other , until , over time , they form the desired architectural structure .
Root bridges have also been made by creating scaffolds out of wood and bamboo , and then training the young roots out across these temporary structures , replacing the more perishable elements many times as they rot in the intense monsoon seasons .
In some places , such as around the village of Nongriat , betel nut trunks , sliced down the middle and hollowed out , are used to create root - guidance systems .
The thin , tender roots of the rubber tree , prevented from fanning out by the betel nut trunks , grow straight out .
The trunks also have the added advantage of providing the roots with additional nutrients as they decay .
When they reach the other side of the river , they ’re allowed to take root in the soil .
Given enough time a sturdy , living bridge is produced .
The root bridges can grow for as long as the organism they are a part of remains healthy , though they can take many years to initially become functional , the length of time being dependent on local conditions such as the health of the tree , the way the bridge is being grown , and the availability of nutrients in the soil that its being grown in .
However , once root bridges become established , they ’re extraordinarily strong — strong enough that some of them can support the weight of 50 or more people at a time .
In fact , because they are alive and still growing , the bridges actually gain strength over time — and some of the ancient root bridges used daily by the people of the villages around Cherrapunji may be well over 500 years old .
The roots bridges of southern Meghalaya come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes .
They have been known to grow as long as 170 feet , and soar 80 feet above the streams they cross .
Most living root bridges only have a single span , yet several have more than one , arranged as either as two parallel spans , or as two bridges stacked one over the other , such as the famous “ Umshiang Double - Decker Root Bridge . ”
The practice of creating new living bridges , and of preserving ones already in existence , is over large parts of Southern Meghalaya slowly fading out .
In many villages across the region , the root bridges are little more than a memory .
However , since they began attracting attention again in around 2004 , local dedication to the bridges has , at least in a few places , kept them from being destroyed in favor of steel ones .
What ’s more , a few new root bridges are currently under construction .
In the village of Rangthylliang , an entirely new bridge is being grown using a bamboo and wood scaffold , and at the double - decker site in Nongriat , a new , third span is currently being grown above the other two , and should be ready for use within a decade .

Just for giggles , two panda bears played a trick on the zookeeper .
While one panda drew the zookeeper ’s attention the other panda opened the door of the cage .
Then both pandas escaped from the open door .
Scientists have a new explanation for what makes the Red Planet so red .
Recent experiments show that regular sand , when combined with black Martian basalt , takes on a reddish hue as it's crushed into dust , whether or not water or oxygen is present .
Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark claim that Mars ' red dust could have formed without the water that current hypotheses hold once covered the planet .
" Mars should really look blackish between its white polar caps , because most of the rocks at mid-latitudes are basalt , " said physicist Jonathan Merrison in a press release .
" For decades we assumed that the reddish regions on Mars are related to the water - rich early history of the planet and that , at least in some areas , water - bearing , heavily oxidized iron minerals are present . "
But when Merrison and his team mixed sand with a mineral called magnetite , found in Martian basalt , they found that mechanical stimulation alone produced a fine red dust .
To simulate sand transport on Mars , the scientists tumbled pure quartz in a hermetically sealed flask for seven months , flipping each flask 10 million times .
By the end of the experiment , 10 percent of the sand had turned to dust , and it became redder and redder with the addition of magnetite .
" Subsequent analysis of the flask material and dust has shown that the magnetite was transformed into the red mineral hematite , through a completely mechanical process without the presence of water at any stage of this process , " said Merrison , who presented the work yesterday at the European Planetary Science Congress in Germany .
Although the scientists do n't understand how the black mineral converts into the red one , they think it 's due to a chemical reaction with the eroded sand .
Because the experiment works not only in air , but also in a dry carbon dioxide atmosphere like the one on Mars , the researchers say simple grinding is a plausible explanation for how Mars got its striking color .

Heavy Boots
howell@psikey.dnet.nasa.gov
About 6 - 7 years ago , I was in a philosophy class at the University of Wisconsin , Madison ( good science / engineering school ) and the teaching assistant was explaining Descartes .
He was trying to show how things do n't always happen the way we think they will and explained that , while a pen always falls when you drop it on Earth , it would just float away if you let go of it on the Moon .
My jaw dropped a little .
I blurted `` What ?!''
Looking around the room , I saw that only my friend Mark and one other student looked confused by the TA 's statement .
The other 17 people just looked at me like `` What 's your problem ? ''
`` But a pen would fall if you dropped it on the Moon , just more slowly . ''
I protested .
`` No it would n't . '' the TA explained calmly , ``because you 're too far away from the Earth 's gravity . ''
Think .
Think .
Aha !
`` You saw the APOLLO astronauts walking around on the Moon , did n't you ? ''
I countered , ``why did n't they float away ? ''
``Because they were wearing heavy boots .'' he responded , as if this made perfect sense ( remember , this is a Philosophy TA who 's had plenty of logic classes ) .
By then I realized that we were each living in totally different worlds , and did not speak each others language , so I gave up .
As we left the room , my friend Mark was raging .
``My God !
How can all those people be so stupid ? ''
I tried to be understanding .
``Mark , they knew this stuff at one time , but it 's not part of their basic view of the world , so they 've forgotten it .
Most people could probably make the same mistake . ''
To prove my point , we went back to our dorm room and began randomly selecting names from the campus phone book .
We called about 30 people and asked each this question :
If you 're standing on the Moon holding a pen , and you let go , will it a ) float away , b ) float where it is , or c ) fall to the ground ?
You 've seen films of the APOLLO astronauts walking around on the Moon , why did n't they fall off ?
About 20 percent of the people changed their answer to the first question when they heard this one !
But the most amazing part was that about half of them confidently answered , ``Because they were wearing heavy boots . ''
I say , science education must be at an all time peak !!!

Ardent feminist ex-communist designer Miuccia Prada is handling the costumes for the Met 's upcoming production of Verdi 's opera Attila .
But according to an anonymous source on set , Prada has balked at dressing anyone who could n't fit into a sample size .
Advertisement
Attila 's non-singing supernumeraries — the opera 's extras — had been cast months ago .
But when Prada met the supernumeraries in person yesterday , the designer allegedly told the producers that there was no way she could outfit them with her costumes .
As Paper 's Peter Davis reports , a tipster says she " took one glance at the women and groaned : ' I can not clothe them !
I need models ! ' "
The Metropolitan Opera swiftly fired the non-model extras and threw together a casting for models who would take their roles .
" Employing models is ridiculous , " says Davis ' source .
" Being a supernumerary is about how you move , not how you look . "
The Met confirmed the abrupt about - face to Page Six , saying the re-casting was " due to a change in concept . "

Prada has long been a sort of intellectual hero for a certain kind of woman : those who , and I class myself among them , respect the craft , beauty , and artistry of high fashion even while being put off by its materialism , its insistence on acknowledging only the merest sliver of the world 's supply of female beauty , its pageantry of excess .
With her doctorate in international relations , her self - awareness , her covetable pretty / ugly aesthetic and obvious design chops , Prada always seemed like she got it .
The existence of someone so level - headed , so reasonable , in an industry of puffery was living proof that it was possible to love fashion without forgetting or ignoring that there are very solid grounds on which it can be criticized .
That she did not see a flat - out contradiction between being a smart woman and working in her industry was heartening .
In 2004 , she told the New Yorker " Today I am having a crisis .
And why ?
Because I can't match a dress with a pair of shoes .
I am embarrassed to say that .
But in the end I cannot forget what I do .
I make clothes .
It 's silly .
But it 's my job . "

She 's a serious art collector ; she had a slide installed in her office ; she used to be a mime .
She always sounded pretty damn cool .
So why the hell , of all people , is Miuccia Prada telling actresses to step off and let the skinny , pretty people have their jobs ?
Surely she ought to recognize that the most important part of a stage production is n't how it looks , but how all the elements come together to make the audience feel something — and while one might argue that these are " only " non-singing roles , it still seems fundamentally short - sighted and wrong - headed to institute a beauty standard for a production like Attila .
Miuccia Prada is the last person I would expect to see a roomful of women with non-model bodies as problems to be solved , rather than as people to be dressed .
And what must it say about her confidence in her own design skills that Prada balked at adjusting her designs to suit a different physical ideal ?
Consider my girlcrush canceled until further notice .

Michigan is an economic disaster zone .
No surprise there .
Its auto dependent economy has taken a huge hit and the state has a 15.2 unemployment rate .
Also not surprising is that both the state and many local municipalities are running big time budget deficits .
Years of Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations ( Former Republican Governor John Engler alone passed 32 such tax cuts ) and the state ’s revenues do n’t begin to cover its expenses .
However what is surprising – or should I say outrageous – is the solution Republican State Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop has to offer .
In an October 6 , Washington Post story he is quoted as saying Michigan needs to change its image and “ create an environment where taxes are low , labor costs are low , and not send so many negative vibes . ”
We need to send this guy packing and let him find out how great life can be on the subsistence wages he wants us to compete with .
Before the loss of almost a million industrial jobs and when many workers still earned union rates , those union wages fueled the demand that kept many businesses humming .
If the Republican Majority Leader has his way , Michigan ’s misery and job loss will increase , not decline .
Wednesday in Detroit , one day after Bishop ’s comments in the Post , 50,000 of the city ’s residents snaked around the outside of Detroit ’s Cobo Hall desperately attempting to get inside to fill out a Federal homeless prevention application .
It is a good program that came with the Federal stimulus but it is far too limited .
A maximum housing assistance of $ 3000 will be available to less than 3500 of the applicants .
Many of those attempting to get applications were out of work but many were also “ the working poor . ”
They were paid the subsistence wages that Bishop wants all of us to work for but those wages do n’t go far enough to pay the mortgage , utility , and taxes needed to keep a home – 80,000 now sit vacant in the city .
More tax cuts for the wealthy and lower wages for workers are not solutions for moving Michigan forward ; they are solutions for digging our hole deeper .
Negative vibes ?
The loudest ones I hear are from the Majority Leaders mouth .
Phoenix and federal authorities detained two Middle Eastern men accused by a passenger of acting suspiciously aboard a Phoenix - bound plane Saturday evening .
An investigation by the FBI found no evidence of a terroristic threat and the men were later released without charges .
While en route from Orlando , Fla. to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , a passenger aboard U.S. Airways Flight 192 reported that two men were acting strangely , said Suzanne Trevino , a Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman .
" The passengers alerted the flight crew and they called for law enforcement and TSA officers to meet them when the plane arrived , " Trevino said .
Once the plane arrived at Sky Harbor for its scheduled stop about 8 p.m. , the two men were met by Phoenix police , TSA and FBI officials , said Special Agent Manuel Johnson , a FBI spokesman .
The passenger told authorities the two men , described as being Middle Eastern , were speaking " loudly " in their native language .
The passenger then saw a suicide bomber on the DVD version of the movie " The Kingdom , " and one of the men reportedly got up to use the lavatory when the fasten - seatbelt sign was lit .
" The totality of those three occurrences led this passenger to believe this was suspicious , " Johnson said .
The men were cooperative with the FBI when questioned , then were later released to catch another flight to their final destination in California .
Neither was charged .
The incident delayed the inbound flight from Orlando for about an hour as authorities emptied the plane , searched luggage and swept the plane with police K - 9s to ensure nothing dangerous was left aboard .
Authorities found nothing .
Todd Lehmacher , a spokesman for Tempe - based US Airways , declined to comment on the incident and referred all questions to the TSA .
In October , US Airways settled a discrimination lawsuit for an unspecified sum in a case involving six imams who were taken from a Phoenix - bound plane from Minneapolis in November 2006 .
In that incident , passengers were alarmed that the clerics said their evening prayers in Arabic , before boarding the flight and some of the men made critical comments about the Iraq war .
The imams were handcuffed and questioned for several hours before being released without charges .
Airports nationwide have beefed up security since Christmas Day , when a Nigerian man allegedly attempted to blow up Northwest Flight 253 in Detroit .
Federal authorities said the device Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , tried to detonate malfunctioned and he suffered significant burns to his legs .
" We definitely want the public to be vigilant to report information , but we do n't agree with racial profiling , " Johnson said .
" What is suspicious to one person could mean something else to another . "
Racial profiling can be counterproductive , said Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper in a statement released Sunday .
" While everyone supports robust airline security measures , racial and religious profiling are in fact counterproductive and can lead to a climate of insecurity and fear , " Hooper said in the statement .
CAIR describes itself the nation 's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization .
Do blondes get picked up more than brunettes ?
The question can be taken literally , as evidenced in psychologist Nicolas Gueguen ’s latest study * on female hitchhikers .
A specialist in the nuances of courtship and attraction , Gueguen wanted to know if a woman is more likely to be offered a ride or other assistance if she goes blond .
All else being equal , do light - haired hitchhikers get more lifts ?
Gurguen recruited five women in their early twenties ( all natural brunettes ) to stand , one at a time , by the side of a road popular with hitchhikers in France .
Their job was to try to get motorists to pull over .
Each woman was equipped with three wigs , blond , brunette , and black , which she was instructed to rotate every time forty cars had passed .
When a car stopped , she ( and two independent observers ) kept a record of what color wig she was wearing and whether the driver was male or female .
Drivers prefer blondes , it turns out .
Blond hair , compared with brown or black hair , inspired a statistically larger proportion of drivers to stop and offer assistance ( 18 % for blondes vs 14 % and 13 % for brunettes and women with black hair respectively ) .
Interestingly , this was true only of male drivers .
Female drivers , who stopped less frequently for hitchhikers , showed no hair color bias .
Gueguen attributes a greater attractiveness of blond hair color to men ’s willingness to help blondes .
As described in BLONDES , blond hair may be associated with female youth , health , and fertility .
Because fair - haired hitchhikers may appear younger , they may come across as more vulnerable or less of a threat .
Blond hair is also more eye - catching than other shades , so drivers may be more likely to notice blond hitchhikers .
But why would more male than female drivers offer rides to blondes if sexual attraction did n’t have something to do with it ?
For various reasons , slightly more drivers appear to prefer blondes .
But are they gentlemen ?
That remains in question .
***
Nicolas Gueguen ’s studies are good fun .
In BLONDES I reported on his fascinating research on the power of touch in a courtship context .
I ’ve also blogged about Gurguen ’s studies on whether makeup is more likely to attract men ; whether dog owners attract more dates ( and whether breed makes a difference ) ; how priming men to think about love changes their behavior ; whether asking a woman a small favor makes her more likely to give him her number later ; and whether cup size helps a female hitchhikers get picked up .

Now that we ’ve looked at the layers of asset management , let ’s reflect upon the key points and see how we can improve our existing engine and pipelines .
Each of these questions targets a specific part of the asset pipeline that deserve consideration .
By reflecting on these points you can see ways to improve your own asset pipeline and workflow .
Runtime
Are shared assets duplicated unnecessarily ?
Are instanced assets handled efficiently ?
With minimal overhead and waste ?
Do you support generated ( procedural ) assets seamlessly ?
Are you wasting memory on strings or filenames ?
Do you avoid unnecessary loading or reloading between levels ?
Processing
Are you processing data to make runtime asset management more efficient ?
Do you pack referenced assets together for faster loading ?
Do you optimize disc layout based on asset usage ?
( Duplicate data , sort of dependency graph , etc )
Content & Workflow
Is your source data versioned ?
Can you re-create a previous version of your data ?
Can you identify who last changed an asset ?
And why ?
Are your tools integrated with your asset management system ?
How many steps are required by a user to add a new asset ?
How many to update or tweak an asset ?
How long does it take to view a data change in game ?
The local police chief in Ozark , Arkansas is standing behind one of his officers who tasered a 10 - year - old girl who was refusing to go to bed .
The bizarre story is laid out in a police incident report obtained by website The Smoking Gun .
Officer Dustin Bradshaw was called to the home by a woman complaining that her daughter was being unruly and refusing to go to sleep .
Bradshaw wrote that when he arrived at the home , he found Kiara Medlock " balled up in ( sic ) the floor crying and screaming . "
After watching her mother attempt to get Kiara into the bathtub with little success , Bradshaw took the girl into the living room and threatened her with jail .
That did n't settle things down .
At some point , Bradshaw claims Kiara 's mother told him to " taser her if I needed to . "
Bradshaw then tried to handcuff Kiara .
But he could n't manage that either .
To hear Bradshaw tell it , he was now in the midst of a full - on brawl on the living - room floor with Kiara , a Grade 5 student .
The 65 - pounder was " verbally combative ... struck me with her legs and feet in the groin , " Bradshaw wrote .
That 's when he reached for his holster and delivered a " very very ( sic ) brief drive stun to her back with my taser . "
Unsurprisingly , Kiara 's struggling stopped immediately .
Bradshaw then cuffed her and carried her to his squad car , since she could no longer walk .
The incident hit the news when Kiara 's father , Anthony Medlock , took exception .
Medlock does not live with Kiara 's mother .
" I want to know how the heck in God 's green earth can they get away with this ...
If you can't pick the kid up and take her to your car , handcuff her , then I do n't think you need to be an officer , " Medlock told local Ozark 40 / 29 news .
He said his daughter has shown signs of emotional issues , but she " does n't deserve to be treated like a dog . "
The local police chief stood behind Bradshaw and his decision .
" He had no other choice .
He had to get the child under control , " said Ozark police Chief Jim Noggle .
No disciplinary action is pending against Bradshaw .
However , the Associated Press has reported that the FBI has dispatched agents to Arkansas to investigate .
Medlock said he will attempt to gain sole custody of his daughter .

Parenting tip of the day : Do n't resort to Tasering
Four people have been arrested in Peru on suspicion of killing some 60 people to sell their fat and other human tissue to Italian co-conspirators for cosmetic use in Europe , authorities say .
The suspects were arrested in central Peru this month and a search is underway for seven others - including two Italian citizens whose names were not revealed - lead prosecutor Jorge Sans Quiroz said .
The fat was purchased " to be commercialised in European [ cosmetology ] laboratories , " he said .
The prosecutor 's indictment said the gang allegedly targeted farmers and indigenous people on remote Andean roads , tricking them by offering them jobs before killing them .
One reported killing took place in mid-September to remove human tissue for trafficking .
The trafficking network could be linked to 60 individual disappearances in the central Andean region , although the ties could not be confirmed .
Police began arrests after discovering early this month a container with human fat that was being shipped to Lima from the Andean city of Huanuco , some 400 kilometres north - east of Lima .
Signs of " an international network trafficking human fat " first surfaced about two months ago , according to General Felix Burga , head of the police criminal division .
Peruvian press cited him as saying the fat can be sold for $ US15,000 ( $ 16,325 ) per gallon in European countries .
The alleged plot revived the Andean legend of the Pishtacos , white foreigners who were said to suck the fat out of people travelling on lonely roads at night , making fine soaps , lubricants , healing salves and beauty creams out of the tissue .

New privacy settings in Facebook .
Facebook hopes people will now get comfortable sharing even more information as notifications on the site are made public across on the internet for the first time .
Privacy advocates still worry that users will expose too much about themselves , inadvertently or not .
It remains to be seen whether the shift will mean fewer surprises for people who have unintentionally shared party photos with their bosses .
“ We 'll be recommending that you make available to everyone a limited set of information that helps people find and connect with you , information like ' About Me ' and where you work or go to school .
For more sensitive information , like photos and videos in which you 've been tagged and your phone number , we 'll be recommending a more restrictive setting , ” said Facebook product manager Ruchi Sanghyi .
As part of the changes , Facebook users will be able to select a privacy setting for each piece of content , such as photos or updates , that they share on the site - as they share it .
The choices are " friends " only , " friends of friends " or " everyone " , which means not just Facebook users but everyone on the internet .
( The exception : minors wo n't be able to share their content with everyone .
For people under 18 , the " everyone " setting will send information to " friends of friends " . )
Facebook 's privacy overhaul .
There is also an option to customise groups of friends - such as " college buddies " - for certain kinds of updates .
Jules Polonetsky , co-chairman and director at the Future of Privacy Forum think tank in Washington , praised how this process resembles the way people decide what to share in their day - to - day lives .
He said putting the controls " when you need it , right there , is far better than putting it in a ' privacy ' or ' help ' location " somewhere on the site .
Some privacy advocates said the overhaul would actually reduce the amount of control Facebook users have over personal data .
Their lists of friends and pages they are fans of will now be easily viewable by the public , for instance .
That is troubling because " even something as seemingly innocuous as your list of friends can reveal a great deal about you " , Kevin Bankston , senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , wrote in a blog post .
While it is still possible to hide your list of friends from the public , the setting is hard to find , which goes against Facebook 's aim of simplifying the privacy settings , he noted .
" Facebook is nudging the settings toward the ' disclose everything ' position .
That 's not fair from the privacy perspective , " said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
Rotenberg said his organisation was evaluating Facebook 's new privacy changes to see if they were deceptive .
" Let me put it this way , right now we 're taking a lot of screenshots ( of Facebook ) , " Rotenberg said , when asked if his group might file a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission .
Facebook is also getting rid of its geographic networks , because many of them - take " New York " or " Australia " - have become too big .
There were 5.7 million people in the London network , for example .
If users were previously part of such a geographic network , this location will now be listed in their profiles under " current city " .
Other networks , for schools and workplaces , are staying .
The changes have no effect on advertising on the site , said Elliot Schrage , vice - president of global communications and public policy at Facebook .
But he added that , by giving users such granular control over the content they share , Facebook is encouraging more sharing and a greater connection to the site .
" If users feel more confident with our service , they will use our service more , " he said .
" And the more they use our services the more benefits we derive . "

Fike has always had the talent to create art .
Being a lifelong hockey fan living in South Florida during the Panthers ’ best years , Rian loved Upper Deck ’s challenge of drawing your own card for an upcoming hockey release .
When Rian submitted his artwork to Upper Deck , he ’d never imagined being selected among the winners .
As it turns out , Upper Deck loved his piece and threw it into their 1999 - ’00 M.V.P release as a short print .
Along with winning the contest , they also sent him 60 copies of the card for his personal collection .
Well , it ’s been a decade and Rian is now a Miami - Dade school teacher and avid comic book fan / collector .
That huge lot of his card Upper Deck sent is all gone , thanks to being way too generous and handing them out to friends and family all over the world .
Rian is dying to get his hands on a card and Wax Heaven is going to try to help .
If you can find at least five copies of the card from any resource , you can pick a total of 5 cards from my recent Bowman Sterling break .
Before writing this blog , Rian was able to find two copies on Sportsbuy for less than two quarters so as you can see , it ’s not the price that ’s holding him back .
I sent Upper Deck a message asking if they knew the print run .
They have yet to make a comment .
What we do know is that the ‘ You Draw the Card ’ inserts were seeded just once in every 144 packs of M.V.P.

Unless you go to PAX or hang out on a school bus , finding friends to play PSP games with is a difficult endeavor .
Sony hopes to rectify this by bringing its adhocParty app to the United States .
Hooking up Japanese gamers since last year , the software allows gamers to use their PlayStation 3 to connect with other gamers online .
PSP's ad hoc wireless gameplay requires players to be in close proximity to another PSP owner to play together , but with the adhocParty software , players can hook up online instead .
This service will only be available for select games , so do n't go dusting off all your old UMDs quite yet .
Sony has confirmed that Gran Turismo and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite will work with the service .
According to the PlayStation blog , the application will soon be available as a free download in the PlayStation Store .
Providing this kind of enhanced interoperability is exactly the kind of thing Sony needs to be doing now to strengthen its brand , especially considering how poorly the PSP has been performing lately .
If Sony wants to keep the momentum it gained last month with sales of the PS3 and Uncharted 2 ( and see some of that business bleed over to their portable division ) it had better have more upgrades like this up its sleeve .

Maple Leaf defenceman Mike Komisarek will miss at least three weeks with a torn quadriceps muscle , opening the door for rookie defenceman Carl Gunnarson .
" Komisarek has a small tear in his muscle in his quad , so he 's probably going to miss three weeks , " said Leaf coach Ron Wilson .
Komisarek has been put on injured reserve .
The defenceman hurt himself Saturday in Toronto's 5 - 1 win , leaving the game early in the third period after colliding with Kris Draper .
Komisarek did n't practice Sunday or Monday , but returned against Minnesota on Tuesday night , playing less than three minutes before leaving the game .
Gunnarson took in Thursday 's practice from the bench , dressed in his civilian clothes .
He was unable to work out with the team for bookkeeping reasons .
" Carl 's played really well , " said Wilson .
" He 's had a great camp and he 's played well for the Marlies . "
Wilson said Gunnarson wo n't play Friday night in Chicago , but would likely get a chance to play while Komisarek is hurt .
The Leafs also sent lightly - used winger Jay Rosehill to the Toronto Marlies on a two - week conditioning assignment .
Rosehill , who has played only six games , cannot be permanently assigned to the Marlies without clearing waivers first .
Gunnarson has two assists and is a minus - 2 in 12 games with the Marlies this season .
He was the last defenceman cut from the Leafs in training camp .

Northern
White rhinos are sub-species of the White rhino Four rare Northern
White rhinos have been flown from a Czech zoo to Kenya , in a desperate attempt to save the species from extinction .
Animal experts hope the rhinos - two males and two females - will breed in their natural habitat in Africa .
Only eight Northern
White rhinos are known to survive worldwide , all of them in captivity : six in the Czech Republic and two in the US .
The last four living in the wild in Africa have not been seen since 2006 .
' Dangerous ' plan On Sunday , the four rhinos from the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic were packed into crates and loaded onto a Boeing 747 bound for the Ol Pejeta reserve in central Kenya as part of the " Last Chance to Survive " project .
Moving them [ the rhinos ] now is a last - bid effort to save them and their gene pool from total extinction
Rob Brett , IUCN
" We plan to give the remaining individuals with breeding potential their last chance of normal and regular reproduction in a secure location in the wild , " said zoo director Dana Holeckova .
Rob Brett , member of the African Rhino Specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , said : " Moving them now is a last - bid effort to save them and their gene pool from total extinction . "
" They are listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and are thought to be extinct in the wild , " he added .
Attempts at Dvur Kralove to breed the animals have produced just one offspring in 10 years : a female rhino was born in 2000 and later dubbed the zoo's " millennium child " .
It is now hoped that returning the rhinos to their natural habitat in Kenya will make the females more fertile and the males more interested .
However , the European Association of Zoos ( EAZA ) has expressed concerns that years in captivity makes the undertaking dangerous and unpredictable , the BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says .
Defenders of the plan reject that , saying they believe the animals ' genetic memory will quickly take over , our correspondent adds .

The view from Betty Kermanian ’s Westwood - area backyard changes every few seconds .
Through the leafy limbs of a tree in front of her house , the stars of “ Sherlock Holmes ” -- Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law -- peer down from a luminescent Clear Channel digital billboard that towers over nearby Santa Monica Boulevard .
Seconds later , Kiefer Sutherland flashes his gun in an ad for “ 24 . ”
Also in the mix are four iterations of midriff - baring vixens selling an H&M line of lacy black bras and silk kimonos .
Living with the sign over the last two years , Kermanian has routinely drawn the shades in her front rooms .
She even moved three maples from the backyard to a spot outside her dining room window to block the flickering pink and purple beams that change the color of her walls .
“ It ’s so tacky , it looks like it ’s Las Vegas , ” Kermanian said on a recent evening as she watched the ads rotate from her yard .
When she entertains guests , “ they just ca n’t believe it , ” she said .
“ You ’re sitting in a nice residential area and there ’s this digital thing changing colors all the time . ”

Kermanian is not alone in her disquiet about digital billboards .
A bright Disneyland billboard off the 101 near Universal Studios has angered some Hollywood Hills residents , who say it has spoiled their views and cast an aqua glow over trees and homes .
And Angelenos in Venice and Silver Lake have voiced similar objections about signs in their neighborhoods .
With a recent court ruling , they now see an opportunity to pressure the Los Angeles City Council to pull the plug on at least the signs that disrupt their peace and quiet .
The 92 digital signs began popping up several years ago after Los Angeles struck a deal with two billboard companies , Clear Channel Outdoor and CBS Outdoor , which had sued the city over its earlier sign regulations .
The 2006 agreement , negotiated by former City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo , allowed Clear Channel Outdoor and CBS Outdoor to modernize up to 840 billboards in exchange for removing 98 -- 3 % of their inventory .
The City Council approved the deal , but a number of council members have said they did not grasp the effect it would have on some of their constituents .
Last year billboard competitor Summit Media sued the city , alleging that the 2006 settlement in effect exempted the two companies from city zoning laws that other firms were required to follow
In November , Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green ruled in favor of Summit and invalidated the agreement .

But Green said it was up to the city to determine whether to revoke the permits for the Clear Channel and CBS digital billboards .
Councilmen Paul Koretz and Bill Rosendahl immediately called for converting all of the brightly lit signs back to traditional billboards , while council President Eric Garcetti and Councilman Ed Reyes proposed studying whether the signs should be modified or demolished .
But CBS and Clear Channel appealed the ruling -- putting a stay on Green ’s order .
Meanwhile , council members have asked city officials to evaluate their legal options .
At public hearings , business groups have argued that reneging on the 2006 settlement would send the chilling message that no one can rely on city commitments .
Representatives from billboard companies have noted that the modernized signs represent just a fraction of the thousands of billboards across Los Angeles .
In January , city officials began a block - by - block inventory , and so far they have counted 6,200 billboard structures ( with a total of more than 9,000 sign faces -- some structures have ads on both front and back .
Of the 92 digital signs that are operational , 13 belong to CBS Outdoor and 79 to Clear Channel Outdoor , city records show .
Though residents sent several dozen e-mails to council members urging them to take down the digital billboards after Green ’s ruling , a building and safety official said his department received just half a dozen formal requests to test the brightness of digital billboards .
In all of them , the signs met the city ’s lighting standards .

Ryan Brooks , vice president of government affairs at CBS Outdoor , said his company has received a small number of sign complaints .
“ We were very cautious and deliberate in where we chose to place our signs , ” Brooks said .
“ We spent a lot of time to make sure we did n’t create any problems . ”
Clear Channel Outdoor declined to comment , citing litigation .
But Laura W. Brill , an attorney for Clear Channel and CBS , told council members in a Nov. 16 letter that “ contrary to the strident complaints of a small but vocal group of neighborhood activists . . . the majority of Los Angeles residents appreciate the special qualities of digital signs . ”
Some residents scoff at that notion and have taken matters into their own hands .
In Westwood , several homeowner groups joined forces with the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight .
They have challenged the validity of the permits for three digital billboard displays -- two on South Westwood Boulevard and one on West Santa Monica Boulevard , near Kermanian ’s home -- in an effort to get them taken down .

Although residents are concerned about preserving the character of their neighborhoods , Barbara Broide , president of the Westwood South of Santa Monica Blvd .
Homeowners Assn. , said her group also took up the fight because members worry that the digital signs have lowered property values .
“ If you had a choice of buying a home , would you buy a home that had one of these things in your backyard ? ” Broide said .
The groups waited more than six months before a zoning administrator heard the cases and another five months for decisions .
The administrator ruled for the homeowners groups on the two Westwood Boulevard signs .
In the decisions , she wrote that before the city issued the permits , a planning official should have determined whether the modernized billboards violated two neighborhood plans barring signs that flash , move or have the appearance of movement .
Clear Channel and CBS are appealing those decisions .
In the third case , members of the Comstock Hills Homeowners Assn. argued that the placement of the digital sign on Santa Monica Boulevard was improper because the roadway is a designated scenic highway .
Advertisement
And they marshaled testimony from residents unhappy with the brightness and the sound created by the billboards .
Among them was Jean Bushnell , who bought a white - noise machine to drown out the digital sign ’s cooling fans .
Bushnell likens the fans ’ noise in the summer months to the drone of an airplane or the rumble of a truck engine .
The zoning administrator did not find problems with the permit , a decision the groups are appealing .
In the Hollywood Hills , residents unhappy with the Disneyland billboard on Barham Boulevard , which is owned by CBS Outdoor , turned to their neighborhood council president for help .
Judy Marlin , who bought her home some 30 years ago largely because of the mountain view from its bank of windows , said the appearance of the sign shocked her and many neighbors .
“ I looked out and there was what looked like a gigantic television screen in the middle of the view , ” Marlin said .
“ We just ca n’t believe we went to bed one night and there was this sign and we had nothing to say about it . ”

Marlin and others relied on the personal connections of Anastasia Mann , president of the Hollywood Hills West Neighborhood Council , who persuaded a Disney executive to have the sign turned off between midnight and sunrise .
Garcetti , the City Council president , has proposed that over the next few weeks , officials conduct a series of meetings with the sign companies to see if some of the digital displays can be moved out of residential neighborhoods .
And Councilman Tom LaBonge , who represents the area that has the Disneyland billboard , said he wants to see that sign unplugged .
“ It would be great if we could turn back the clock , ” he said .

Coked up on prescription smack
( Natural News )
On the heels of the sudden death of celebrity actress Brittany Murphy ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027781_Brittany_M... ) , people are once again raising the question of just how dangerous prescription drugs might really be .
Some are arguing , however , that street drugs are the real danger , not prescription drugs .
But the following study demonstrates why prescription drugs are far more dangerous than illegal recreational drugs .
According to a new study conducted by physicians at St. Michael 's Hospital and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) in Toronto , the number of deaths due to prescription opioid use has doubled between 1991 and 2004 .
Following the introduction of oxycodone into Toronto 's drug formulary in 2000 , there has been a 500 % increase in deaths due to the drugs .
Researchers reviewed over 7,000 files from the Office of the Chief Coroner in Ontario and found that between the years of 1991 and 2004 , , representing about one - third of the opioid prescriptions given in 2006 .
( This is the largest prescription increase among all opioid drugs . )
Following the addition of this drug into the provincial drug benefit plan in 2000 , deaths from opioid usage rose by 41 percent .
Shockingly , .
The vast majority of people who died from opioids had visited their doctor and received a prescription for the drug within a month of their death .
The total number of opioid - related deaths in Toronto in 2004 is estimated to be 27.2 per million people .
Study authors said they hope to shed light on the tremendous dangers associated with prescription opioid drugs .
It 's the dirty little secret of the pharmaceutical industry : .
And that probably even includes all the shootings of gang bangers in northern Mexico .
Prescription drug abuse is now more common than street drug abuse -- by far !
And yet Big Pharma rakes in huge profits from all the patient addictions to their opioids .
And by " opioids " , what I mean is .
They are , in fact , one and the same .
So of all the drug addicts in America today , you can divide them into two camps : 1) People addicted to street drugs .
2 ) People addicted to prescription drugs .
The people in group # 1 ( street drugs ) are taken to jail where they are given prison sentences .
People in group # 2 ( prescription drugs ) are taken to their doctor where they are given prescription refills .
It 's all really the same narcotics , it 's just that one group is legal and the other is illegal .
And what really determines whether a particular narcotic is legal or illegal ?.
If Big Pharma makes money off the narcotics , they 're considered Big Pharma , you see , earns tens of billions of dollars each year from drug addicts .
And just by coincidence , it turns out that their prescription narcotics are , guaranteeing repeat business .
The business model is so dang lucrative , you might think they were drug dealers ...
Why do you think the main sponsors for theare the drug companies themselves ?
It 's because .
By keeping up the so - called " War on Drugs " front , the pharmaceutical industry can make sure it dominates the market for narcotics .
After all , if you 're going to feed narcotics to a nation full of junkies , why not make a hefty profit on it ?
That 's the thinking of drug companies , it seems , as they have done basically zilch to effectively stem the abuse of their own prescription narcotics .
Much like the tobacco companies , drug companies secretly want people to be addicted to their products .
You know me as James Chartrand of Men with Pens , a regular Copyblogger contributor for just shy of two years .
And yet , I ’m a woman .
This is not a joke or an angle or an analogy — I ’m literally a woman .
This is my story .
Once upon a time , I found myself having to make some hard decisions .
The welfare application was on my kitchen table .
It was filled out and signed , waiting for me to bring it to the people who would decide whether I ’d be able to make rent next month or put food on the table .
I hated looking at it .
I did n’t want to be in this situation .
I ’d thought that when you start over , make a clean break , life was supposed to get better , right ?
But here I was , out of money and out of choices .
I had two young daughters to take care of .
I was single and alone , having left an unhealthy relationship , and I was living in a crappy , tiny apartment .
I ’d used up my savings trying to make ends meet , supplementing as best I could with the money I earned from a dangerous part - time job that gave me all of 4 hours pay a week at minimum wage .
I had been looking for a better job , but there were none to be had in the low - income / high - unemployment area where I lived .
And I could n’t get a full - time job anyway — I was still on the waiting list for a spot in daycare .
How did I get here ?
It was ironic .
I ’d once had a respectable , safe job in a corporate office .
I ’d had the nice salary , the paid vacations , the opportunity for advancement .
I had formal education , diplomas , brains , and skills , and life had been good .
Now it was n’t .
My older daughter told me she could look for work to help pay the bills .
She was 12 .
As a last - ditch resort , I turned to the internet .
There must be something I could do .
There must be jobs out there . . . maybe in writing .
I was a good writer .
And sure enough , there was writing work for me on the ‘ net , work I could do from home that paid quickly .
I signed up with the company , thinking I was so lucky to have this chance to pull myself out of the mess .
I struggled to get gigs — there was tough competition from more experienced hustlers .
When I did manage to grab a job before someone else could , I worked hard and wrote well .
I wanted to do my best .
I earned $ 1.50 an article .
I averaged $ 8 a week .
I was treated like crap , too .
Bossed around , degraded , condescended to , with jibes made about my having to work from home .
I quickly learned not to mention I had kids .
I quickly learned not to mention I worked from my kitchen table .
I quickly learned that this sucked .
So I started looking for better gigs and clients , now that I knew there was writing work to be had .
I scoured Craigslist and job sites and gig auctions and sent applications to all sorts of people .
And it worked .
I started getting real clients , for real pay .
I was earning more , feeling good .
I even began hiring people to work with me as a team .
But . . . it still was n’t really working
I had high - quality skills and a good education .
I was fast on turnaround and very professional .
I hustled and I delivered on my promises , every single time .
I worked hard and built the business , putting in long hours and reinvesting a lot of the money I made .
I really , really wanted to make this work .
But I was still having a hard time landing jobs .
I was being turned down for gigs I should ’ve gotten , for reasons I could n’t put a finger on .
My pay rate had hit a plateau , too .
I knew I should be earning more .
Others were , and I soaked up everything they could teach me , but still , there was something strange about it . . .
It was n’t my skills , it was n’t my work .
So what were those others doing that I was n’t ?
One day , I tossed out a pen name , because I did n’t want to be associated with my current business , the one that was still struggling to grow .
I picked a name that sounded to me like it might convey a good business image .
Like it might command respect .
My life changed that day
Instantly , jobs became easier to get .
There was no haggling .
There were compliments , there was respect .
Clients hired me quickly , and when they received their work , they liked it just as quickly .
There were fewer requests for revisions — often none at all .
Customer satisfaction shot through the roof .
So did my pay rate .
And I was thankful .
I finally stopped worrying about how I would feed my girls .
We were warm .
Well - fed .
Safe .
No one at school would ever tease my kids about being poor .
I was still bringing in work with the other business , the one I ran under my real name .
I was still marketing it .
I was still applying for jobs — sometimes for the same jobs that I applied for using my pen name .
I landed clients and got work under both names .
But it was much easier to do when I used my pen name .
Understand , I had n’t advertised more effectively or used social media — I had n’t figured that part out yet .
I was applying in the same places .
I was using the same methods .
Even the work was the same .
In fact , everything was the same .
Except for the name .
The answer was plain .
Without really thinking much about it , I tried an experiment when I chose my new pseudonym :
I became a man ( in name only )
Taking a man ’s name opened up a new world .
It helped me earn double and triple the income of my true name , with the same work and service .
No hassles .
Higher acceptance .
And gratifying respect for my talents and round - the - clock work ethic .
Business opportunities fell into my lap .
People asked for my advice , and they thanked me for it , too .
Did I quit promoting my own name ?
Hell yeah .
Eventually , I had earned enough income and credibility to get a mortgage , and I bought a tiny , modest house for me and my kids in a quiet town near my mum .
It was the first home of my life I could truly call my own , paid for by long hours and hard work .
Paid for by my own sweat and tears , at the tender age of 37 .
It ’s nothing new
Using a male pseudonym when you ’re a woman is n’t anything new .
Writers have been doing it for centuries .
George Eliot , George Sand , Isak Dinesen .
Even the Brontë sisters , championed today , wrote as Currer , Ellis , and Acton Bell back in their time .
Why did they do it ?
To have their work accepted , because women were n’t supposed to be writers .
Their work had a much better chance if their audience did n’t have to get over initial skepticism that a woman could write at all , much less do it well .
Since then , we ’ve had feminism .
We have the right to vote , to own property , to be members of Parliament and Congress , to get a job , and to be the main breadwinner of the family .
And yet apparently we have n’t gotten past those 19th century stigmas .
The evidence was right there in front of me .
I never wanted to be an activist , or to fight the world .
I ’m not interested in clawing my way up a ladder to a glass ceiling .
Life ’s too short for that .
I just want to earn a living and be respected for my skills .
I want my kids to be happy and have access to what they need .
I want them to go to university and have good opportunities in life .
When it started to take off
I really did n’t think any of this would ever happen , to be honest .
The blog I ’d started to get some clients and show off my skills ?
For a long time , so few people read it that weeks would go by without a single comment .
But things changed .
Slowly at first , but then all of a sudden they picked up speed .
There were more comments on the blog , and more again .
I did n’t overthink it — I just answered them and kept on blogging to earn clients .
Then my blog hit Michael Stelzner ’s list of the Top Ten Blogs for Writers .
The flood of people who came to visit was overwhelming .
And they liked what I wrote .
And I thought to myself , “ Oh shit .
What do I do now ? ”
What I did next
I was in too deep to back down , too survival - minded to do anything but go forward , and , quite honestly , too scared I ’d lose everything I ’d worked so hard to build .
So I did n’t do anything at all .
I did n’t really know what to do .
I thought about it a lot , though .
And logic told me that the loss of my real name was a small concession for the ability to be able to support my family and ensure their financial security for years to come .
Truth be told , if just a name and perception of gender creates such different levels of respect and income for a person , it says a lot more about the world than it does about me .
Why am I telling my story now ?
Well , people talk .
For three years , I ’ve kept my true name and gender pretty tightly under wraps and only confided in a tiny handful of people I trusted .
But there was always that risk that someone , someday , would end up spilling the beans .
And for years I sat braced for that moment .
And sure enough , someone I trusted got mad and decided to out me .
( Someone who , incidentally , was using a male pseudonym and identity too .
Go figure . )
Here ’s the thing .
My life , my terms .
No one handed me anything .
I ’ve worked damned hard for this .
I took care of myself and my family , and I ’ve given the best of my creativity and knowledge to each of my clients and my readers .
I ’d like to keep doing that .
P.S .
Oh , my real name ?
Well , I never really wanted that revealed , totally apart from the gender issue .
I know better than most how quickly and profoundly revealing just a tiny bit of personal information can affect ( and even destroy ) people ’s lives .
I have kids .
I ’m not interested in making myself vulnerable in that way .
So please .
Just call me James .
( Author ’s note : I have to extend my thanks to Kelly for the help she gave me with the original draft of this post .
Her kindness made a difficult task so much easier . )
The first priority of Central Bankers in any crisis is to buy time by any method available .
By now , it should be perfectly clear that Central Bankers are willing to unconstitutionally usurp authority in an effort to buy that time .
I talked about that idea most recently in Hussman Accuses the Fed and Treasury of " Unconstitutional Abuse of Power "
Hussman : " The policy of the Fed and Treasury amounts to little more than obligating the public to defend the bondholders of mismanaged financial companies , and to absorb losses that should have been borne by irresponsible lenders .
From my perspective , this is nothing short of an unconstitutional abuse of power , as the actions of the Fed ( not to mention some of Geithner 's actions at the Treasury ) ultimately have the effect of diverting public funds to reimburse private losses , even though spending is the specifically enumerated power of the Congress alone .
Needless to say , I emphatically support recent Congressional proposals to vastly rein in the power ( both statutory and newly usurped ) of the Federal Reserve . "
Fed Uncertainty Principle
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Four :
The Fed simply does not care whether its actions are illegal or not .
The Fed is operating under the principle that it 's easier to get forgiveness than permission .
And forgiveness is just another means to the desired power grab it is seeking .

Bank of England Props Up RBS , HBOS at Height of Crisis
Mervyn King , the Bank ’s governor , said the central bank stepped in as a lender of last resort to provide a bridging loan before the Government rescued the two institutions .
The banks put up collateral worth more than £ 100bn in return for the loans as the financial system was rocked by the failure of Lehman Brothers , the Wall Street bank .
Mr King , appearing at a Treasury Select Committee hearing on the Bank ’s November Inflation report , said the loans were granted because “ this was a dire emergency " .
" It was very effective in buying time , ” he said .
Details of the Emergency Liquidity Assistance ( ELA ) for the banks were revealed in a Submission to the Treasury Select Committee .
Mr King repeated his argument that no bank should be deemed “ too big to fail . ”
Preposterous Statements by Mervyn King
Discerning Truth From Fiction
Mr King on the world 's global imbalances :
" I think the point that really does trouble me is the speed at which the imbalances in the world economy are likely to adjust .
As the level of output in the world starts to grow again , my concern is that the imbalances will start to emerge again .
" I have no doubt that as those imbalances become large again , that will create pressure for protectionism to build up . "
" It behooves the Treasury and the Bank to do a contingency plan for what kind of private sector assets you would buy , and how . "
Honesty Amongst Thieves
Secret Loans Disclosed
In a shock announcement , the Bank disclosed that it had been forced to use its lender of last resort facility last October to " buy time " for RBS and HBOS , which were " effectively ... bust " .
It managed to keep the loans - the equivalent of almost £ 3,000 for every household in the UK - a complete secret to all but a handful in the City for well over a year .
Most remarkable , however , was the fact that the Bank managed to lend such a sum without it being detected by market participants or by the media - although rumours did abound at the time .
The loan facilities , of £ 36.6 bn for RBS and £ 25.4bn for HBOS , were in addition to the hundreds of billions provided to the banking system in the form of guarantees , liquidity support and recapitalisation funds .
Through them , the Bank was also quietly injecting cash into the economy some six months before it started quantitative easing .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said : " The scale of these loans raises the question of how Labour 's tripartite regulatory structure allowed these banks to come so close to collapse in the first place , and underlines the need for fundamental reform to put the Bank of England back in charge . "
Pray Tell , What Is The Fed Hiding ?
An Admitted Mugging
Lloyds TSB shareholders were “ mugged ” when the bank agreed to buy HBOS last year without knowing that the stricken lender was being propped up by a secret £ 25 bn loan , it was claimed on Wednesday .
Alistair Darling , the chancellor , was forced on to the defensive as he gave a Commons statement explaining the decision to keep secret the combined £ 61.6 bn of emergency funds given to HBOS and RBS last year .
Although Lloyds shareholders were told that HBOS would have to “ substantially rely for the forseeable future ” on Bank of England liquidity support , they only found out on Tuesday the true extent of the stricken bank ’s problems .
Lloyds bought HBOS at the height of the banking crisis in a deal facilitated by Gordon Brown , who waived competition rules to allow the merger to take place .
Eric Daniels , Lloyds chief executive , later admitted that his bank could have escaped being part - nationalised in October 2008 had it not been for the liabilities it assumed when it bought HBOS .
“ It is plain that the workers and shareholders of Lloyds were mugged , ” said Jim Cousins , a Labour MP .
But Mr Darling disowned any responsibility for the fact that Lloyds shareholders were kept in the dark about the emergency loans at the time of the HBOS merger , saying it was “ fairly and squarely ” a matter for the Lloyds board .
My Dear Darling ...
Place No Trust in Central Bankers
Faber : “ No decent citizen should trust the Federal Reserve for one second .
It ’s very important that everyone own some gold because the government will make the dollar ( in the long term ) useless . "
Mish :
No decent citizen should trust any central bank anywhere .
The problems go far beyond the Fed and in the long run all fiat currencies are worthless .
Fiat currencies do not float , instead they all sink at varying rates .
As the unemployment rate surged to 10.2 percent in October , reaching double digits for the first time in 26 years , it suddenly seemed possible that the nation might yet confront the worst joblessness since the Great Depression .
In the six decades since the government began compiling such data , the highest level of unemployment came at the end of 1982 , when it hit 10.8 percent .
Despite the widespread assumption that the recession has already ended , and even as the economy has resumed growing , the government ’s latest snapshot of the labor market released Friday testified to the uncomfortable truth that expansion had yet to translate into jobs .
“ The guy on the street is going to ask , ‘ What recovery ? ’ ” said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh .
“ The job market is still in reverse . ”
The sharp rise in unemployment  which climbed from 9.8 percent in September , as the nation lost another 190,000 net jobs  intensified pressure on the Obama administration to show results from the $ 787 billion package of spending measures unleashed early this year to spur the economy .
After reviving Unplugged this summer , MTV has signed off on the release of first recording from the latest run —MTV Unplugged : Katy Perry is out tomorrow in standard and deluxe CD / DVD editions .
View the trailer above , plus the re-imagined “ I Kissed a Girl ” after the jump .
Anybody missing Auto - Tune right about now ?
“ I Kissed a Girl ” unplugged
While Idolator has distinguished itself with articulate arguments against Katy Perry ’s recordings ( and photography ) , we think she deserves a little credit for exploring her songs from a new vantage point .
In Unplugged ‘s best moments , her voice is surprisingly strong when you peel away the electro - style ( over ? -) production , and it ’s refreshing to see Perry perform without wearing a ridiculous costume or riding a phallic stage piece .
Reviving “ I Kissed a Girl ” as a loungy come - hither tune was actually kind of rewarding , and not the worst thing to do with an overplayed song that everyone knows frontwards and backwards already .
The former Katheryn Hudson ‘s off - kilter personality still shines during the song breaks , and on a few songs , we get to see Katy showcase her skills as a guitarist , something she probably should show off more often than her legs .
But the problem is that not enough of her repertoire works without the studio embellishments .
Even though the unplugged “ Waking up in Vegas ” sneaks in some nice vocals from her band , her own voice is — what ’s the word ? —” pitchy . ”
“ Ur So Gay ” sounds pretty much the same unplugged as it does on the album , though the whistling during the chorus is sorely missing .
“ Brick By Brick ” suffers the least since there ’s no other version to compare it to .
Are any of these songs going to replace their glossy originals ?
Not really , but if you wanna decide for yourself , you can watch all the clipshere , or wait til Friday November 27 when MTV airs a half - hour version of the taping .
( Even by conservative definitions , that probably counts as airing music on the channel . )
Here ’s one more which we ’ve renamed “ Waking Up in Starbucks ” :

Where are the off - ramps for the military ?
What is the exit strategy ?
When will Americans and their allies hand responsibility to the Afghanistan government ?
Can the Afghan government improve its credibility ?
While much has been made of the four military options that are on the table  all turning on how many troops to send to Afghanistan and for how long  the president also made clear that he is not yet fully satisfied with these choices and will not approve an open - ended commitment .
He has also asked , officials said , that some of the options be redrafted .
The White House has been eager to show that Mr. Obama is engaged in extensive deliberations before making what is likely to be one of the most debated decisions of his presidency .
Drawing on studies of how decisions were made to escalate the war in Vietnam , Mr. Obama and his aides seem intent on showing the nation and the world that he is not being rushed by the military , nor making a judgment without considering the long - term implications .
In purely political terms , the relatively slow pace  administration officials had initially suggested that the review would be complete by early November  signals to both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill that he has given serious consideration to all the options .
Given that liberals in his own party are generally opposed to further escalation in Afghanistan and could make trouble for the president over more money for the war , which he will almost certainly need to request , reassuring the left about how rigorously he is examining the options can only help the White House .
As the weeks have passed without a decision , the administration is making its frustration known over several news reports that suggested a decision had been made .
The Italian Supreme Court has ruled that ISPs can be forced to block BitTorrent sites , even if they are not hosted in Italy or operated by Italian citizens .
According to the decision by the Supreme Court , sites offering torrent files that link to copyrighted material are engaging in criminal activity .
The Supreme Court ruling follows a nationwide block of The Pirate Bay In August 2008 , when a decree from a public prosecutor instructed ISPs to censor the site .
As a result , millions of Italians were banned from accessing the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker .
The Pirate Bay chose to appeal the decision and won the court case .
The Court of Bergamo ruled that no foreign website can be censored for alleged copyright infringement and the block was lifted .
However , two months ago the Supreme Court nullified this victory , opening up the possibility for anti-piracy groups to censor The Pirate Bay and many other torrent sites in Italy .
This week the Supreme Court detailed its decision .
According to the verdict , BitTorrent sites that host torrent files are playing a significant role in the downloading and uploading process of their users .
By doing so they are more than an agnostic search engine such as Google .
The fact that a site is not hosted in Italy or operated by Italians is irrelevant according to the court .
The site is visited by many Italians who ( in part ) use it to share copyrighted material , the Supreme Court argued .
With this verdict in hand , copyright holders can now request The Pirate Bay and other BitTorrent sites to be filtered by Internet service providers .
The Pirate Bay is first in line , as its case has now been sent back to the Court of Bergamo .
Pirate Bay lawyers Giovanni Battista Gallus , Giuseppe Campanelli and Francesco Micozzi have informed TorrentFreak that the site will remain accessible for now .
“ There will be another hearing before the Court of Bergamo , ” they told us , “ which will have to decide again whether to block The Pirate Bay in Italy or not . ”
“ We will go again before the Court of Bergamo , where we will have ample grounds to defend The Pirate Bay , ” the lawyers noted , adding “ And we could even appeal the new decision before the Supreme Court . ”
The Supreme Court decision has nevertheless set a dangerous precedent .
If The Pirate Bay loses its case it is expected that many other BitTorrent sites will face a shutdown order in the future .

The BBC has become tangled in the row over the alleged manipulation of scientific data on global warming .
One of its reporters has revealed he was sent some of the leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia more than a month ago – but did nothing about them .
Despite the explosive nature of some of the messages – which revealed apparent attempts by the CRU ’s head , Professor Phil Jones , to destroy global temperature data rather than give it to scientists with opposing views – Paul Hudson failed to report the story .
This has led to suspicions that the scandal was ignored because it ran counter to what critics say is the BBC ’s unquestioning acceptance in many of its programmes that man-made climate change is destroying the planet .
Dr Benny Peiser , director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , said : ‘ We need to know more about the BBC ’s role in this affair .
Was Mr Hudson told by the BBC not to use the story ? ’
It was only after the same emails were published on a blog called Air Vent that Look North climate correspondent Mr Hudson owned up in his own blog to the fact he had also had the material .
In a bizarre twist , he claimed the leak had been triggered by an article he had written that questioned global warming .
Mr Hudson , 38 , last night declined to comment .
A BBC spokesman said : ‘ Paul has nothing to add to what he has already said in his blog . ’
Sixty years ago today the United Nations general assembly voted into existence a temporary body known as UNRWA , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency .
UNRWA 's task was to deal with the humanitarian consequences of the dispossession of some three - quarters of a million Palestine refugees forced by the 1948 Middle East war to abandon their homes and flee their ancestral lands .
Just two decades later , the six - day war generated another spasm of violence and forced displacement , culminating in the occupation of Palestinian territory .
Today , anguished exile remains the lot of Palestinians and Palestine refugees .
The occupation of Palestinian land persists , there is no Palestinian state , and the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which Palestinians are entitled under international law do not exist .
The occupation , now over 40 years old , becomes more entrenched with every infringement of human rights and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory .
Political actors hold in their hands the power to redress the travesties Palestinians endure .
Yet the approach has been , at best , to equivocate over the minutiae of the occupation – a checkpoint here , a bag of cement there – or , at worst , to look the other way , to acquiesce in or even support the measures causing Palestinian suffering .
From my perspective as the head of the agency mandated to assist and protect Palestine refugees , it is particularly vexing that the prevailing approach fails – or refuses – to accord the refugee issue the attention it deserves .
Over 60 years , dispossession has faded from the focus of peace efforts .
The heart of where peace should begin is absent from the international agenda , pushed aside as one of the " final status " issues , one which belongs to a later stage of the negotiation process .
As forced displacements continue across the West Bank , as Palestinians are evicted from their homes in East Jersualem , I ask a simple question : is it not time for those engaged in the peace process to muster the will and the courage to address the Palestine refugee question ?
On this regrettable 60th anniversary of the agency which I shall leave in less than one month , I wish to refocus the debate on the displaced and dispossessed , to put the refugees at the centre of peacemaking efforts .
Make no mistake , not a single conflict of contemporary times has been resolved , no durable peace achieved , unless and until the voices of the victims of those conflicts were heard , their losses acknowledged and redress found to injustices they experience .
The precedents of recent peacemaking efforts and the methodology of contemporary conflict resolution affirm that giving high priority to resolving dispossession and the plight of refugees is a necessity , an international obligation and a humanitarian imperative .
The Israeli-Palestinian confrontation is uniquely complex .
Among its myriad dimensions , all of which require attention , the unresolved refugee issue is one of those most profoundly linked to the uncertainties of the regional situation and to the persistence of the conflict .
Addressing it is , therefore , a sine qua non for making progress towards a negotiated solution .
Failing to engage with the refugee issue and consciously shunting it to one side has served only to disavow the refugees ' significance as a constituency with a prominent stake in delivering and sustaining peace .
This has left many with a dangerous cynicism about the peace process , thus strengthening the hands of those who argue against peace itself .
I refuse , however , to conclude my time in office on a pessimistic note .
Instead I urge that we take steps to engage the marginalised .
Let us confound the cynics .
Let us create alternative realities to disarm those who favour violence .
I call on the peacemakers to acknowledge , in their rhetoric and their policies , the need to address Palestinian dispossession .
Let symbolism and rhetoric give way to substance .
On the anniversary of UNRWA , I call on the international community and the parties to the conflict to acknowledge the 60 - year - old injustice as a first step towards addressing the consequences of that injustice .
Let us build facts in the mind to create facts of a just and durable peace on the ground .

THE latest kind of recycling has nothing to do with soda bottles .
It entails liposuctioning fat from , say , thighs or buttocks and injecting it into breasts to augment them .
After being condemned in the early ’90s , this procedure is generating newfound excitement among the handful of doctors nationwide who offer it and patients keen to enlarge their breasts without resorting to implants .
Almost 20 years ago , the association now known as the American Society of Plastic Surgeons issued a warning to its member doctors to not inject suctioned fat into patients ’ breasts , for fear that mammograms would be misread .
Since some injected fat dies and calcifies , the thinking was that radiologists would not be able to distinguish between those calcifications ( or calcium deposits ) and suspicious ones that may indicate breast cancer .
A second concern was that too little injected fat survived being transplanted , because techniques for harvesting , refining and placing fat were not advanced enough .
Even today , the success of fat grafting to the breast , as the procedure is also known , depends on the physician .
But this year , the plastic surgery society reversed its former position .
A report from its task force reviewed the limited research on fat grafting to the breast and concluded that it “ can be considered a safe method of augmentation . ”
On the issue of mammography , the report said fat grafting “ could potentially interfere with breast cancer detection ; however no evidence was found that strongly suggests this interference . ”
Thus , the task force ’s statement turned a red stoplight into a yellow one , signaling to plastic surgeons : Proceed with caution .
The man who served as the no .
2 official in Saddam Hussein's air force says Iraq moved weapons of mass destruction into Syria before the war by loading the weapons into civilian aircraft in which the passenger seats were removed .
The Iraqi general , Georges Sada , makes the charges in a new book , " Saddam 's Secrets , " released this week .
He detailed the transfers in an interview yesterday with The New York Sun .
" There are weapons of mass destruction gone out from Iraq to Syria , and they must be found and returned to safe hands , " Mr. Sada said .
" I am confident they were taken over . "
Mr. Sada 's comments come just more than a month after Israel 's top general during Operation Iraqi Freedom , Moshe Yaalon , told the Sun that Saddam " transferred the chemical agents from Iraq to Syria . "
Democrats have made the absence of stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq a theme in their criticism of the Bush administration 's decision to go to war in 2003 .
And President Bush himself has conceded much of the point ; in a televised prime - time address to Americans last month , he said , " It is true that many nations believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
But much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong . "
Said Mr. Bush , " We did not find those weapons . "
The discovery of the weapons in Syria could alter the American political debate on the Iraq war .
And even the accusations that they are there could step up international pressure on the government in Damascus .
That government , led by Bashar Assad , is already facing a U.N. investigation over its alleged role in the assassination of a former prime minister of Lebanon .
The Bush administration has criticized Syria for its support of terrorism and its failure to cooperate with the U.N. investigation .
The State Department recently granted visas for self - proclaimed opponents of Mr. Assad to attend a " Syrian National Council " meeting in Washington scheduled for this weekend , even though the attendees include communists , Baathists , and members of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group to the exclusion of other , more mainstream groups .
Mr. Sada , 65 , told the Sun that the pilots of the two airliners that transported the weapons of mass destruction to Syria from Iraq approached him in the middle of 2004 , after Saddam was captured by American troops .
" I know them very well .
They are very good friends of mine .
We trust each other .
We are friends as pilots , " Mr. Sada said of the two pilots .
He declined to disclose their names , saying they are concerned for their safety .
But he said they are now employed by other airlines outside Iraq .
The pilots told Mr. Sada that two Iraqi Airways Boeings were converted to cargo planes by removing the seats , Mr. Sada said .
Then Special Republican Guard brigades loaded materials onto the planes , he said , including " yellow barrels with skull and crossbones on each barrel . "
The pilots said there was also a ground convoy of trucks .
The flights - 56 in total , Mr. Sada said - attracted little notice because they were thought to be civilian flights providing relief from Iraq to Syria , which had suffered a flood after a dam collapse in June of 2002 .
" Saddam realized , this time , the Americans are coming , " Mr. Sada said .
" They handed over the weapons of mass destruction to the Syrians . "
Mr. Sada said that the Iraqi official responsible for transferring the weapons was a cousin of Saddam Hussein named Ali Hussein al - Majid , known as " Chemical Ali . "
The Syrian official responsible for receiving them was a cousin of Bashar Assad who is known variously as General Abu Ali , Abu Himma , or Zulhimawe .
Short of discovering the weapons in Syria , those seeking to validate Mr. Sada 's claim independently will face difficulty .
His book contains a foreword by a retired U.S. Air Force colonel , David Eberly , who was a prisoner of war in Iraq during the first Gulf War and who vouches for Mr. Sada , who once held him captive , as " an honest and honorable man . "
In his visit to the Sun yesterday , Mr. Sada was accompanied by Terry Law , the president of a Tulsa , Oklahoma based Christian humanitarian organization called World Compassion .
Mr. Law said he has known Mr. Sada since 2002 , lived in his house in Iraq and had Mr. Sada as a guest in his home in America .
" Do I believe this man ?
Yes , " Mr. Law said .
" It 's been solid down the line and everything checked out . "
Said Mr. Law , " This is not a publicity hound .
This is a man who wants peace putting his family on the line . "
Mr. Sada acknowledged that the disclosures about transfers of weapons of mass destruction are " a very delicate issue . "
He said he was afraid for his family .
" I am sure the terrorists will not like it .
The Saddamists will not like it , " he said .
He thanked the American troops .
" They liberated the country and the nation .
It is a liberation force .
They did a great job , " he said .
" We have been freed . "
He said he had not shared his story until now with any American officials .
" I kept everything secret in my heart , " he said .
But he is scheduled to meet next week in Washington with Senators Sessions and Inhofe , Republicans of , respectively , Alabama and Oklahoma .
Both are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
The book also says that on the eve of the first Gulf War , Saddam was planning to use his air force to launch a chemical weapons attack on Israel .
When , during an interview with the Sun in April 2004 , Vice President Cheney was asked whether he thought that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had been moved to Syria , Mr. Cheney replied only that he had seen such reports .
An article in the Fall 2005 Middle East Quarterly reports that in an appearance on Israel 's Channel 2 on December 23 , 2002 , Israel 's prime minister , Ariel Sharon , stated , " Chemical and biological weapons which Saddam is endeavoring to conceal have been moved from Iraq to Syria . "
The allegation was denied by the Syrian government at the time as " completely untrue , " and it attracted scant American press attention , coming as it did on the eve of the Christmas holiday .
The Syrian ruling party and Saddam Hussein had in common the ideology of Baathism , a mixture of Nazism and Marxism .
Syria is one of only eight countries that has not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention , a treaty that obligates nations not to stockpile or use chemical weapons .
Syria 's chemical warfare program , apart from any weapons that may have been received from Iraq , has long been the source of concern to America , Israel , and Lebanon .
In March 2004 , the director of Central Intelligence , George Tenet , testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee , saying , " Damascus has an active CW development and testing program that relies on foreign suppliers for key controlled chemicals suitable for producing CW . "
The CIA 's Iraq Survey Group acknowledged in its September 30 , 2004 , " Comprehensive Report , " " we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that WMD elements were relocated out of Iraq prior to the war .
Reports of such actions exist , but we have not yet been able to investigate this possibility thoroughly . "
Mr. Sada is an unusual figure for an Iraqi general as he is a Christian and was not a member of the Baath Party .
He now directs the Iraq operations of the Christian humanitarian organization , World Compassion .
Italian police say they have arrested an influential mafia boss in the southern city of Naples .
They say Luigi Esposito - who is on the list of Italy 's 30 most wanted men - was held at a luxury villa in the city .
He is believed to be one of the heads of the Nuvoletta clan of the Camorra , which operates in the Naples region .
He had been on the run since 2003 .
He was sentenced to nine years is prison for drug trafficking and associating with mafia in 2006 .
Mr Esposito , aged 49 , is the latest in a string of senior mafia bosses held recently in southern Italy .
Last week , three brothers of the Camorra 's Russo clan were arrested near Naples .
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni described their arrest as " a heavy blow for the Camorra " .
The Camorra is believed to have about 5,000 members .
Washington , D.C. , December 11 , 2009 - At a critical moment in August 1963 , President John F. Kennedy saw only negative choices on Vietnam , according to new audio recordings and documentation posted today by the National Security Archive .
Recently declassified tapes of secret White House meetings on the possibility of U.S. support for a military coup against President Ngo Dinh Diem show that Kennedy believed that if Diem 's brother Ngo Dinh Nhu remained a major influence , the war might not succeed .
Recognizing that Congress might get " mad " at him for supporting coup - minded Vietnamese generals , Kennedy said that it will " be madder if Vietnam goes down the drain . "
Thus , Kennedy did not disagree when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said that the U.S. needed to " plan how we make this thing work . "
The tapes also show that McNamara , long held to have opposed the Diem coup , failed to express such a strong view at the moment of this decision .
The newly declassified tapes are authoritative evidence on U.S. policy toward the Vietnamese coup , and they shed fresh light on one of the most controversial episodes of the American war in Vietnam .
In continuation of our previous coverage of this aspect of U.S. policy during the Vietnam war , the National Security Archive is posting the Kennedy tapes and memoranda containing the written accounts of the same National Security Council ( NSC ) meetings , together with related documents concerning this affair .
The episode is covered in considerable detail in William Colby and the CIA : The Secret Wars of a Controversial Spymaster , by National Security Archive fellow John Prados .
The new evidence shows that :
President Kennedy repeatedly pressed for better information regarding the balance of South Vietnamese forces for and against a coup .
While President Kennedy expressed reluctance to proceed with a coup that had no chance for success , he agreed with other senior U.S. officials that under the existing Saigon leadership there was no chance of success in the Vietnam war .
On the tapes , Kennedy can be heard moderating NSC deliberations that aimed at forging a policy specifically aimed at the Saigon coup .
Kennedy and other top U.S. officials agreed that , at a minimum , Saigon leader Diem had to be made to eject his brother , Ngo Dinh Nhu , and Nhu 's wife , Madame Nhu , from the South Vietnamese government .
Whether this could be done by diplomatic approaches or required resort to a coup became the focus of much of these NSC deliberations .
Even officials opposed to a coup agreed on the necessity to eject Nhu .
Defense secretary Robert S. McNamara , who , like President Kennedy , voiced support only for a coup that could succeed , also concurred on the Nhu problem .
The range of consensus included U.S. officials who subsequently gained credit for opposing expansion of the Vietnam war , most prominently Undersecretary of State George W. Ball .
Kennedy and his advisers saw proposals to halt U.S. aid to South Vietnam as measures to weaken the Diem government in the face of the South Vietnamese generals or to direct the aid to the Vietnamese military rather than Diem .
Proposals to evacuate Americans from South Vietnam were explicitly linked to the military coup .
The tapes reveal that plans for an American withdrawal were created in the context of NSC deliberations on the coup ; they became a feature of diplomatic maneuvers to induce Diem to oust Nhu .
The specific U.S. policy choice that Kennedy made — to send Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor on a diplomatic mission to Saigon in September 1963 — was prefigured in these NSC discussions .
The tapes show that their mission , designed to pressure Diem to get rid of Nhu , originated as a maneuver to achieve the U.S. goal by diplomacy while the South Vietnamese generals recruited more supporters for a coup move .
All these points bear on important aspects of our understanding of the Vietnam war .
For example , the tapes ' discussion of the purposes for planning an American withdrawal from South Vietnam weakens claims by some that President Kennedy all along intended to get out of the conflict .
Though JFK expresses doubts — in the Oval Office on August 29 Kennedy tells his inner circle , " We 're up to our hips in mud out there " — the president never forthrightly rejects the Vietnam commitment .
In fact Kennedy tells the same group shortly afterwards that while Congress might get " mad " at the U.S. sidling up to the Vietnamese generals , " they 'll be madder if Vietnam goes down the drain " ( Item 12 ) .
President Kennedy 's emphasis indicates his determination to fight the war , not abandon it .
The Tapes
The Kennedy tapes concern a series of top level meetings the president held at the White House in late August 1963 .
The tapes form part of a larger collection of audiotapes by President Kennedy , who had recording systems installed in the Cabinet Room and in his Oval Office respectively in the summer and fall of 1962 .
Kennedy himself controlled the taping system , using switches located underneath the conference table in the Cabinet Room and in his desk in the Oval Office .
JFK recorded his first tape on July 30 , 1962 .
Microphones were concealed in unused light fixture recesses in the Cabinet Room , and in Kennedy 's desk in the Oval Office .
( Note1 )
Due to the state of technical development of recording equipment at that time , and to the fact that people recorded on the tapes were speaking from where they stood or sat , not directly into the microphones , the audiotapes are not perfect recordings .
Voices can be distant , other noises impinge , and ambient noise sometimes overwhelms the material .
In spite of these drawbacks the Kennedy tapes constitute the most authoritative material imaginable , for they record the actual words of President Kennedy and his closest advisers .
Tapes for roughly 248 hours of meetings and 12 hours of telephone calls were given to the Kennedy Library by the former president 's estate in 1976 , and a last group of dictabelt recordings came to the Library in 1998 .
The present release is from the original bequest .
It is the latest in a series of releases from the Kennedy tapes that began in 1983 , when the Library opened to the public segments of audiotape that concerned the Cuban Missile Crisis , beginning with a few conversations transcribed by McGeorge Bundy .
Since then there have been periodic additions , and the Kennedy Library adopted a systematic program to process and open the tapes in order , with the goal of completing the work in 2011 .
Kennedy Library archivists affirm they are on schedule to meet that goal .
Despite the existence of the orderly program , however , the Kennedy Library has repeatedly released material out of sequence when it saw advantage in doing so .
The full set of Cuban Missile Crisis tapes were opened between 1994 and 1997 ( Note 2 ) , tapes bearing on civil rights were released a few years ago ( Note 3 ) , and the Kennedy tapes of meetings during the final period before and during the coup against Ngo Dinh Diem were opened as long ago as 1999 .
( Note 4 ) Considering the historical importance of Kennedy 's August Vietnam tapes , and given the existence of a procedure at the Library for requesting an early review of tapes , this analyst asked for such a review in 2000 .
The Kennedy Library took no action .
The present release represents the result of the Library 's orderly program .
The fact that the Kennedy Library chose to make a wide release of these tapes to the public and to post them on its
Web site is an acknowledgement that it does , after all , recognize the historical importance of these audiotapes .
The item descriptions below describe why the tapes are the most authoritative record , for they show many instances where the written memoranda of the meetings differ from what was actually said .
The lead written record of each meeting ( normally from Bromley Smith of the NSC staff but in one instance from General Victor D. Krulak , an assistant to Maxwell Taylor ) is annotated by archivist Maura Porter of the Kennedy Library with minute : second times for passages of the meeting portrayed in the memorandum .
This added value makes the audiotapes easier to follow .
Background and Context
Triggering these White House discussions were approaches by two South Vietnamese generals to U.S. embassy officials in August 1963 .
They asked what position the United States would take if the South Vietnamese military launched a coup d'état against Saigon leader Ngo Dinh Diem .
( Note 5 ) A few days earlier , President Diem , prodded by his brother and counselor , Ngo Dinh Nhu , had sent Vietnamese police and army forces to seize the largest Buddhist pagodas in Saigon and Hue .
In the political maneuvering preceding this operation , Nhu had manipulated the Vietnamese military into taking apparent responsibility for what became known as the " pagoda raids , " the latest episode in an increasingly hostile confrontation between South Vietnamese Buddhists and Catholics that had begun in Hue in May .
The pagoda raids , reported around the world , became a South Vietnamese political fiasco .
American journalists , among them David Halberstam of the New York Times , were highly critical of the raids .
The U.S. government was scandalized .
Vietnamese generals rejected blame for carrying out the raids and -- with the exception of certain loyalists -- most determined at that time to move against the Saigon government .
News that the generals wanted some expression of U.S. policy toward a coup reached Washington on Saturday , August 24 , 1963 , a moment when many top officials happened to be away .
Impelled by the need for an immediate response , those subordinates who were available crafted a reply which strongly implied the U.S. would back a coup under certain circumstances .
Undersecretary of State George Ball , the senior official on duty that day , was accosted on a golf course to obtain his approval of the draft reply ( Item 1 ) .
The cable was written by Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Roger A. Hilsman and Deputy Secretary of State W. Averell Harriman , cleared by acting chiefs at the Pentagon and CIA , and coordinated by telegram with President Kennedy by his NSC staff director for Vietnam , Michael V. Forrestal .
( Note 6 ) This document became notorious as the " Hilsman Cable . "
It was regarded by some , led by Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Maxwell D. Taylor ( Note 7 ) , as an " egregious end run " around established U.S. policy that took advantage of the heat of the moment .
It is worth noting that Taylor had no approval authority for the cable , and that the senior Pentagon official who did , Secretary McNamara , later recalled , " I do not share Max 's view that the cable represented an egregious end run . "
( Note 8 ) Action based on the cable was nevertheless halted when top officials , including McNamara , learned that it contemplated ending U.S. support for President Diem .
The White House meetings captured in these Kennedy tapes ( Items 2 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) began on Monday , August 26 , when members of the president 's inner circle were back in Washington .
The issue at all the meetings was the position the United States should take with respect to a coup by the Vietnamese military against Diem and / or Nhu .
The tapes and written records of those same meetings , posted here ( Items 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 ) make it possible to read and listen to primary sources on those deliberations .
President Kennedy acted primarily as a moderator , eliciting the views of his advisers by posing questions and listening to the ensuing discussion .
Kennedy makes occasional statements of opinion but for the most part his own views must be inferred from the direction of his questions .
His interests indicate the president agreed with the assessments that the Diem government held primary responsibility for the pagoda raids , that Nhu and Madame Nhu had to be ejected from power in Saigon , and that he was prepared to use the available means the United States possessed to attain that goal .
What really happened at these meetings is far more complex — and significant — than is usually portrayed by historians , some participants , or for that matter by President Kennedy himself in a brief personal reflection he recorded on audiotape on November 4 , 1963 .
Historians frequently portray the August decisions as the result of a cabal among Hilsman , Harriman , and Forrestal ; or as out - of - control activism on the part of newly - arrived American ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , who reached Saigon only as these events began to unfold .
The view that a cabal was responsible was influenced by the president 's brother , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , who said that " a handful of men in the State Department and the White House had been awaiting an opportunity to encourage the Vietnamese army to move against the government . "
Bobby Kennedy added , with respect to the White House meetings themselves , " The government was split in two .
It was the only time , really in three years , [ that ] the government was broken in two in a very disturbing way . "
( Note 9 ) In actuality , Bobby Kennedy spoke very little in these meetings and was absent at the crucial August 26 meeting , which should have demonstrated the " split " of which he spoke .
Many subsequent commentators took their cues from his opinion .
Ellen Hammer ( cited above ) builds her account directly from the quoted material .
William Prochnau , writing of the cabal getting approval for the first , incendiary cable , asserts that " each [ official ] was easier to convince after another had signed . "
( Note 10 ) In his recent account , historian Howard Jones speaks of " a triumvirate of hard - line advisers who . . . tied the administration to [ the ] coup . " ( Note 11 )
In John F. Kennedy 's taped reflection he simply places his officials on one side of the dispute or another : Robert McNamara , General Taylor , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy , and CIA director John A. McCone as opposing the coup ; Hilsman , Harriman , Ball , and Forrestal as favoring it .
The president does not specify the side taken by Secretary of State Dean Rusk .
The audiotapes actually show President Kennedy 's advisers cooperatively helping him determine policy .
The individuals cited do speak out against an immediate coup , but they are united in the judgment that Vietnam would be lost if Ngo Dinh Nhu remained in the Saigon government , and they waver one way or the other on the capacity of Diem himself .
All favor supporting an eventual coup , once forces were aligned , if Nhu were not ousted .
Moreover , the tone of the first of these meetings , on August 26 ( Item 2 ) , belies the claim that top officials were furious with Hilsman , the supposed perpetrator of a " cabal . "
More to the point , the White House meeting did not discuss countermanding the Hilsman Cable but rather took it as a starting point around which to build .
In addition , officials whom President Kennedy later recorded as opposed to the coup are among the most active participants in discussions of how the U.S. could utilize its aid and its own forces in Vietnam in support of the Vietnamese military plotters .
Listeners can hear the tone of the key August 26 meeting and decide for themselves how angry the group was at the actions of the supposed " cabal . "
Much like the Cuban Missile Crisis meetings had ranged over a set of alternatives and finally settled on a policy , the Vietnam deliberations of late August 1963 ended with general agreement that Washington would wait for the Vietnamese generals to assemble their forces and would support a coup once they had , provided that the Nhus had not been ousted in the interim .
During that time the U.S. would make one final attempt to convince President Diem to rid himself of his brother Nhu , and , as part of that maneuver , would suspend some U.S. aid while standing ready to evacuate Americans from South Vietnam .
A word should be said with regard to Ambassador Frederick C. Nolting , the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Saigon .
Nolting was known as a friend to Diem and his replacement by Cabot Lodge already showed U.S. displeasure with the Diem government .
Nolting and Lodge exchanged notes in Honolulu as the former ambassador returned to Washington and his successor headed for Saigon .
In transit during the initial approach of the Vietnamese generals , Nolting arrived in Washington in time to influence the proceedings .
At the first of the meetings which Kennedy taped , that of August 26 ( Item 2 ) , the president ended by asking that Nolting be brought into the group .
Participants explicitly recognized this meant bringing a champion for Diem into the proceedings .
Thereafter Nolting steadfastly defended Diem , and also Nhu to a considerable degree , arguing he was not " anti-American " but " pro-Vietnamese " ( Item 6 ) .
Yet by the end of the week , even Nolting was on board with the formula for making a final effort to induce Diem to oust Nhu , in a context where officials clearly understood that , failing that , the United States would support a military coup in Saigon ( Item 12 ) .
( Note 12 )
During the month of September , President Kennedy carried out the course he had agreed upon with advisers at the August White House meetings .
Robert McNamara and Maxwell Taylor became JFK 's emissaries on the mission to convince Diem to fire Nhu .
These Kennedy tapes also shed light on that mission : by selecting emissaries who had opposed an immediate coup , the proposal to oust Nhu was being made by those who had taken the most relaxed view of the Saigon leader .
Kennedy was signaling to Diem that even his closest friends in Washington had lost patience with him .
It was during the McNamara - Taylor mission that the U.S. terminated military aid to the South Vietnamese Special Forces , the military unit most directly controlled by Nhu and Diem .
This reinforced the signal , but it also weakened the loyalist forces which Diem might rely upon to defend against a coup .
This formed an integral element of a U.S. policy supporting the South Vietnamese generals in the coup scenario .
Thus while President Kennedy decided against an immediate coup , his stance in effect accepted that there would ultimately be such an event if Diem proved unresponsive ( Item 12 ) .
Finally , the new Kennedy tapes further illuminate the debate as to whether John F. Kennedy intended to withdraw the United States from the Vietnam war .
The record of the August meetings shows President Kennedy 's acute awareness of the political capital he would lose in Congress if the Vietnam war were lost ( Item 12 ) .
In the meetings Kennedy and his advisers use the term " withdrawal " mostly to signify termination or suspension of aid to the Diem government .
They explicitly use " evacuation " in conversations about getting Americans out of South Vietnam in the context of a coup situation , and a plan for such an evacuation was discussed and refined during this period .
Kennedy and his advisers were reaching for mechanisms to influence the Diem government , and they would , as noted , terminate aid to some of Diem 's troops .
South Vietnamese officials , specifically including
Nhu , made public statements at this time that hinted at a future demand for the Americans to leave Vietnam .
The minor withdrawal that President Kennedy approved and which Secretary McNamara ordered in October 1963 should be seen in this context : it was a measure that simultaneously suggested that Washington could be responsive to demands by the Diem government , simplified U.S. problems in case an evacuation actually needed to be carried out , and put Diem further on notice that the United States had the power to leave him in the lurch .
( Note 13 ) Among the earliest commentaries on what has been endlessly debated as the " Kennedy withdrawal " thesis is the oral history interview done with Roswell Gilpatric on August 12 , 1970 , while the Vietnam war still raged .
Gilpatric had been McNamara 's deputy and was present at some of the White House meetings recorded here .
Asked if the October withdrawal announcement was " a move in the direction of the eventual or planned withdrawal " of American troops , Gilpatric answered , " I could n't put it in quite as specific terms as that . "
Gilpatric recalled President Kennedy as having been " restive " in the summer and fall of 1963 , but that it was McNamara , not JFK who had indicated " that this was part of a plan the president had asked him to develop to unwind the whole thing . "
( Note 14 ) Gilpatric opines that the idea was not part of a pressure play .
In fact , McNamara had ordered the planning for this limited withdrawal finalized in May 1963 , the very moment when the Buddhist crisis in South Vietnam began .
The tapes of the October NSC meetings that discussed this specific matter , which are already available , show Kennedy 's tone of skepticism as he questioned McNamara , Taylor , and others about this project .
( Note 15 )
In the meantime there had been further development of the options for pressuring Diem , including scenarios Roger Hilsman assembled in early and mid-September .
These documents survived .
The State Department 's executive secretariat , on instructions from the White House , recalled from the " eyes only " recipients all copies of the original Hilsman Cable and similar communications sent between August 24 and August 29 and destroyed them in late September , with the exception of one set retained by State for reference .
( Note 16 )
According to John P. Roche , a political adviser to Lyndon B. Johnson , several years later President Johnson asked him to review the period leading up to the coup against Diem .
Following conversations with Secretary Rusk , the Hilsman scenarios appeared in the packet of material sent to the White House for Roche to examine .
He concluded that Kennedy had " half - ordered " the coup but had not specifically approved it .
( Note 17 ) President Johnson , who had personally supported Diem from the beginning of the Kennedy administration , no doubt relied on this inquiry when he wrote in his own memoir that the Hilsman Cable had been " a hasty and ill - advised message " and that the decision " was a serious blunder which launched a period of deep political confusion in Saigon that lasted almost two years . "
( Note 18 ) It is yet another indication of President Kennedy 's direction here that then - Vice President Johnson attended only one ( plus part of another ) of the August 1963 White House meetings on the coup project .

This meeting represented President Kennedy 's initial effort to hammer out a coherent response to the South Vietnamese generals following the confusion of the " Hilsman Cable . "
Upon returning to Washington from his weekend at Hyannis Port , Kennedy convened his top advisers to review developments in Saigon .
Assistant Secretary Hilsman led off , noting that " We are all in agreement that Nhu must go , " and that suspicions were reciprocal — " Nhu has thought for months that we are out to get him . "
Hilsman discusses South Vietnamese coup prospects , details of the Diem government 's raids on Buddhist pagodas , and a plan to evacuate Americans from South Vietnam , noting that the U.S. force there , the Military Assistance Command Vietnam ( MACV ) has little ability to defend itself .
President Kennedy cites coverage of South Vietnam in the U.S. press , particularly that of Newsweek and journalist David Halberstam of the New York Times , commenting on a coup that " we just want to be sure , " and that " we 're not going to do it just because the New York Times is excited about it . "
Roger Hilsman , who dominates much of the discussion at this meeting , reflects that the Vietnamese generals " would n't do something unless we said something , " but that two of the key plotters had both told U.S. officials that " you have got to make up your mind . "
A number of comments by Secretary of Defense McNamara elicited doubts about the adequacy of information on Saigon events , while Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned that in Vietnam " we 're on the road to disaster . "
President Kennedy set a follow - up meeting , requested more information , and asked staff to arrange for former ambassador Frederick Nolting — a known supporter of Diem — to attend .
JFK wanted Nolting in the room precisely because of his pro-Diem views .
Item 3 : Memorandum of Conversation , White House Meeting , August 26 , 1963 , Noon
SOURCE : National Defense University , Taylor Papers , Vietnam , Chapter XXIII .
Prepared by Taylor 's special assistant for counterinsurgency , Lieutenant General Victor Krulak , this meeting record supplies the written version of the audio tape in Item 1 .
Many points that President Kennedy 's group discusses in some detail are represented in only summary form in the memorandum .
Some , like a discussion toward the end of the session of how the Diem government was dealing with American journalists , are absent altogether .
The written record of this and subsequent meeting tapes have been usefully annotated by Kennedy Library archivist Maura Porter with minute / second citations to where the president and his advisers deal with various subjects of concern .
Item 4 : Memorandum of Conversation , White House Meeting , August 26 , 1963 , Noon
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library , Roger Hilsman Papers , Country series , box 4 , folder : " Vietnam : White House Meetings 8/26/63-8/29/63 , State Memos . "
This document is Roger Hilsman 's record of the same meeting .
It supplements the account in Item 3 and contains significant nuances .
Hilsman notes General Taylor 's doubts about ousting Diem , and refers to Taylor 's anger at Hilsman for bypassing the military chain of command in having a direct conversation with the Commander - in - Chief Pacific , Admiral Harry D. Felt — apparent on the audiotape simply as a question from Taylor to Hilsman ( c. 9:00 ) .
Hilsman also notes Rusk's " road to disaster " remark near the end of the meeting as a reference to the possibility of a coup failure , with the alternatives in that eventuality being either committing U.S. combat forces or watching South Vietnam fall in defeat .
Hilsman claims " there was no dissent from the Secretary 's analysis , " but this analysis does not seem to be present on the audiotape .
Item 5 : Memorandum for the President , August 27 , 1963
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library , NARA : John Newman Papers , Notebook " August 24 - 31 , 1963 . "
This document is the briefing memo prepared for President Kennedy by NSC staffer Michael V. Forrestal .
In it the staff expert advises JFK to end the meeting by observing the U.S. could not continue supporting a Saigon government dominated by Nhu , should leave Diem 's future in the hands of the Vietnamese military , and would continue to support a Saigon government that showed itself capable of prosecuting the war against the insurgency .

William E. Colby , chief of the CIA 's Far East Division , presents a detailed briefing for President Kennedy and colleagues .
Relying upon recent cables reporting the situation , Colby relates that the situation in Saigon was " fairly well - controlled . "
In terms of CIA contacts with two Vietnamese generals , Colby observed that one seemed solid and the other " jumpy , " but that the Saigon officers were talking of the coup taking place within a week .
Colby discussed reports that Ngo Dinh Nhu was actually in contact with North Vietnamese adversaries of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and also warned that Nhu might be preparing a coup of his own as a last - ditch move , to which Ambassador Frederick Nolting replies " that is speculation . "
The group went on to discuss the South Vietnamese military forces controlled by the plotters versus those loyal to Nhu and Diem , as well as the qualities of the Vietnamese generals , concluding that by and large the Diem government controlled the preponderance of troops around Saigon .
Ambassador Nolting argues that Nhu is " a man of integrity , " but concedes that though he had been a great asset to Diem he had become a liability , and rationalized his actions to the point of becoming indistinguishable from an opportunist .
The ambassador , who had just been replaced in Saigon by Lodge , exhibits a certain lack of realism in calling Nhu 's pagoda raids " a victory of sorts ; " and a degree of credulity in maintaining that Nhu had not ordered brutality in the raids , that Diem and Nhu were sincerely committed in reconciliation with the Buddhists , and in reciting what was apparently a Diem - Nhu private argument to Nolting that Cambodia was behind the Buddhist movement in South Vietnam .
Credulity is also apparent in Nolting 's evident belief that the commissions Diem had approved to investigate underlying Buddhist - Catholic hostilities were capable of defusing the crisis .
Ambassador Nolting concedes he is " speculating " when he says that the South Vietnamese generals had themselves been the source of the demand for martial law , which the Diem government had imposed — which some neo - orthodox historians take as a fact .
In any case , throughout this series of meetings Nolting would mostly argue against supporting an anti-Diem coup .
Yet even he admitted that Ngo Dinh Nhu had become a liability .
Here , in answer to a direct question from President Kennedy , Nolting favored waiting a few weeks to see if Nhu 's anti-Buddhist strike had worked , and if it turned out not , the ambassador said , Washington could have CIA tell the generals to " get cracking . "
After more discussion on the Vietnamese generals ' personalities , their potential as national leaders , and civilian alternatives , national security adviser McGeorge Bundy lamented that " if we had vigorous generals . . . we would have been backing them a long time ago . "
The need for evaluation remained paramount .
President Kennedy ended the session by indicating that Ambassador Nolting 's views had impressed him , expressing doubts about the chances an immediate military coup in Saigon might have .
Kennedy did not use the talking points NSC staffer Forrestal had prepared for him .
Item 7 : Memorandum of a Conference with the President , White House , August 27 , 1963 , 4:00 PM
SOURCE : Kennedy Library : Kennedy Papers , National Security File , Meetings and Memoranda series , box 316 , folder : " Meetings on Vietnam , 8/24/63-8/31/63 . "
This record by Bromley Smith , NSC executive secretary , shows both the advantages and limitations of written notes as opposed to the Kennedy tapes .
Although the tape only begins with President Kennedy 's arrival ( because JFK himself controlled his taping system ) and thus with William Colby 's CIA briefing , the meeting actually began earlier , and Smith 's notes capture a discussion during which Secretary McNamara advocated re-activating for this Vietnam crisis the NSC special unit called the " Executive Committee " that had been used to manage the Cuban Missile Crisis .
Both McNamara 's proposal and the unusual handling of these documents in the White House records system ( Kennedy had them segregated in a single file among his NSC records ) demonstrate the dimensions of the Diem crisis for JFK as well as his sensitivity about it .
Differences between tape and written records are also evident .
For one , Smith 's record focuses on Ambassador Nolting 's contention that Diem had kept his promises to the United States , while the tape recording of this meeting suggests the ambassador concentrated more on arguing that Diem was a man of integrity .
In another instance Bromley Smith 's memo account mistakenly has President Kennedy asking about Madame Nhu 's authority where the audiotape makes clear that JFK 's concern was about her husband .
Item 8 : Memorandum of Conversation , White House Meeting , August 27 , 1963 , 4:00 PM
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Roger Hilsman Papers , box 4/6 , folder : " Vietnam : White House Meetings 8/26/63-8/29/63 , State Memcons . "
Roger Hilsman 's record of the August 27 encounter furnishes additional perspective on the same discussion .
Hilsman 's recitation in this document of the Nolting discussion in which the former ambassador spoke of a pause with the option to tell the Vietnamese generals to " get cracking " takes a very different form on the audiotape .
Hilsman also cites Dean Rusk in ways that do not seem quite accurate , and there is no mention of Nolting 's account of how the Australian ambassador had been asked to invite Madame Nhu to his country to get her out of South Vietnam .
Hilsman does not record President Kennedy 's statement that there was no sense in going ahead with a coup unless it had a good chance of success , but he does note that both Kennedy and McNamara spoke of seeking additional information from Ambassador Lodge and MACV commander General Paul Harkins .

Another CIA briefing by William Colby summarized late - breaking developments , notes an imminent meeting with some of the South Vietnamese generals , and revealed that a telegram to Ambassador Lodge from an American citizen ( in Laguna Beach , California ) exhorting action against the Diem government had induced Ngo Dinh Diem to believe the U.S. and CIA were behind coup plotting .
Colby says the situation had reached a point of no return .
General Taylor follows with an extended discussion regarding provisions for an American evacuation ( withdrawal ) from South Vietnam , including details of U.S. air and naval forces that could participate .
Secretary McNamara breaks in to comment that a key element in any withdrawal would be the more than 200 U.S. helicopters with MACV forces — helicopters that would also become a focus of White House discussions on how the U.S. could help coup plotters assemble troop units superior to those loyal to Diem .
The balance of forces , reviewed once again , remained unfavorable to the plotters , although General Taylor remarked that their troops could include some " tough " Airborne and Marine battalions .
William Colby compared this situation to what had occurred during another coup against Diem in 1960 , when the Saigon leader had defeated the coup by delaying its leaders long enough to bring loyalist forces into the city .
Some of the talk revolved around getting additional South Vietnamese officers to align themselves with the coup .
Having Ambassador
Lodge speak directly to the military would convey U.S. support more directly than relying upon clandestine CIA contacts .
Speaking of the array of forces Robert McNamara , in contrast to the usual portrayal of him as opposed to the coup , remarks that the U.S. needed to plan " how we make this thing work " ( 22:40 ) .
McGeorge Bundy , who agreed ( see Document 10 ) , recommended an immediate decision on whether to further encourage the Vietnamese generals .
Ambassador Nolting expressed " grave reservations , based on personal commitments if you will , which were based on government instructions . "
The coup was a bad principle and a bad precedent .
But President Kennedy observes that Lodge and Harkins both seemingly approve going ahead , and George Ball and Roger Hilsman joined in that conclusion .
Hilsman and Bundy both agreed with Nolting that the United States had no operational control over the coup , but Hilsman added the generals had gone down the coup road so far they would continue no matter what Washington did .
George Ball remarked that the United States could not back off , " We should mobilize all the resources that we have . . . to make this thing work . "
Averell Harriman agreed .
This tape is marred by multiple deletions of dialogue on national security grounds .
What those might be , after 46 years , the disappearance of South Vietnam , and the deaths of every major character involved , is a mystery .
At least five deletions remove more than two minutes of the White House discussion .
One of them concerns George Ball remarks that in written form ( Item 10 ) have been declassified since at least 1994 .
McGeorge Bundy 's handwritten notes scribbled on a CIA paper circulated at the meeting ( not reproduced ) indicate that Ball complained of Ngo Dinh Nhu 's control of the Saigon government : it was " intolerable " and had done " terrible damage , " and that Rusk and Harriman concurred .
Item 10 : Memorandum of Conference with the President , August 28 , 1963 , Noon
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Kennedy Papers , National Security File , Meetings & Memoranda series , box 316 , folder " Meetings on Vietnam 8/24/63-8/31/63 . "
The written record of this meeting opens with an extremely sparse recounting of the CIA briefing , followed by detailed coverage of General Taylor 's description of U.S. evacuation plans .
Discussion of Secretary McNamara 's comments on how to make the plan work is missing , except for noting Roger Hilsman 's remarks , which are partially deleted both here and in Hilsman 's own record of the meeting .
The memo cites McNamara saying " if we decided to back a coup we should go in to win " ( on the tape McGeorge Bundy notes the " principle of action " : " We should never encourage this and then let it fail " ) .
President Kennedy still felt Washington could " unload " if the coup was not in the cards .
Undersecretary of State George Ball and Hilsman discussed having senior U.S. military officers speak to the plotters , but Ambassador Nolting doubted that General Paul Harkins actually did favor a coup .
George Ball countered the ambassador 's entire analysis , arguing that Diem had broken promises made to the U.S. and that the war could not be won with Diem in power , that " we must decide now to go through to a successful overthrow of Diem . "
Averell Harriman agreed .
Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon warned that a coup would be seen as a U.S. move from the beginning and answered President Kennedy 's doubts regarding its prospects by saying , " Then do n't go . "
Kennedy asks for options to build the strength of coup forces .
After discussion of some possibilities , Harriman took the floor to say " We have lost Vietnam if the coup fails . . .
We have lost the fight in Vietnam and must withdraw if a coup does not take place . "
President Kennedy directed that Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins be informed that in Washington 's view it was still Diem who " held the balance of power . "
He again sought more information from the officials on the scene , and McGeorge Bundy stipulated some aspects that should be covered in the embassy reporting .
Robert F. Kennedy , the Attorney General and the president 's brother , advised that the U.S. needed to figure out how to offset moves Diem must undoubtedly take to destroy his opposition .
Hilsman weighed in on that , and expressed that Diem and Nhu would have to be " exiled , " but Nolting came back swinging , insisting that only Diem could hold South Vietnam together .
Harriman again refuted Nolting , arguing that even with Diem " the political situation in Vietnam will blow up sometime . "
President Kennedy ended the session by calling for a follow - up meeting .
Item 11 : Memorandum of Conversation , White House , August 28 , 1963 , 4:00 PM
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Roger Hilsman Papers : Country series , box 4/6 , folder : " Vietnam : White House Meetings 8/26/63-8/29/63 , State Memos . "
Assistant Secretary Roger Hilsman also compiled a written account of the August 28 White House session .
Hilsman covers the CIA briefing in somewhat greater detail and also discusses Maxwell Taylor 's comments on the U.S. evacuation plan .
McNamara's " make it work " language is accurately reported , but Hilsman adds that the secretary of defense began by saying that the first thing was to decide whether to go ahead with the coup or call it off .
This is a close but not an exact representation of McNamara as he is recorded on the audiotape .
Hilsman is also close to the mark in recounting Ambassador Nolting 's position , and in capturing George Ball 's views .
He seems to misrepresent Douglas Dillon , however , making the treasury secretary more receptive of the coup option than appears elsewhere , and toward the end of the meeting Hilsman depicts Averell Harriman 's refutation of Nolting 's remarks more stinging than in the audiotape .
Hilsman also cites himself saying things not heard on the tape .

Secretary of State Rusk opens this meeting by informing the group of views expressed by Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins in their latest cables .
Both agree that the Vietnam war would be lost if Diem remained in power .
Assistant Secretary Hilsman interrupts at one point to add that State Department Southeast Asia expert Paul Kattenburg , who has known Diem for a decade , is visiting Saigon and holds the same view .
The main difference among the on- scene officials is that General Harkins advocates one last attempt to convince Diem to rid himself of Ngo Dinh Nhu and Madame Nhu .
The White House group then takes up various nuts - and - bolts questions regarding Saigon developments .
A continuing issue is whether to instruct Lodge and Harkins to engage with the generals — though Lodge has already made known to one general through a lower - ranking U.S. official that he was indeed involved .
President Kennedy asks " do we want to continue , or do we want to withdraw ? " ( 5:05 ) .
Defense secretary McNamara points out that capability for a coup is still " several days away anyway " and advocates a final attempt to persuade Diem .
His deputy agrees .
Secretary Rusk wonders whether the persuasion attempt is not " something for the generals to do , at the moment when they 're ready to move . "
McGeorge Bundy also comments on the prospects of " an ultimatum delivered by us " to Diem about his brother .
At that point President Kennedy raises the possibility of withdrawing American assistance to Diem as part of that maneuver , and though some feel that would be " an awkward signal , " the group proceeds to mull over ways to shift U.S. aid to a government of the generals without appearing to be " in cahoots " ( c. 21:30 ) .
Assistant Secretary Hilsman wished to reassure the generals " that we want the same things as they want . "
Even Ambassador
Nolting 's advice was to tell Diem that " we want a new deal , and if we do n't get it we will have to go another way . "
The president 's only doubt seems to have been whether cutting aid to Diem might reveal Washington was siding with the Vietnamese generals .
Some conversation revolved around whether to have Lodge and Harkins make these representations to Diem or to have a mission from Washington do so .
McGeorge Bundy points out that the CIA 's Bill Colby is the American best known to Nhu , potentially the one to make the pitch for him to leave .
It is disturbing that a statement by the CIA 's Richard Helms on covert operations in South Vietnam is excised on this audiotape even though a written reference to it was declassified as long ago as 1992 ( Item 13 ) .
President Kennedy and his inner circle then retire to the Oval Office , where they spend another ten minutes meeting privately to work out the language that would be used on two cables sent to Saigon .
Ambassador Lodge was instructed to learn what he could of the generals ' plans without committing the United States .
There was more talk of making U.S. helicopters and means available to the plotters .
This is when the president made the remarks quoted in the introduction , about America hip - deep in mud in Vietnam , and about Congress .
Although he had resisted the coup path unless it would work , and decides in favor of the last approach to Diem , Kennedy also says that he does not think the ultimatum gambit will work .
In effect the president rejected an immediate coup but accepted that one would eventually take place .
Item 13 : Memorandum of Conference with the President , August 29 , 1963 , Noon
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Kennedy Papers , National Security File : Meetings & Memoranda series , box 316 , folder : " Meetings on Vietnam , 8/24/63-8/31/63 . "
Bromley Smith 's written record of this meeting condenses the early discussion involving Rusk , Hilsman and others regarding coup modalities , and by citing only Ambassador Nolting in connection with the question of the plotters ' use of American helicopters , leaves the impression that deliberations on this point were much less extensive than they were .
The written record is positively misleading where President Kennedy ( c. 16:45 ) discusses U.S. aid .
Smith 's memo also makes Secretary McNamara 's advice to disassociate from the coup seem more forceful than what McNamara actually said , which was to try a diplomatic approach , but in the context of a coup capability that still had to be developed .
McNamara is cited at several points here arguing there is no alternative to Diem , yet other participants talked right around that point .
The vital ten minutes spent discussing instructions to the U.S. embassy are represented in this record by a single sentence .
Item 14 : Memorandum of Conversation , White House , August 29 , 1963 , Noon
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Roger Hilsman Papers , box 4/6 , folder : " Vietnam , White House Meetings 8/26/63-8/29/63 , State Memos . "
Again there are significant differences between Hilsman 's record of this encounter and that of the NSC notetaker .
The State Department official 's account of Rusk 's initial presentation is fuller than Smith's , and also captures remarks by the CIA 's Richard Helms that go entirely unrecorded in the NSC version .
Hilsman is also more accurate than Smith in noting Secretary McNamara 's response to the question posed by President Kennedy of whether to continue or withdraw from the coup .
In Hilsman 's version , " The Secretary of Defense said that on the first question he thought we should proceed with the operation .
On the second question he agreed . . . that one last approach should be made to Diem . "
On the other hand , Hilsman 's notation that Kennedy " asked whether we would really pull out of South Viet - Nam in any event " seems , in listening to the audiotape , false — that the president was referring to the " withdrawal " of aid not the termination of the U.S. commitment ( throughout these tapes the use of the term " withdrawal " is confusing because it is clearly used in reference to the aid issue but can be interpreted — as Hilsman does in this written record — as about the commitment ) .
Hilsman recounts the subsequent discussion linking aid and the South Vietnamese generals , and he , too , notes the Helms briefing on CIA support possibilities for the plotters ( in this instance declassified since 1987 ) which is deleted from the newly released audiotape .
In some cases differences are a matter of nuance .
Where Hilsman records Ambassador Nolting saying " The Generals may well want to retain Diem , " on the tape Nolting 's comment is that " removal of the Nhus is what they 're after . "
As in the NSC record of this meeting , the private session that considered what cables to send the U.S. embassy is absent from Hilsman 's account .
Item 15 : State Department Cable , Department - Saigon no 272 , August 29 , 1963
SOURCE : Lyndon B. Johnson Library : Johnson Papers : National Security File : Country File : Vietnam , temporary box 263 , folder : " Hilsman , Roger ( Diem ) . "
The first of two cables which President Kennedy approved after the noon meeting at the White House , this one instructed Ambassador Lodge that General Harkins was to tell the South Vietnamese generals that the indications of support for the plotters previously conveyed only by CIA officers represented the policy of the United States government .
Before making " specific understandings , " however , Harkins was to seek more details of the plots , with the generals to be told that the U.S. " will support a coup which has [ a ] good chance of succeeding but plans no direct involvement of U.S. Armed Forces . "
Ambassador Lodge himself was authorized to announce a suspension of U.S. aid through the Diem government " at a time and under conditions of your choice , " though attempting " to minimize [ the ] appearance of collusion with [ the ] Generals . "
Item 16 : State Department Cable , Department - Saigon no.
279 , August 29 , 1963
SOURCE : John F. Kennedy Library : Kennedy Papers , National Security File , Country File , box 198A , folder : " Vietnam : General , State Cables 8/24/63-8/31/63 . "
The second of the two cables , this again went over the ground of whether Diem and the Nhus could be separated or had to be dealt with as " a single package . "
The cable further informed Ambassador Lodge that views at " the highest level " in Washington were that a diplomatic approach in a talk with Diem " could not succeed if it were cast purely in terms of persuasion , " and thus needed to include " a real sanction " — the aid cutoff .
Also , " if such an approach were to be made it might properly await the time when others were ready to move immediately to constitute a new government . "

Hilsman 's notes record his daily activities , including phone calls and office meetings , sessions with other officials in their offices along with the meeting times and the participants .
The notes include occasional notations on discussion subjects .
The Hilsman diary is very informative on the extent of his contact with the Central Intelligence Agency .

Yah , the Earth ’s never , ever , been hotter , the “ hockey stick ” proves it , it ’s unprecedented , and its all your fault !
Well , we ’ve known it ’s unsubstantiated spin for quite a long time .
NOAA apparently has too , because the data presented in this video is in fact from NOAA and is from the year 2000 on their website .
But you do n’t see it publicized much .
Why ?
Well , because it totally destroys claims of “ unprecedented warming ” in our present day .
The source of inspiration is from my post Hockey stick observed in NOAA ice core data .
And the source of inspiration for that is from J. Storrs Hall , writing here .
WUWT reader “ docattheautopsy ” produced a YouTube video for us for distribution for which I ’m grateful and you can see below .
I ’ve also produced an animated GIF which is done somewhat like a video , since not all blogs and websites can support video .
Here is the low - res version at 480 pixels wide .
As you go back in time , our “ unprecendented ” temperatures of the present day do n’t seem quite so large , when put in perspective of geologic time .
Here are the permalinks to both the low - res and hi-def versions :

Hi-Definition : http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/noaa_gisp2_icecore_anim_hi-def3.gif
And here is a YouTube video showing the same process :
Just a couple of caveats to mention :
1 ) The ice core data from Greenland does n’t go past the year 1900
2 ) The reason for this is that ice is formed by the compaction of snow , that takes time .
Young snow , and snow in transition to becoming ice through compaction is not a reliable indicator yet .
3 ) From the observed temperature change in the last century , one could add about a .5C to 0.7C line to the end of the ice core data .
It does not change the conclusion .
UPDATE : Upon further thought ,
In version 3 of the animation , I decided to do this to be a better comparison to the Mann / IPCC chart shown , since that is what they did also .
The instrumental record for the last century ( ~ 0.7C ) is shown in red , approximately fit to each scale .
4 ) My first animated GIF had a labeling error due to using a template .
I forgot to label the Vostok Ice Core presentation separately .
Fixed now and links updated .
If you grabbed links in the first 30 minutes , please note they have changed .

The human sensory experience is far more complex and nuanced than previously thought , according to a groundbreaking new study published in the December 15 issue of the journal Pain .
In the article , researchers at Albany Medical College , the University of Liverpool and Cambridge University report that the human body has an entirely unique and separate sensory system aside from the nerves that give most of us the ability to touch and feel .
Surprisingly , this sensory network is located throughout our blood vessels and sweat glands , and is for most people , largely imperceptible .
" It 's almost like hearing the subtle sound of a single instrument in the midst of a symphony , " said senior author Frank Rice , PhD , a Neuroscience Professor at Albany Medical College ( AMC ) , who is a leading authority on the nerve supply to the skin .
" It is only when we shift focus away from the nerve endings associated with normal skin sensation that we can appreciate the sensation hidden in the background . "
The research team discovered this hidden sensory system by studying two unique patients who were diagnosed with a previously unknown abnormality by lead author David Bowsher , M.D. , Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Liverpool 's Pain Research Institute .
These patients had an extremely rare condition called congenital insensitivity to pain , meaning that they were born with very little ability to feel pain .
Other rare individuals with this condition have excessively dry skin , often mutilate themselves accidentally and usually have severe mental handicaps .
" Although they had a few accidents over their lifetimes , what made these two patients unique was that they led normal lives .
Excessive sweating brought them to the clinic , where we discovered their severe lack of pain sensation , " said Dr. Bowsher .
" Curiously , our conventional tests with sensitive instruments revealed that all their skin sensation was severely impaired , including their response to different temperatures and mechanical contact .
But , for all intents and purposes , they had adequate sensation for daily living and could tell what is warm and cold , what is touching them , and what is rough and smooth . "
The mystery deepened when Dr. Bowsher sent skin biopsies across the ocean to Dr. Rice 's laboratory , which focuses on multi-molecular microscopic analyses of nerve endings in the skin , especially in relation to chronic pain conditions such as those caused by nerve injuries , diabetes , and shingles .
These unique analyses were pioneered by Dr. Rice at Albany Medical College ( AMC ) along with collaborators at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
" Under normal conditions , the skin contains many different types of nerve endings that distinguish between different temperatures , different types of mechanical contact such as vibrations from a cell phone and movement of hairs , and , importantly , painful stimuli , " said Dr. Rice .
" Much to our surprise , the skin we received from England lacked all the nerve endings that we normally associated with skin sensation .
So how were these individuals feeling anything ? "
The answer appeared to be in the presence of sensory nerve endings on the small blood vessels and sweat glands embedded in the skin .
" For many years , my colleagues and I have detected different types of nerve endings on tiny blood vessels and sweat glands , which we assumed were simply regulating blood flow and sweating .
We did n't think they could contribute to conscious sensation .
However , while all the other sensory endings were missing in this unusual skin , the blood vessels and sweat glands still had the normal types of nerve endings .
Apparently , these unique individuals are able to ' feel things ' through these remaining nerve endings , " said Dr. Rice .
" What we learned from these unusual individuals is that there 's another level of sensory feedback that can give us conscious tactile information .
Problems with these nerve endings may contribute to mysterious pain conditions such as migraine headaches and fibromyalgia , the sources of which are still unknown , making them very difficult to treat . "
In addition to international collaborations such as this one , Dr. Rice and his principle AMC colleague , Dr. Philip Albrecht , in the Center for Neuropharmacology and Neuroscience , collaborate extensively with neurologists Dr. Charles Argoff at AMC and Dr. James Wymer of Upstate Clinical Research Associates , who also holds a joint AMC appointment .
All are co-authors on the study , which included normal subjects from the Albany , N.Y. area .
Several studies on chronic pain are being conducted by this team with support from National Institutes of Heath ( NIH ) and several pharmaceutical companies .
Scientists at the University of York have discovered how certain bacteria such as Escherichia coli have evolved to capture rare sugars from their environment giving them an evolutionary advantage in naturally competitive environments like the human gut .
Microbes are well - known for their ability to grow in demanding and nutritionally poor environments , which has allowed them to colonise some of the most remote places on the planet .
Bacteria living in theoretically nutrient - rich environments like the mammalian intestine face similar challenges due to intense competition between bacterial species in the intestine for the finite amount of available food .
Researchers led by Dr Gavin Thomas in the University 's Department of Biology discovered that a protein present in the intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli was a unique sugar transporter .
Common sugars like glucose form a cyclic structure called a ' pyranose ' when dissolved in water .
All transporters for glucose recognise the pyranose form .
But , for sugars such as galactose , which is commonly found in dairy produce , around 10 per cent is found in a different ring form called a ' furanose ' .
Initial work on the unknown E. coli transporter by Dr Thomas 's team suggested that it was a galactose transporter .
The researchers knew that E. coli has a galactopyranose transporter already , so why should the bacterium have evolved another system to do exactly the same thing ?
The answer to the problem was discovered when researchers led by Professor Keith Wilson in the York Structural Biology Laboratory solved the 3D structure of the protein , revealing that it was bound to the rarer furanose form of galactose .
Experiments by Dr. Jennifer Potts in the University 's Centre for Magnetic Resonance confirmed that the transporter was the first biological example to recognise furanose over pyranose forms .
Dr Thomas said : " The picture that emerges is that bacteria have evolved many related transporters to allow them to exploit every possible potential source of nutrient in their environment .
Being able to use the extra 10 per cent of galactose available in the gut appears a trivial adaptation .
But it is exactly the small change required to allow E. coli to grow a little bit faster when galactose is present in the gut , and so persist at the expense of other species of bacteria . "
The work was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .

Earlier , ISP BT predicted that operating an anti-filesharing scheme in the UK would cost £ 365 m a year .
Now the government has admitted that not only will broadband customers have to foot a £ 500 m bill , but that burden will prove too great for 40,000 households - who will have no choice but to give up their Internet connections .
The music industry ’s own research indicates that , on a ridiculous ‘ one download equals one lost sale ’ basis , losses to online piracy will amount to £ 200 m ( $ 319.67 m ) in the UK during 2009 .
Labeling the claims “ melodramatic , ” in September boss of ISP BT ’s consumer division , John Petter , warned that proposed measures to tackle these supposed loses would prove costly for ISPs – a staggering £ 365 m ( $ 583.4 m ) a year .
Today , according to a new report , government ministers have admitted that the costs will amount to £ 500 m ( $ 799.2 m ) .
ISPs say that issuing warnings will cost every customer £ 1.40 ( $ 2.24 ) and otherwise meddling with accounts at the behest of the music industry will add £ 25 ( $ 40 ) total to an annual subscription .
Worryingly , ministers say that this extra cost will force 40,000 UK households offline , with BT ’s John Petter calling the plans “ collective punishment that goes against natural justice . ”
Jeremy Hunt , the Shadow Culture Secretary , said that it is “ grossly unfair ” for the government to force all broadband customers to foot the bill , and noted that forcing tens of thousands offline will go against government targets of increasing Internet take - up among the most disadvantaged communities .
“ We are confident that those costs will be a mere fraction of the stratospheric sums suggested by some ISPs , ” a BPI spokesman told The Times , adding , “ .. and negligibly small when set against their vast annual revenues . ”
British music churned over £ 3.6bn in 2008 , up by 4.7 % .
In the same year British films accounted for 15 % of worldwide box office takings , totaling £ 2.6 bn ( $ 4.2bn ) – an increase of $ 1bn over 2007 .
So , if this anti-piracy scheme really is destined to bring them an extra £ 1.7 billion extra in media sales over the next 10 years , why do n’t they offset these “ negligibly small ” costs against their own “ vast revenues ” ?
Because they can get the customer to pay , of course .
When this £ 25 charge is added to customer accounts , ISPs up and down the UK should put the amount separately on the bill as an extra item which clearly reads “ Music industry surcharge . ”
Let ’s see how that affects piracy and , indeed , the attitudes of people who now quite rightly feel they should at least be getting some music for their money .
Well , well , well ...
It has been interesting to see Republicans and Senate moderates pivot in their arguments against the public option recently .
It seems like they knew the fiscal argument was no longer operative .
Under the $ 905 billion version favored by liberals , compensation rates for medical providers in the government - run insurance plan would be based on Medicare rates , which are significantly lower than private rates .
That idea , which Senate liberals also support , would hold down costs for the government , according to the CBO , but it would create a problem for providers in rural areas where Medicare rates tend to run much lower than the national average .
Under the $ 859 billion version , administrators would negotiate rates directly with doctors and hospitals , the option preferred by moderate Democrats from rural areas .
The link to Medicare rates has been a very contentious issue and Sen.
Conrad has been using this as a primary basis for his argument against the public option once his we do n't have the votes charade ended .
The CPC has been holding extremely firm on their Medicare +5 requirement .
However , the fact that both bills basically meet the President 's financial requirements is huge .
This gives them a lot of leverage .
The moderates like Sen. Mary Landrieu and Sen. Ben Nelson are now only left with the Republican argument that this is a " government take over " of health care ( which the media dutifully reiterates using Frank Luntz 's language .
I notice the word " public option " is not used in the bolded quote above ) .
There is simply no other argument against having a public option remaining .
If they are truly fiscally conservative , they would change course stat .
My guess is that they will simply find new arguments , because there is big time insurance lobby money to be had .
But we will see .
There is now no doubt that a public option could easily be included in the final bill .
Only the slippery slope conspiracy theory remains .
If the public option is not in the final bill , we will have no choice but to assume there are certain Democrats who quite simply have no interest in real , robust health care reform .
Instead , it will be clear their constituency resides on K St. , not their home states .
It is time for Progressives in the Senate and House to join forces and make it clear to the moderates and the WH that they now have a line in the sand .
No trigger free public option for all = A No Vote on Health Care Reform .
Blue Dogs and Senate Moderates have been coddled to long .
If Progressives are ever going to take a stand , they now have all of the ammunition they need .
Let 's give the support they need to maintain the firewall .
We can do it folks , if we keep the pressure on .
We are the ones we have been waiting for .
Update [ 2009-10-16 10:10:12 by justmy2 ] :
Thanks for the recs everyone ... this is great news and provides an important arrow in the progressive quiver to bring to the negotiation table in conference , and hopefully gives Sen .
Dodd a bit more power in the Senate merger negotiations .
I hope Senate progressives can now make the same progress with their recalcitrant colleagues in the same way the Pelosi was able to pull Blue Dogs along .
We are getting there folks .
But now is not the time to let up .
Reform opponents have no cards .
If Progressives are ever going to go all in , now is the time .
This is the moment to make history .
Update [ 2009-10-16 10:10:12 by justmy2 ] :
An important note provided by BennyToothpick in comments .
The CBO did not provide an estimate of whether either of the bills will be deficit neutral according to the article .
This does n't mean that it is not deficit neutral , but it is outstanding , and I wanted to make sure that part was clear .
However , it does meet the President 's cost targets .
Update [ 2009-10-17 10:13:16 by justmy2 ] :
While I was away from site access ,
It was pointed out in comments that the Baucus bill was actually scored at $ 829 billion .
I mistakenly thought the President 's $ 900 b goal was the Baucus score .
I think that $ 900 billion number has been hammered into my head .
I have corrected the title to be more accurate .
However the point of the diary remains that the fiscal argument against the public option has been removed .
I regret the error .

Each year , human beings put vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through processes like the combustion of fossil fuels or the clearing land for agriculture .
Thankfully , the majority of it does n't stay there , as there are a number of significant carbon sinks that pull somewhere around 60 percent of human emissions back out of the air , dissolving it into the oceans and sequestering it in growing forests .
One of the worries about our continued carbon emissions is that these sinks could eventually start to fill , increasing the challenge involved in limiting the levels of atmospheric carbon .
Two new studies have looked at the issue , and they come to what appear to be very different conclusions .
Any process that removes carbon from the atmosphere can act as a carbon sink .
These include basic processes like having the gas dissolve into the ocean , to more complex ones , like the sequestration that appears to take place in mature forests .
The cumulative impact , however , is huge ; carbon sinks are estimated to remove about 60 percent of the CO 2 that human activity puts in the atmosphere annually .
( The remaining 40 percent is termed the airborne fraction . )
There are a number of factors that may change the ability of many of these sinks to continue absorbing .
On the plus side , agricultural efficiency has allowed extensive reforestation in the industrialized world , and the restored forests should be acting as new carbon sinks .
Obviously , however , not everything is a positive .
In the oceans , increasing temperatures limit the amount of gas that can dissolve , which should slow the oceanic sink .
On land , the fertilization effect of additional carbon dioxide will eventually tail off as other factors , like water or trace nutrients , begin to limit plant growth .
The uncertainty about when and to what degree the sinks would start to lose capacity has made them an active area of study .
So it 's no surprise that two papers that attempt to track the behavior of the sinks were published in rapid succession , one in Geophysical Research Letters , the second in Nature Geoscience .
The surprise may be that they 're being promoted as if they contradict each other .
Both papers use a similar methodology : total up the estimates of global emissions from various sources , and figure out what the airborne fraction is .
The remainder has to be going into carbon sinks .
But the two operate on very different time scales .
The GRL paper starts all the way back in 1850 , and comes to the conclusion that the airborne fraction has been increasing , but only by about 0.7 percent a decade ; the uncertainties are nearly twice that , making it statistically indistinguishable from zero .
In contrast , the Nature Geo paper starts its analysis in 1960 , when the post - war boom in carbon emissions was really kicking in .
It sees a more pronounced trend , one of 0.3 � 0.2 percent a year , which they say has a 90 percent probability of being statistically significant .
Why the difference ?
The rate of human CO 2 emissions rises dramatically starting in 1960 .
By lumping those later years with data that extends back to 1850 , the GRL paper runs the risk of having earlier data swamp more recent ( and , arguably , relevant ) trends .
In addition , it necessarily extends into years where reporting on things like land use was sketchy or nonexistent , creating more significant uncertainties .
There 's also a difference in interpretation ; the author of the GRL paper actually sees what appears to be an increase in the airborne fraction after the year 2000 .
But he ascribes this to differences in how land use changes are accounted for ( in one scenario , he estimates that land use emissions figures are off by over 80 percent ) .
He also repeats his analysis using approaches employed in other publications , and does see a significant trend for the entire time period .
To an extent , the authors of the Nature Geosciences paper agree with him , as they find land use trends in recent years to be problematic .
In their case , they suggest that singular events in recent years have swamped some trends .
Burning of forests shot up in Indonesia during an El Ni�o inflicted drought , then plunged as rainier conditions returned .
Deforestation of the Amazon has plunged in the last year , for reasons that are unclear .
Nevertheless , they see a trend that 's distinct from these one - time events over longer periods .
So , are carbon sinks beginning to reach their limits ?
Given the two papers , I have to admit I lack the expertise to judge .
What is clear , however , is that two extremely cautious and technical papers have been handled awkwardly from a media perspective .
The GRL paper was heralded with a press release that touted it as " Controversial new climate change data , " even though it did n't directly address climate change , and actually applies new methods to existing data sets .
Two articles removed from the press release , and you end up with an article that claims " new research shows that atmospheric levels of CO2 have effectively remained unchanged since the advent of the industrial revolution . "
It 's hard to imagine anyone getting it so badly wrong .
This seems to have prodded Nature publishing to respond ; normally , Nature Geoscience papers are released on Sundays .
An exception was made to release this one on a Tuesday , accompanied by a press conference .
One of the universities involved also felt compelled to issue a press release .
The title on this one was at least accurate , but focused on carbon emissions when these figures are widely estimated and reported already .
These are two highly technical papers that use different data sets and different methods ; it 's no surprise that they 've reached different conclusions , and it will probably take the scientific community a few months of digesting them and comparing them to previously published work in order to reach a consensus on which one ( if either ) is likely to better reflect reality .
Using them to generate competing coverage in the popular press does n't do a public that understands climate science poorly any favors .

Fruit bat sex , zombie invasions and the psychology of bus stops : Kiwi scientists are gathering in Hamilton this week to explore some of the year 's more unusual findings from the frontiers of scientific research .
The scientists , who meet sporadically to explore the latest ideas in science and technology at an event known as Cafe Scientifique , have abandoned the more serious scientific issues of the day for an end - of - year discussion about what it takes to mathematically model the consequences of a zombie invasion or just what fruit bats do during mating .
As fascinating as fruit bats and zombies are , it is a paper titled " Why Does Public Transport Not Arrive On Time ? " that perhaps offers the most practical relevance to society .
That research was carried out by Mexican scientists who have proven what commuters have known since the advent of public transport : the longer you wait for a bus , the greater the chance that two will come along almost simultaneously .
It may help to know the scientific term for this is " equal headway instability phenomenon " .
Better yet , not only have scientists studied the problem , they 're also offering a couple of potential solutions .
It can all be avoided , they say , " with appropriate passenger behaviours " .
In other words , you have the power to make the bus arrive on time .
That 's because , the researchers say , technology alone wo n't solve the problem .
Even with dedicated bus lanes and sympathetic traffic lights that turn green when a bus pulls up to an intersection , the bus still wo n't stick to the timetable .
Here 's the secret : if passengers want buses to come more regularly they have to be better behaved .
The scientists recommend :
* Do n't get on a crowded bus .
If a crowded bus arrives after you 've been waiting for ages , it 's very probable that empty buses wo n't be far behind .
Waiting might mean getting to your destination faster .
* Let people get off before you try to get on .
Trying to " win " and get on before everybody else only causes more delays .
* If you do get on a crowded bus , do n't stand near the doors .
" Giving space to ascending and descending people will accelerate the travel . "
Waikato University 's Dr Marcus Wilson , who helps organise Cafe Scientifique , admitted that while the research was sound , the recommendations were an exercise in stating the obvious .
" But it does prove that it 's not just our perception , it is actually true . "
The issue Wilson is most keen on exploring at the scientific get - together is whether the bird that dropped some bread on the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland recently was actually sent from the future to sabotage the project .
Physicists hope to use the $ 14 billion , 27 km - long atom - smasher to prove the existence of the Higgs boson , or " God particle " , which appears to give matter in the universe its mass .
But the baguette - believed to have been dropped by a bird - caused serious damage .
Cafe Scientifique will discuss a theory getting wide airing on internet science blogs , that the bird came from a point in the future to prevent the Higgs boson being discovered .
As for the scientific conclusions on the projected effects of zombie attacks : disastrous .
And fruit - bat sex ?
Let 's just say if it was a movie , getting it past the censors would be an issue .
* Cafe Scientifique is open to the public and meets at Hamilton 's The Bank on Tuesday at 7.30 pm .
www.sci.waikato.ac.nz/cafescientifique/
* Cafe Scientifique also meets in Wellington in Te Papa at Espresso on Level 4 on the first Thursday of the month ( except Dec , Jan ) at 6.30 pm , and at Cafe Reka at The New Dowse , Laings Road , Lower Hutt on the last Thursday of the month ( except Dec , Jan ) at 6 pm .
[ The following statement was released by neurologist Dr. Laura Boylan after her arrest on Thursday morning in midtown Manhattan for sitting down with others in front of the building housing the offices of Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , and refusing to move .
She was charged with disorderly conduct and released shortly afterward . ]
I was arrested this morning in an act of peaceful civil disobedience along with a diverse group of seven others , including a medical student and a nurse , similarly passionate about Medicare for All .
Ours was one of 17 actions organized by Mobilization for Health Care for All across the country to honor International Human Rights Day .
We blocked the doors to Sen. Charles Schumer ’s office building .
Sen .
Schumer is a powerful player in health reform .
This week some senators have proposed expanding Medicare to cover those 55 and over .
No details of the plan have been released , but the idea has been floated .
I ’m a physician with the American majority who ’d really like in on Medicare .
I support Medicare for All , single - payer health care for all .
Medicare ’s not perfect , but we can make Medicare 2.0 .
It ’s the only way to get quality , universal access and affordability .
Its principal weakness is the threat it poses to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
Many congressmen and senators , including Sen .
Schumer , say they support Medicare for All or acknowledge its superiority .
They insist , however , that it is “ politically unfeasible . ”
This is not because Americans are anti-Medicare – far from it .
Medicare is one of American ’s most beloved public programs .
As the coins hit the fan , the time will come when it will be politically unfeasible to continue to bailout our for - profit insurance industry with taxpayer subsidies .
Medicare provides much higher value for our health care dollar with no money siphoned off in administrative multi-payer waste and stockholder profits .
Meanwhile people are dying .
I am not speaking metaphorically ; I have seen people dying from lack of access to care .
Most recently last month it was a 42 - year - old mother of two with a big bleed in her brain from uncontrolled blood pressure .
She ’d been cutting back on the pills she could n’t afford .
Fear is being promoted in the land , the idea that we are not all in this together .
That if you want yours , someone else must go with less or without .
It ’s the “ illegals , ” the “ fatties , ” the smokers , the oldies , the “ Medicaid cheats ” and so on .
This is a big lie .
We can all do better with single - payer Medicare for All .
Only by having “ everybody in , nobody out ” can Americans get real choice , real freedom and real security .
How often does the universe breathe an opening where quality and low cost are bedfellows , where justice and mercy meet and shake hands , where the pragmatic is both just and beautiful ?
One life sacrificed to health insurance profits is too much .
Right now 45,000 people a year die from lack of insurance .
The congressional plan that covers the most people will leave at least 18 million uncovered .
There can be no freedom of opportunity where there is no guaranteed health care .
On this day of human rights , we put our bodies on the line to affirm that health care is a human right .
We , his constituents , insist to Sen .
Schumer : Medicare enrollment should start at birth .
DESK CLERK : Welcome to the Bethlehem Inn . May I help you ?
JOSEPH : Yes , we have a reservation for Joseph and Mary .
DESK CLERK : Oh , I 'm sorry , sir .
I 'm not finding any reservation under those names .
JOSEPH : What ?
No , look again , we have a reservation .
DESK CLERK : Maybe you have your confirmation number ?
JOSEPH : What ?
No , I must have left it in my other robe .
But we do have a reservation !
Can you get your manager ?
DESK CLERK : Right away , sir .
MANAGER : Good evening , sir .
What seems to be the problem ?
JOSEPH : You lost our reservation we 'd just really like to get some sleep .
MANAGER : Understood , sir .
Let 's see what we can do here .
I have a very spacious pharaoh suite , if that would suit your needs .
JOSEPH : Yes , yes , anything .
I just need a room .
My wife is pregnant and could deliver at any moment .
MANAGER : Oh dear , I 'm afraid I 'll have to charge you the triple occupancy rate in that case .
JOSEPH : No , you do n't understand .
She 's endowed with the Holy Spirit .
MANAGER : Twins ?
Well , congratulations !
I will have to charge quadruple occupancy , unfortunately .
MARY : Ooh , felt him kick !
Some 23,300 nuclear weapons are stored at 111 locations around the world ( click for map
.
By Hans M. Kristensen
The world ’s approximately 23,300 nuclear weapons are stored at an estimated 111 locations in 14 countries , according to an overview produced by FAS and NRDC .
Nearly half of the weapons are operationally deployed with delivery systems capable of launching on short notice .
The overview is published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and includes the July 2009 START memorandum of understanding data .
A previous version was included in the annual report from the International Panel of Fissile Materials published last month .
Figure 2 :
Saratov Nuclear Sites
More than 1,000 nuclear weapons surround Saratov .
Russia has an estimated 48 permanent nuclear weapon storage sites , of which more than half are on bases for operational forces .
There are approximately 19 storage sites , of which about half are national - level storage facilities .
In addition , a significant number of temporary storage sites occasionally store nuclear weapons in transit between facilities .
This is a significant consolidation from the estimated 90 Russian sites ten years ago , and more than 500 sites before 1991 .
Many of the Russian sites are in close proximity to each other and large populated areas .
One example is the Saratov area where the city is surrounded by a missile division , a strategic bomber base , and a national - level storage site with probably well over 1,000 nuclear warheads combined ( Figure 2 ) .
The United States stores its nuclear weapons at 21 locations in 13 states and five European countries .
This is a consolidation from the estimated 24 sites ten year ago , 50 at the end of the Cold War , and 164 in 1985 ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 :
B61 Nuclear Bombs in Storage
Approximately 50 B61 nuclear bombs inside an igloo at what might be Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada .
Seventy - five igloos at Nellis store “ one of the largest stockpile in the free world , ” according to the U.S. Air Force , one of four central storage sites in the United States .
.
Europe has about the same number of nuclear weapon storage locations as the Continental United States , with weapons scattered across seven countries .
This includes seven sites in France and four in Britain .
Five non-nuclear NATO countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , and Turkey ) still host U.S. nuclear weapons first deployed there during the Cold War .
We estimate that China has 8 - 14 facilities associated with nuclear weapons , most likely closer to the lower number , near bases with units that operate nuclear missiles or aircraft .
None of the weapons are believed to be fully operational but stored separate from delivery vehicles at sites controlled by the Central Military Commission .
Is There a Nuclear Weapons Storage Site on Hainan Island ?
Where does China store nuclear warheads for its ballistic missile submarines ?
The naval base near Julin on Hainan Island has extensive underground facilities .
An alternative to the base itself could potentially be a facility elsewhere on the island , such as Foluo Air Base where construction of an underground facility began five years before the first SSBN arrived at Hainan .
Or are the weapons stored on the mainland ?

.
Israel probably has about four nuclear sites , whereas the nuclear storage facilities in India and Pakistan are – despite many rumors – largely undetermined .
All three countries are thought to store warheads separate from delivery vehicles .
Despite two nuclear tests and many rumors , we are unaware of publicly available evidence that North Korea has operationalized its nuclear weapons capability .
Warhead concentrations vary greatly from country to country .
With 13,000 warheads at 48 sites , Russian stores an average of 270 warheads at each location .
The U.S. concentration is much higher with an average of 450 warheads at each location .
These are averages , however , and in reality the distribution is thought to be much more uneven with some sites only storing tens of warheads .
.
Finally , a word of caution is in order : estimates such as these obviously come with a great deal of uncertainty , as we do n’t have access to classified intelligence estimates .
Based on publicly available information and our own assumptions we have nonetheless produced a best estimate that we hope will assist the public debate .
Comments and suggestions are encouraged so we can adjust the overview in the future .

Hello all !
As promished , I am kicking off my blog with a countdown of some of my all - time favorite sexy nerds .
These women define what it means to be smart , quirky , and incredibly hot all at once .
They project strong , positive role models to the public , and emphasize that being a geek and loving it is n’t only okay , it ’s amazing .
10 . Jewel Staite :
Coming in at number 10 is the adorably geeky Jewel Staite .
If her space - age time on “ Battlestar Galactica , ” as well as the cult classics “ Firefly ” and adapted film “ Serenity ” do n’t give her due credentials , the girl has a history of going for the final frontier .
She got her start on the kids ’
Nickelodeon 90 ’s series “ Space Cases , ” playing an alien with an imaginary friend .
She also starred with Ben Foster “ who played Archangel in ‘ X3 : The Last Stand ’ on the popular 90 ’s Disney show “ Flash Forward . ”
This space cadet cutie just had to be on our list !
9. Alexis Bledel :
When she ’s not being classically beautiful , with that old Hollywood Audrey Hepburn softness , Bledel is paving the way for nerds everywhere .
She started off starring alongside Lauren Graham on the CW ’s “ Gilmore Girls ” playing Rory ; the quiet , quirky bookworm who made reading very , very sexy .
She also played shy , artsy Lena in “ Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , ” and has since joined the cast of “ ER ” in the final season .
On top of her amazingly brainy characters , Bledel attended NYU ’S Tisch School of the Arts , has AMAZING music tastes ( Radiohead , Incubus , and Less than Jake are among her favorites ) , and was an extra in the uber - nerd film of this generation , “ Rushmore .
8. Kate Beckinsale :
: A countdown would n’t be complete without our vampire sexpot , Kate Beckinsale .
While “ Twilight ” may have grossed bajillions in the box office , “ Underworld ” grossed over 5 million at its release , not bad for a vampire movies “ that is , when vampire movies are n’t a pre-teen trendy money factory . ”
Kate also co-starred with hunky Hugh Jackman ( who ALSO had his own nerd creds as Wolverine ) in “ Van Helsing . ”
Our bloodsucking queen is also a smarty pants ; she attended Oxford University and is fluent in French , German and Russian .
I imagine that makes her smarter than Bella Swan …
7. Danica McKellar :
America ’s sweetheart of the VERY early 90’s ( pre-Topana Lawrence ) was Winnie Cooper , aka Danica McKellar of “ The Wonder Years . ”
McKellar vanished from the limelight for almost twenty years before resurfacing as a published author of “ Math Does n’t Suck . ”
The woman is a powerhouse : filmmaker , actress , lingerie model … she graduated from UCLA with a BS in Mathematics , and even proved a new math theorem , the Chayes - McKellar - Winn Theorem .
And after almost two decades , the girl still looks gorgeous .
Maybe if she ’d been MY math teacher , I would n’t think that math sucked .
6. Mila Kunis
Ukrainian - born Mila Kunis is hands - down one of the sexiest chicks in Hollywood today .
But her love of World of Warcraft , her role as Meg on “ Family Guy ” and her frequent appearances on Comedy Central ’s “ Robot Chicken ” make her a must - have on this list .
Not to mention her role in adapted graphic novel “ Max Payne ” where she learned to shoot a gun .
There ’s nothing sexier than a nerd with a firearm .
5. Thora Birch
When I look at Thora Birch , I still see the precocious little Danny from “ Hocus Pocus . ”
Although seeing Thora get nude in “ American Beauty ” can kind put the term hocus pocus in a whole new light .
That cult classic role , plus her myriad of roles in independent films and her vegetarian advocacy , gives her a spot on the list .
Plus , the girl played Empress Savina in “ Dungeons and Dragons . ”
I mean , if that does n’t seal the deal …
4. Felicia Day
What can I say about Felicia Day ?
Other than amazingly gorgeous , brilliant , adorably quirky , and overall awesome ?
That probably sums it up .
Day started off with an assortment of small roles , including a spot as a potential slayer on the last season of “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer . ”
Since , she has become an internet powerhouse ; starring in “ Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog , ” “ The Legend of Neil , ” and her own created internet show “ The Guild . ”
Day is writer , director , and actor , as well as an avid blogger and Twitterer .
On top of everything , the girl got a BA in mathematics from the University of Texas .
It ’d be an insult not to put her on this countdown .
3. Anna Paquin
Paquin defined this generation ’s sexy superhero as Rogue in the X - Men trilogy .
Now she ’s playing psychic / waitress Sookie Stackhouse in HBO ’s “ True Blood . ”
A gorgeous tribute to fantasy lovers everywhere , the youngest - ever Oscar winner also attended Columbia University , and had childhood dreams of becoming the Prime Minister of New Zealand .
I do n’t know who the Prime Minister is now , but I ’m pretty sure sexy nerd Anna is far more qualified to fill those shoes .
2. Alyson Hannigan
Just look at Alyson Hannigan .
The girl defines nerd ( and I mean that in the most flattering way possible ) .
A sexy , adorably cute redhead with a quirky sense of humor , the girl pretty much defines what it means to be a sexy nerd .
She played a bookworm - turned - hot lesbian wicca in “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer , ” as well as the role of nymphomaniac band geek Michelle in “ American Pie . ”
She majored in Psychology at California State University , and is married to “ Buffy ” co-star Alexis Denisof ( Wesley Wyndam - Price on both ‘ Buffy ’ and its spinoff ‘ Angel ’ ) , who was named number 2 on the sexiest men in the Buffyverse list .
An inspiration to aspiring sexy nerds everywhere , we bow down to thee , Alyson .
1. Eliza Dushku
Rolling in at number one on the countdown is our newest inductee into the sexy nerds coven , Eliza Dushku .
Dusku is a rising star in the cult art of the hot geek .
She built up her creds as the bad slayer on “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer , ” and has now rejoined Joss Whedon on the new smash hit show “ Dollhouse , ” where she plays a girl whose mind has been erased and re-programmed to be the perfect woman to any high - paying client of the business known as the Dollhouse .
She ’ll also be starring in the upcoming horror flick “ Open Graves . ”
In my opinion , Dushku only has more incredibly nerdy roles to come ( can anyone else see her reprising Wonder Woman ? )
A Pakistani court has ordered that two men have their ears and noses cut off , as punishment for doing the same to a woman who refused to marry one of them .
The two brothers were found guilty of kidnapping 20 - year - old Fazeelat Bibi , one of their cousins , in September .
The judge in Lahore also sentenced them to life in prison .
Sentence was passed on Monday under a rarely invoked Islamic law dating from the 1980s .
In the past similar sentences have been revoked on appeal .
' Eye for an eye '
Government prosecutor Ehtisham Qadir said the punishment had been awarded in accordance with the Islamic principle of " an eye for an eye " .
Sher Mohammad and Amanat abducted Fazeelat Bibi as she returned home from work at a brick kiln in the Raiwind area of Lahore , the court heard .
" They put a noose around her neck , and then cut off her ears and nose , " Mr Qadir told the BBC .
Three alleged accomplices are still being sought by police .
The crime was committed after Fazeelat Bibi 's parents refused to give her hand in marriage to Sher Mohammad , Mr Qadir said .
Islamic laws were introduced in Pakistan during the military regime of General Ziaul Haq in the 1980s .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says punishments prescribed under the laws have rarely been awarded , and never carried out .
Pakistani human rights activists have long campaigned for more to be done to stop attacks against women , which often include facial disfigurement .
However , they also disagree with the type of punishment handed out in Lahore , correspondents say .
From major conferences at the Moscone Center to small coffee shops in the Mission , San Franciscans are buzzing about Mayor Gavin Newsom and the stunning turn of fortune that in a few short days took him from being a candidate for governor to hiding out in Hawaii .
From Newsom 's highs , like his law - breaking same - sex marriages in 2004 , to his lows , like an admitted affair and alcohol problem in 2007 , the telegenic , risk - prone mayor has always given his constituents something to wag their tongues about - and this bizarre chapter is no different .
Last Friday , hours after speaking before a bank of television cameras about the oil spill in the bay , Newsom announced he was dropping out of the governor 's race and has n't been seen at City Hall since .
Word finally came Tuesday that he was on the Big Island with his wife , newborn daughter and in - laws .
He left without telling his staff , who abruptly canceled a raft of major appearances on his behalf .
Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said Thursday afternoon that the mayor was preparing to fly back to San Francisco Thursday night and expected him to be at City Hall today .
Previously , his staff had said they did n't know when he'd return .
It is unclear whether someone relayed the message to the mayor that his absence was being received at home about as well as a bright red sunburn .
The mayor may have gone quiet - not even using his beloved Twitter in more than a week - but city residents sure have n't .
" I do n't know why he disappeared , " said John Hosford , 68 , who was drinking coffee and doing a crossword puzzle at Javalencia in the Mission on Thursday morning .
" He must be reeling from his gubernatorial shock , so I feel like he 's taking a breather . "
Jessie Churchill , a 35 - year - old mom pushing twins in a stroller nearby , said she does n't begrudge Newsom a vacation , but anybody else would have been in major trouble for vanishing from work with no heads - up .
" It 's kind of typical - he seems to be a bit of a cad , " she said in a thick British accent .
Political analysts are similarly divided over Newsom 's vanishing act .
Barbara O'Connor , a political science professor at Sacramento State University , said the gubernatorial dropout clearly wanted to avoid the media and decompress - but did it in a childish way .
" To not let his staff know is not civil .
It 's petulant , " she said .
" I can certainly understand wanting to get out of Dodge , but you do it gracefully , you say you need some personal space and then you go away .
That 's the way big people do it . "
Corey Cook , a political science professor at the University of San Francisco , said the way Newsom behaves once he 's back at City Hall will determine his mayoral legacy .
" He 's clearly at a crossroads in terms of his career in public service , and he clearly has some decisions to make , " Cook said .
" If he comes back and says , ' Let 's get to work on the city 's business , and let 's start solving some of these fiscal problems , ' this will long be forgotten . "
But organizers and attendees of Newsom 's scheduled appearances this week may struggle to forget the mayoral brush - off .
Privately , several of them are steaming that the mayor left them in the lurch .
His staff made last - minute cancellations on long - planned engagements including addressing 2,000 people at the Silver SPUR Awards Luncheon at Moscone Center on Monday , speaking to 6,000 at the Urban Land Institute conference Wednesday , meeting at his request with a dozen top business leaders to talk about jobs and appearing with his new police chief to tout a citywide reduction in crime .
City
Hall folks have been buzzing about the missing mayor .
" How does it feel to work for Mark Sanford ? " one quipped to a member of Newsom 's staff in reference to the South Carolina governor who disappeared recently and said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail but had really gone to Argentina to rendezvous with his lover .
Ballard said Newsom 's explanation is much more mundane .
" He was feeling under the weather , and he wanted to spend some time with his wife and child , " he said .
" As a human being , he 's entitled to do that . "
Ballard stressed that Newsom 's " got a lot of work to do in City Hall , " and one of his first priorities is meeting with the parties involved in the three - day hotel strike at Grand Hyatt Union Square .
Shauna Joseph , 55 , was playing with her dog , Sophie , Thursday morning at a dog park near the mayor 's new home in the upper Haight .
She said Newsom must be exhausted from a grueling gubernatorial loss and a newborn keeping him up at night .
" I bet he 's stressed to the max , " she said .
" Maybe he 's kind of feeling defeated . "
While much about Newsom is unknown right now , that guess is probably a safe bet .
BEIJING / SINGAPORE , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - Chinese oil firms have agreed to buy a total of about 1.04 million barrels per day of crude from Saudi Arabia under a term pact finalised for 2010 , roughly 12 percent above the 2009 contract level , trading sources told Reuters .
The pace of growth quickens from a rate of under 10 percent seen this year over 2008 , as demand in the world ’s No.2 oil consumer looks poised to recover more on the back of China ’s solid economic expansion .
The 2010 amount includes about 200,000 barrels per day of supplies to Fujian Refining & PetroChemical Co Ltd ( FREP ) , which is 25 percent owned by state - run Saudi Aramco .

Recently by Matt Taibbi : The Best Goldman Apology Yet
During the week of the A.I.G. bailout alone , Mr. Paulson and Mr. Blankfein spoke two dozen times , the calendars show , far more frequently than Mr. Paulson did with other Wall Street executives .
On Sept. 17 , the day Mr. Paulson secured his waivers , he and Mr. Blankfein spoke five times .
Two of the calls occurred before Mr. Paulson ’s waivers were granted .
via During Crisis , Paulson ’s Calls to Goldman Posed Ethics Test — NYTimes.com .
I spoke with someone who was in the Fed offices the whole weekend prior to the AIG bailout , a government official , and he poses an interesting question .
Aside from the Fed , the Treasury , and the New York State Department of Insurance , the main players involved in the AIG bailout that weekend were AIG ( obviously ) , JP Morgan , Morgan Stanley , and Goldman Sachs .
There were swarms of bankers from the latter three banks there that weekend , poring over AIG ’s books , trying to figure out if AIG could be rescued without government help .
Spanking the Donkey : D... Matt Taibbi Best Price : $ 5.49 Buy New $ 40.87 ( as of 10:45 EST - Details )
Now , we know why AIG was there , obviously .
Morgan Stanley was there representing the Treasury ( it had been hired to advise the Treasury on the bailouts by Paulson during the Fannie / Freddie mess , with the rumor being that it was the only bank willing to give up market positions that would have left it too conflicted to do the work ) .
JP Morgan we know was there because AIG had hired them weeks before to come in and try to clean up its messes .
Only Goldman
Sachs did not have an official role at these proceedings .
So why was Goldman there ?
And why was Paulson calling Goldman two dozen times that week ?
This is one of the other problems with Gasparino ’s account ( u201 Cof course 
Blankfein was there that weekend , he says , not telling us why this is so obvious ) .
I ’m not sure I ’ve ever seen an official explanation for why Goldman was there that weekend ; the ostensible explanation that most people seem to accept is that Goldman naturally was there because it was such a large counterparty to AIG .
But I suspect we ’re going to find that Paulson was not on the phone two dozen times with executives from Deutsche Bank or Societe Generale or Barclays or Calyon , all of whom were significant counterparties to AIG as well .
Goldman was not even AIG ’s largest counterparty in the sec-lending wing of its business ( Deutsche Bank was , and would eventually receive $ 7 billion via the bailout as a result ) , and yet as far as I know there were no Deutsche reps there that weekend at all .
So what made Goldman special ?
This is a good question , I think .

Hi ,
I just released the 0.1 version of my Haskell Neural Network library on Hackage .
Instead of writing a long blog post , I created a page on the Haskell wiki that you can find here : HNN describing what is HNN , how to get it , showing a sample and all .
There is an online version of the documentation here : hnn documentation
You can also consult hnn ’s hackage page : hnn at hackage ( the documentation should be generated soon there )
Here is a sample showing how you can use HNN :

Where the Wild Things
Are is a beloved children 's book and now a beautiful movie .
But in the investment world there are really scary wild things lurking about in the hidden recesses of the economic landscape .
Today we look at one of the unintended consequences of the Federal Reserve 's low interest rate policy .
For quite some time , I have been arguing that we are faced with no good choices , not just in the US but in the entire " developed " world .
I see a low - growth , Muddle Through world over the next years ( with a double - dip recession just to liven things up ) .
However , that does not mean that we will lack for volatility .
Things could get volatile rather quickly .
Let 's quickly set the background .
It Is Not Just Japan
Let 's look at today 's interest rate picture .
Yesterday , we had the bizarre occurrence of banks actually paying the government to hold their cash .
Three - month treasuries yield a miniscule 0.01 % in interest .
If you opt to buy a one - year bill you get all of 0.26 % .
You can see the entire spectrum below .
Look at the graph of the yield curve below .
It is as steep as we have seen it in a long time .
But that is almost the point .
Banks are essentially getting free money .
If you are a banker and can't make money in this environment , you need to quit and find meaningful employment .
And that is part of the rationale that the Fed espouses with its low interest rate regime .
Not only does it allow banks to repair their balance sheets , it also encourages investors to put money into riskier assets in order to get some return on their investments .
Over $ 260 billion has gone into bond funds this year , and just $ 2.6 billion into stock funds .
However , you have to balance that with the fact that some $ 400 billion has left money market funds paying less than 0.2 % .
So there is some movement to capture yield .
But is it just banks that are getting cheap money ?
And is encouraging investors to find riskier assets a sound policy ?
Maybe not .
The Euro - Yen Cross and the Dollar Carry Trade
I wrote a great deal in the past few years about the strong correlation of the euro - yen cross to stock markets all over the world in general .
( The euro - yen cross is the exchange rate of the euro and the Japanese yen . )
This was a proxy for the Japanese carry trade .
The stock markets of the world rose and fell in synchronization with the yen versus the euro .
A currency carry trade is a strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher interest rate .
A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the difference between the rates , which can often be substantial , depending on the amount of leverage used .
The Japanese drove their rates down to essentially zero in the 1990s .
By early 2007 , it was estimated that the yen carry trade was over $ 1 trillion .
But when the world credit crisis hit , the world wanted dollars .
They paid back the yen and bought dollars , driving the yen higher and killing the yen carry trade .
Who wants to borrow in a currency that continues to rise , even if the costs are low ?
And often , large leverage was used , so small movements in the currency could destroy outsized amounts of capital .
But now , there are some who are beginning to ask whether there is a dollar carry trade .
In the last nine months , the correlation between the dollar and the stock market has gone to about 90 % .
If the dollar rises , the stock markets and other risk assets tend to fall , and vice - versa .
It would appear that investors and funds are borrowing cheap dollars on a short - term basis and investing in all sorts of risk assets .
Not only have stock markets risen , but so have high - yield bonds , commodities , and so on .
We have seen the steepest rise in US stock markets coming out of a recession since the end of the last world war .
The market is " discounting " a 5 % GDP next year and a profit rebound beyond anything in past experience .
Depending on the quarter , operating earnings are expected to rise by anywhere from 30 - 40 % .
P/E ratios are back at 23 , well above the 17 we saw in the summer of 2007 ( I am using 4th quarter 2009 estimates so as to not have to take into account the disastrous 4th quarter of last year . )
Worrying about a dollar carry trade is not just a preoccupation of my friends Nouriel Roubini or David Rosenberg or Frank Veneroso .
Look as this story from Bloomberg :
" China 's Liu Says U.S. Rates Cause Dollar Speculation
" Nov. 15 ( Bloomberg ) --
The decline of the dollar and decisions in the U.S. not to raise interest rates have caused " huge " speculation in foreign exchange trading and seriously affected global asset prices , said Liu Mingkang , chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission . "
" The continuous depreciation in the dollar , and the U.S. government 's indication , that in order to resume growth and maintain public confidence , it basically wo n't raise interest rates for the coming 12 to 18 months , has led to massive dollar arbitrage speculation , " he told reporters in Beijing today at the International Finance Forum .
" Liu said this has ' seriously affected global asset prices , fuelled speculation in stock and property markets , and created new , real and insurmountable risks to the recovery of the global economy , especially emerging - market economies . '
" His view echoes that of Donald Tsang , the chief executive of Hong Kong , who said the Federal Reserve 's policy of keeping interest rates near zero is fueling a wave of speculative capital that may cause the next global crisis . "
" 'I 'm scared and leaders should look out , ' Tsang said in Singapore Nov. 13 .
' America is doing exactly what Japan did last time , ' he said , adding that Japan 's zero interest rate policy contributed to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and U.S. mortgage meltdown . "
It is not just China .
Brazil has moved to impose a tax ( or tariff ) on investment money coming into the country on a shorter - term basis , as they are worried about both a bubble in their markets and in their currency .
Russia is openly considering similar policies .
I have been doing a lot of speaking in the last month .
In almost every speech , I warn of the significant imbalance in the dollar .
I walk to the very end of the stage to help illustrate that the world now has on a massive ABD trade .
By that I mean Anything But Dollars .
Everyone is now on the same side of the boat .
They have borrowed dollars to buy other risk assets , assuming that the dollar , like the yen in the glory days of the yen carry trade , will continue to fall .
Dollar bears are everywhere .
Explanations abound for why the dollar is a trash currency .
It is Fed policy , or the Obama administration 's willingness to run massive deficits , or the trade deficit or our health - care policy or ( pick any number of issues ) .
But I wonder .
Global trade collapsed last year and well into this year .
Global trade was essentially done in dollars .
If global trade is down 20 % or more , then there is less need for companies in various countries to hold dollars and more need for local currency because of the crisis .
Thus , after a rush to safety in the credit crisis , there is a rational selling of dollars by business .
Look at the above chart .
Notice that the dollar is roughly where it was 20 years ago .
And notice the recent jump during the credit crisis .
We are not even back to where we were before the crisis .
What happens if world trade picks back up , as it appears to be doing ?
Admittedly , it is not a robust recovery as yet , but it is rising .
That means more need for dollars .
And dollars which are being borrowed ( and probably leveraged ! ) on the assumption the dollar will continue to fall .
And I agree that , over time , the case for the dollar is not as good as I would like .
But in the meantime , we could have one very vicious dollar rally , which would take equity markets down worldwide , along with other risk assets .
Why ?
Because it would be a major short squeeze .
Barron 's just did a survey .
It revealed that the bullish sentiment on stocks is quite high and almost everyone hates US treasuries ( graph courtesy of David Rosenberg of Gluskin , Sheff )
Whenever sentiment gets too strong in one way or the other , it is usually setting up the markets for a rally in the despised asset .
Mr. Market like to do whatever he can to cause the most pain to the largest number of people .
I am not predicting a near - term crash or imminent precipitous bear , although in this environment anything can happen .
I am merely noting that there is an imbalance in the system .
The longer this imbalance goes on , the more likely it is that it will end in tears .
And the irony is that a recovering world economy could be the catalyst .
The Wild Things ?
They may be hiding in a portfolio near you .
Just food for thought .
Stay nimble .
New York , London , and Switzerland
I am going to hit the send button on what may be the shortest e-letter I have ever done .
The travel is catching up with me and I need some rest .
I am looking forward to Thanksgiving next week .
It may be my favorite holiday .
Family , friends , food , and football .
My usual pattern is to get up very early Thursday and start the prime slow - cooking , and then turn to the side dishes .
It will be no different this year .
My brother will bring the smoked turkeys , which he has down to an art form .
And then there are the over - the - top wines I was so graciously given this past birthday by so many friends .
I will bring a few of those bottles out .
The next weekend I am in New York for Festivus with the crowd from Minyanville , and then I am home for over a month before I go to London and Switzerland in late January .
Then not much is currently scheduled until April , although it always does seem to change .
After the recent hectic schedule ( 15 cities and even more speeches in just a little over three weeks ) , I look forward to some home time .
I wish those of you in the US the best of Thanksgivings , and the rest of you a great week .
And thanks for all the very kind words of late about Tiffani .
She seems to be doing better .
She is due in a month , so she is still moving slowly , but you can sense the excitement in her and Ryan .
I find it all very pleasant .

Life is paradox between appearance and structure , meaning that what something appears to be is usually the reverse of what it is as an active part in the process of life .
In other words , what causes a situation to come about is far removed from the point at which you observe that situation .
The earthquake that just destroyed your house was not caused by an earthquake , but by shifting magma plates , and if you ’d known to check geothermal sources nearby , you could have seen it .
But you were too busy looking for signs of an earthquake , not tectonic motion .
Humans make this more complex because they hide their motivations : the person who appears most helpful is probably trying to sell you something ; the person who appears most calm is the one having to remind himself to avoid violence ; the person most convinced they must minimized their ego are in fact inflating themselves with their ego - denying puritanism .
Structure , or the world of causes for effects , reflects the true nature of impetus , or what starts an action .
With humans , this is biological need : food , shelter , reproduction , social recognition .
Knowing these base demands look bad to others , we conceal our motivations .
“ I ’m just here to help ” and “ I ’m just doing my job ” are the two biggest cons in the world , right after “ I just want to be friends , ” which either means flight or reproduction .
In this world of false appearances , we often associate environmental awareness with The Kumbaya Mentality .
TKM is a nice impulse… really .
It ’s the hope that we can all accept each other , get along , sing a happy song and be one in spiritual unity .
We are all children of God .
Except that , of course , some of God ’s children are sociopathic anal rapists .
Ruh roh !
Do we want them in our Kumbaya circle ?
Do we really trust that singing Kumbaya will stop their tendency for rectal raiding , at least enough to fall asleep in the same tent with them ?
Hell no we do n’t .
The well - meaning people who introduced the singing of Kumbaya as yet another miserable ritual for children subjected to adult fears , despite knowing better on some level , hoped to give us a symbol for hope and change .
Instead , they gave us a symbol for cynical manipulation of others using sops of an impossible promise , and now Kumbaya — a title given to an American folk song by well - meaning delusional missionaries who sang it in Africa — is a symbol of cynicism , bitterness and hatred for how we cannot retaliate against such a positive symbol .
In our society , the ones who do n’t want to sing Kumbaya are the problem .
In reality , the people trying to get us to sing Kumbaya are the cynical predators , parasites and manipulators who make life worse for everyone .
But thanks to the social censure of others , we ca n’t strike back , or we ’re seen as the aggressor .
That ’s how Kumbaya becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy : instead of dealing with conflict , wish it away and snow everyone over with a simplistic song .
I propose we redefine kumbaya as a noun and a verb .
The noun form refers to a psychology : “ the desire that everyone will avoid conflict so we can continue shopping . ”
The verb form is to project that noun kumbaya onto someone to paralyze them , because if they react , all the other dummies in the room will then attack them .
Like wounding a shark during a feeding frenzy , passive aggression is the simian way of getting indirect revenge with less risk to yourself .
After all , anyone who claims to spot the passive aggression must be putting themselves on a pedestal and claiming they ’re smarter than the rest of us .
Kill that king .
It ’s 1789 all over again , and We The People want a Pontius Pilate to crucify anyone trying to do the right — but difficult ! — thing .
We want convenience .
We want shopping .
We want the illusion that we are supreme , Earth will never be hit by asteroids , our climate will be Just Fine , and dinner will always be on time .
We just want to deny the parts of reality that threaten us , which are generally the parts between a cause and its unknown and only semi-predictable effect .
“ Will he love me if I drive a Hyundai ?
Note to self : make all cars equal , so he will ALWAYS AND FOREVER love me and I can be free of doubt , which reminds me of DEATH . ”
This thought process , which we could call kumbayafication , confuses us between social tokens ( “ Of course that does n’t make you look fat ! ” ) and reality ( “ Stripes make anyone look fat , and you are kinda fat , so … ” ) .
How does our hypocrisy manifest itself in the political process ?
when students had a choice between a bacon cheeseburger , a chicken sandwich , and a veggie burger , they went straight for the bacon cheeseburger .
And they did so more often than when the choice was just between the burger or the chicken .
The scholars determined these were examples of “ vicarious goal fulfillment . ”
Your goal in eating a salad is to eat better .
But once you ’ve thought to yourself , “ I will have a salad , ” psychologically , you do n’t actually need to eat the salad .
Because your brain considers the mere act of thinking about the salad as having moved toward a better diet .
Thus , you ’ve already met your goal of improving your nutrition .
Having cognitively checked the goal off the mental to - do list , you can now eat the worst possible alternative , guilt - free .
In the study ’s conclusion , the scholars wondered if this plays out the same way in other contexts .
They write : “. . . does merely considering your options for retirement - investing fulfill your goal to be economically responsible and license you to a day of frivolous shopping ?
Does considering a Sunday catching up on work fulfill your work - related goal and give you license to play a round of golf ? ”

Ah .
There it is : we think of a socially positive token , assert it as the goal , and then charge ahead and do what ’s convenient .
Someone ’s singing , My Lord… Kum Ba Yah
Listen to the pleasant music as we drift away .
It ’s not that the monkey is still within us — a semi- smart creature , so smart enough to know he ’s screwed in the grand game , and still dumb enough to try to compensate in the short term by lying , cheating , stealing , raping , conniving , and so forth .
Conflict makes us think of possibly losing .
A conflict could make us a loser , but sitting here in the pleasant music , eating the hot dog which does n’t even resemble meat and so does n’t remind us of death , using chemicals and air conditioning to keep the bugs away , this makes us feel isolated from the world .
We are rarified , pure , abstract and removed .
Since we are so above it all , we can sing this pleasant song and think about what our positive intentions are .
Except that , when we ’re done thinking , we will just space out and eat another hot dog .
That ’s most convenient .
Never leave our own minds , even when the words solipsism and narcissism get bandied about by surly academics .
Here we see the failing of the traditional left - right axis .
If we intend to do something really nice , and then go do what ’s convenient , what we intended does n’t matter much .
Instead , we can see a new axis in our behavior : the division between modifying our behavior , and pleasantly pretending singing Kumbaya is a substitute for paying attention to problems and fixing it .
In fact , it seems the more we get into good intentions , the less we deal with reality , with horrific consequences :
The Aral Sea was once the world ’s fourth - largest body of fresh water , covering an area the size of Ireland .
But then the nations around it became part of the Soviet Union .
With their passion for planned economics and giant , nature - reversing projects , the communists diverted the rivers that fed the inland sea and used them to irrigate vast cotton fields .
The result : The Aral shrank by 90 percent to a string of isolated stretches of water .
The catastrophe “ is unprecedented in modern times , ” says Philip Micklin , a geography professor at Western Michigan University who has studied the Aral Sea for years .
AP
From this you can see the dilemma of politics : trying to be “ green ” is just silly , because all of politics is interconnected — and politics is not just far - removed bureaucracies , governments and ideas , but how you behave every day and even more , how you condition your psychology .
Condition yourself toward fond intentions and singing kumbaya , and you ’ll ignore reality and make vast wastelands .
Condition yourself toward self - discipline , accepting death and the interconnection of all being , and you ’ll be able to deal with reality and shape nature in ways that both ( a ) do n’t destroy it and ( b ) benefit you .
Our newest kumbaya mentality is the idea that we can buy green products , vote for green candidates , trade in the SUV for a hybrid and take three - minute showers and the problem will magically Just Go Away .
The only other alternative is to engage ourselves fully with the situation , not rely on some distant political body to do it for us — correctly , we hope and wish and never verify .
That would in turn require we remove this imaginary divide between ourselves and the reality that seems paradoxical to us , learn about it , and accept things ( death , mortality , poop , aging , bad consequences ) that come with the whole of reality .
Either that , or we can just sit back and listen to the song , and hope we ’ve fallen asleep by the time the bad consequences of our inaction come home to roost .

If sources have it right , then EA is to make Pandemic Studios no more after this afternoon .
According to a Kotaku report , several unnamed sources have said that the studio responsible for Mercenaries and the still - upcoming The Saboteur is to close its doors in the near future .
Furthermore , much of the studio's 200 or so staff members will be laid off this morning via an in - house announcement expected at 11 AM PT .
The remaining staff are supposedly to be reassigned to other EA - owned “ development teams . ”
Pandemic ’s videogame IPs will reportedly transfer to EA Montreal .
We ’ve checked in with a few people that may or may not have knowledge of this situation .
We ’ve yet to receive a response , but will update this when / if we receive a comment .
With the death of Uther Pendragon , the realm of Britannia falls into chaos , and war spreads throughout the land between the various warlords and princes vying to fill the power void .
A new true king is needed to restore peace to the land .
When a boy steps forward and wrests Excalibur out of the great anvil that holds it , Arthur , the true son and heir of Uther Pendragon , becomes the new king .
So begins your adventure in Neocore Game ’s King Arthur : The Role - playing Wargame .
This latest installment to the RTS genre explores the world of mythical Britannia and the world of King Arthur , a legend that has been read throughout centuries .
Players begin the game immediately after Arthur raises Excalibur from the anvil .
Consequently , the country ’s warlords and princes continue to fight for power as you struggle to recruit men and reliable , loyal knights to your banner and restore unity and peace to the realm .
What really sets this game apart from other traditional build - and - rush RTS games is its blending of RTS features with RPG elements .
Although King Arthur utilizes the RTS feature for combat , movement , recruitment , and mobilization of resources , the developers of Neocore Games added an adventure element where players will be able to follow the story of King Arthur and his fabled Knights of the Round Table and complete a series of open - ended quests that determine your popularity and your character throughout Britain .
Also , there are four choices on a morality chart that are determined by the players actions throughout the game : Rightful , Tyrant , Christian , Old Faith .
Each of these morals are exactly what they are intended .
Depending on your actions , you may gain new followers , ladies in waiting , as well as mystical items and weapons that have unique features , which could be used to supplement your heroes ’ attributes .
True to an open - ended RPG , depending on your path to victory , there are also different endings to the campaign based on your choices throughout your quest .
In addition , with each completed quest and victorious battle your heroes gain experience points that allow them to improve their unique skills in battle and future challenging quests .
Once players begin the first chapter out of four of the grand campaign , many RTS gamers will automatically notice a familiar feature seen in many RTS titles and that is the Campaign map , which shows all the provinces with its cities and landmarks and military units as well as quest objectives , reminiscent of the Total War series ’ map style .
On the Campaign map screen , players will be able to control the movement of armies , manage recruitment , as well as assigning new attributes and skills to units and heroes to increase their quality .
Once players have completed their turns , they will notice that the game operates on a four seasons system .
Certain actions available depending on the season such as the upgrading of units , researching new technologies , and establishing royal laws .
This can be frustrating at times , especially when you are waiting for your gold and food reserves to replenish in the winter .
If you are running out of these essentials , there is only so much that can be accomplished until the next tax period .
King Arthur would not be complete without the combat element , which is a vital part of conquering the various provinces into the realm .
When you choose to attack an enemy army on the Campaign map , you are given a choice of a variety of maps featuring different weather and terrain conditions that could prove advantageous to the type of troops that you control .
Within each of these battlefield maps , there are different objectives , which you are able to take in order to increase the morale of your forces .
Also , some of these victory locations provide unique boosts for you throughout the battle , making the occupation of these areas an important part of the battle .
Battles are just like other RTS games where you see your units and are able to place them in different formations .
As a medieval style game , the units are pretty generic ; there are footmen , pikemen , light and heavy cavalry , archers , longbowmen , etc .
However , as a mythical game there are also magical creatures such as giants , druids , and other creatures from a race from the Deepwood , known as the Sidhe .
In addition to having your army units , your fabled knights are also present on the battlefield with their unique skills that when activated provide advantages to your troops or damage the enemy .
However , timing is key on the execution of these powers as it costs mana , which does not recharge during the battle unless the hero has a special skill or you have occupied a landmark that allows for recharging mana during combat .
The only small problem that I noticed was that if you execute powers simultaneously , the game would lag for a few seconds , but despite that the special effects are marvelous and add an epic touch to battles .
What gamers will also notice is the overall ambiance of King Arthur .
The environment has a nice mystical feel and really makes the old legend come alive on the computer screen .
The different battlefield maps and their topographical features are also worth noting as they allow you use terrain to your advantage against your enemies such as concealing troops in a forest for ambush or placing your archers on high ground for maximum effect .
The music is also very appropriate for the time period .
Utilizing a blend of Celtic and medieval melodies , the game ’s medieval backdrop is complete .
Although , transition between tracks are a little rough at some points , the tunes are very catchy .
Overall , King Arthur : The Role - playing Wargame does a great job in taking RTS features and fusing them with RPG elements to create a unique gaming experience .
Strategy fans and fans of the Arthurian legend would not be disappointed as this game does not have as complicated of a learning curve as other RTS games such as the intimidating , in - depth game play of the Total War series .
For those slightly more casual RTS gamers , this would be a nice buy .
The commision said poor literacy can be best addressed at a young age A commission set up to tackle literacy problems in Scottish schools has found almost one in five Scots has difficulty with reading and writing .
The Literacy Commission , which included author Ian Rankin , called for a " zero tolerance " approach to tackling the issue .
The commission made 11 key recommendations aimed at addressing the problem of poor literacy skills .
It said tackling problems caused by deprivation was crucial .
The commission was comprised of leading figures from education , academia , business and culture .
It found that almost one million Scots had problems with literacy in their everyday lives .
It acknowledged that literacy affected people of all ages , but focused its attentions on younger children , as this is the stage at which poor literacy can best be addressed .
At the heart of the commission 's findings was the need to address the problems caused by social and economic disadvantage at an early age
Judith Gillespie
Commission chairwoman
The commission found that 18.5 % of children in Scotland leave primary school without being functionally literate - some 13,000 youngsters a year .
Education Secretary Mike Russell told BBC Radio Scotland 's Good Morning Scotland that the concept of literacy was broader than simply reading and writing .
He said : " What we were talking about 20 years ago was essentially an inability to read .
" What we are talking about now is an inability to cope with all the demands around us .
" It 's not just about reading - essentially you need to be able to operate a computer , you need to be able to use a mobile phone .
" We need to ensure we are constantly upskilling people to cope with everyday life . "
Judith Gillespie , chairwoman of the commission and development manager of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council , said : " There needs to be a zero - tolerance approach to tackling poor literacy and it's time that this problem was effectively addressed .

" At the heart of the commission 's findings was the need to address the problems caused by social and economic disadvantage at an early age .
This should be a key feature in the development of any literacy strategy .
" The commission also recommends that children are diagnostically assessed to see what help and support they need in order to flourish . "
Among the other recommendations was a call for literacy programmes in secondary schools , comparable to the early years programmes , that would focus on developing the necessary advanced skills .
' Wake up call '
The commission was set up 18 months ago by the Labour Party .
Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray said the report should act as a " huge wake up call " , and pledged to eradicate illiteracy in Scotland .
He said : " I pledge Scottish Labour to the task of eradicating illiteracy and innumeracy from 21st Century Scotland .
We need a revolution in literacy teaching in our schools .
We will argue for that in opposition , and once in office we will pursue this relentlessly .
" This report is huge wake - up call for Scotland .
With one in five Scots with literacy problems this mean that thousands of Scots will not reach their full potential and Scotland 's ability to compete in business and commerce will also suffer . "

Nonexperts should be very cautious in offering assessments of airport security measures , or any complex policy issue .
There is too much that we do n’t understand .
Thus , the following is at best a tentative analysis .
That said , I suspect that many of the measures the TSA plans to take in reaction to the latest foiled terrorist plot are likely to be either ineffective or not worth their cost .
There are three reasons for that suspicion .
First , as I pointed out in this post , many of the TSA ’s most intrusive and annoying policies are not used by Israeli airport security , generally considered to be the best in the world ; these include forcing people to take off their shoes and confiscating all liquids other than those in special containers .
Interestingly , the measures used by the TSA , but not by the Israelis , tend to be highly visible and intrusive to the average traveler .
That leads me to suspect that the TSA has adopted them for “ security theater ” reasons , so as to make it seem that they are making a great effort to combat terrorism , and make people feel more secure .
If the public sees the TSA making a major visible effort , fear will perhaps decrease and the agency is less likely to be blamed for any security failures that may occur in the future .
Thus , the agency engages in “ political theater ” measures despite the inevitable grumbling by passengers .
The Israeli public , by contrast , may demand less in the way of security theater than American voters , because of the nation ’s vastly greater experience in dealing with terrorist attacks .
Of course it ’s possible that the TSA experts simply know better than the Israelis .
Israeli security experts are far from infallible and they surely make mistakes .
On the other hand , Israel has not had a single successful terrorist attack on one of its airliners in decades , and it ’s not because the terrorists were n’t trying .
So , on balance , I suspect that the Israelis are more likely to know what they are doing than the TSA .
Second , a large , generally free society offers an almost endless variety of good targets for terrorists .
It is impossible to secure them all , or even come close .
That makes it counterproductive for us to spend large amounts of effort and resources to secure any one particular target .
Even if we make planes 100 % secure , the terrorists can simply target trains , buses , tourist sites , football games , universities , and other locations where there are lots of people in one place and relatively modest security measures .
Indeed , virtually all of the above types of targets have been attacked by terrorists in Europe , Israel , and elsewhere .
It makes sense to secure a small number of high - value targets that really are of much greater importance than any other sites the terrorists can attack ( e.g. – the White House , the Capitol , nuclear power plants , etc. ) .
But we should not expend enormous resources or impose great inconvenience on people to better protect targets for which the terrorists can easily find alternatives that are almost equally attractive .
That does n’t mean that we should have no airplane security measures at all .
But it does suggest that we should be very conservative about deciding what tactics to adopt , and be extremely skeptical of those that are highly intrusive , annoying , or costly .
Finally , the TSA ’s new security measures since 2001 often have the air of “ fighting the last war . ”
The 9/11 hijackers used knives and boxcutters to take over planes ; so the TSA bans knives and box cutters .
Richard Reid tried to put a bomb in his shoes , so now we must take off our shoes .
And so on .
Terrorists who are at all intelligent are likely to use new methods of attack that we do n’t expect .
Co-blogger Orin Kerr suggests that the TSA believes terrorists “ will want to do the same thing over and over again if we let them . ”
Orin correctly points out that al Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center a second time after the failed effort of 1993 .
But it ’s worth nothing that they used a completely different method the second time around , one that we were not prepared for , despite ( or perhaps even because of ) the fact that precautions had been taken against a repeat of the 1993 attack .
Nonetheless , it ’s certainly possible that the terrorists will repeat effective tactics that worked well the first time .
However , the last several attempted attacks ( such as Reid ’s and the one that just failed ) do n’t seem to have been well planned , and of course they failed despite the advantage of surprise .
If anything , we should want the terrorists to try these dubious methods again , rather than giving them additional incentives to think of new and potentially better ones .
On these issues as well , the Israelis have a very different approach that we might be able to learn from , though we probably should not copy every aspect of their system .
Ultimately , I lack the security expertise and access to intelligence information necessary to make specific recommendations on airport security policy .
However , I hope that we keep the above three points in mind as we consider how to respond to the latest foiled attack .

Advertisement A rare surfing competition has been held in Hawaii as waves of 12 m ( 40 ft ) pounded Oahu 's famous North Shore .
Thousands of people gathered on beaches and cliffs to watch the world 's greatest surfers tackle the waves .
It was only the eighth time in 25 years that the Eddie Aikau competition , named in honour of a celebrated Hawaiian surfer and lifeguard , was held .
The contest is only staged in the most extreme surf conditions and last took place in 2004 .
' Unbelievably dangerous '
Nine - times world champion Kelly Slater was the strongest starter , but first - time entrant Greg Long , 24 , took a narrow lead over his older rival and won with a score of 323 to 313 .
It really is about the wave and celebrating the ocean

The victorious Californian - who took home a purse of $ 55,000 ( £ 34,000 ) - said it was " a dream come true " to take part in the " biggest event of big waves in the world " .
Long said the camaraderie of the contest , known as the Eddie , " encapsulates everything that 's great about surfing " .
" It really is about the wave and celebrating the ocean .
It 's what we do : go out there and ride big waves . "
A total of 28 surfers were invited to take part in the event at Waimea Bay , chosen by a poll of the surfing community .
Organisers had been watching weather and wave conditions in the seas around the US state and announced early on Tuesday morning local time that the competition would run .
" We were all stoked out there , smiling , laughing and having a good time , " said competitor Jamie O'Brien .
" This is like a natural arena out here for this and it's amazing to be a part of it , " he told the Honolulu Advertiser .
People travelled from around the world to the US state to watch the event .
Malika Dudley of CBC
News told the BBC people were lining cliff tops and had climbed trees to watch the vast waves .
She said it was " unbelievably dangerous " to take part in the event - one surfer , Tom Carroll of Australia , had been injured - but that safety teams were in the water on jet skis in case of accidents .
Eddie Aikau , after whom the contest is named , was a legendary surfer who died in 1978 at the age of 31 , after capsizing in a traditional voyaging canoe en route from Hawaii to Tahiti .

Final Fantasy XIII now has a release date .
It will be released March 9th in Europe and North America for both Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 .
The video is a very different way of presenting a games release date and certainly celebrates the history and grandeur that is the series .
When asked John Yamamoto who is the president and chief executive officer for Square Enix , Inc. said “ We know that our fans have been eagerly awaiting the next installation of the franchise — FINAL FANTASY XIII will exceed all expectations … Coming simultaneously to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for the first time , FINAL FANTASY XIII will be available to all players who are looking for the most immersive gaming experience of 2010 ”

Researcher will be allowed to publish his paper after making ' tiny ' changes .
Publication of a paper on cap - and - trade has been held up by CSIRO .
Malcolm Paterson / CSIRO
An Australian researcher involved in a censorship controversy will be allowed to publish a paper critical of cap - and - trade systems for controlling carbon emissions — but only after some changes are made to wording , the country 's science agency has said .
Clive Spash , an ecological economist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) in Canberra , had an invited paper on the failings of emissions - trading schemes accepted by the journal New Political Economy earlier this year .
But the acting chief of his division subsequently wrote to the editors telling them that the paper was being withdrawn because it had not passed internal processes ( see ' Australian agency denies gagging researchers ' ) .
With Australia 's government battling to pass emissions legislation , accusations that the agency was trying to muzzle climate researchers made headlines .
But after Spash met with CSIRO chief executive Megan Clark on 9 November , the two reached an agreement that the paper could be published with some rewording .
" We had a productive talk , " Spash says .
" I was told by the chief executive that her changes would be tiny , consisting of a few words or phrases .
That sounds as if it would be acceptable . "
A spokesman for the agency , Huw Morgan , confirmed that Clark told Spash the article was publishable under CSIRO rules with " minor but important " changes .
He said Spash would see the proposed changes by close of business today .
Chopping and changing
The issue centres on the charter under which the CSIRO , a statutory authority , operates .
That charter allows agency researchers to discuss their results , but says they " should not advocate , defend or publicly debate the merits of government or opposition policies " .
Spash told Nature that Clark agreed with " my own opinion that the paper did not breach the CSIRO charter or policy in any substantive fashion .
This reversed the decision statements previously issued to me by senior managers wishing to cut 75 % or more of the paper . "
“ The paper was therefore submitted to the journal , with the express permission of the acting chief of division . ”
Clive Spash
CSIRO
The paper analyses emissions - trading schemes , economists ' claims for them , and the implications of their design .
" There is no detail on , nor analysis of , the current proposals by the Australian government or opposition parties , " says Spash .
When he first alerted his CSIRO bosses to the paper , they considered it to be politically sensitive and in need of robust review , Spash said .
Normally , papers produced by the agency are reviewed internally before being sent for external review .
But Spash says he and his co-author Andrew Reeson were told they should send the paper straight away for review by the journal even though the internal review had not concluded .
" The paper was therefore submitted to the journal , with the express permission of the acting chief of division , prior to completion of the internal referee 's reports , " Spash adds .
" Both internal referees recommended publication a few weeks after submission to the journal . "
Spash says the journal accepted a revised version of the paper in June .
He told the acting division chief this , but two weeks later was informed that the article could not be published .
Speak truth to power ?
The episode has caused debate in Australia about whether CSIRO scientists should have the same freedoms as university academics .
Michael Borgas , president of the CSIRO 's staff association , has backed the current system , telling The Australian newspaper that most of the agency 's researchers " find they are helped by CSIRO to directly engage with the political process by getting their research into the heads of [ ministers and the bureaucracy ] , rather than by publishing in academic journals " .
Meanwhile , CSIRO has moved to further tighten its grip on scientists ' freedom to speak out , rolling out a new policy over recent weeks that requires researchers " to use their CSIRO affiliation on all publications that arise from research work they do as an employee with CSIRO , " spokesman Huw Morgan said .
Morgan said it would be extended across the agency by early 2010 .

Spash hopes his case will highlight the need for openness and public engagement .
" This does not mean scientists becoming political activists or advocates , " he says .
" It does mean being prepared to make and defend logical arguments and being prepared to explore moral and ethical issues . "
" Institutions are today facing the reality of a new mode of operation at the science–policy interface , " he adds .
" My hope is that recent events have shown they must grasp this challenge rather than falling back into a mode of operation which is long outdated . "

Countless M.F.A. , or Made for AdSense , Web sites have appeared ; they use articles stolen or “ scraped ” or mashed together from sites like Wikipedia , and their edges are framed with Google ’s text ads .
The ads work on a cost - per - click scheme : the advertiser pays Google only if you actually click on the ad .
If you do , he ’s billed a quarter , or a dollar , or ( for some sought - after keywords like “ personal injury ” or “ mesothelioma lawyers ” ) $ 10 or more .
But think — when was the last time you clicked on a three - line text ad ?
Almost never ?
Me neither .
And yet , in 2008 , Google had $ 21.8 billion in revenue , about 95 percent of which flowed from AdWords / AdSense .
( A trickle came from banner and video ads sold by Google ’s new subsidiary , DoubleClick , and from other products and services . )
These unartful , hard - sell irritants — which have none of the beauty or the humor of TV , magazine , radio or newspaper advertising — are the foundation of Google ’s financial empire , if you can believe it .
It ’s an empire built on tiny grains of keyword - searchable sand .
The advertising revenue keeps Google ’s stock high , and that allows the company to do whatever it feels like doing .
In 2006 , when Google ’s stock was worth $ 132 billion , the company absorbed YouTube for $ 1.65 billion , almost with a shrug .
“ They can buy anything they want or lose money on anything they choose to , ” Irwin Gotlieb , the chief of GroupM , one of Google ’s biggest competitors in the media market , told Auletta .
If Microsoft is courting DoubleClick , Google can swoop in and buy DoubleClick for $ 3.1 billion .
If the business of “ cloud ” computing seems to hold great promise , Google can build 20 or 50 or 70 massive data centers in undisclosed locations around the world , each drawing enough power to light a small city .
Earlier this month , Google announced it would pay $ 750 million in stock for a company called AdMob , to sell banner ads on cellphones .
“ Once you get to a certain size , you have to figure out new ways of growing , ” Ivan Seidenberg , the chief executive of Verizon , said to Auletta .
“ And then you start leaking on everyone else ’s industry . ”
That ’s why Auletta ’s C.E.O. ’s are resentful .
True , the miracles keep coming : Google Voice , which can e-mail you a transcript of your voice mail messages ; and Chrome , a quick , clever Web browser ; and Android , the new operating system for mobile devices .
One of the latest is an agreement to print books on an A.T.M.- style on - demand printer , the Espresso Book Machine .
But perhaps there are too many miracles emanating from one campus now ; perhaps brand fatigue is setting in .
Google ’s famous slogan , “ Do n’t be evil , ” now sounds a little bell - tollingly dystopian .
When they were at Stanford , Page and Brin criticized search engines that had become too “ advertising oriented . ”
“ These guys were opposed to advertising , ” Auletta quotes Ram Shriram , one of Google ’s first investors , as saying .
“ They had a purist view of the world . ”
They are n’t opposed now .
Now they must be forever finding forage for a hungry , $ 180 billion ad - maddened beast .
Auletta describes an unusual job - interview test that Sergey Brin once gave to a prospective in - house lawyer : “ I need you to draw me a contract , ” Brin said to her .
“ I need the contract to be for me to sell my soul to the Devil . ”
That was in 2002 , the year Google began work internally on what would become AdSense .
Now Page and Brin fly around in a customized Boeing 767 and talk sincerely about green computing , even as the free streamings of everyone ’s home video clips on YouTube burn through mountaintops of coal .
They have n’t figured out a way to “ monetize ” — that is , make a profit from — their money maelstrom , YouTube , although I notice that Coffee-mate and Samsung banners appear nowadays in Philip DeFranco ’s popular video monologues .
“ The benefit of free is that you get 100 percent of the market , ” Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , explained to Auletta .
“ Free is the right answer . ”
For a while , perhaps — but maybe free is unsustainable .
For news­papers , Auletta writes , “ free may be a death certificate . ”
Maybe in the end , even on the Internet , you get what you pay for .

Guest post by Willis Eschenbach
The upcoming Copenhagen climate summit , officially and ponderously named “ COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference Copenhagen 2009 ” , is aimed at reducing the emissions of the developed world .
The main players , of course , are the US and Western Europe .
There is a widespread perception that if the US and Western Europe could only get our CO2 emissions under control , the problem would be solved .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
To see the gaping hole in this idea , it is only necessary to look at the historical record of carbon emissions .
Here is that graph :
While in 1970 the US and Western Europe combined to contribute about half of all CO2 emissions , at present this is far from true .
In the past 35 years , the combined emissions of the US and Western Europe have risen only slightly .
Globally , however , CO2 emissions have risen steeply , with no end in sight .
So it does n’t matter if Europe signs on to a new Kyoto .
It does n’t matter if the US adopts Cap and Trade .
Both of them together will make no significant difference .
Even if both areas could roll their CO2 emissions back to 1970 levels , it would not affect the situation in the slightest .
These are meaningless attempts to hold back a rising tide of emissions .
Me , I do n’t think rising CO2 levels are a problem .
But if you think it will be a problem , then you should definitely concentrate on adaptation strategies .. because mitigation simply is n’t going to work .

As this early autumn night arrives in Norway , colorful display of aurora paints the northern horizon .
The Ringebu Fjell in southern Norway is situated too far south for frequent aurora activity .
It has been pure luck that some lights showed up when TWAN photographer Bernd Proschold put up his time - lapse camera .
But what a disappointment next morning :
The hard drive crashed and all pictures seemed to be lost .
Hopefully another TWAN photographer from across the globe Kwon O Chul was able to recover all data in Korea !

The teabaggers are turning to threats and intimidation out there in NY - 23 land .
Elizabeth Benjamin writes in the NY Daily News :
It 's getting ugly out there .
I just got off the phone with former state Democratic Chairwoman June O'Neill , who informed me the police had been called to at least two polling sites in St. Lawrence County due to overzealous electioneering ( O'Neill called it " voter intimidation " ) by Doug Hoffman supporters .
" We 've gotten reports that people are standing there , covered with Hoffman stickers and yelling anti-choice stuff at voters , " said O'Neill , a St. Lawrence native who has been running the party 's GOTV effort for Bill Owens in NY - 23 .
" Apparently , there 's some woman claiming to be a commissioner , " O'Neill continued .
" Commissioner of what , I do n't know .
She 's from Texas , I think , and she wo n't leave . "
" This is not the way we roll in the North Country . " '
O'Neill also said she had received anecdotal reports of problems at polling sites in Gouverneur , which is Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava 's hometown .
But she could n't immediately confirm this .
I called over to the St. Lawrence Board of Elections and got GOP Elections Commissioner Debbie Pahler on the line .
She confirmed that the police indeed had been called , but she downplayed the incident , saying it 's " a routine procedure here in the county . "
" We had electioneering within the 100 - foot polling marker , " Phaler said .
" It 's my understanding that they were asked to leave and would n't leave . "
" If people are electioneering within the marker and do n't stop when we ask them to , our inspectors are instructed to call law enforcement to assist them .
I do n't think anybody was arrested . "
O'Neill also said she had received anecdotal reports of problems at polling sites in Gouverneur , which is Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava 's hometown .
But she could n't immediately confirm this .
Mental institutions have a bad reputation .
Many people think of them as little more than prisons for the insane , their populations of violent or stupefied patients forcibly confined to dismal wards ruled over by tyrannical matrons .
There 's some truth in that : this picture shows Matteawan State Hospital in Beacon , New York – which is now Fishkill Correctional Facility .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
In the foreword of Christopher Payne 's book Asylum : Inside the closed world of state mental hospitals , the neurologist Oliver Sacks says that we tend to think of asylums as " snake pits , hells of chaos and misery , squalor and brutality " – places that no one would stay in voluntarily .
These straitjackets were used to restrain and pacify patients at the North Dakota State Hospital in Jamestown .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
But asylums started out as philanthopic dreams , rather than psychiatric nightmares .
The concept was born in the mid-1800s , when socially minded citizens , dismayed by the often dismal lot of the mentally unstable , paid for dozens of institutions to be constructed for their care .
By 1880 , 139 had been built in the US .
These were often palatial buildings , designed by prestigious architects , with vast landscaped grounds and impressive vistas .
They were symbols of civic pride , just as museums and universities are today , and some became fixtures on the tourist trail .

The intention was for the asylums to be places of refuge – sanctuaries where patients ' disorders were recognised and allowed for .
Their founders hoped that the mentally ill could be cured by providing them with a calming environment , fresh air , a varied diet , exercise and jobs in the asylum 's workshops or farm – an approach known as " moral treatment " .
This is the sweeping marble staircase in the lobby at Yankton State Hospital in South Dakota .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
Unfortunately , moral treatment did n't prove very effective .
Rather than being cured and leaving , residents tended to remain in the asylum for the duration of their lives , even as more continually arrived .
By the end of the 19th century , some asylums had many thousands of residents and had become more like miniature towns , complete with the appropriate utilities and recreational facilities .
These bowling shoes were photographed at Rockland State Hospital in New York .

Residents at these huge institutions could also visit theatres and cafés , as well as beauty salons like this one at Trenton State Hospital in New Jersey .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
Asylums even cared for residents after their deaths .
Patients might be buried in the asylum 's graveyard , or their remains stored for collection by next of kin – although that sometimes never happened .
This picture shows rows of unclaimed copper cremation urns at Oregon State Hospital .
( You can see David Maisel 's stunning close - up photographs of these canisters in this New Scientist gallery . )
( This image : Christopher Payne )
As time went on , however , state funding dwindled , and so did the number of qualified staff .
The benevolent philanthropists ' dream began to crumble , with the institutions gradually becoming " bywords for squalor and negligence , and often run by inept , corrupt or sadistic bureaucrats " , writes Sacks .
This is the view through the observation window from the seclusion room at Middletown State Hospital in New York .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
By the beginning of the 20th century the " moral treatment " philosophy was essentially dead , to be replaced by more invasive therapies .
For example , in insulin shock therapy , an early treatment for schizophrenia , patients were put into a coma induced by injections of large doses of insulin every day for weeks .
Another approach was psychosurgery .
Lobotomy consisted of cutting connections to and from the prefrontal cortex of the brain , the region responsible for everyday decisions , language , memory , socialising and spontaneity .
As a result , lobotomised people underwent drastic personality changes .
It was widely used between the 1930s and 1950s to treat a wide range of severe disorders , including schizophrenia and clinical depression .
This is an electroencephalograph used to observe patients ' brain activity at Clarinda State Hospital in Iowa .

The most notorious of the new therapies was electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , introduced in the 1930s .
ECT involves electrically inducing seizures in anaesthetised patients using machines like this one at Lincoln State Hospital in Nebraska .
The treatment has been portrayed as barbaric but is still used to treat some conditions , such as severe depression .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
The 1950s brought the advent of antipsychotic drugs such as Thorazine , which suppressed the symptoms of mental disorders , raising hopes that sufferers might be able to lead relatively normal lives beyond the asylum walls .
This was a welcome development for the cash - strapped asylums .
A 1948 survey showed that a quarter of New York 's state budget was going to the hospitals , and by the mid-1960s the US government had started to opt for community care of the mentally ill .
New mental health centres were set up , designed to administer the short - term treatments made possible by the new drugs .
This is a photograph of a typical ward of the now outmoded asylums , a corridor with bedrooms branching off it , at Buffalo State Hospital in New York .
It was euphemistically rebranded as a state hospital at the turn of the century .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
Care in the community offered the remaining state hospitals relief from their financial pressures , but these were renewed in the 1970s , when laws were passed establishing minimum standards of care and barring patients from working .
These measures were intended to protect patients ' rights , but the cost of complying with them was staggering .
Vast areas of land were sold to raise funds and the institutions started to decay .
Patients who could not be treated in accordance with the new standards were simply released .
Those who remained found themselves directionless , sometimes becoming the TV - addict zombies of popular imagination .
The Norwich State Hospital , Connecticut , was closed in 1996 .
Although its windows are boarded up , its national architectural and historical significance mean that its buildings can't be torn down .
( Image : Christopher Payne )
By the 1980s , deinstitutionalisation was in full swing , with patients being returned to their communities in large numbers .
The remaining institutions were shut down , with their grounds sold off and buildings demolished .
But by the 1990s it became clear that the rapid closing of the asylums had been a mistake .
Not enough clinics and half - way houses had been set up to ease the transition , and the community care centres were struggling to cope .
This picture shows Danvers State Hospital , which closed in 1992 but where demolition only began in 2005 .
There was public outcry at the destruction of its Gothic architecture , which is said to have inspired the fictional Arkham Asylum of the Batman comics .

“ You know , that ’s a great question , ” Ms. Palin said .
“ And it ’s lovely to think that he would ever even consider such a thing . ”

She added : “ He is a part of the family , and you want to bring him in the fold and kind of under your wing .
And he needs that too , Oprah . ”
There was more : “ I think he needs to know that he is loved , and he has the most beautiful child , and this can all work out for good .
It really can .
We do n’t have to keep going down this road of controversy and drama all the time .
We ’re not really into the drama .
We do n’t really like that . ”
Finally Ms. Winfrey cut to the chase , asking , “ Does that mean yes , he is coming , or no , he is not ? ” ( Pressed , Ms. Palin said she would extend the invitation . )
Ms. Palin is obviously hurt and angry about the way Mr. Johnston has exploited his connections to convert fame into fortune , but there are other reasons for resentment .
In the age of balloon dads and transformative reality television Ms. Palin has emerged as quintessentially American , in terms of the America of the moment .
Her career gyrations , life and family continue to feed a spotlight - hungry media carnival .
In some ways her almost son - in - law ’s quick and callous cashing - in looks like a junior version of her own quickie book campaign .
The title of Ms. Palin ’s book is “ Going Rogue , ” but her appearance on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” mostly showed a politician - celebrity going for broke .
Economic Crisis
Peak Oil
* Peak production appears to have occurred in 2005 or 2008 .
Certainly , production has been on a plateau since 2004 - 5 .
The recession and the high prices from last year caused falling demand .
This is brought on lower prices .
That caused new production projects to be slowed , delayed or stopped .
Because starting up projects takes much longer than shutting them down , this will likely lead to oil shortages if the economy and demand rebound , certainly by 2012 or so .
UPDATE Nov. ' 09 :
The new IEA World Energy Outlook revised ** downward * * to 105 million barrels a day it 's projections for future oil production .
What they are saying is , over the next 20 years , we wo n't be finding much oil .
Whistle blowers , one still employed , one not , say even this is wishful thinking .
We agree .
We have thought so for two or three years .
They also say the decline rate is higher than admitted - and it was already 4.2 % !!!
This means we are looking at , what ?
Six percent ?
Eight ?
At six percent we lose the equivalent of Saudi Arabia every two years .
Of course , we are n't finding that much new , recoverable oil each year and have n't for decades .
Where 's the extra coming from ?
** Peak occurred from 2005 to 2008 .
It is slightly possible we could exceed past production in the next two years * if * there is economic growth as there is some spare capacity and some new spare capacity came on this year .
There appears to be just enough new oil coming online - or there would have been if projects had n't been shut in due to the economic crash - the next two years to barely stay even .
After that , decline will have eaten away two Saudi Arabias and it will be impossible to reach a new high .
*
Production surpasses new oil discoveries by a margin of 3 :1 or 4:1 .
This is unsustainable .
* The global economic downturn may decrease these numbers , which would help slow the fall down the back slope of the decline curve .
*
The " Export Land " Model ( .pdf ) shows increased consumption in oil exporting nations leads to decreasing exports .
Exports dropped by 3 % in 2006 .
For oil importing nations , this means oil availability falls 2 x to 3 x the global decline rate .
*
Current prices make some alternative energy projects economically infeasible .
While oil is depleting and declining , the low prices and economic crash are impacting our ability to ramp up renewables to replace fossil fuel - based energy .
*
OPEC has announced ( 1/2/08 ) future production is in peril .
Many believe OPEC cannot raise their current production by more than 3 million barrels a day .
Ever .
Or can do so only at the cost of future production .
I.e. , they must choose between their own citizens and the rest of the world .
*
A nice , but older , overview ( .pdf ) .
Its age , 2005 , makes the time lines a little longer than seems probable .
Still , excellent forecasting .
People & Power - Peaked - 06 Jan 08 - Part 1 .
(
Part 2 can be found on youtube . )
An excellent overview of Peak Oil right now .
Climate Change
* James Hansen , et al. , published some very important papers ( article ) this year .
Conclusions are thus :
1 . The world is at @ 392 ppm CO2 , but irreversible climate change happens at just 350 , which we passed decades ago .
This is why time is shorter than it seems .
2 . The goal now is to stop warming at only 2 degrees C .
This will still mean seas rising a meter or more and climate change globally , but we may be able to stabilize there .
It also means reducing carbon emissions by 90 % by 2100 .
That 's creating an entirely new energy system in less than a century .
We did that already , but that was when there was virtually no infrastructure in place .
3 . Action must be taken in a very short time period .
Waiting ten years is almost certainly too long .
The silver lining that comes with Peak Oil ?
It may give us no choice but to act sooner rather than later .
The solutions for Peak Oil and Climate Change are the same ( except for bio- fuels . )
This situation is unprecedented in human history .

The Arctic melted to an extraordinary degree in 2007 and nearly as much in 2008 - despite perfect conditions for 2008 .
This is THE canary in the coal mine .
Back in February , when the first of three IPCC ( Those rock - n- rollers of recent Nobel fame . ) reports came out and did n't include ice melt in their projections , I was stunned .
Various scientists , also .
I knew viscerally that change was coming faster than they stated .
Much faster .
The summer melt validated that view .
Hold on to your hats .
f you know anything of Chaos , bifurcations , tipping points and non-linear systems , you 're probably as scared as I am .
* New findings of methane being released from the Arctic permafrost and sea floor , along with increased atmospheric methane are ominous signs we may be well past key tipping points .
There have been massive , abrupt climate changes in the past due to the release of methan clathrates from the sea floor .
The Big Melt - Arctic ice melt accelerates by 20 +% .
Since this is Philadelphia Eagles Week here in Steeler Nation , I thought I 'd share the story of how the Steelers and Eagles actually combined teams during World War II to keep the NFL alive .
Once again Art Rooney rose to the occasion with his creative entrepreneurial thinking and his standard practice of looking out for the good of the league .
Matthew Algeo wrote a fabulous book titled " Last Team Standing . "
It is the story about how the Steelers combined with the Philadelphia Eagles during the 1943 war year .
If you love history and the Pittsburgh Steelers , this book is for you .
I will jump this story so as not to hog the front page .
In 1943 America was entrenched in World War II , both in European and Japanese theaters .
Most young men who were of the age to play professional football were also of the age to fight for their country .
This badly damaged the well - being of the NFL , but obviously the well - being of the country was the top priority .
At the annual spring meeting , the NFL decided to play through the roster adversity for much the same reasons that Major League Baseball continued to play .
While at war , the country needed some form of entertainment and sense of normalcy .
Sports were a much - needed diversion .
At the time baseball far surpassed football as America 's game ( that since has reversed ) .
President Roosevelt wrote an inspirational decree on how important it was to the country for baseball to continue .
He made no mention of football .
What was good for baseball was good for football .
The young men who remained in the States to play football were by and large deferred from the draft .
There were basically three types of deferment that defined 1943 NFL players .
The first group was called 3 - As .
If a man was supporting a family Uncle Sam would not make him a draft priority .
To keep things clean , the government defined a 3 - A as a father whose child / children was born or conceived prior to Pearl Harbor .
The cutoff date for birth was September 15 , 1942 , precisely nine months and one week after the attack on Pearl Harbor .
The second group consisted of those men who worked in the war industry , producing and preparing ammunition , weapons and materials .
The third group were those deemed physically unfit .
They were called 4 - Fs. Common ailments were ulcers , perforated eardrums , partial blindness or deafness and even flat feet .
Even with these deferments , NFL rosters were hurting .
The Cleveland Rams suspended operations .
The Steelers had only six men left under contract .
The Philadelphia Eagles had 16 .
Steelers ' owner Art Rooney knew that the league needed at least eight teams to survive .
The 1943 NFL draft was a waste , with most players going off to the war instead of joining NFL teams .
Rooney 's idea was to merge with the Eagles .
This idea came quickly to him since two years earlier he thought about combing the two teams into the Pennsylvania Keystoners .
Lex Thompson , who owned the Eagles , was not as keen on the plan since he at least had 16 players under contract .
Thompson remembered 1941 and how Rooney actually swapped cities with him , allowing him to keep the Eagles in Philadelphia , close to his New York City home .
He agreed to combine teams .
The two cities were married in many ways anyhow .
They were anchor cities in Pennsylvania , one in the east and one in the west .
They were both industrial cities .
Pittsburgh , with the nation 's 10th largest population , manufactured raw materials such as steel , iron , glass and aluminum .
Philadelphia , with the country 's third - most population , refined those materials into finished war products , tanks , ammunition and the likes .
The merger had its price .
The league approved the plan by a slim vote of 5 - 4 .
The league stipulation was that the merger would expire as soon as the regular season ended , keeping the Pittsburgh / Philadelphia combine out of any playoffs .
The other owners feared the merger would produce a team with an unfair advantage .
The other stipulations were imposed by Thompson .
The team would be known as the Philadelphia Eagles and be based in Philly .
Rooney had very little leverage , bringing only six players to the table .
He was successful in landing two home games in Pittsburgh .
The team was also to wear the Eagles ' green and white colors instead of black and gold .
Two other business items of note occurred during that spring meeting .
The first was that helmets were mandated for the first time .
The second was the approval of expansion in 1944 .
The Boston Yanks paid $ 50,000 for entry into the league .
It may seem strange that a league on the verge on non-existence would agree to expand , but the $ 50,000 was much needed for operations in 1943 .
The owners divided that money faster than my kids divide Halloween candy .
The Philadelphia Eagles began training camp with co-head coaches : Greasy Neale of Philadelphia and Walt Kiesling of Pittsburgh .
They could n't stand each other .
Co -head coaches would be difficult to begin with , let alone two guys at each other 's throats .
Kiesling 's own players did n't like him anyhow .
Asking the Eagles to like him was too much to ask .
Walt Kiesling ( L ) and Greasy Neale Were Co-Head Coaches of the Steagles
As the season got underway , fans and newspapers , everywhere but in Philadelphia , began calling the team the Steagles , a combination of Steelers and Eagles .
It had a nice ring to it and was fair to both cities .
In Philly , the writers and even the team insisted on Philadelphia Eagles .
Steagles eventually became nomenclature throughout most of the country .
The Steagles jumped out to a 2 - 0 start after defeating Brooklyn and New York at home in Philadelphia 's Shibe Park .
In the New York game the Steagles fumbled the ball 10 times , still an NFL record , but managed to win 28 - 14 .
The team stumbled on the road and after seven games was 3 - 3 - 1. Washington was 6 - 0 - 1 and the Eastern title ( though just four teams ) seemed hopeless .
Two straight wins over Detroit and Washington gave the team hope again .
The final game , at home in Shibe Park against the Green Bay Packers , would make or break the season .
A packed house of 35,000 fans was on hand , but Green Bay receiver Don Hutson was too much and the Steagles fell 38 - 28 .
The team finished 5 - 4 - 1 .
In many ways 1943 was a major success .
Total attendance was 129,000 , a record for both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia .
Total NFL attendance experienced a huge spike , averaging 24,000 per game .
The premise of playing football during the war as a diversion was obviously correct .
Individually , the Steagles ' Jack Hinkle ended the season with 571 rushing yards .
He lost the rushing title to New York 's Bill Paschal by one yard .
Against those very Giants Hinkle was not given credit for a 37 - yard run ( they gave it to Johnny Butler ) .
Hinkle did not complain about not winning the NFL rushing crown .
He figured with a war going on there were better things to cry about .
Tony Bova , a half - blind 4 - F , led the team in receiving with 417 yards .
It should also be noted that all the Steagles ' players were full - time war workers in Philadelphia .
Playing football was extracurricular .
Playing football was also an oxymoron .
On one hand they were playing for the fans who needed a sense of routine .
On the other hand , many of those same fans were critical of the players .
There was a feeling that if guys could play football they could fight in the war .
This was a logical train of thought , except that the players were n't making the decisions as to who could fight and who could n't .
Men with flat feet were n't drafted .
They could lead normal lives and even play football , but the Army deemed that flat feet was not conducive to marching long distances .
Similar reasons existed for other 4 - F deferments .
Most NFL football players wanted to join the war .
In the early 1940s there was patriotic gravitation to serve and fight for the country .
Being classified as a 4 - F was an embarrassment .
Playing football and being ridiculed was added embarrassment .
One Steagle , Bill Hewitt , quit in the middle of the season .
He could n't take the ridicule and subsequent guilt feelings anymore .
Hewitt was good enough to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971 .
The next season , 1944 , the NFL was back on solid footing .
The Army had declared that it had enough soldiers and men over 26 years of age would not be drafted .
The league had another problem .
With the Cleveland Rams back in operation , the expansion Boston team in the fold and the Eagles and Steelers back in their separate ways , the NFL had 11 teams .
this created a nightmare with divisions and scheduling .
The league 's owners could not resolve these issues during the spring meeting .
Commissioner Elmer Layden begged for two teams to combine again in 1944 .
Ten teams made for a perfect league and 11 seemed impossible .
Art Rooney , who lived his life for the good of the league , volunteered to combine his team with the Chicago Cardinals .
The Cardinals were chosen since they recorded an 0 - 10 record in 1943 .
Rooney did not want to do this .
It was another of his lifetime examples of benevolence .
The Card - Pitts as they were called , went 0 - 10 in 1944 .
Fans started calling them " carpits " since everyone walked all over them .
Better days were ahead though , for the Pittsburgh Steelers and America .
In August of 1945 the Japanese surrendered and the war came to an end .
A 72 - year - old Harlem business owner turned Bernhard Goetz on four robbers yesterday , pulling a shotgun from beneath his desk and opening fire , killing two and wounding the others , cops said .
The four men barged into Kaplan Bros. Blue Flame Corp. , a restaurant - supply company at 523W .
125th St. , at 3 p.m .
Inside was the owner , Charles Augusto , Jr. , of Irvington in Westchester County , and two employees whom the robbers tried to handcuff .
After Augusto made it clear that there was no money on the premises , the bandits turned their attention to his 33 - year - old assistant , JB , and starting pistol - whipping him .
That prompted Augusto to pull the 12 - gauge , pump-action shotgun and fire three times , cops said .
The blasts struck all four men , two of them in the back .
“ I was hoping I could have talked them out of it .
I ’m sorry they ’re dead but they did n’t give me any other choice , ” Augusto said .
One of the perps , James Morgan , 29 , fell in the doorway and died outside the building , with a gun near his body .
Raylin Footman , 21 , who had prior arrests for robbery and weapons charges , collapsed across the street , and later died at St. Luke ’s Hospital .
Footman ’s brother said , “ He is loved , ” but added , “ I ca n’t say anything until I find out what happened . ”
The other two suspects , Bernard Witherspoon , 21 , and Shamel McCloud , 21 , were caught within blocks of the store .
Cops followed a trail of blood that led to Witherspoon , and caught McCloud using witness descriptions .
Both were taken to St. Luke ’s to be treated and charges are pending against them .
Augusto said he told the perps , “ No one even came in here today .
Take your gun , put it in your pocket and go home . ”
“ I could see it in the guy ’s eyes that he wanted to go home .
I just had a feeling he wanted to forget about it .
It ’s a damn shame . ”
There were no customers in the building at the time .
Witnesses described a wild scene as the defeated robbers came running out of the business pursued by one of Augusto ’s angry employees .
“ I heard two blasts , ” said Vernon McKenzie , who rents an apartment in the building from Augusto .
“ I came down and saw one of the guys who works there standing over a man in the doorway , screaming ‘ You ’re dead !
You ’re dead !’
“ [ Augusto ] has been robbed before , and I guess he was prepared , ” McKenzie said .
“ Those dudes ran into some real tough stuff . ”
In fact , Augusto said he bought his gun after his last robbery but had n’t yet fired it .
“ ” Ihad n’t tried to shoot it in all that time .
I did n’t even know if it would work .
I never fired it all this time . ”
Several witnesses said the employee dragged the robber out to the sidewalk , where he died .
“ The man pulled him from inside the store , ” said a woman who watched from her window across the street .
“ His face had blood all over it . ”
The dead man remained on the sidewalk covered by a sheet for several hours — his right shoe lying next to his head .
Augusto and his employees were being questioned at the 26th Precinct station house eary today .
It was unclear whether Augusto had a permit to carry the weapon .
A Manhattan prosecutor was also at the station house , sources said .
Police spokesman Paul Browne said Augusto “ is being treated as a witness and victim of an attempted armed robbery . ”
Augusto told cops he got the shotgun about 30 years ago after being robbed , Browne said .
Possession laws are tougher on handguns than shotguns .
Stefany Blyn , 56 , who has lived above the business for 25 years , described Augusto — known as Gus — as “ very laid back , very relaxed . ”
“ Gus has been robbed a few times over the years .
There have been attempts made before — some successful , ” she said .
“ He was n’t afraid of the neighborhood . ”
A man who said he knows both Augusto and the employee who was pistol whipped , said the store owner “ is very old fashioned .
He did n’t have a buzzer or security . ”
The violence brought to mind Goetz ’s shooting attack on a pack of subway muggers in 1984 , a case that spawned a debate on crime and vigilantes .

Dell H. Hymes , a prominent anthropologist , linguist and folklorist whose work mined the rich , often overlooked territory where language and culture intersect , died on Nov. 13 in Charlottesville , Va .
He was 82 and lived in Charlottesville .
The cause was complications of Alzheimer ’s disease , his son Robert said .
At his death , Professor Hymes was the Commonwealth professor of anthropology emeritus at the University of Virginia , where he had taught from 1987 till his retirement in 1998 .
Professor Hymes ’s academic net was so wide that a single name for his field is hard to come by : he has been described variously as a sociolinguist , an anthropological linguist and a linguistic anthropologist .
He himself came to call his vast , ecumenical discipline “ the ethnography of communication . ”
“ He was an anthropologist through and through and a linguist through and through , and he did n’t see an enormous barrier between the two , ” Joel F. Sherzer , emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Texas , said in a telephone interview on Friday .

A worldwide study of sexual preferences revealed that females feel more secure if they have a mate in reserve .
It seems you have the best of both worlds .
The older male is established and able to offer you security and thus provide for any children you may have with him , but you should be aware that male fertility and the condition of sperm decline with age .
The younger male , on the other hand , is likely to have a higher sperm count .
He excites you more sexually , but as yet he cannot provide for you or your future children .
However , the " sexy son hypothesis " states that sons born of sexy strangers will mature to become sexy men themselves , thus providing granny with plenty of grandchildren .
Some Darwinists might say your optimal strategy would be to pair - bond with the older male but surreptitiously allow the younger , sexy male to fertilise you .
But be careful , most men consider being cuckolded the greatest of betrayals .
Good luck !

I want to divorce him
From Suzie , age 47 , by email
I 've been with my husband for 20 years , we have two daughters , I love him but he is mad in some way .

I work full time and I 'm worn out .
I support him , I fund our lives , I do everything with the girls .
There 's no one else and I do n't want my kids to suffer , but I want to divorce him .

Twenty years ago you saw potential in your mate , but he has disappointed you .
Perhaps you have stayed with him because you fear he cannot cope alone ?
You have daughters and they are no doubt aware of your feelings , even if you have n't said anything .
We have not evolved to stay with one mate for the whole of our adult lives .
Some of us do so and enjoy it , but others do n't .
If your partner is weakening you it will be harder for you to invest time and energy in your daughters , who will need advice and support from their mum until they are settled adults .
Then they will require support from you to look after their own offspring .
You should have your husband medically assessed .
It may be that some form of genetic disorder underlies his erratic behaviour , in which case he will need counselling and support .
But you will also need to inform your daughters so that , if they are carriers , they do not themselves mate with men suffering from the same condition .

Do n't let your self - respect fall by allowing yourself to feel that your friends ' lives are better than your own .
Everyone has problems , but maintaining your self - respect will help you to maintain your social status .
A low - status chimpanzee mother has low - status infants , and humans are no different , so you must retain your self - respect at all costs .
You obviously want to make changes , which is good .
Why not ask your sons what they think ?
Young children have opinions – they are wired for survival and will ask for changes that will benefit themselves .
Having said that , youngsters do tend to think short - term and some of their suggestions might not be feasible , but seeing their points of view will be useful to you .
If you keep prioritising your sons you will , in a roundabout way , be helping yourself .
Certain genes are connected with addictions to alcohol and other drugs such as cocaine .
For example , an irregular form of the " D2 " gene can result in having a third fewer dopamine receptors than normal .
Those with the unusual D2 may unconsciously be trying to raise their dopamine levels with stimulants .
You need to understand your genetic makeup to be able to take control .
Why not ask your GP for a blood test ?
In the meantime try raising your dopamine levels naturally by laughing and playing with your sons .

The Sixth Army Group had assembled bridging equipment , amphibious trucks and assault boats .
Seven crossing sites along the upper Rhine were evaluated and intelligence gathered .
The Seventh Army could cross north of Strasbourg at Rastatt , Germany , advance north along the Rhine Valley to Karlsruhe , and swing west to come in behind the German First Army , which was blocking Patton ’s Third Army in Lorraine .
The enemy would face annihilation , and the Third and Seventh Armies could break loose and drive into Germany .
The war might end quickly .

Devers never crossed .
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , the supreme commander , visited Devers ’s headquarters that day and ordered him instead to stay on the Rhine ’s west bank and attack enemy positions in northern Alsace .
Devers was stunned .
“ We had a clean breakthrough , ” he wrote in his diary .
“ By driving hard , I feel that we could have accomplished our mission . ”
Instead the war of attrition continued , giving the Germans a chance to counterattack three weeks later in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge , which cost 80,000 American dead and wounded .
Garrison Davidson , then Devers ’s engineering officer and later a superintendent of West Point , believed Devers ’s attack would have succeeded and pre-empted the Bulge , writing , “ I have often wondered what might have happened had Ike had the audacity to take a calculated risk , as General Patton would have . ”
Patton wrote in his diary that he also believed Eisenhower had missed a great opportunity ; the Seventh Army ’s commander , Lt. Gen .
Alexander Patch , felt the same way .
Why did Eisenhower refuse to allow Devers to cross ?
Eisenhower disliked Devers  a prim teetotaler who rubbed many gruff Army commanders the wrong way  and refused to include him among the generals fighting in northern France .
Devers was appointed to lead the southern invasion by the Army chief of staff , George Marshall .
Eisenhower would likely have fired Devers once the Sixth Army Group fell under his command in September 1944 , but Devers had powerful patrons in Marshall and President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
Eisenhower was also a cautious , some would say indecisive , commander who favored a “ broad front ” strategy with all Allied armies moving in tandem on a solid front .
His military objective was Germany ’s main industrial area to the north , the Ruhr .
Devers was operating too far south to help that effort .
A SURVEY of prescriptions written by homeopathic practitioners has found that 10 out of every 10 is riddled with unscientific garbage , according to a new study .
Researchers found that many health food shop owners are having to rectify their mistakes by advising customers to visit a proper doctor instead .
Sample prescriptions found medicines such as ' shavings of Hogsfoot bark ' and ' two drops of that blue stuff in the fancy jar ' being recommended , with 30 % throwing in a reference to ' temporal chakras ' or praying to the river god Bento while wearing a hat made of ivy .
Helen Archer , an unwell person from Hatfield , said : " I 'd lost a lot of weight , was having dizzy spells and had started coughing up blood .
Unfortunately my homeopath wrote ' tincture of Elf Bane ' on his prescription instead of ' for Christ 's sake , go and see an oncologist ' . "
The General Medical Council has called for a standardisation of homeopathic prescriptions to avoid confusion , with all slips carrying the message ' you may as well eat this piece of paper ' .
A GMC spokesman said : " An A&E doctor working 100 hours a week might make a goof and accidentally kill a patient by mistaking a bottle of pethidine for orange juice , which is perfectly understandable .
If you do n’t like it , I suggest you pay us more money .
" But , if a bearded man in sandals listening to a CD of whale intercourse charges you eighty quid for a bottle of water tainted by microscopic amounts of more water , well , you can see how that would be unacceptable . "
He added : " If any homeopaths disagree , I suggest they mix up a tonic of one part my balls to three parts my big , fat , hairy arse . "

THERE was a rare moment this week in Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu , when a crowd of protesters marched through the ruined seaside city and burned the black flag of the Shabab , the jihadist militia that is threatening to take over the country .
The Shabab , which means youth , hunts down its critics , sometimes beheading them , so torching its battle banner in broad daylight was a brave act .
But the courage was perhaps born of desolation .
Most of the protesters were family and friends of Benadir University medical students killed by a suicide - bomber on December 3rd .
It has been 18 years since Somalia has had a properly functioning government .
Since 2007 , 19,000 Somali civilians are reported to have been killed and 1.5 m displaced ; over 3 m in a population of 8 m need emergency aid .
Yet amid all the violence and despair , people often overlook the lion - hearted efforts of institutions like Benadir University to turn the country around .
Against the odds , the embattled university trains young Somalis to serve as doctors in Mogadishu 's dire hospitals .
A graduation ceremony for its newest physicians was meant to be a moment of celebration .
It took place in a hotel in the only part of the city that Somalia 's feeble transitional government still controls ; several government ministers were present .
Survivors say the bomber was a man dressed in a burqa .
He approached the students and blew himself up , killing at least 22 people , many of them just - qualified doctors , and injuring 60 .
Three ministers perished ; a fourth was badly wounded .
So cruel was the attack that even the Shabab did not dare claim responsibility .
The bodies of the dead ministers wrapped in blue and white Somali flags have stirred an uncommon wave of national feeling in a normally bitterly fractious society .
Some hope the bombing may even mark the beginning of the end for the jihadists .
But that is unlikely .
The Shabab controls most of south and central Somalia .
If anything , its area of operations is widening .
The Shabab covers its expenses from taxes , tariffs and roadblocks .
It includes some opportunists but at its core are ferocious fighters linked to al - Qaeda who are intent on creating a caliphate of Greater Somalia , including chunks of Ethiopia and Kenya .
The Shabab appears to run at least two suicide - bomb brigades , mostly made up of teenage boys .
The bomber at Benadir University may have been one of them .
The death of the ministers is a big blow to a government already struggling to keep its less stoical ministers and parliamentarians in the country .
The well - meaning president , Sharif Ahmed , a moderate Islamist who was once a geography teacher , has been ineffectual .
His more secular - minded prime minister , Omar Sharmarke , whose father was an assassinated president of Somalia , says he wants more help to train his country 's army and police .
He also wants a massive programme of apprenticeships for young unemployed Somalis .
International navies , he says , should not just chase pirates but should also protect Somali waters from illegal fishing .
Outsiders seem unable to hold the ring .
The African Union ( AU ) still has a force of around 5,000 peacekeepers , mostly from Uganda and Burundi , 17 of whom were killed by a Shabab suicide - bomber in September .
But the AU force cannot patrol freely beyond a few streets in one section of Mogadishu .
America has been sending arms and money .
European countries have pledged support — but not nearly enough to defeat the Shabab .
Somalia 's neighbours , especially Kenya , are increasingly worried .
Shabab commanders controlling south Somalia say they will not spread their jihad across the border provided the Kenyan army leaves them alone .
Yet for decades many Kenyan ethnic Somalis , whose territory covers a swathe of north - eastern Kenya , have hankered after joining their brethren .
Western intelligence people in Nairobi , Kenya 's capital , have long feared that Somali jihadists will spread their wings into neighbouring countries or even farther afield .
Two Los Angeles City Council committees rejected the advice of the city attorney and voted Monday to approve an ordinance that allows marijuana dispensaries to continue to sell the drug to people with a doctor ’s recommendation .
The city attorney ’s office has maintained for a year and a half that Los Angeles has no choice but to ban sales because state law and court decisions are clear that collectives can only cultivate marijuana .
That opinion had stalled the council ’s deliberations because dispensary operators insisted it would force them to close .
Four hours into a raucous hearing , frustrated council members decided to replace the provision with one that authorizes cash contributions as long as they comply with state law , which prohibits collectives from making a profit .
“ When can we finally stop the merry - go - round ? ” said Councilman Dennis Zine , who urged his colleagues to discard the city attorney ’s version .
“ We ’re going to come back with another version and another version , and it ’s going to be 2010 , and then 2011 and 2015 , and we ’ll be dead by then and we wo n’t accomplish anything . ”
The decision broke the major deadlock on the contentious issue .
The planning and Public Safety committees sent the draft ordinance to the full council , which is likely to consider it Wednesday .
“ We need something on the books now .
There is no reason why we should delay , ” said Councilman Ed Reyes , who has overseen the council ’s effort to write an ordinance .
Don Duncan , a Los Angeles resident who is the California director of Americans for Safe Access , said he believed the decision would resolve one of the last obstacles .
“ It sounded like they were going to let a patient walk in and reimburse a collective for their medicine .
We can live with that , ” he said .
The council ’s action came after a judge ruled last month that the city ’s 2007 moratorium on new dispensaries was illegally extended , which essentially left the city with no rules that it could rely on to shut down the hundreds of stores that have opened in the last two years .
Some council members responded favorably to the city attorney ’s suggestion to consider capping the number of dispensaries .
Councilman Jose Huizar proposed a cap of 70 , allowing two in each of the 35 community plan areas .
“ Hopefully , that will allow us to control for the over - concentration , ” he said .
Almost 400 people crowded into the main council chamber and about 70 spoke , most testifying passionately about the medical value of marijuana and the role dispensaries play .
If the council members decide to ban sales , said Degé Coutee , who runs the Patient Advocacy Network , “ You will create a black market overnight .
You will turn good citizens into criminals overnight .
And you will get the city involved in costly litigation for years to come . ”
About a half - dozen neighborhood activists spoke .
Their complaints about vandalism , noise , loitering and dispensary operators with criminal backgrounds drew thundering boos and persistent catcalls from medical marijuana supporters .
“ This has become a public safety nightmare , ” said Michael Larsen , the public safety director for the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council .
James O’Sullivan , the president of the Miracle Mile Residential Assn. , advised : “ Do the right thing .
Protect your community . ”
A vote for a sales ban would take Los Angeles into uncharted legal territory .
Two organizations , Americans for Safe Access and the Union of Medical Marijuana Patients , have threatened to sue the city if the council adopts the provision .
Throughout the hearing , William Carter , the chief deputy city attorney , cited state law and court decisions and insisted they do not allow collectives to sell marijuana .
Several council members pointed out that West Hollywood has an ordinance that allows sales .
“ There are other cities throughout the state that may not be complying with state law as we see it , ” Carter said .
Reyes , who expressed exasperation with the city attorney ’s office , said , “ I think they are very , very narrow in that they ’re taking their prosecutorial perspective . ”
Zine urged the council to interpret state law in a way that would not disrupt how dispensaries now operate .
“ Why do n’t we push the envelope to the edge and see what we can do ? ” he said .
After the vote , David Berger , a special assistant to City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich , said the council had the right to decide whether to accept the office ’s legal advice .
“ Our duty is to advise them on what the law allows for , not to go on a whim , ” he said .
“ They decided to go a different way . ”

A CHEMISTRY student has reportedly been killed by what is believed to be exploding chewing gum .
Russian news agency Ria Novosti reports the 25 - year - old chemistry student was found dead with his jaw blown off after he was working on a computer at his parents ’ house in the Ukraine city of Konotop .
" A loud pop was heard from the student 's room , " a city police chief aide told ukranews.com .
" When his relatives entered the room they saw that the lower part of the young man 's face had been blown off . "
The man was studying at Ukraine ’s Kiev Polytechnic Institute and was known for his habit of dipping chewing in citric acid .
Ria Novosti reports police found both citric acid packets and “ some kind of explosive material ” on a table in his parents ’s room .
They believe he may have confused the two packets , dipping thegum into the explosive material rather than the citric acid .

It 's taken the Feds long enough .
They 're finally getting around to looking at all Allen Stanford 's extensive relationship -- both personal and financial -- with various members of Congress .
One of his biggest allies in Congress was Republican Pete Sessions :
Miami Herald :
He held an event at his office on the 21st floor of the Miami Center for Ohio house member Ney , who was later sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to accepting gifts and money from clients of lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
He rallied his brokers when Sessions was in a tight race with Democrat Martin Frost in Texas in 2004 .
`` He got on the speakerphone and told everyone to give to Pete Sessions , '' said Riger .
`` He said Sessions was good for our company and we needed to give to him . ''
Stanford raised $ 38,875 in the final weeks of the campaign for Sessions , who defeated Frost .
After Stanford was arrested , Sessions wrote to him an email saying : " I love you and believe in you ...
If you want my ear / voice -- e-mail . "

The US contractor Blackwater is operating in Pakistan at a secret CIA airfield used for launching drone attacks , according to a former US official , despite repeated government denials that the company is in the country .
The official , who had direct knowledge of the operation , said that employees with Blackwater , now renamed Xe Services , patrol the area round the Shamsi airbase in Baluchistan province .
He also confirmed that Blackwater employees help to load laser - guided Hellfire missiles on to CIA - operated drones that target al - Qaida members suspected of hiding in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border regions , confirming information that surfaced in the US media in the summer .
The secretive base at Shamsi is a key element in the CIA co-ordinated missile strikes that have hit more than 40 targets in the past year .
Officials in Washington said that a drone attack on Wednesday killed a senior al - Qaida figure .
The officials declined to name the individual , other than to say it was not Osama bin Laden .
It is the first time in almost a year that the US has claimed to have successfully targeted a senior al - Qaida figure .
The controversy over Blackwater stems mainly from its work in Iraq and Afghanistan that raised questions about the US use of private contractors in war zones .
Several cases against the company are pending in US courts over violent incidents , including a 2007 Baghdad shooting spree .
The New York Times reported today that links between Blackwater and the CIA in Iraq and Afghanistan have been closer than has yet been disclosed , with Blackwater staff participating in clandestine CIA raids against suspected insurgents .
The US and Pakistan governments , as well as Xe , deny the company operates in Pakistan .
Blackwater is a particularly emotive issue in Pakistan , where the company 's name , along with the drone strikes , have become lightning rods for anti-American sentiment .
Television stations have run images of alleged " Blackwater houses " in Islamabad , while some newspapers regularly run stories accusing US officials and respected journalists of being Blackwater operatives .
US diplomats say the stories are mostly incorrect , and the Pakistani media has confused American contractors from other companies and aid workers with Blackwater employees .
Pakistan 's interior minister , Rehman Malik , offered to resign if Blackwater was proved to be in Pakistan .
But there is growing evidence to suggest that Blackwater is working in Pakistan .
A serving US official said that Blackwater had a contract to manage the construction of a training facility for the paramilitary Frontier Corps , just outside Peshawar , this year .
But most of the work on the project , the official said , was done by Pakistani sub-contractors .
Blackwater rebranded itself
Xe after the shooting in a Baghdad square that left 17 Iraqis dead .
The CIA director Leon Panetta earlier this year ordered that many contracts with Blackwater be terminated .
A Congressional committee is investigating links between Blackwater and the intelligence services .
Xe , in a statement , denied that Blackwater was ever under contract to participate in covert raids with the CIA or special forces in Iraq , Afghanistan or anywhere else .
In a separate development , five young Americans detained in Pakistan over alleged terrorist links will probably be deported , Javed Islam , a police chief , said .
They had not been charged .
The US authorities have not yet said what action , if any , they will take when the five return .
The five , aged between 19 and 25 , are alleged to have made contact with militant groups .
News of their arrest has renewed US fears on homegrown terrorists .
The five all attended a mosque in Alexandria , Virginia , run by the Islamic Circle of North America .

Given the online forum of Facebook to create whatever public persona you ’d like , it would seem logical that people might portray an idealized version of themselves — putting up their most attractive photos , editing down their thoughts to the most clever and pithy before posting them in a status update , carefully choosing favorite books and movies to portray a certain sophistication .
Not so , say researchers from the University of Texas at Austin .
Instead of using Facebook to create rose - tinted portraits of themselves , more often people ’s Facebook profiles reflect their authentic personalities , with all of the quirks , funny faces and moodiness they entail .
Psychologist Sam Gosling analyzed the Facebook profiles of 236 college - aged people , who were also asked to fill out personality questionnaires .
The study , which will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science , included surveys that were designed to assess not only how study participants viewed themselves in reality , but also what their personalities would be like if they had all of their ideal traits .
Specifically Gosling and colleagues measured openness , agreeableness , conscientiousness , extraversion and neuroticism .
And when they sized up the survey results against participants ’
Facebook profiles , it quickly became clear that , instead of putting out gilded versions of themselves , people ’s online profiles were in keeping with what they were actually like in real life .
Not all personality traits transfer equally to the internet , however , Gosling points out .
While extroverts are consistent , whether in person or on Facebook , nueroticism is more evident in person than it is online .
For the most part , however , Gosling suggests that online profiles — which some 700 million people around the globe currently have — are relatively accurate depictions of personality , either because their owners intend for them to be , or because people are trying , but failing , to present an idealized version of themselves .
In what will likely strike a chord with Facebook devotees , he concludes that , instead of presenting a false alternative social world online , social networking sites are simply another medium for sincere social interactions .
( In other words , if you ’re a jerk in real life , you ’ll be one on Facebook too . )

The solution
In Haskell we write `f` in order to infixify the identifier f .
In ABC the stuff between backquotes is not limited to an identifier , but any expression may occur there .
This would allow one to write e.g .
xs ` zipWith ( + ) ` ys
Chung - chieh Shan and Dylan Thurston showed the Haskell98 solution for exactly the same example , in their article ` Infix expressions ' , back in 2002 in the article referenced above .
For ease of reference , here 's their elegant solution :
infixr 0 - : , :- data
Infix f y = f :- y x - : f :- y = x ` f ` y main = print $ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] -: zipWith ( + ) :- [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]

Mr Devdas says he was unaware of the law A 50 - year - old population control law has been invoked in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) to dismiss an official from a housing society board .
V Devdas was asked to step down from the Oberoi Gardens Co-operative Housing Society for having a third child .
His successor as secretary said rivals in the housing society had complained about Mr Devdas after a disagreement .
The 1960 law bars public office holders from having more than two children .
It can only be invoked after a complaint .
The law is meant to set an example to the general public , but experts say it has rarely been used to disqualify anyone .
India is the second most populated country in the world after China and officials have been grappling with ways to curb population growth .
' Rivalry ' Mr Devdas , a garment exporter , worked as secretary of the Oberoi Gardens Co-operative Housing Society in the city 's western suburb of Kandivali for nine years .
His third child , a girl , was born in 2005 .
Mr Devdas says he was not aware of the law when he contested - and won - the election for the third time this year .
" It is a very well organised society and we have won medals for our cultural activities .
But some members of the society made a request for waiving off their dues , " Mr Devdas told the BBC .
" It was not possible and so they complained to the registrar and invoked this section .
I was not even aware of this particular law earlier .
But after receiving the order from the registrar I have stepped down and a new secretary has taken charge . "
Government official SM
Patil who passed the order said : " This order was issued under section 73 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies ' Act .
" After I received a complaint from the society members , we studied the matter and after giving a hearing to Mr Devdas we passed an order disqualifying him . "
The housing society now has a new secretary , Manohar Bidaye .
" Everything was going smoothly in the society until some members made some requests which could never be fulfilled .
So they used the provision against Mr Devdas .
It is a case of rivalry , " he said .

Howard Roark in New Delhi
Consumer spending in the United States may be down , but an interest in Ayn Rand certainly is not .
Sales of Rand ’s last novel , the vigorously pro-capitalism fable Atlas Shrugged , have seen a huge leap in 2009 , briefly outperforming even President Barack Obama ’s The Audacity of Hope on Amazon ’s best - seller list .
Few 1,000 - page , half - century - old tomes can claim so much .
At tea parties and town halls nationwide , amid outrage over government bailouts of Wall Street banks and Detroit carmakers and the supposed socialization of health care , protesters speak of " going Galt , " refusing to work in what they see as a socialist economy , just as Rand ’s hero John Galt did .
Even the mea culpa of Rand ’s most famous fan and follower , former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , has done little to dent the appeal of her radical individualism and libertarianism , which Rand shaped into a philosophy she called Objectivism .
But all this makes a certain amount of sense .
Perhaps more surprising is the Ayn Rand boom that is building in another mass democracy : India .
Not only do Indians perform more Google searches for Rand than citizens of any country in the world except the United States , but Penguin Books India has sold an impressive number of copies — as many as 50,000 of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead each since 2005 , a number comparable to sales there by global best - seller John Grisham .
And that ’s not counting the ubiquitous pirated copies of her works that are hawked at rickety street stalls , sidewalk piles , and bus stations — an honor that Rand , a fierce defender of intellectual property rights , probably would not have appreciated .
As modern India continues to undergo seismic economic and cultural shifts , not to mention the current global recession , Rand is emerging as a touchstone for a new generation .
For many Indians , she is a tonic of modernization , helping to inspire a break with India ’s collectivist , socialist past .
Rand ’s mixture of capitalist boosterism and self - empowerment is an irresistible combination for a range of Indians , from think - tankers to corporate barons to pop stars .
Rand ’s celebration of independence and personal autonomy has proven to be powerfully subversive in a culture that places great emphasis on conforming to the dictates of family , religion , and tradition .
Gargi Rawat , a correspondent and news anchor for top tv channel ndtv and a former Rand admirer , says Rand ’s theory of the supremacy of reason and the virtue of selfishness adds up to " the antithesis " of Indian culture , which explains the attraction for Rawat in her youth and for many rebellious Indian teens today .
Unlike in the United States , Rand ’s most popular novel in India - anecdotally at least - is not the overtly political Atlas Shrugged , but her earlier novel , The Fountainhead , in which Rand ’s political views are muted .
The novel tells the story of Howard Roark , an architect who refuses to compromise his designs for clients or the public in a heroic expression of personal will .
It is Rand ’s most accessible work , and also the one that makes the strongest emotional appeal to those who feel suppressed by attempts to put the collective ahead of the individual .
In recent years , the so - called " Howard Roark effect " has swept across wealthy Indian society .
Shortly after winning Miss India Earth , the country ’s top beauty pageant , in 2005 , Niharika Singh cited The Fountainhead as her favorite book .
" Ayn Rand helped me win the crown , " she declared .
Other stars , including biotech queen Kiran Mazumdar - Shaw , actress Preity Zinta , and soccer - player - turned - dancer Baichung Bhutia have all credited Rand with helping them succeed .
Beyond personal inspiration , however , the Indian excitement for Rand today is linked to a larger enthusiasm for the country ’s inchoate but powerful drive for development and wealth .
Since the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , India has seen a gradual shift away from socialism , much appreciated by Rand ’s fans .
Vikram Bajaj , a 45 - year - old entrepreneur who considers himself an objectivist , has lived through Rand ’s evolution from an ignored outsider to a popular prophet of capitalism .
When he discovered Rand , taxation rates for high earners were hovering at 85 percent of income ; now , with her books widely available , that upper rate is only 30 percent .
Barun Mitra is the founder and director of the Liberty Institute , which hopes to be India ’s equivalent of the United States ’ libertarian Cato Institute and has recently received a grant from an American foundation to launch a Web initiative promoting " Ayn Rand in India . "
He has been a Rand devotee since the early 1980s and even met his wife through a Rand discussion group .
To Mitra , Rand offers a blueprint for India to develop as a democratic and capitalist society at the same time .
He hopes that Rand and her libertarian doctrines can enable India to provide a counterexample to the so - called " Asian model " of economic development , which holds that a certain level of authoritarian government and stifled liberty is a prerequisite for a surging economy .
If India can achieve double - digit growth while remaining democratic , Mitra thinks , it could become a model for the rest of the world .
Rand ’s philosophy , Mitra says , can help Indians " moor ourselves to fundamental economic and moral principles . "
It ’s unclear whether Rand will ever become the definitive textbook of modernization for India :
Her ideas about religion , capitalism , and society are too anathema to India ’s traditional culture ever to be adopted completely .
But Rand will continue to inspire India ’s emerging creative class and corporate titans , not to mention the ambitious youth who make up her most passionate fan base , in India as around the world .
For those fans , Ayn Rand is truly a prophet of things to come .

Cheney : ‘ Not a chance ’ I ’ll run for president
Dick Cheney in 2012 ?
One new political group , led by a prominent former Log Cabin Republican , thinks it could — and should — happen .
Despite the former vice - president ’s low approval ratings among the American public , the organizers of Draft Cheney 2012 believe he ’s the right man to take on President Barack Obama in the next election — and , they say , he may be the only person left in the Republican Party who has what it takes to run the country .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The 2012 race for the Republican nomination for President will be about much more then who will be the party ’s standard bearer against Barack Obama , the race is about the heart and soul of the GOP , ” CNN quoted Christopher Barron , the principal organizer of the Draft Cheney movement .
“ There is only one person in our party with the experience , political courage and unwavering commitment to the values that made our party strong – and that person is Dick Cheney . ”
The group has launched a Web site and a Facebook group ( 87 members so far ) , and plans to rally supporters to their cause at Tea Party events and in early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa , CNN reports .
But does the group stand a chance of garnering support from grassroots Republicans cheering for a Sarah Palin ticket or even a run by Lou Dobbs ?
The Chicago Tribune ‘s Swamp Politics blog reports , “ There would seem to be support in some quarters for a Cheney bid , notes Barron , quoting Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard as saying : ‘ Of course , everyone ’s first choice for president in 2012 is Dick Cheney . ” ”
Yet the effort to put Dick Cheney back in the White House could face one major obstacle : Dick Cheney himself .
As CNN notes , earlier this month at a campaign event for Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , the Texas Republican running to replace Gov. Rick Perry , Cheney responded to calls for him to run for president with three simple words : “ Not a chance . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Barron , who appears to be the group ’s founder as its
Web site is registered in his name , is known for his unwavering loyalty to core Republican values .
A lawyer and campaign consultant , he was political director of the Log Cabin Republicans , a group for gay conservatives , before he and some other LCR members decided the group was n’t conservative enough and launched their own , more conservative group , GOProud .
Barron also runs CapSouth , a political consultancy that lists among its members PhRMA , the pharmaceutical industry ’s lobby group .
Last June , Barron penned a column for the Huffington Post in which he advocated in favor of expanding concealed - carry permits because , he suggested , carrying guns is an effective way for homosexuals to prevent attacks against them .

“ If Congress is actually interested in preventing violent hate crimes , they should pass legislation that will empower individuals to defend themselves before they become another hate crime victim , ” he wrote .
Barron ’s column was criticized by some for its poor timing — it was published the day white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly killed a security guard with a concealed weapon at Washington ’s Holocaust Museum .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bank overdraft fees would be sharply curtailed under a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate on Monday , adding to a raft of regulatory challenges for banks .
The legislation offered by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and five other Democratic senators would curb fees that some banks are already backing away from .
Under the Dodd bill , banks could not slap overdraft fees on cash - machine and debit - card transactions unless customers have specifically opted in to an overdraft protection program .
Many banks in recent years have automatically enrolled customers in overdraft coverage programs and then charged them fees ranging from $ 10 to $ 38 per incident when they overdraw .
“ Consumers are being hit with hundreds of dollars in penalties for overdrawing on their account by just a few dollars .
Banks should not be trying to bolster their profits at the expense of their customers , ” said Dodd in a statement .
Major banks that have recently announced voluntary caps or other curbs on overdraft fees include Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co .
The Dodd bill adds to a fast - growing list of regulatory problems confronting the banking industry as Washington reacts to the worst financial crisis in generations .
By tightening oversight of the financial sector , President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats hope to prevent another crisis in the future and do more to protect consumers .
Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney has introduced a bill to rein in overdraft fees in the House of Representatives .

The administration has sent more than a dozen regulatory reform proposals to Capitol Hill , ranging from creating a systemic risk regulator to restraining executive pay .
The European Union is making similar efforts , but progress on both sides of the Atlantic has been slow in the face of stiff industry resistance and fading momentum as markets recover .
The House Financial Services Committee will meet on Tuesday to work on a bill that would create a U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Agency , or CFPA , which supporters say is needed to police issues like overdraft fees , mortgages and credit cards .
Opponents of the proposed agency , including banking industry lobbyists , have attacked it as an unneeded and costly new layer of government bureaucracy .
PROFITS THREATENED
Analysts say the proposed agency , along with other parts of the Obama administration ’s financial regulation reform program , would threaten banks ’ profits .
The CFPA bill , as drafted , could expose many banks to increased state regulation .
The biggest banks would likely be hit hardest by the agency , while many small banks would be shielded from the full impact of its examinations .
Large banks ’ profits from over - the - counter derivatives markets operations are also threatened by legislation approved last week by the committee .
Debate resumes this week in the House Agriculture Committee on OTC derivatives regulation .
Bonuses at Wall Street mega - banks have come under attack .
Obama aides have stepped up their rhetoric in recent days , blasting recent reports that firms such as Goldman Sachs could hand out record levels of bonuses as “ offensive . ”
On fees , Dodd ’s bill would require that customers “ opt in ” to overdraft coverage programs on cash machine and debit card transactions , while limiting banks to charging a maximum of one overdraft fee per month and no more than six fees per year .
Joining Dodd in introducing the bill were five other Democratic senators : Jack Reed , Sherrod Brown , Charles Schumer , Carl Levin and Jeff Merkley .
“ Excessive and unfair overdraft fees are forcing Congress to step in yet again to stop abusive banking practices , ” Levin said .
The bill would bar banks from punishing those who reject overdraft coverage by , for instance , denying them favorable terms on other services .
Further , it would “ require fee amounts be proportional to the cost of processing the overdraft . ”
In addition , banks could not manipulate the order in which they process transactions to gain extra fees , while customers would have to be notified when they overdraw at a cash machine or teller and be allowed to cancel the transaction .
To mark Toronto 's 175th birthday , the Saturday Star is presenting turning points in the city 's history that have helped make it what it is today .
Toronto owes much to Egerton Ryerson , who envisioned a public school system where children of all backgrounds would learn side by side .
More than 160 years after the passing of the first Schools Act , his dream is realized in every classroom in the city .
He would go on to become the father of public education , but as a youth , Egerton Ryerson was always getting into trouble .
His first act of defiance was in his teens , when he decided against his Anglican father 's wishes to pursue his mother 's Methodist faith .
Shocked , his father gave him an ultimatum : forgo his faith or leave home .
Determined , but defiant , Ryerson left home .
It was his second act of defiance , a few years later , that would initiate Ryerson 's quest for a more equitable society .
In an effort to defend Methodism , Ryerson , by then a devout minister , took on John Strachan , one of the most influential men in Upper Canada in the 1820s .
Strachan , a leading Anglican cleric , was determined to maintain his church 's elitist power and control over the business , financial and educational affairs of Upper Canada .
When Strachan delivered what was later dubbed the " obnoxious sermon " at a funeral in 1825 , he was trying to undermine the growing popularity of the Methodists , whom he called " ignorant American enthusiasts , unsound in religion and disloyal in politics . "
Offended at being called a traitor , Ryerson , just 22 , wrote a stinging rebuttal .
A bold move by a man so young , it made him a spokesperson for a powerless community .
Ryerson noticed how the Anglicans could afford the best schools and seminaries to produce leaders , the kind of grooming he felt was a " danger " to society .
He believed education should be " the surest means to the way a better , more equal , society could be built . "
" He always was aware of the fact he was in a minority living in this British Anglican culture , " said Anthony Di Mascio , a history professor at the University of Ottawa who recently completed a thesis on the origins of schooling in Ontario .
" He saw this idea of schooling Methodist children alongside Anglicans ' children as a form of security against the potential of religio - social segregation , " Di Mascio said .
Ryerson was given a chance in 1844 , when he was appointed superintendent of education for Upper Canada .
Two years later , the first Schools Act was passed , a law that formalized and standardized public education – setting the stage for publishing local textbooks , formal teacher training and compulsory taxation to ensure that all children , regardless of faith or social status , would be educated .

Over his 30 - year tenure , Ryerson would contribute immensely to the city by creating standards , opening libraries , allocating funds , and opening the first Normal School ( teachers ' college ) on the site of the university now named for him .
Ryerson predicted what kind of city Toronto would become – one where despite differences of colour , faith , and status , schools have remained an equalizer .

Louise Radnofsky reads about politics when she ’s not reporting on politics .
There are only so many hours in the day , and we want to help you .
So here ’s the first in an occasional series rounding up what you need to know about big politics books you want to read , if only you could find the time .
PublicAffairs Books
In between election returns , we read “ Sarah From Alaska ” by Scott Conroy and Shushannah Walshe , two reporters who covered last year ’s presidential race .
It ’s out now from PublicAffairs Books ( with the teasing subtitle , “ The Sudden Rise and Brutal Education of a New Conservative Superstar ” ) .
We found enough in it to sustain a week of cocktail conversations .
Here are the highlights :
— Getting the news from Fox : Sarah Palin learned from Fox News that she and John McCain would n’t win last year ’s presidential election .
When she heard anchor Brit Hume announce that Barack Obama had won Ohio , “ Palin swallowed a mouthful of air .
‘ Oh , well , that ’s it , ’ she said . ”
— No concession on the concession : Palin wanted to give a concession speech , but that was nixed by McCain and his aides .
It had been written by former Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully , and would have had her say , “ when a black citizen prepares to fill the office of Washington and Lincoln , that is a shining moment in our history that can be lost on no one . ”
And Palin would have offered her own lavish praise for Obama and his “ beautiful family , ” McCain and the “ honor of a lifetime ” that he had given her , and a shout - out to a boy with Down syndrome who she had met on the campaign trail .
McCain and his staff were adamantly opposed , though the authors offer no real explanation beyond the general friction between the McCain and Palin camps by the end of the campaign …

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wants UEFA to consider taking retrospective action on bookings as well as red cards in Champions League matches .
Ferguson was incensed that Darren Fletcher was booked for diving by Portuguese referee Olegario Benquerenca instead of a penalty being awarded in the thrilling 3 - 3 draw against CSKA Moscow .
Antonio Valencia scored the equaliser in stoppage time at Old Trafford to secure United 's place in the last 16 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ferguson , however , rounded on the official and said : " You can't appeal a yellow card .
I can understand in domestic football that it could get lost in the system .
" But in European football it is crucial because , later in the tournament , to miss a really important game because of that is unfair .
They should look at that but they wo n't .
" I cannot believe the decision ( of the referee ) .
Okay , it is human error , but it was one of the worst in my lifetime . "
United were facing their first home defeat in 23 Champions League games after finding themselves two goals down to the Russians early in the second half .
Wayne Rooney , whose wife Coleen gave birth to baby boy Kai yesterday , was then introduced and - according to CSKA coach Leonid Slutski - changed the face of the game .
Paul Scholes pulled a goal back in the 84th minute and Valencia secured a vital point when his shot took a deflection to wrong - foot superb goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev .
Ferguson said : " Wayne had n't had much sleep .
I would have preferred to leave him on the bench .
" He was a safety player that we knew we could have played if we needed him - he was there .
" I think his energy and confidence was very high .
He makes an impact .
He is such a good player and is always capable of scoring .
He was a wee bit unlucky . "
Slutski added : " Rooney is one of the best players in the world .
He has a high level of skill as well as aggression .
" He made a difference as I thought United were moderate before he came on . "
Alan Dzagoev opened the scoring for the visitors only for Michael Owen to pull United level with his fifth goal of the season .
However CSKA regrouped and extended their lead with goals from Milos Krasic and Vasili Berezutski .
It looked curtains for United , only for last season 's beaten finalists to raise their game despite the sterling efforts to Akinfeev to keep them out .
Ferguson said : " If you want excitement , come to Old Trafford .
One of the great pleasures of being a manager here is when you get finishes like that .
" We went very open and kept being caught on the counter attack - but having said that , we should have been 4 - 0 up before they even had an effort on target .
" When they got their third goal it knocked us back a bit because we could n't get our momentum back for ten to 15 minutes and their goalkeeper was fantastic . "
Slutski said : " My team played well and our plan worked but there was no joy in the dressing room after the game . "
The best league in the world is back .

Understanding has been helped by the film the Diving Bell and the Butterfly
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
The case of Rom Houben , thought to have been in a coma for 23 years , but apparently conscious all the time , raises a horrifying prospect : how can you cope being trapped in your body , aware of everything but unable to communicate with the outside world ?
Mike Cubiss can vividly remember the tiles on the kitchen floor and how cold they felt .
He was waiting for the ambulance , afraid he might die , but unable to move or say goodbye to his wife .
LOCKED -IN SYNDROME
Condition superficially resembling coma in which patient is mute and totally paralysed , except for eye movements , but remains conscious Usually results from massive haemorrhage , thrombosis , or other damage , affecting upper part of brain - stem , which destroys almost all motor function , but leaves the higher mental functions intact Sources : The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia and Taber 's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary
' Coma ' man conscious for 23 years
On an ordinary day in 2002 , as he prepared to take his three sons to school , and his wife got ready for work , Mike collapsed .
The aftermath was locked - in syndrome .
Public awareness of the condition today is largely a result of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , a book by French magazine editor Jean - Dominique Bauby , later turned into a film .
The syndrome is typically caused by a lesion in the pons , effectively the part of the brain stem that acts as a bridge between brain and body .
The most common cause is a stroke .
In its " classical form " those with the syndrome are almost completely paralysed and sometimes only able to move their eyes up and down , or to blink .
They cannot move but they are fully conscious .
" It has nightmarish qualities , robbed of all function and trapped in a body in which you can't communicate , " says Dr Mark Delargy , director of the brain injury programme at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dublin .
Rom Houben 's case has again focused attention " Another aspect is that it is often diagnosed at a very late interval .
The person could be in hospital , considered to be in a coma state or vegetative state [ and ] it 's only discovered some months after the person has been surviving , that they are actually not in a vegetative state .
" It 's often family members who believe that their nearest and dearest have some intellect .
They are not believed for a while .
Eventually someone spots what the family have seen . "
In Rom Houben 's case , his mother always believed he could communicate .
And the idea that the family may establish a line of communication first is familiar to Lorna Elwick who became partially locked - in in 1993 , when she was 40 .
" I had a particularly bad headache at work one day , " says Lorna , communicating via a special computer .
" The ache was centred round the lower part of my head , at the back , and my neck .
I also could n't speak .
Over three days I went three times to both my GP and A&E .
Neither had any ideas , I was n't scanned but just given strong painkillers .
MIKE CUBISS , 47 ( below , left )
" It was September 2002 .
I can remember everything , from initially experiencing a loud buzzing in my ears , knowing it was something serious .
" I asked the boys to get my wife [ Wendy ] as we were all at home - she was getting ready for work as a practice nurse , I was going to drive the boys to school .
Our boys were aged 12 , 10 and eight then ; first day back at school after the summer hols .
I was sitting down in the kitchen and as Wendy spoke to me my speech very rapidly deteriorated from slurring to nothing .
" I never lost consciousness and I could hear Wendy calling the ambulance .
I was frightened that if I closed my eyes I would die .
They moved me to the floor to keep my airway safe - it was tiled and I remember how cold it felt .
I wanted to say goodbye to Wendy as I thought might die , but could not speak .
All the way in the ambulance I kept my eyes open for that reason .
" I was transferred to ICU .
Wendy had to convince the anaesthetist that I really was normal and definitely still intellectually in tact .
I was eventually transferred to a neuro rehab unit in Newcastle .
I recall seeing the trees from the ambulance trip up there , feeling for the first time that I was going to live . "
" By the third day I could n't even swallow .
A&E finally agreed to take me in on the third evening , but the following morning I completely collapsed .
They diagnosed brain - stem infarction and locked - in syndrome . "
It was her brother , a policeman familiar with communicating by using presses of a walkie - talkie button , who found that Lorna could communicate .
" He said he was going to ask me some questions , which I should blink once for no and three times for yes .
In 15 minutes he had established that I was cognitively ok .
" The consultant said it meant nothing and told my husband that I 'd probably die .
Gradually the medical staff - beginning with auxiliaries and ending with consultant - began communicating like that with me . "
Many doctors would know to test consciousness by looking for eye movements , says Adam Zeman , professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology at Exeter 's Peninsula Medical School .
" The trouble is that you may lose even those movements and still be aware .
It becomes much more difficult to diagnose .
It is very nightmarish but very , very rare . "
Even for those where a line of communication is established using eye movements , it is a painstaking process .
" Often the individual has a lot of eye problems - eye watering , they can't blink , grit gets into their eyes .
The eye becomes very sore , " says Dr Delargy .
" Eye movements fatigue very rapidly .
It gives a sense of pressure on the communicator to be clever about the questions .
" It 's the equivalent of a mobile phone with a dying battery . "
Communication can be by an e-tran frame
How can the locked - in patient maintain the will to live ?
Studies of patients suggest that while the layman imagines it a fate worse than death , the vast majority of those who are locked - in want to be alive , despite their predicament .
It 's something that Mike Cubiss attests to : " I now feel that this is better than being dead .
I accept it .
I do not allow myself to dwell on it as that would be too depressing .
" I am surrounded by my family and can see my sons grow up , though I can't put much input into that , which makes me very sad . "
Dr Delargy knows that most people immediately assume the locked - in person is in a state of mental torment , but they are in a battle where there is no choice but to carry on .
" The person has been in a state for so long that they have worked out how to cope with this .
They have lived with the situation day by day until an appropriate person finds out .
" Not everyone is on anti-depressants .
They choose not to be .
People who are in locked - in syndrome say it is n't great but it is better than being dead . "
COMMUNICATION
E-tran frame Reorganised alphabet is read out with yes no answers Eyegaze computer , such as those worked on in the UK by specialist Mick Donegan Complete recovery is rare , but patients can make improvements .
Lorna no longer considers herself locked - in .
She can mouth words to those who can lipread , she has some use of her right finger and has learned to swallow food .
She remains angry about the standard of medical treatment she had before and immediately after she became locked - in .
And life is still very hard .
" When I was first ill , I was very upbeat .
Now I get fed - up more often especially as I am forced to stay in bed more or my bum hurts .
" What helps most is the fact that I had more than my fair share of emotional lability [ a symptom of brain - stem damage that can cause uncontrollable laughter ] and found humour in so many things - some people cry or get angry but , although I did cry and get very angry , predominantly I laughed quite uncontrollably and still do .
" The fact that my husband stayed around , plus all my family also helped .
Also , I have much more control now that I 'm home . "

In terms of practical coping , the locked - in patient has all the same challenges as any paralysed person .
They must be moved to avoid bed sores , carers must be aware that certain postures can become uncomfortable for them , and a host of other concerns .
But communication is key .
Patients use everything from an e-tran board , where their gaze is interpreted by a carer , to eyegaze computers , to devices operated by tiny body movements .
At the point where blinking or upwards eye movement is all they can manage , carers will read out a reorganised alphabet with yes / no answers to communicate .
And all the time , there is the knowledge for the doctors , carers , and family that the patient is often desperate to communicate something vital .
MINIMAL CONSCIOUSNESS
As well as locked - in syndrome , there is the more common condition of being " minimally conscious "
As many as 40 % of patients diagnosed as vegetative may be partially conscious some of the time Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans can be used to detect brain activity ' Uncommunicative ' patients are instructed to think about certain things while being scanned Imagining playing tennis is a key task Activity in the brain shows up as yellow blobs on the scan Key paper on subject by team led by Adrian Owen published in 2006
Could be used to spot locked - in patients who cannot move eyes Source : Martin Monti , MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit , Cambridge Dr Delargy recalls one severely locked - in male patient was transferred from a bed to a chair every day for about four hours so he could enjoy a change of scenery .
It was two years before it was established that he became uncomfortable after about an hour in the chair .
In a life that was a tissue of problems and discomforts , carers and doctors had been unable to ascertain this particular problem .
" It is exquisitely gut - wrenching , " says Dr Delargy .
" Once you get the answer no to the question ' are you comfortable ? ' , it can take another 10 questions . "
And of course the issue of coping is not just for those who are locked - in , but also those around them , as Lorna attests .
" My family accepted me almost straightaway .
Most friends were obviously so traumatised , they disappeared after the first few months .
I was disgusted and angry with them . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
I 'm so glad the public are being made aware of locked - in syndrome .
Fifteen years ago , after a car accident , I was only able to communicate by blinking and using the alphabet .
Family and friends became very adept at talking this way with me .
Now I can whisper , I have enough movement to use an electric chair and to use a computer .
I have a good life , I run my own home , I 've brought up my daughter and son .
All with the support of family , friends and personal assistants .
Of course I have low times , who does n't .
But I 'm very glad to be alive and I try to get the most I can out of life .
Often when out I 'm aware of the strong reaction to me from people , specially when I open my mouth to talk .
I feel my communication difficulties almost frightens people .
I 've often been told people wo n't talk to me because they 're frightened of upsetting me if they do n't understand me .
Who 's upset ?!
At the end of the day what 's really needed , besides support from family and friends is the right care support and understanding from service providers ( enabling us to take our roles back within family and social circles ) adequate medical care for both during and after a trauma .
So that those of us living with the effect of or the aftermath of locked - in syndrome , are able to pull back some control over our lives .
With the public more aware that it does n't have to be the end of life to be locked - in .
It will hopefully mean that this awareness will help those who are or have been locked - in , get on with living .

This is a living hell for the patient and truly awful for family and friends .
My sister suffered an attack of Guillain - Barre syndrome when she was a fully fit 32 - year - old .
She was left paralysed to her eyes , on a life support machine , and in constant , agonizing pain .
Discovering she was in pain was easy , but working out the location and cause could take hours .
Thankfully , a year on she is recovering some feelings and movement , but she may never fully recover .
Gemma , Newport I am profoundly respectful of those who have the strength to remain upbeat despite an horribly debilitating condition .
The ability to communicate one 's desires should be taken into account when being alive is NOT better .
We are granted the choice to end the suffering of a beloved pet , and it seems that people should be given the same respect and choice .
Following a massive stroke , my mother was essentially locked in for three years .
The only communication that she had was through tears , and I know what her request would have been .
It seems that the communication technology might provide a compelling reason for euthanasia at the patient 's request .

I visited my uncle on the Monday and he died on the Friday but between those dates he was in a coma .
However when I first visited him and said it is " Pat 's daughter " this glow slowly went up his face till all his face was aglow and then it immediately went back to normal .
So I am sure he heard .
There was no other response after that .
Pat Bailey , Blackpool I would want to die instantly .
In fact , my mother and I already have a mutual pact regarding this situation .
Losing my freedom in every sense of the word would be the worst thing imaginable to me .
Frank Wallace , Glasgow , Scotland I have so much respect for the way those suffering from this illness manage to cope .
Five years ago I suffered from bilateral facial paralysis .
Unable to move any part of my face , no blinking , and just about managing to make noise with my mouth in a way that people could understand I felt so trapped within myself & if I could have cried I 'm sure I would have done for most of the time I was ill .
Luckily for me , I made an almost full recovery , just can't quite open my mouth as wide as I used to or smile the same and one eye gets very small when I 'm tired or ill or even if it 's very windy .
But by comparison , being able to communicate in some form and being able to at least get up & walk around and even have people communicate with me , my problems were minor and I feel so much for those who are ' Locked - in ' , but their determination to stay positive is a real inspiration !

Western Union has been the conduit of a lot of fraud .
But since they ’re not the victim , they do n’t care much about security .
It ’s an externality to them .
It took a lawsuit to convince them to take security seriously .
Western Union , one of the world ’s most frequently used money transfer services , will begin warning its customers against possible fraud in their transactions .
Persuading consumers to send wire transfers , particularly to Canada , has been a popular method for con artists .
Recent scams include offering consumers counterfeit cashier ’s checks , advance - fee loans and phony lottery winnings .
More than $ 113 million was swindled in 2002 from U.S. residents through wire transfer fraud to Canada alone , according to a survey conducted by investigators in seven states .
Washington was one of 10 states that negotiated an $ 8.5 million settlement with Western Union .
Most of the settlement would fund a national program to counsel consumers against telemarketing fraud .
In addition to the money , the company has agreed to increase fraud awareness at more than 50,000 locations , develop a computer program that would spot likely fraud - induced transfers before they are completed and block transfers from specific consumers to specific recipients when the company receives fraud information from state authorities .
