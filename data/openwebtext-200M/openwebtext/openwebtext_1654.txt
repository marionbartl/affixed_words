General information
What is SheepShaver ?
SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for BeOS and Linux that allows you to run classic MacOS applications inside the BeOS / Linux multitasking environment .
This means that both BeOS / Linux and MacOS applications can run at the same time ( usually in a window on the BeOS / Linux desktop ) and data can be exchanged between them .
If you are using a PowerPC - based system , applications will run at native speed ( i.e. with no emulation involved ) .
There is also a built - in PowerPC emulator for non-PowerPC systems .
SheepShaver is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
However , you still need a copy of MacOS and a PowerMac ROM image to use SheepShaver .
If you 're planning to run SheepShaver on a PowerMac , you probably already have these two items .
Supported systems
SheepShaver runs with varying degree of functionality on the following systems :
Unix with X11 ( Linux i386/x86_64 / ppc , NetBSD 2.x , FreeBSD 3.x )
Mac OS X ( PowerPC and Intel )
Windows NT/2000/XP
BeOS R4/R5 ( PowerPC )

Abstract :
This talk will begin with an introductory overview of string theory .
This will lead to a discussion of the role of the dualities that provide connections between very different perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the theory and provide fascinating interconnections between quantum field theory and quantum gravity .
There are quite a few U.S. cities that are complete and utter economic disaster zones in 2010 ( Detroit for example ) , but there is something about the demise of Las Vegas that is absolutely stunning .
In recent decades , Las Vegas has become a symbol for the over - the - top affluence and decadence of America .
But now it is a microcosm of the economic nightmare that has gripped the entire nation .
When the subprime mortgage crisis stuck , no major U.S. city was more devastated than Las Vegas .
When the recession went from bad to worse , Americans decided that they really did n’t need to gamble so much and casino revenues plummeted .
Suddenly unemployment started to increase dramatically in Vegas and even today it continues to soar .
Like so many other cities that are highly dependent on tourism and entertainment , Las Vegas has gone from boom to bust .
Local officials are hoping that the worst will soon be over , but the truth is that the worst is yet to come .
As the U.S. economy continues to unravel , average Americans will be spending what little money they do have to put a roof over their heads and to feed their families .
The truth is that the glory days of Las Vegas are over and they are not coming back .
Already , the number of unemployed in Las Vegas is reaching unprecedented levels .
Unemployment rates for the state of Nevada and for the city of Las Vegas both set new records during the month of April .
In Las Vegas the unemployment rate in April was 14.2 % .
For the entire state the unemployment rate was 13.7 % .
Of course those are just the “ official ” numbers .
We all know that the “ real ” unemployment numbers are much higher .
For example , the “ official ” unemployment figure is about 14 percent in the state of Michigan right now .
But if you actually believe that 86 percent of able - bodied workers in the state of Michigan are employed , then perhaps you would be interested in an offer to purchase the Golden Gate Bridge as well .
Elliott Parker , an economist at the University of Nevada , Reno says that the record - setting unemployment numbers in Nevada are just part of a larger trend … .
“ Nevada has been losing jobs since March 2008 , and we are continuing to do so . ”
But where the state of Nevada and the city of Las Vegas have really been hammered is in the housing industry .
It is estimated that a whopping 65 percent of all homes in the state of Nevada are underwater .
Let that sink in for a bit .
65 percent of all home owners with a mortgage in the state of Nevada owe more than their homes are worth .
Talk about an implosion .
Nationally , the number of homes that are “ underwater ” is about 24 percent .
That is an all - time record for the entire nation , but it does n’t come anywhere close to the nightmare that is unfolding in Nevada and in Las Vegas .
And the number of foreclosures taking place in Nevada is absolutely breathtaking .
According to RealtyTrac , Nevada is still ranked number one for foreclosure filings .
In fact , one out of every 79 Nevada homes received a foreclosure filing in the month of May alone .
Nevada ’s foreclosure rate is now five times the national average .
By just about any measure , the economy of Nevada is a complete and total disaster .
A reader recently sent an email describing the economic horror that is unfolding in Las Vegas .
No matter what you may think about the city , the truth is that it is sad to see any great U.S. city fall to pieces like this ….
“ Las Vegas is a goner .
The homeless population is out of control .
The real estate is far worse than I have seen in the media ( no surprise there ) .
The towers of condos are ninety five percent vacant with zero activity .
The streets and parks are in decline .
Local governments are busy making cuts and fighting unions .
When I ride the streets they are deserted , a big change from 2006 .
The major casino companies have all but moved the casinos out of Nevada .
Rooms and restaurants have been closing for years , even while they finished the new projects .
The entire town is a skeleton staff providing substandard service and decaying properties .
I still work for one of the majors which is in bankruptcy .
When the next wave hits there is nowhere to cut .
It will be a game of dominoes with the Wynn properties the only ones left standing .
I see the ninety nine cent breakfast making a comeback .
The bullet train a day late and a few billion dollars short . ”
So is there any hope for Las Vegas ?
Well , if the U.S. economy gets back up off of the operating table and roars back to life there is little doubt that millions of Americans would once again soon be flying there to gamble away their discretionary income .
But the truth is that any “ revival ” that is going to happen in Vegas is going to be very short - lived .
The U.S. economy as a whole is caught in a death spiral , and we are about to see a repeat of the housing crash that devastated Las Vegas so badly the first time around .
No , there really is n’t any way that the death of Las Vegas can be avoided .
Just like the U.S. economy as a whole , it is inevitably doomed .
The numbers do n’t lie .
The grand total of all government , corporate and consumer debt in the United States is now equal to 360 percent of GDP .
That is a far greater level than the U.S. ever approached during the Great Depression .
The entire U.S. economy is a house of cards built on a gigantic pile of debt and paper money , and it is only a matter of time until it all comes crashing down .
But of course that is n’t stopping the U.S. government from spending even more money and getting us all into even more debt .
According to a recent Treasury Department report to Congress , the U.S. national debt will top $ 13.6 trillion this year and climb to an estimated $ 19.6 trillion by 2015 .
But as many of you who have experienced this on a personal level know , getting into continually increasing amounts of debt never ends well .
So do any of you have a tale to tell about the city where you live ?
Do you find yourself caught in the middle of an economic nightmare ?
Feel free to leave a comment telling us what is happening in your area of the United States … .
**** UPDATE ****
A number of readers have chimed in with some very insightful comments .
A sampling is below … .
Vegas Bob :
I lived here in Vegas from 1998 - 2006 and moved back at the beginning of 2010 .
I worked in Corporate Finance for one of the largest casino operators up until I retired .
The article is spot on .
Compared to its heyday in 2005 - 2006 , Las Vegas today is an economic disaster zone .
The condo I sold in 2006 for $ 172,500 now goes for $ 48,900 – a 72 % haircut .
It ’s not getting any better .
Real estate prices are resuming their descent , now that the $ 8,000 homebuyer tax bribe is gone .
The so - called economic recovery is for wealthy people only .
Everyday people just keep getting the shaft .
Obama is just another Republican with a ‘ D ’ after his name .
I ’m glad I was smart enough to rent a place instead of buying one .
I ’m getting the hell out of this hellhole when my lease is up at year - end .
Tiara :
I am born and raised Vegas .
When I say I was raised in Vegas I do n’t mean a casino .
I mean the middle of the dessert 30 miles north from the strip with the lizards and tumbleweeds .
Vegas and I have a love hate relationship .
I have seen this the growth in this town blow up in my face and now it is imploding just like an old worn out casino .
It has been a crazy ride but due to the economy I will most likely be leaving Las Vegas soon .
Growing up in this town has been interesting and leaving it will be bittersweet .
Craig :
I lived in vegas in 2006 and have been back to visit many times .
I was there recently for the first time after the economy imploded in late 2008 — That town is a shell of it ’s former self .
On any given night there are half the people on the strip that there used to be .
The service even in the 5 - star hotels has declined .
You can see the lack of morale , sucked from the faces of the wokrers .
I loved this town in its hay day .
Right now , it ’s pretty sad .
Dolly :
Vegas was , and is , easy to understand .
I ’m in the musical equipment business– audio– and we go to Trade Shows .
These are held all over the world , but let ’s contrast just two places , Los Angeles and Vegas :
If you go to Los Angeles , you will visit with the worlds best engineering talent , and a solidly - grounded people that are there to PRODUCE something OF VALUE .
You have small manufacturers , Farm and Ranch people , Oil people , the film industry and plenty of unspoiled , honest , clean - living young people who work hard , and then play hard .
Many are Surfers , etc. , and are a breath of Fresh Air .
In short , a business convention or trade show in this city is a TREAT .
Now , let ’s look at Las Vegas .
Everything that ’s big there is built around money manipulation and power .
No one gives a damn about anybody else .
Got a brilliant idea ?
One that Los Angelinos would want to encourage you to develop and succeed at ?
NOT in Vegas !
Any Casino in town handles more money than that in a microsecond .
Besides– who are YOU ?
YOU do n’t matter .
Vegas gets all the big shows and all the big stuff – so YOU DON ’T COUNT .
Want to hold a convention in a DECENT CITY – say L.A. , or Denver ?
SORRY–
Vegas will move right in– bribe the show principals and it WILL be held in Vegas .
Look at what happened to the National Finals Rodeo– Oklahoma City was GREAT , but VEGAS has STOLEN it .
Vegas deserves the worst that can happen to it– GOOD RIDDANCE !
Bob :
LV was built by losers .
I ’ve lived in & near LV since ‘ 89 , watched it grow cancerously , and now the tumor is shrinking … good riddance indeed to a grand delusion .
This city is not electrified by the dam — it is fed with coal - generated power from Moapa .
Fake Lake Mead is dying too ( and the city is fed by one old pipeline that can break down at any time …
There is no primary industry here , just gambling and military — everyone here ( except me , of course ) is living the Big Lie .
The place is a death trap … stay away !
BD :
I recently went back to visit my old neighborhood ( moved out of vegas and sold my house in summer of ‘ 08 ) and talked with a few of my neighbors .
Apparently its so bad they dont even park their cars on the streets anymore because “ these damn people siphon gas out of your gas tank ” .
No lie .
And this is a nice gated neighborhood in Henderson … .

Tickle these ivories : Rock Band 3 adds a new keyboard controller to the music game experience .
Ever since Rock Band expanded the musical video - game stage in 2007 to add drums and vocals to the Guitar Hero experience , players have been clamoring for keyboards .
Consider that request filled .
Rock Band 3 ( due for the holidays for PS3 , Xbox 360 and Wii ) expands the virtual band to seven ( drums , lead and bass guitar , keyboards , lead vocals and two harmony vocals ) .
" With the introduction of keyboards , we get to bring a ton of amazing new music onto the platform , which will help feed the appetite for music for years to come , " says Alex Rigopulos , CEO of game studio Harmonix .
MORE : What 's new , notable in ' Rock Band 3 ' GAME HUNTERS :
More coverage in our blog
Among the 83 new songs to be included , Rigopulos says , " it 's hard to pick a favorite , but for The Doors to be making an appearance on Rock Band finally with their classic Break On Through , I love that one .
And Queen 's Bohemian Rhapsody is endlessly fun . "
The success of Rock Band and follow - up Rock Band 2 propelled sales of music games to more than $ 1.6 billion in 2008 — with the help of competing Guitar Hero titles .
Despite a wide variety of new games in 2009 including The Beatles : Rock Band and DJ Hero , annual sales fell by nearly 50 % .
That slide inspired the Rock Band 3 development team to try to recapture the fun " that really started this whole phenomenon in the first place , " says project director Daniel Sussman .
During the game , green , red , blue , yellow or orange keys flow on a " stream " representing the notes to be played on five corresponding keyboard keys .
In a new authentic Pro mode meant to help players segue to actual instruments , all 25 keys are used ; the streams shifts left and right to cover the correct keys .
The keyboard also works as a MIDI keyboard that can be connected to a computer .
" This is a real instrument and a real device , " says senior designer Sylvain Dubrofsky .
In addition to the new keyboard controller , also due for the game 's release are two advanced guitar controllers that take advantage of the Pro mode , one a full - sized , fully functional Fender guitar ( all sold separately , no prices yet ) .
Other Rock Band 3 advances : improved animations , refined gameplay features — players can drop in and out of games , or change instruments and difficulty settings without stopping songs — and a easier - to - use song menu .
" Our ambition for Rock Band 3 was really to re-energize and reinvigorate the ( music game ) category and advance it and move it forward , " Rigopulos says .

In all the back and forth yesterday over who pays for the Gulf oil spill , remember the particular issue got started by statements made last Friday by Thomas Donohue , President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce .
The Chamber just released another statement clarifying those comments …
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – June 11 , 2010
U.S. Chamber Statement on BP Oil Spill Cleanup
WASHINGTON , D.C. –Thomas J. Donohue , president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement today clarifying comments that he made at a recent Christian Science Monitor media breakfast on the BP oil spill cleanup efforts :
“ The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is an environmental and financial catastrophe for families , small businesses , and communities along the Gulf Coast .
As I said and as the transcript makes clear , this will require significant long - term attention from BP , the federal government , state and local authorities , volunteers , and the entire business community .
While the depth and breadth of the consequences are unknown , clearly BP will have to assume its responsibilities over the long - term .
“ Let me be clear : the recovery costs should not be on the backs of American taxpayers or the businesses that have been adversely affected by this tragedy .
“ As I stated at the breakfast , we believe that abandoning the rule of law and retroactively changing the liability cap is not the best approach .
Any changes to the cap need to be done very carefully and with full consideration of the broad economic consequences to companies far beyond those directly involved in the spill .
“ Our nation needs a comprehensive energy policy to ensure America ’s energy security .
While addressing the near - term recovery needs of the Gulf Coast , we must be careful not to make decisions that threaten our long - term energy security . ”
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world ’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes , sectors , and regions , as well as state and local chambers and industry associations .

Lässt sich das Volk ablenken ?
Bundesregierung hofft in aller Eile während der WM die Verlängerung der AKW - Laufzeiten durchzusetzen
So ein internationaler Song - Wettbewerb – pardon : - contest – ist doch was Feines : Man veranstaltet eine Riesenparty und das besonders Schöne : Gleich im Anschluss gibt es eine Fußballweltmeisterschaft , sodass die Party fast nahtlos weitergehen kann .
Da lässt sich der öde , meist prekäre Alltag mal für ein paar Wochen vergessen .
Irgendwie scheint sich das auch die Bundesregierung gedacht zu haben .
Da heißt es immer Angela Merkel würde nur alles aussitzen , hätte gar keine rechte Lust zum richtigen Regieren .
Dabei hat sie doch ihr Handwerk bei einem Meister seines Faches gelernt , bei Helmut Kohl , der jahrelang den arroganten Intellektuellen vorgegaukelt hat , er sei " eine Zwei - Zentner - Null " , um dann so oft wie kein anderer vor ihm wiedergewählt zu werden .
Merkel hat sich also ganz offensichtlich gedacht , das Volk ist im Juni mit seiner WM beschäftigt , da ist doch die beste Gelegenheit , ein paar unpopuläre Maßnahmen unter Dach und Fach zu bringen .
Vor der NRW - Wahl hatte man zum Beispiel genau wie letztes Jahr vor der Bundestagswahl das Thema AKW - Laufzeiten immer schön klein gehalten .
Zwar wusste jeder , der es wissen wollte , was die Tigerenten im Schilde führen , aber bloß nicht drüber reden .
Nun heißt es , das für den Herbst angekündigte Energiekonzept soll noch vor der Sommerpause über die Bühne gebracht werden und damit auch die Verlängerung der AKW - Laufzeiten .
Darauf haben sich offenbar , wie unter anderem das Handelsblatt meldet , am heutigen Freitag die Spitzen von Union und FDP geeinigt .
Das Demokratieverständnis , das sich dabei offenbart , ist atemberaubend : Industriepolitische Entscheidungen aller erster Güte , bei denen es um Festlegungen für viele Jahrzehnte geht , werden mal eben klammheimlich und in aller Schnelle getroffen , und zwar vorzugsweise nicht in einer offenen parlamentarischen Debatte , sondern in Mauschelrunden mit den Vertretern der großen Energiekonzerne .
Ob allerdings die Rechnung der Kanzlerin und ihrer Freunde aufgeht , ist offen .
Zum einen ist höchst umstritten , ob sie am Bundesrat vorbeikommen , in dem sie gerade ihre Mehrheit verloren haben ( siehe Bundesländer sind gefragt ) .
Zum anderen hat die Anti-AKW - Bewegung in den letzten Monaten wiederholt gezeigt , dass sie quicklebendig ist .
So demonstrierten auch heute über 100 AKW - Gegner vor dem Kanzleramt , wo sich einige CDU - Ministerpräsidenten mit Merkel und anderen Kabinettsmitgliedern auf das Vorgehen verständigt hatten .
Zuletzt hatten Ende April fast 150.000 Menschen mit zwei Großdemonstrationen gegen die schwarz - gelben Atompläne demonstriert .
An diesem Wochenende wird es im niedersächsischen Wendland weitergehen .
Dort wird an diesem Wochenende an den 30 .
Jahrestag der Räumung des Gorlebener Hüttendorfes erinnert .
Die Aktionen stehen allerdings ganz im Zeichen der aktuellen Atompolitik .
The American electronics giant Apple was investigating damaging allegations last night that Chinese workers making its new iPad device were subjected to such " inhumane " treatment that some of them took their own lives by jumping off factory roofs .
Documents seen by The Independent reveal there are widespread failures by Apple 's suppliers to respect standards on labour rights and safety specified by the company , which had sales of £ 30 bn last year .
An update to the US firm 's supplier codes in February revealed that a majority of its 102 facilities flouted its " rigorous " rules on working hours , which include a weekly limit of 60 hours a week – equivalent to 12 hours a day .
Some 39 per cent broke rules on workplace injury prevention and 30 per cent broke guidelines on the management of toxic chemicals .
Audits uncovered violations involving child labour , falsified records and disposal of hazardous waste .
The company has been embarrassed by publicity surrounding 11 suicide attempts at the vast Foxconn facility near the southern boom city of Shenzhen , where the iPad is made , which threatens to overshadow the global launch of the touch - screen computer tomorrow .
Yesterday a " saddened and upset " Apple promised to investigate whether the plant , which employs 300,000 people who earn around 30 p an hour , should continue to make its products , which sell for hundreds of pounds each .
At the 1.2 - square mile Foxconn facility , which also makes products for Dell , Hewlett Packard and Acer , nine workers have died and two have been gravely injured in roof jumps in the first five months of 2010 .
All the incidents involved workers aged under 25 , who apparently have been disturbed by the long shifts and strict discipline .
Talking and music are banned during shifts , which last at least 10 hours .
Workers must perform a certain number of repetitive operations per shift , under the eye of allegedly harsh military - style supervisors .
" Foxconn 's management is totally inhuman , " one worker told the Reuters news agency .
Another said : " They do n't treat workers as humans . "
A young Foxconn line supervisor , Tang Wenying , told journalists allowed into the complex yesterday : " This is a good place to work because they treat us better than many [ other ] Chinese factories . "
In an attempt to prevent more suicides , the Taiwanese - owned firm has hired 2,000 singers , dancers and gym trainers .
It is also putting up netting to thwart future suicides .
Concerns were expressed about the factory three years ago by China Labour Watch , a US organisation which claims dire conditions involved " serious labour violations including excessive working hours , unpaid wages for up to 30 minutes of work each day , compulsory overtime and extremely poor dormitory conditions . "
Last July , it revealed the suicide of a young worker , Sun Danyong .
According to its report , only workers producing for Apple were given a stool to sit while working , while all others had to stand .
Workers also complained of violence , including beatings with iron bars and whips .
The allegations have not surprised campaigners , who say that while Western shoppers often hear of problems at Asian clothes factories , conditions for workers in cleaner , bigger consumer electronics plants are just as grim .
" When you look at large - scale export - driven trade , it does n't really matter whether the workers are making clothes or electronics , " said Simon MacRae , senior campaigns officer at War on Want .
" There 's a similar pattern : long working hours , very poor pay and suppression of labour rights .
The sector provides jobs but without decent wages you are not going to lift people out of poverty . "
Last month a report by the National Labour Committee , an American NGO , found that workers at a Chinese factory supplying Microsoft , Hewlett Packard and other brands toiled for up to 15 hours a day in heat of up to 30C .
Other allegations about the KYE factory included sexual harassment and humiliation by supervisors .
Teenage workers were pictured slumped over their desks during a break in a 15 - hour shift .
One said : " We are like prisoners .
We do not have a life .
Only work . "
KYE management responded that conditions were excellent and fully complied with Chinese labour laws .
Microsoft said it was " very concerned " and launched an investigation .
Although China has occasionally expressed concern over the regime in export factories , the spate of suicides has spurred a national debate about whether workers fulfilling foreign orders are being pushed too hard .
Campaigners believe Bangladeshi clothes factories are the very worst sweatshops , but factories in China can combine the financial advantages of a cheap labour supply with a totalitarian state 's intolerance of industrial rights .
Most of those in free trade export zones such as Shenzhen , the " the workshop of the world " , are owned by foreign companies .
Apple , which will open its 27 stores around the UK as early as 8 am tomorrow to sell the iPad , said it was taking the spate of suicides " very seriously " .
A spokeswoman said : " A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made . "
Hewlett Packard said it was investigating " the Foxconn practices that may be associated with these tragic events " .
Dell said it expected its suppliers " to employ the same high standards we do in our own facilities " .
Acer declined to comment .

An enterprising iPad user was n't particularly enthused with AT&T 's network , so he modded the device to use the Verizon network instead .
The feat was accomplished by removing the AT&T 3G card from the iPad and replacing it with the innards of a Verizon MiFi , undoubtedly voiding the iPad 's warranty .
The replacement not only allows the iPad to make use of Verizon ’s network , but also lets it act as a wireless router for up to four other devices .
The modification is n't for the faint of heart : it requires disassembling both devices and some soldering .
Once the AT&T card is removed , the iPad also loses GPS functionality , and in order squeeze the MiFi innards into the iPad , the iPad 's " resonating chamber " has to be cut in half .
This results in lower sound quality , but is a necessary tradeoff , as the MiFi logic board is longer than its AT&T counterpart .
The MiFi hooks right into the iPad ’s bottom antennae and the stock battery .
The enterprising modder , an employee of a Dish Network reseller , did have to use a circuit from the MiFi ’s battery in order for WiFi sharing to work .
The MiFi has terminals for four battery connections while the iPad has only two terminals on the logic board to power the AT&T card ; he tried some simple splicing , but it did not work .
The voltage , however , was conveniently spot on , and did n’t need any alteration .
The original power button was removed from the MiFi and replaced with a smaller $ 2 switch that fits nicely inside the device 's now empty SIM slot .
Without the switch , the MiFi would n't be of much use , as it automatically shuts off after a half - hour of inactivity .
Finally , the LED indicator on the MiFi had to be removed — in its unaltered state , it would shine through the screen , even when the iPad ’s screen was on .
There is no word on how the MiFi affects the iPad ’s battery life or if any software problems have arisen .
The owner does report experiencing much better speeds and , although he has some concerns with future WiFi signal strength , he says he has n’t experienced any signal loss as of yet .
This is , no doubt , a manifestation of Steve ’s very own keynote nightmare .

Dense ash
There was no evidence that the eruption was about to finish , the Icelandic Meteorological Office warned on Sunday .
It said on its website that " output from the volcano has been slowly decreasing " but that " further changes in overall activity can be expected " .
It concluded : " Presently there are no indications that the eruption is about to end . "
Weather forecasters predicted the ash cloud would gradually weaken as it spread over southern Germany , the Czech Republic and Austria by Sunday night .
Eurocontrol 's latest map on Sunday showed two areas of concentrated ash over northern Italy and south - eastern France .
Aircraft reported an ash cloud over the Pyrenees on Saturday , the UK's Met Office said .

Former House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt ( D - Mo. ) has been hired to lobby for a major food - services company that has faced criticism from a powerful union .
Gephardt and Tom O’Donnell , his former chief of staff , have registered to lobby on “ labor / management related matters ” by Sodexo , according to lobbying disclosure records .
ADVERTISEMENT
The French - owned company has been embroiled in a battle with the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) over a labor organizing campaign , and Gephardt is known for his labor ties .
SEIU is running online ads that show videos of Sodexo employees complaining about worker conditions at the company .
They have organized public protests of Sodexo and argue the company is paying its employees wages below poverty levels .
Sodexo has set up a blog to respond to charges from the union .
The company argues SEIU is spreading misinformation and its campaign is “ part of an ongoing dispute with rival unions , including Unite Here , designed to attract new members . ”
The company has also hired Jeff Trammell , a former senior adviser to ex-Vice President Al Gore Albert ( Al ) Arnold GoreUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing Mellman : Do debates matter ?
Compromise , yes — but how ?
A pre-debate suggestion MORE , to lobby for the firm .
The contracts with Gephardt ’s lobbying group and Trammell and Co. represent the first time the food - services company has turned to outside lobbyists to work in Washington , according to a review of records by The Hill .
Overall , the group has spent more than $ 5.6 million on internally hired lobbyists since 2002 .
“ We have hired those two groups for general business purposes , ” said Jaya Bohlman , Sodexo ’s vice president for public relations , in a voice mail to The Hill .
Sodexo representatives did not respond to requests to elaborate further on the two lobbying contracts .
Gephardt Group Government Affairs has been lobbying for Sodexo since May 5 , according to lobbying records , while Trammell and Co. has been lobbying for the company since May 3 .

John Kerry John Forbes KerryMellman : Do debates matter ?
President Trump faces Herculean task in first debate Trump , Biden have one debate goal : Do n't lose MORE ( D - Mass . ) and then - Sen .
John Edwards ( D - N.C. ) , is also lobbying for Sodexo at Trammell and Co .
Both lobby firms declined to comment for this piece , saying they do not discuss client matters with the press .
A prominent Democrat and presidential candidate in 1988 and 2004 , Gephardt earned a reputation as a big union supporter .
His firm ’s website says the former House leader “ is widely recognized as an innovative thinker in the area of labor relations ” and that he has earned “ the trust of the leadership and members of many of the largest international labor unions in the United States , including the Teamsters , the Steelworkers and several of the AFL - CIO organizations . ”
Part of his firm ’s work involves helping business executives develop strategies for negotiations and collective bargaining between companies ’ managers and their workers ’ unions .
Since creating the firm in 2005 , Gephardt and his team have been hired to lobby for some of the most prominent names in business and finance .
Boeing , Goldman Sachs , Visa and others have all hired Gephardt at some point , according to lobbying disclosure records .
Those lobbying contracts , however , have earned him the ire of labor groups .
Last month , SEIU members protested Gephardt along with other well - known Democratic lobbyists , including Steve Elmendorf and Tony Podesta , in a large K Street rally .
Renee Asher , SEIU ’s assistant director of communications for property services , said she thinks Sodexo ’s hiring of Gephardt has little to do with the organizing campaign her union is running .
Instead , she believes it has more to do with lawmakers ’ concerns over a massive U.S. Marine Corps food - services contract for which Sodexo is responsible .
“ No matter how many shiny shoes they put in the halls of Congress to protect this contract , it still stinks , ” Asher said .
The eight - year , $ 881 million Marine food - services contract is due to end soon and will likely attract new bidders once it is up again .
Sodexo is facing questions from Congress on its handling of the contract .
In April , Rep. Loretta Sanchez ( D - Calif . ) called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate the contract for government waste and food safety complaints .
The lawmaker argued there “ are significant concerns that Sodexo ’s food services have been more expensive and less effective than originally promised . ”

Despite the harsh organizing campaign this year , SEIU and Sodexo have come to terms in the past .
In 2008 , the Wall Street Journal reported that SEIU had negotiated an agreement with Sodexo to organize only in certain company locations .
Asher said that agreement has expired and the SEIU wants to organize more workers at the company .
“ We do want to form a union , and they are trying to try stop us forming one here in the United States , ” she said .
The iPad App Store just launched yesterday , and as you might expect , these apps are generally more expensive .
The priciest iPad app costs a whopping $ 900 .
It 's called SiteClone Publisher , a universal app for both iPad and iPhone , and we could n't help but feel curious about just what it does for such a hefty price .
It turns out SiteClone is a framework designed to help corporate and government entities develop apps that pull content from websites even without an internet connection .
For example , if Wired.com bought SiteClone , we could create an app that pulls videos , audio clips and other media when the iPad is online , and later even if users are without an internet connection , the app could still access all that data without having to redownload it .
The screenshot at right is an example of an app using the SiteClone framework .
That sounds awfully wonky and somewhat complicated , but why so expensive ?
" The app contains two years of in - house development work , so we did n't want to make it too cheap , " said Pete Meyers , vice president of EP Visual .
" If we sell a few of them , hopefully we can lower the price . "
Meyers explained that hospitals , for example , could make use of SiteClone because they 're notorious for poor internet connections .
$ 900 is exorbitant for an app , but it sure beats the feature - less iPhone app " I Am Rich , " which was priced at $ 1,000 before Apple yanked it from the App Store in August 2008 .
Let 's hope we do n't see an " I Am Rich HD . "
A hat tip to Daisy , who pointed out this app with the help of Mobclix analytics .

A legal campaign by a pair of 13 - year - old twins has forced police chiefs to admit carrying out unlawful stop and searches on thousands of climate change protesters .
The twins won a high court battle against the police after one of them was left " crying and shaking " and fearing that he would go to prison for having a sticker in his bag .
As a result of their victory , police have been compelled to apologise after 3,500 climate protesters at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent were stopped and searched at airport - style checkpoints at the demonstration .
Adrian Leppard , Kent police 's acting chief constable , admitted that the protesters ' human rights had been breached .
The admission is the latest embarrassment for the force , which has been heavily criticised over its £ 5.3 m operation to control the week - long demonstration against a proposed coal - fired power station at Kingsnorth two years ago .
Kent police have faced allegations of brutality by officers who concealed their badges and used loud music to prevent camapigners sleeping .
The twins , who cannot be named , and Dave Morris , another activist , have each been awarded more than £ 1,000 compensation after they took Kent police to the high court .
More than 40 other Kingsnorth demonstrators are pursuing legal action against the force .
One of the twins , a boy , said : " I had stickers and stuff that I was scared about .
When I was in the queue I heard stories about people being searched and taken away .
I was worried that they would arrest me too because of the stickers . "
The other , a girl , said : " We arrived at the protest ourselves and we then tried to meet up with our mum .
There was a long line of people waiting to be searched , and it was a bit scary .
It was really unfair – we were n't actually doing anything .
" It made me more wary of police .
Before I just thought they were there to help us if we have problems .
It was like they were above the law .
We 're trying to change the world for them as well , not just us . "
Their solicitor , John Halford , said it was very worrying that " violation of human rights to protest on a massive scale " had been exposed not by two internal police investigations but by " two tenacious children " and an activist .
Police searching the protesters were required to have a reasonable suspicion that an individual was carrying prohibited weapons that could be used for criminal damage , according to the 1984 police and criminal evidence act .
However a secret document , disclosed by Kent police at a late stage in the litigation , showed that police officers had instead adopted a blanket approach .
Kent 's assistant chief constable Andy Adams said their policing of the Kingsnorth demonstration " was very successful in preventing criminality and harm , while at the same time enabling a protest around an issue of genuine public concern to go ahead " .
As part of the settlement , Kent is required to write to all police forces explaining what happened to ensure that protesters are not unlawfully searched under the act in future .
In the letter , Kent 's chief constable will say : " Many people were searched as a result of these briefings .
That should not have happened .
" I accept that the combination of the act of stopping and searching these individuals breached their rights under articles 8 , 10 and 11 of the European convention on human rights and lessons must be learned . "
“ The fact that Steven Chu selected Steve Koonin , BP ’s chief scientist , to be his under secretary could predispose them to think that they could maybe negotiate with BP , could be more like partners regarding the oil cleanup , ” said Jennifer Washburn , the author of a coming report by the Center for American Progress called “ Big Oil Goes to College , ” which examines the BP - Berkeley venture .
“ It makes it more likely for them to see BP as a legitimate partner in handling the cleanup operation .

“ Unfortunately , ” Ms. Washburn added , “ what people are questioning , with good reason , is whether the government has been too soft on BP . ”
Added John M. Simpson of Consumer Watchdog : “ From what I ’ve seen , the Energy Department ’s response has been less than rapid to this oil spill .
This whole thing just underscores that corporate interests have created , over time , these relationships that give them unfair access to policy makers . ”
Ms. Mueller , the Energy Department spokeswoman , said that the accusation that the agency reacted slowly to the spill was unfair , and that 150 people at national laboratories had been working on it .
Public anger is mounting at both BP , which says it will try again on Wednesday to plug the spill using a method called top kill , and at Mr. Obama , who announced a major expansion of offshore oil drilling in March before first tending to what Mr. Obama himself described two weeks ago as an often cozy relationship between government regulators and oil companies .
On Monday , BP announced another $ 500 million grant , this one to study the impact of the spill on the marine and coastal environment , with the first award to go to Louisiana State University .
An independent panel will decide which institutions will receive the rest of the money , the company said in a news release .
A White House official said Tuesday that the Energy Department “ does n’t have jurisdiction over the oil spill . ”
Dr. Chu — who , according to an Energy Department news release was in Houston on Tuesday “ to continue engagement on strategies to stop the oil spill ” — is “ just volunteering because he ’s one of the most brilliant scientists around , ” the official said .
Dr. Chu canceled a trip to China in order to deal with the crisis , the Energy Department said .

Turkey ’s grievances with Israel concern its government and not its people , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday .
While some expect Turkey to be silent in the face of Israel ’s “ state terrorism ” and “ piracy , ” Erdogan said , his nation will not stay silent .
“ We will seek solutions in the framework of international law , ” Erdogan was quoted as saying by the Anatolia news agency .
On Thursday , Israeli diplomatic officials said Ankara was considering a number of steps to express its anger over the Gaza flotilla episode , including significantly downgrading diplomatic ties .
However , Jerusalem has not been informed of any concrete moves .
The comments came amid reports that Turkey was considering not returning its ambassador to Israel and reviewing military , economic , cultural and academic cooperation if Israel did not apologize for the flotilla raid , return the seized ship , agree to an international investigation and offer compensation both to the families of the nine people killed and to the injured .
Turkey recalled its ambassador soon after the incident .
Israel ’s ambassador to Turkey , however , is still in Ankara and diplomatic channels of communication between the two countries are still open .
Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said unequivocally on Sunday that Israel had no intention of apologizing , and one diplomatic source said Thursday that there were voices inside the government saying that not only should Israel not apologize , it should demand a Turkish apology for facilitating the dispatch of a ship with terrorist supporters who beat Israeli soldiers trying to protect its territorial sovereignty .

Ever since their discovery in 1909 , the spectacular Burgess Shale outcrops in the Canadian Rockies have presented scientists with a cornucopia of evidence for the “ explosion ” of complex , multicellular life beginning some 550 million years ago .
The fossils , all new to science , were at first seen as little more than amazing curiosities from a time when life , except for bacteria and algae , was confined to the sea — and what is now Canada was just south of the Equator .
In the last half century , however , paleontologists recognized that the Burgess Shale exemplified the radiation of diverse life forms unlike anything in earlier time .
Here was evolution in action , organisms over time responding to changing fortunes through natural experimentation in new body forms and different ecological niches .
But the fossil record then goes dark : the Cambrian - period innovations in life appeared to have few clear descendants .
Many scientists thought that the likely explanation for this mysterious disappearance was that a major extinction had wiped out much of the distinctive Cambrian life .
It seemed that the complex organisms emerging in the Cambrian had come to an abrupt demise , disappearing with few traces in the later fossil record .
Image SET IN STONE
Among the 1,500 fossils found near the Atlas Mountains in Morocco by an international team of scientists was that of an extinct member of the arthropod family , above and in the drawing below , from about 480 million years ago .
Its closest living relatives include horseshoe crabs , spiders and scorpions .

Not everyone was convinced , however , and now a trove of 480 - million - year - old fossils in Morocco appears to strike a blow to the idea of a major extinction .
The international team of scientists who discovered the 1,500 fossils said their find shows that the dark stretch in the fossil record more probably reflects an absence of preservation of fossils over the previous 25 million years .

Documento del Instituto de Estudios para la Transición Democrática presentado el sábado 5 de junio de 2010
La democracia mexicana se encuentra estancada .
La desigualdad social crece y escinde cada vez más al país .
La sociedad está desmoralizada , atemorizada y desconfiada .
La clase política , ensimismada en rencillas domésticas , deambula en la incertidumbre más preocupada en su próxima cita electoral que en los problemas esenciales del país .
Y la política es vista por la gran mayoría de los mexicanos , como un espacio ajeno a sus intereses .
En ese panorama , han aparecido propuestas de soluciones aparentes para resolver el deterioro de nuestra vida pública .
A partir de diagnósticos sesgados por el interés político , la simpleza analítica o la desmemoria histórica , se ha puesto de moda considerar que las decisiones que hacen falta solamente puede tomarlas un gobierno homogéneo y fuerte , que no tenga contrapesos eficaces en la diversidad de los partidos que se expresa en el Congreso de la Unión .
Nos parece que ese punto de vista se encuentra profundamente equivocado y que , lejos de remediar los problemas de nuestro sistema institucional , conduciría a un retroceso autoritario , acentuando las capacidades discrecionales de un presidencialismo del que , a fuerza de cambios parciales aunque insuficientes , nos hemos venido liberando en las décadas recientes .
La sociedad mexicana es más diversa que nunca .
El único camino para consolidar un sistema político capaz de representarla y gobernarla , radica en reconocerla , llevando a partidos y al Congreso , esa diversidad .
Estamos convencidos de que la pluralidad , lejos de amenazarlos , constituye la mejor garantía para la estabilidad y el desarrollo de la sociedad y la política .
La pluralidad no tiene la culpa de los desaciertos y las insuficiencias de los políticos .
El reconocimiento de la pluralidad constituye la conquista más importante del tránsito democrático que los mexicanos hemos experimentado y consolidado en los lustros recientes .
Ahora es tiempo de que , asumiéndola como parte de nuestra naturaleza política y social , le demos plena presencia en las instituciones que nos gobiernan .
Hacia una segunda transición
La población mexicana experimenta un sentimiento de fracaso generalizado que se trasmina en casi todas las áreas de la vida nacional : la económica , la política y aún la actividad cultural : abstenerse de invertir ; cancelar proyectos para tiempos mejores ; incursionar en los circuitos de la informalidad o la ilegalidad ; marcharse del país ; renunciar a tomar riesgos ; excluirse de la vida pública ; una moral social cargada de valores negativos y proclives al conservadurismo o incluso , a la superstición ; retroceso de los valores laicos .
Se trata de un círculo vicioso que alimenta permanentemente la desconfianza de los ciudadanos en sus dirigentes y en las instituciones políticas .
El cambio democrático ocurrido en México , la salida del autoritarismo , la histórica conquista de libertades políticas , la transición en síntesis , ocurrió en un contexto adverso que acentuó la vulnerabilidad y la precariedad social para la mayoría , aceleró la desintegración y minó las bases de la propia democracia , sobre todo para las generaciones que han empezado a ser adultas después del año 2000 .
El desencanto se debe , aunque sea en parte , a las desmedidas expectativas que se desarrollaron ante la alternancia en el gobierno y las nuevas reglas para la competencia política .
La democracia es , no menos pero tampoco más , el régimen que permite la convivencia de la diversidad política , que construye candados para acotar a los poderes constitucionales , subordinar a los poderes de hecho y potenciar los márgenes de libertad .
Pero en México no pocos protagonistas , así como diversos comentaristas del cambio democrático , llegaron a idealizarla como la estación de llegada del desarrollo político mexicano en donde la sociedad se encontraría reconciliada y sin fisuras y en donde bastaría la acción tutelar de los gobiernos electos bajo las nuevas reglas para que tuviéramos un porvenir dichoso y sin conflictos graves .
La realidad ha confirmado que la democracia , cuando existe , permite dirimir conflictos de manera civilizada pero no garantiza el bienestar de la sociedad .
Si a esa realidad añadimos el hecho de que hemos padecido gobernantes inexpertos o mimetizados con la vieja cultura política y cuyas gestiones no han significado cambios sustanciales en comparación con el régimen autoritario que prevaleció durante todo el siglo 20 , tenemos las claves de un escenario propicio para la insatisfacción y el enfado sociales .
Para hacerla sustentable , eficaz y compartida por la sociedad , la democracia requiere de un horizonte de todos y para todos .
Y no es ese el perfil que ha tenido el quehacer político preponderante durante los años recientes .
La democratización del país fue posible gracias a los esfuerzos conjuntos de gobiernos y oposiciones , además de la contribución de organizaciones no gubernamentales , medios de comunicación , académicos e intelectuales .
Hoy se requiere un esfuerzo similar para edificar una casa común que logre trascender el archipiélago de clases , nuevas castas , grupos , tribus y pandillas en el que se está transmutando el país .
Es hora de emprender una “ segunda transición ” , ahora desde la democracia , hacia una sociedad cohesionada e igualitaria en sus derechos .
Pese a reformas , desigualdad social
En los partidos hegemónicos y en algunos segmentos de la opinión publicada , se ha desarrollado la presunción de que la diversidad política impide que se acuerden y aprueben las reformas que le hacen falta al país .
También se llega a decir que en México no hemos tenido reformas importantes en las décadas recientes .
La historia contemporánea desmiente esas suposiciones .
Desde los años 80 y especialmente en los 90 , cuando el régimen de partidos comenzaba a fortalecerse y luego fue una realidad inevitable en el Congreso , el Estado pudo aprobar importantes –aunque con frecuencia discutibles – reformas estructurales para la economía .
Las políticas de privatización que crearon nuevos polos de poder financiero , los acuerdos comerciales que nos involucraron en una globalización sin desarrollo suficiente , la apertura a la inversión extranjera de diversas áreas de la economía , la contracción del Estado y a pesar de ello la transformación en deuda pública de importantes adeudos financieros privados y el nuevo esquema de pensiones han sido , junto a otras más , reformas estructurales surgidas bajo gobiernos de distintos signos políticos y por lo general precedidas de intensos debates .
Llevamos un cuarto de siglo de reformas profundas cuya sola enumeración demuestra la capacidad estatal para hacer ajustes y cambios .
El problema entonces , no ha sido la ausencia de reformas , sino su completa indiferencia para enfrentar la desigualdad social , que constituye la dificultad mexicana más apremiante .
A pesar de las reformas económicas ( y también debido a ellas ) México se encuentra estancado desde hace casi tres décadas , con todos sus efectos distorsionantes : pobreza indisoluble , polarización social , migración masiva , multiplicación de la informalidad , cancelación de la movilidad social .
Toda una generación ha escuchado la misma promesa que se repite hoy : “ tan pronto como pongamos en marcha las reformas estructurales necesarias , México tomará la senda de prosperidad ” .
Los jóvenes de hoy , igual que los jóvenes de ayer que crecieron confrontados con el incumplimiento de esa promesa , tienen fundado derecho al escepticismo .
La capacidad reformadora , por otra parte , también ha logrado crear instituciones democratizadoras que además de proteger derechos fundamentales logran fiscalizar la gestión de las autoridades .
De eso se trata la vida democrática aun cuando los contrapesos legislativos , judiciales , regionales , se multiplican y gravitan a cada paso complicando el gobierno y las decisiones esenciales .
Cualquiera que compare la política de hoy y la de hace veinte o treinta años notará las diferencias : asentamiento de la diversidad , ejercicio más franco de la libertad , contrapesos en las instituciones estatales , coexistencia de la pluralidad , ejecutivo acotado , federalismo real , mayor publicidad de las decisiones y rendición de cuentas .
No obstante , ese proceso democratizador se encuentra erosionado porque en muchos otros terrenos de la vida social las realidades son más oscuras .
El tránsito democratizador ha sido acompañado no sólo por un crecimiento económico magro , sino también por una persistente desigualdad social y los fenómenos de exclusión asociados a ella , como el incremento notorio de la delincuencia , un frágil y contrahecho Estado de derecho , una vida pública estridente y , en suma , una escasa cohesión social .
Legitimar al Estado , en una sociedad plural
El pluralismo que se ha instalado en el estado nacional y que determina la vida pública mexicana carece de aliento , sus ideas relevantes son escasas y manifiesta una reiterada incapacidad para deliberar de manera franca e ilustrada .
El narcisismo de los partidos , la creencia de que el control de los aparatos burocráticos es fuente de impunidades y la propensión a la discusión irrelevante , han equiparado a la pluralidad con la banalidad .
A pesar de todo ello , el pluralismo es necesario en la democracia contemporánea .
Si el pluralismo que hemos tenido en México resulta insatisfactorio , no ha sido por carencias de la democracia sino debido a incapacidades e impericias de la mayor parte de los actores políticos que lo han encarnado .
Esas insuficiencias del pluralismo en la vida mexicana reciente , pero además una inquietante nostalgia por las mayorías excluyentes , han conducido a la reivindicación del monolitismo en el Estado .
Al confundir gobernabilidad con uniformidad , se ha llegado a suponer que la única manera eficaz de gobernar en nuestro país radica en la conformación de un bloque capaz de imponerse sobre los demás .
Esa noción de gobernabilidad es antidemocrática pues supone la supresión de la pluralidad y es contradictoria con una realidad ineludible .
Aunque seguimos teniendo un régimen presidencial , desde 1997 las fuerzas políticas que llegan al Congreso están obligadas a formar coaliciones para tomar decisiones .
El pluralismo que tenemos , con todos sus defectos , es una adquisición democrática de nuestra transición : puso fin al presidencialismo autoritario singularizado por numerosos abusos y arbitrariedades .
Cuando se pretende restringir el pluralismo para forjar mayorías artificiales mediante dudosas reglas electorales –que buscan fortalecer un gobierno supuestamente capaz de sacar adelante , sin problemas , algunas célebres pero discutibles “ reformas estructurales ” – se olvida que venimos de un sistema que garantizaba mayorías automáticas para un presidencialismo sin contrapesos .
Abolir el pluralismo que significa la existencia de partidos de ideologías , proyectos , dimensiones y presencia pública diversos , es una solución falsa que sólo conduciría a mayores polarizaciones y a una menor legitimidad democrática de los gobiernos sustentados en esas mayorías .
Lo que hace falta es vigorizar y hacer cada vez más representativo al Estado .
Necesitamos instituciones estatales con legitimidad suficiente para que sea efectivo el imperio de la legalidad , para garantizar la seguridad y los derechos de los ciudadanos e incluso para establecer y recaudar impuestos y desarrollar una política distributiva de las dimensiones que exige la profunda desigualdad social que agobia a nuestro país .
Sólo un Estado fuerte , eficaz y eficiente , crea las condiciones de una sociedad civil fuerte , exigente y organizada , así como una verdadera y cabal ciudadanía .
Sólo un Estado que garantiza universalmente los derechos sociales hace posible el ejercicio igualitario de los derechos de libertad , de los derechos civiles y de los propios derechos políticos .
Y sólo un Estado legitimado por su capacidad de garantizar esos derechos puede regular con eficacia y eficiencia los poderes fácticos que inevitablemente surgen de una sociedad abierta y plural .
Esa tarea requiere de coaliciones y mayorías capaces de trascender intereses puramente electorales y de coyuntura .
Pero no de mayorías al servicio del presidente en turno , sino de verdaderos gobiernos de coalición sustentados en acuerdos públicos y transparentes y en proyectos de largo plazo .
El mayor obstáculo no es el pluralismo político sino un presidencialismo que a lo largo de toda la historia mexicana ha mostrado sólo ser eficaz cuando se vuelve autoritario .
El reto es compartir el poder
La construcción de un verdadero Estado social y democrático , garante efectivo de los derechos fundamentales de todos los mexicanos , exige reemplazar el régimen presidencial por un régimen parlamentario , que entre otras cosas haga posible distinguir claramente a los gobiernos y sus mayorías contingentes , del Estado y sus funciones permanentes .
Esta operación requiere de un salto cultural y político de la mayor importancia .
Las bases sociales de los partidos no parecen preparadas para encarar ese desafío , pero tampoco las dirigencias , los líderes y menos aún los candidatos .
Hacia las elecciones del año 2012 , cuando la democracia mexicana haya cumplido 15 años , el único vaticinio cierto es éste : ninguno de los partidos obtendrá mayoría congresual ; gobernar sin mayoría volverá a ser condición ineluctable en el ejercicio del poder en México .
Para resolver ese acertijo , sería preciso arriesgar un tipo de gobierno de coalición inexplorado en nuestra historia política .
Si los actores políticos no son capaces de extraer las lecciones básicas de la post - transición , viviremos una nueva versión de los sexenios previos , sea cual sea el partido que resulte ganador .
Pero si el país es capaz de abandonar el libreto de la era política anterior , entonces México sería testigo de un proceso inédito , pluralista , más propiamente democrático : la construcción de una mayoría legislativa entre partidos diferentes , o hasta enfrentados , para poder gobernar .
Allí está el hecho político que abriría una nueva época en México : compartir el poder .
Se trataría de crear una alianza legislativa , que se reflejase en la integración del gabinete y que impulsara un programa de gobierno común .
No habrá popularidad ni capital político que valga , si no se sabe crear esa coalición .
Existen numerosas experiencias exitosas de esa índole , en países con regímenes parlamentarios ( Alemania , Reino Unido , España , Bélgica , Holanda , Dinamarca , etcétera ) en los cuales resulta ineludible construir una coalición .
Si no la hay , si nadie tiene mayoría en el parlamento , el gobierno es imposible .
Las recientes iniciativas legislativas presentadas por los grandes partidos ( PRI , PAN y PRD ) , tienen la virtud de poner en el centro la discusión acerca de la “ forma de gobierno ” , abandonando el reiterado debate sobre las cuestiones electorales .
Pero casi todos esos planteamientos acuden a “ salidas mixtas ” que no encauzan ni resuelven el nudo esencial : la existencia de la pluralidad política .
Se recurre a fórmulas ingeniosas ( segunda vuelta con elección congresual ) o a fórmulas artificiosas ( cláusulas de gobernabilidad ) que la democracia mexicana alguna vez abandonó precisamente porque adulteraban la expresión política legítima del país real .
Parlamentarismo , para la equidad
Ya es hora de repensar el arreglo institucional en su conjunto .
El formato que debemos imaginar y ensayar para resolver el problema de gobierno y la ecuación pluralista en México , es el Parlamentarismo .
Ese régimen necesita que haya coalición cuando ningún partido alcanza la mayoría absoluta de escaños ; una coalición para formar gobierno sin desplazar o abatir los intereses y las visiones distintas que requieren ser representadas .
El parlamentarismo exige y ofrece a la vez , precisamente eso : conversación y compromisos entre adversarios , naturalización del acuerdo , política de coalición , todas ellas prácticas ausentes en la realidad política de México .
Aunque no cambiase el formato presidencial , aunque no transitáramos a un régimen parlamentario , de todos modos el futuro de nuestra democracia va a depender , cada vez más , de saber gobernar en coalición , de compartir el poder con un aliado a menudo incómodo .
Y no habrá tema de intercambio y decisiones compartidas más importante que las medidas legislativas y políticas para reorientar la economía y atemperar la desigualdad social .
Al país se le está acabando el tiempo .
En las dos últimas décadas , de 1990 a 2010 , la población ha aumentado en 24.5 millones de personas , y en los siguientes veinte años crecerá unos doce millones más .
La transición poblacional sigue madurando y estamos perdiendo el bono demográfico ante la falta de inversiones y la escasa generación de empleos .
No es casual que en la última década hayan emigrado , cada año , alrededor de 450 mil mexicanos en promedio .
La experiencia internacional indica que los gobiernos plurales están mejor preparados para desarrollar cambios de esa índole .
Un estudio reciente de la OCDE indica que siete de las 10 mayores consolidaciones fiscales llevadas a cabo en los países desarrollados desde 1970 , se han producido bajo gobiernos de coalición .
Las grandes coaliciones políticas pueden enfrentar mejor los desafíos y las resistencias de los poderes de hecho que , tradicionalmente , constituyen el principal freno a las reformas fiscales , las únicas capaces de crear las estructuras de protección y de igualdad social .
Por primera vez en la historia estamos obligados a resolver , en democracia , los problemas de la pobreza y la desigualdad .
Es una oportunidad y un desafío que tienen plazo : si no logramos cambiar la estructura del ingreso en la década que comienza , México habrá dejado de ser un país de jóvenes sin empleo , para convertirse en una nación de viejos empobrecidos y sin seguridad ante la vida .
La riqueza para preparar y sostener a esa generación y a ese futuro debe ser creada y distribuida desde ahora , creciendo , echando mano de aquello con lo que contamos y hemos producido en las transiciones del nuevo siglo : márgenes de libertad y pluralismo como nunca los tuvimos pero escuchando , ahora sí , el mensaje igualitario de la democracia .

A surge in consumer spending helped the US economy to grow by 3.2 % , on an annualised basis , during the first quarter of the year .
Although the rise in gross domestic product was slightly lower than expected , it indicated that the US economy is continuing to recover from its longest and deepest recession since the 1930s .
Analysts had predicted an annualised growth figure of 3.4 % , and today 's figure was also significantly lower than in the fourth quarter of last year , when the economy grew at 5.6 % .
The price of oil rose to nearly $ 86 a barrel on the news , driven by the view that the global economy was heading for a full recovery and amid hopes of a bailout for Greece .
Consumers increased their spending this quarter by 3.6 % , the strongest showing since early 2007 .
That marked a big improvement from the fourth quarter when spending grew at just 1.6 % .
Britain 's economy grew at just 0.2 % in the first quarter of 2010 , less than forecast .
On an annualised basis that is equal to slightly over 0.8 % , which leaves the British recovery some way behind the US .
Health products with medical formulations cannot be accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration without tests on animals -- a situation that arguably has ethical and moral implications .
New research in the field of tissue engineering by Prof.
Amit Gefen of Tel Aviv University 's Faculty of Engineering holds a promise that far fewer lab animals may one day be needed for the necessary experimental trials .
Dr. Gefen 's research into fat cells , published in a recent issue of Tissue Engineering , has led him to conclude that the necessary tissue can be produced from fat , skin , bone and muscle cells .
His breakthrough study could have hundreds of applications in the pharmaceutical and medical world .
" Drugs make our lives better , and basic science is needed to push new drugs through clinical trials .
But there is no doubt that an untold number of animals are sacrificed in the laboratory setting -- both in basic research and in applied conditions when testing particular molecules , " says Prof.
Gefen , who heads TAU 's Teaching Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering .
As a medical researcher himself , he was dependent on animal trials for testing new hypotheses he developed for living systems -- until recently .
A more efficient road to scientific research
Bridging the worlds of biology and engineering , Prof .
Gefen is now using adult rat stem cells -- cells that can be stimulated to create skin , bone , fat and muscle tissue from an animal in a laboratory setting .
In his own work on studying the mechanical properties of pressure ulcers , many tissue replications were needed .
His new approach no longer requires the sacrifice of large numbers of animals .
When an experiment is over , not one animal life has been lost .
The use of engineered tissues , says Prof .
Gefen , may also be more scientifically efficient than using those from a living source .
" The model we 've created offers a very reliable method for researchers asking questions about basic science , and those investigating new drugs .
We can injure tissue in a very controlled environment and grow muscle tissue without blood vessels , thereby neutralizing certain variables that often cloud what 's happening in an experiment . "
Saving lives and improving research at the same time
Though Prof .
Gefen 's method may not completely eliminate the need for animal testing , as few as 5 % of the animals used today will need to be sacrificed in future tests , he predicts .
" It 's a matter of proportion .
Our tools spare an enormous number of lives , " Prof .
Gefen says .
He is currently bringing together a number of discrete research directions from the separate fields of mechanics , tissue engineering and biology .
He is also developing a new tool for researchers to investigate fat accumulation in cells ( an important question for diabetes researchers ) and weight loss drugs .
Among his devices is one that can tell doctors how much mechanical stress is being placed on a person 's foot , buttocks or other soft tissues .
Another measures how much sensation is left in a diabetic limb .
For all these approaches , Prof .
Gefen has adopted tissue engineering methods to use fewer animals in his trials .
" We are now able to build a number of ' simplified ' living tissues quite readily , and we 're able to keep them ' alive , ' " Prof .
Gefen says .
" They 're genetically similar to the biological tissue of the animal , so we can factor out irrelevant physiological elements such as bleeding and pain response in an experiment .
The fact that this tissue is genetically identical and the environmental factors are so well - controlled means that we can obtain far more experimental reproducibility than with experiments done on live animals . "
In the future , Prof .
Gefen hopes that similar models can be based on live human tissue , but that could be a number of years down the road .

Who wrote those lines ?

No , the author is former White House adviser Richard A. Clarke in his new book , Cyber War : The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It .
It has been a few months since Clarke 's latest opus appeared , but it 's still making quite a splash .
Clarke , after all , was the guy who repeatedly warned the White House about Al Qaeda before September 11 , 2001 .
As a result , he has quickly become the most publicly identifiable person on the subject .
" While it may appear to give America some sort of advantage , " Cyber War warns , " in fact cyber war places this country at greater jeopardy than it does any other nation . "
The enormous dependence of our financial and energy networks on the ' Net open us up to potentially devastating online attacks .
" It is the public , the civilian population of the United States and the publicly owned corporations that run our key national systems , that are likely to suffer in a cyber war . "
Large scale movement
Clarke takes readers through various famous cyberwar incidents , most notably the Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attack on Estonia back in 2007 , but how bad could such events really get ?
The hypothetical answer is on page 64 .
There Clarke deputizes you as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and takes you through a scenario of doom .
The National Security Agency has just sent a critical alert to your BlackBerry : " Large scale movement of several different zero day malware programs moving on Internet in US , affecting critical infrastructure . "
But by the time you get your office , one of the DoD 's main networks has already crashed ; computer system failures have caused huge refinery fires around the country ; the Federal Aviation Administration 's air traffic control center in Virginia is collapsing , and the hits just keep coming .
" The Chairman of the Fed just called , " the Secretary of the Treasury tells you .
" Their data centers and their backups have had some sort of major disaster .
They have lost all their data . "
Power blackouts are sweeping the country .
Thousands of people have already died .
" There is more going on , " Clarke narrates , " but the people who should be reporting to you can't get through . "
File under fiction
Clarke 's book has gotten tons of play with this sort of stuff — check out , for example , the scary interview he did with Terry Gross on NPR 's Fresh Air .
But little of it impresses his critics .
" File under fiction , " begins Ryan Siegel 's review over at Wired .
" Like in real war , truth is the first casualty . "
Siegel warns that the tome is based on hypothetical scenarios ( see above ) or alarmist and inaccurate rehashings of various cyber emergencies .
Plus , we note the book has no references or index .
Ditto , says Evgeny Morozov in the Wall Street Journal .
" We do not want to sleepwalk into a cyber - Katrina , " he writes , " but neither do we want to hold our policy - making hostage to the rhetorical ploys of better - informed government contractors . "
Clarke is one of four partners in the Good Harbor Consulting security firm .
But even his detractors acknowledge that some of Clarke 's broad arguments make sense — most notably his warning that the Pentagon can't assume that the energy and financial sectors will effectively defend themselves from cyber attacks .
" At the beginning of the age of cyber war , " Clarke ruefully notes , " the US government is telling the population and industry to defend themselves . "
Money talks
Why has the national response to this problem been so slow ?
Lack of consensus on what to do and fear of the " R - word " — government regulation , Clarke contends .
Then there 's Reason Number Five on his list , which basically boils down to " Microsoft . "
" Some people like things the way they are , " Clarke obliquely observes .
" Some of those people have bought access . "
Microsoft , he notes , is a prominent member of OpenSecrets.org 's " Heavy Hitters " political donor list .
Most of the list 's stars are trade associations .
" Microsoft is one of only seven companies that make the cut . "
The software giant 's largesse has shifted from Republicans back in the Clinton antitrust days to Obama , he continues , but the agenda is always clear : " Do n't regulate security in the software industry , do n't let the Pentagon stop using our software no matter how many security flaws it has , and do n't say anything about software production overseas or deals with China . "
Clarke tries to be fair .
He notes that Microsoft did n't originally intend its software for critical networks .
But even his efforts at fairness are unflattering .
Microsoft 's original goal " was to get the product out the door and at a low cost of production , " he explains .
" It did not originally see any point to investing in the kind of rigorous quality assurance and quality control process that NASA insisted on for the software used in human space - flight systems . "
But people brought in Microsoft programs for critical systems anyway .
" They were , after all , much cheaper than custom - built applications . "
And when the government launched its Commercial Off - the - Shelf program ( COTS ) to cut expenses , Microsoft software migrated to military networks .
These kind of cost cutting reforms " brought to the Pentagon all the same bugs and vulnerabilities that exist on your own computer , " Clarke writes .
Floating i-brick
The former White House advisor cites the 1997 USS Yorktown incident as a consequence .
The Ticonderoga - class ship 's whole operational network was retrofitted with Windows NT .
" When the Windows system crashed , as Windows often does , the cruiser became a floating i-brick , dead in the water . "
In response to this " and a legion of other failures , " the government began looking into the Linux operating system .
The Pentagon could " slice and dice " this open source software , pick and choose the components it needed , and more easily eliminate bugs .
Clarke says that , in response :
[ Microsoft ] went on the warpath against Linux to slow the adoption of it by government committees , including by Bill Gates .
Nevertheless , because there were government agencies using Linux , I asked NSA to do an assessment of it .
In a move that startled the open - source community , NSA joined that community by publicly offering fixes to the Linux operating system that would improve its security .
Microsoft gave me the very clear impression that if the US government promoted Linux , Microsoft would stop cooperating with the US government .
While that did not faze me , it may have had an effect on others .
Microsoft 's software is still being bought by most federal agencies , even though Linux is free .
The company took a similarly hard line towards the banking and financial industry , Cyber War says , rebuffing access requests from security specialists for Microsoft code .
When banks threatened to use Linux , Microsoft urged them to wait for its next operating system — Vista .
" Microsoft insiders have admitted to me that the company really did not take security seriously , even when they were being embarrassed by frequent highly publicized hacks , " Clarke confides .
Sure enough , when Apple and Linux began to offer serious competition , Microsoft upgraded quality in recent years .
But what the company did first was to lobby against higher government security standards .
" Microsoft can buy a lot of spokesmen and lobbyists for a fraction of the cost of creating more secure systems , " concludes Clarke 's section on the software firm .
" They are one of several dominant companies in the cyber industry for whom life is good right now and change may be bad . "
Required to do so
Given the considerable amount of criticism Cyber War has come in for , we 're not endorsing Clarke 's nightmare version of Microsoft 's history .
And we 're more than a little nervous about some of his prescriptions for " change . "
These include government rules ordering the big ISPs " to engage in deep - packet inspection for malware . "
Although these provisions should include high standards for privacy , " the ISPs must be given the legal protection necessary " so they wo n't fear being sued for stopping malware , viruses , DDOS attacks , and worms .
" Indeed , they must be required to do so by new regulations , " Clarke insists .
But many of the reviews and notices of Cyber War gloss over one of the principal observations of the book : the privatization of government over the last two decades may have saved cash but compromised the government 's ability to defend crucial portions of America from big and small attacks on the ' Net .
That 's a concern that bears further discussion , whatever you think of Clarke 's scary cyber stories .
The jury verdict last Friday in favor of Red Hat and Novell in a case based on bad software patents owned by " non-practicing entities " is an important victory for the open source community .
Those in the business of acquiring bad software patents to coerce payments or bring lawsuits should be worried .
Two such businesses were plaintiffs in our case , and they did their best to confuse the jury in one of their favorite locales , eastern Texas .
But it did n't work .
The jury unanimously found that the patents were not infringed , and , even worse for the plaintiffs , that the patents were invalid .
The case was about allegations by IP Innovation , L.L.C. ( a subsidiary of Acacia Technologies ) , along with Technology Licensing Corporation that Red Hat and Novell infringed four claims from U.S. Patents 5,072,412 , 5,394,521 , and 5,533,183 .
The patents share a common disclosure and are all titled “ User interface with multiple workspaces for sharing display system objects . ”
The patents relate to a computer - implemented system and method for providing a graphical user interface with multiple workspaces .
Like most patent cases , this one involved technical subject matter and terminology .
However , the plaintiffs came forward with minimal evidence to support their argument of infringement .
They also faced abundant evidence showing that the patents were invalid based on prior art .
In other words , there was nothing new in these “ inventions ” sufficient for a patent .
In these circumstances , you might suppose that a rational patent plaintiff would dismiss the case , perhaps in return for a token payment .
Instead , the plaintiffs decided to ask the jury for millions of dollars .
Their theory appeared to be that the jury might be confused by the technical terms and unsympathetic to out - of - state businesses with creative business models .
With that end apparently in view , the plaintiffs ' counsel launched an attack on the theory and practice of open source software .
It was clear during jury selection that our jurors had no prior knowledge of , or experience with , open source .
Plaintiffs attempted to exploit this inexperience by arguing that open source software involved behavior that was , if not downright illegal , at least ethically dubious .
They promoted the fallacy that open source distributors unfairly take the property of others and thereby unfairly profit .
They also suggested that Red Hat 's public criticisms of the U.S. patent system as it relates to software and related calls for legal reform were un-American and indicated a secret fondness for the writings of Karl Marx .
I kid you not !
As absurd as this argument sounds , after many hours of sitting on a hard courtroom bench , I briefly wondered whether the jury might fall for this version of the classic FUD strategy and be so fearful and confused as to find for the plaintiffs .
It turned out that there was no cause for concern .
Michael Tiemann , Red Hat 's vice president of open source affairs , explained the fundamentals of open source so as to make them clear , and even inspiring .
He explained that open source software is about voluntary collaboration , not involuntary expropriation .
He also made plain that Red Hat 's legitimate criticisms of the existing patent system in no way shows a proclivity to infringe patents or indifference to patent claims , and that Red Hat respects and abides by the law .
Our side took the opposite approach from the plaintiffs , basing our case on facts and evidence , rather than emotion and confusion .
Our experts carefully showed that our products were noninfringing and demonstrated specific examples of prior art .
In the end , the jury saw through and quickly rejected plaintiffs ' FUD .
The jurors took a bit more than two hours to find every one of 23 issues in favor of Red Hat and Novell .
We learned many things from this experience , but I 'll note just three here .
We now know for certain that those in the business of bringing software patent lawsuits are not invincible , even in the supposedly patent - friendly jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Texas .
We know that Texas juries are willing to reject bogus infringement claims and invalidate bad software patents .
And we know that attacks on open source based on FUD will not stand up when subjected to the light of truth .
When I read Ben Hutchison ‘s OO / Imperative programmers : ‘ Study Functional Programming or Be Ignorant ’
I knew I had too much to say for the comments , so I figured I ’d put in my 2 cents here .
Haskell is my go - to language , both for scripting , and for getting work done .
This is not because of any particular allegiance to the language .
Haskell and I have an open relationship , and the moment I find a language that out - Haskells Haskell , you can be sure I ’ll move on .
Here I want to describe my favorite things about Haskell .
You ’ll note that they are all about the type - system .
I do n’t feel too strongly one way or the other about laziness , or about monads ( though I wo n’t give them up without first finding something to take their place ) .
I do n’t even particularly care that it ’s a functional language , in as much as I can have these features in a non-functional environment .
Some of these features are already available elsewhere .
This is wonderful !
If you know of any examples of this , please tell me in the comments .
This is a list of my favorite things :
Separation of class and data definitions .
Haskell ’s notion of classes is more like Java ’s notion of interfaces .
A class is a list of function prototypes , and any data type for which such functions can be defined is an instance of that class .
One does not inheret a parent class , but rather , one implements a class .
It ’s a weird distinction if you have n’t seen it before , but after I learned how to use it , I must say I prefer it .
The first example most people see is the Show class .
Here is how it ’s defined ( to get this listing , I just asked ghci — the interactive GHC prompt — to give me the definition ) :
Prelude > :info
Show class
Show a where showsPrec :: Int -> a ->
ShowS show :: a -> String showList :: [ a ] ->
ShowS -- Defined in GHC .
Show
This says that any data type a which is an instance of Show provides functions with these signatures .
( Edited :
The first of these functions are used for implementing a Haskell idiom for fast string construction , while the last is related to a restriction in the unmodified Haskell 98 standard . )
When I define a new datatype , I can either ask Haskell to derive a Show instance for me automatically , or I can specify one myself :
data Car = Person { make :: String , year ::
Int } deriving Show data Pet =
Pet { name :: String , animal :: String , age :: Int } instance Show
Pet where show p =
" My pet is named " ++ name p ++ " and he is a " ++ animal p ++ " and he is " ++ show ( age p ) ++ " years old . "
I understand that Google ’s
Go language has this notion of class ( they call it interface ) , and that Scala provides this as well ( they call it trait ) .
Typed side - effects .
In Haskell , if a function wants to communicate with the environment , then the function ’s type signature will document this fact .
Want to print to the console ?
Open a socket ?
Read a file ?
Any of these actions will put your function into the IO monad , which is a red- flag to other programmers that the function communicates with the environment .
When your application works with library code ( and whose does n’t ? ) this is a handy feature .
Haskell uses the monad design pattern as the underpinning of how it types side - effects .
I do n’t particularly care that it ’s monads per se , I just like that there is something which statically documents which functions communicate with the environment .
Why is this useful ?
One huge answer is concurrency .
If your function has side - effects , it is not obviously thread - safe .
If it has no side - effects , it is thread - safe .
The monad design pattern provides a way to define application - specific notions of side - effects , which allows you to dial in the granularity on this as much as is appropriate for your application .
With respect to typed side - effects , a common Haskell idiom is to break up your program into different layers of state .
For instance , in a web framework , you might have a “ user - input ” layer which is read - only , and on top of that a “ logging ” layer , and on top of that your application - specific stuff .
( Each of these layers is a monad , or more precisely , a monad transformer . )
Haskell allows you to statically track which functions rely on which layers , which is a useful thing if you want to call a function and be certain that it wo n’t modify some data out from under you .
If you ’re new to Haskell and monads , in my humble opinion this idiom is the real reason to give a damn about monads .
But that ’s just my perspective .
( And it ’s certainly not obvious from the beginning , but a lot of bugs can be eliminated this way . )
Type safe macros .
No language is completely free from the occasional boilerplate .
One way around this is to use macros .
In C , macros can be very tricky .
The preprocessor takes all instances of a macro , replaces it with the corresponding text , then passes off to the compiler .
If it turns out that you used the macro incorrectly , the compiler is n’t really there to help you out : after all C macros are all about find - and - replace .
Haskell ’s macro system is called Template Haskell .
Macros written in Template Haskell are actually written in Haskell syntax .
The compiler then takes this code , compiles it like it would any other Haskell , and then uses it to expand your usage of the macros .
Everything is typed the whole way through , and if there are errors , the compiler can tell you where they are and why ( with its usual level of precision , for better or worse ) .
When I recently ran into a scenario where ( for some very long - winded reason ) I had to define 20 essentially - identical datatypes , then give them all essentially the same class instances , I was able to quickly whip up some Template Haskell to do all the lifting for me .
When I realized I needed to modify those class instances , it was as simple as modifying the Template Haskell that was generating them .
This is how macro-ing should be .
Instead of a deal with the devil , it should be safe enough to be accepted practice .
Quasi-quoting .
This is one of the many fine ways to embed a language in Haskell .
Here ’s a typical use case : you ’re writing a library and the most natural way for a developer to specify some options is in a simple configuration language .
You could implement a function String -> MyLibOptions , but if they have any typos in their configuration string , you wo n’t be able to catch them until run-time .
If the configuration is n’t known until run -time that ’s fine , but if the configuration is known at compile - time , you ’d like the error to be caught at compile - time .
( I need to mention that quasi - quoting is able to mix run-time and compile - time data — I ’m just simplifying things to describe this use case . )
Quasi -quoting to the rescue .
I recently gave an example of Haskell ’s quasi-quoting abilities in a post about how it can be used to provide an injection - proof form of string interpolation ( via Interpolique ) .
One of my favorite applications is Michael Snoyman ‘s Hamlet , a type - safe HTML generation library .
( If you ’d like to see what it looks like to implement a quasi - quoter in Haskell , I ’ve got some code up on github that demonstrates this in the case of string interpolation , as mentioned above . )
Quasi-quoting is basically syntactic sugar for Template Haskell .
Consequently your quasi-quoters are able to reach into the environment and interact with the rest of the code ( all in a type - safe , purely functional way , of course ) .
In the string interpolation example above , for instance , the code
author = " broker " content = " ' or 1=1 ; " query = [ $ interpolique| insert into posts values ( ^^author , ^^content ) ; |]
set query equal to the following
* Test > query InterpoliquedString " insert into posts values ( b64d ( \" YnJva2 Vy \ " ) , b64d ( \" JyBvciAxPTE7 \ " ) ) ; "
which was generated by inspecting the values of author and content at run-time , encoding them in base64 , and then interpolating them into the result you see here .
The fact that author and content were strings was determined at compile - time , so there was n’t any chance of any shenanigans when the code actually executed .
For instance , if I instead had the code
author = 2 :: Int content = " ' or 1=1 ; " query = [ $ interpolique| insert into posts values ( ^^author , ^^content ) ; |]
I ’d get a compile - time error :
Test.hs:9:23 : Could n't match expected type ` String ' against inferred type `Int '
In the first argument of ` Interpolique QQ.b64enc ' , namely `author '
which I think is pretty cool .
Type families and associated types .
I must admit that I only use the “ associated types ” half of this , although the feature is slightly more general .
Anyway , I ’ll describe the part that I use .
Type families give you a way to compute which type you want to use .
Yes , sounds weird , but it ’s amazing .
A typical first example of this is the associated list .
Every modern language has these : it is just an array where the lookup does n’t need to be an Int ( think HashMap and the like ) .
In Haskell this can be described like so :
class GenericMap a where type Key a type Value a get :: a -> Key a ->
Value a set :: a -> Key a -> Value a -> a
The first two parts of this class definition are the so - called “ associated types . ”
The easiest way to see this in use is with an example of what an instance might look like .
Here I ’ll do something crazy and define the function type String ->
Int as an instance of this class ( the Haskell Wiki article on type families has other examples , some of which you might find more conventional ) :
instance GenericMap ( String -> Int ) where type Key ( String -> Int ) = String type Value ( String -> Int ) =
Int get f k = f k set f k v' = \k ' -> if k == k' then v' else f k '
This instance works :
sampleMap :: String ->
Int sampleMap s = length s sampleMap ' = set sampleMap " foo " 4 ... * Main > get sampleMap " monkey " 6 * Main > get sampleMap " foo " 3 * Main > get sampleMap ' " foo " 4 * Main > get sampleMap ' " bar " 3 * Main > get sampleMap ' " monkey " 6
which is all well and good .
Now , I have n’t yet given any reasons why this type families business is any good .
The answer has to do with polymorphism : sometimes you want to write a function whose type signature is so damned flexible you just can’t figure out how to write it .
You try a few examples , but each is too restrictive .
But there ’s a pattern to it .
If you ’re in this boat , type families can help .
I ’d give an example of this , except I already did in polymorphic first class labels .
( Which , by the way , is another feature I ’d like to see in other languages . )
Another application of type families is type - level programming ( functional dependencies can also be used for this , but as type families get better , my interest in seeing functional dependencies in other languages will dwindle ) .
Type - level programming is an insane idea where you do computation in the type system at compile - time .
This actually can be helpful in situations where you have really complicated properties you want to express about your program statically .
For instance , I had a situation where certain types had a “ size ” associated to them .
I had functions that were polymorphic over arguments of a given size .
Some of these functions would yield a new type that was twice the size as the input .
How do you express that statically , if the goal is to still be polymorphic ?
Type families can do it .
I basically wrote a class whose sole job was to use type families to do arithmetic in the freaking type system .
This basically looked like
class HasSize a where type Size a class Doubler a where type Double a ... --
The ~ operator asserts type equality , so this next -- line basically reads " the size of b is ` Double ' the -- size of a . " someFunction :: ( Size b ~ Double ( Size a ) ) => a -> b someFunction = ...
I would not describe it as pretty , but it solved my problem , and it gave me a compile - time guarantee that an important design invariant was being met .
The syntax is easy to read as well .
And if it looks like I ’m applying functions to types , it ’s because I am .
Rank - 2 types .
You do n’t often see this on the list of great things about Haskell , but I love them .
To say that a type is “ rank - 2 ” is basically a statement about just how polymorphic it is .
I use this feature in two different ways : the first is to solve a polymorphism problem , the second is to prevent tainted data from leaking into places it does n’t belong ( I ’m in love with this second application and I have no clue how to statically do it in any other language — tell me in the comments if you do ! ) .
Here is an example of how I use it to get some extra polymorphism :
useFoo :: ( forall a . a -> [ a ] ) -> b -> ( [ b ] , [ String ] ) useFoo f b = ( f b , f " bar " )
This function takes two arguments ( another function and some other type ) and uses them to build a tuple ( by applying that function twice ) .
The forall asserts that the function we give must work for any type a , hence why we can apply it to the mystical input of type b or to an ordinary String .
If I were to rewrite this function without the forall I 'd get a type error ( two type errors , actually ) :
useFoo1 :: ( a -> [ a ] ) -> b -> ( [ b ] , [ String ] ) useFoo1 f a = ( f a , f " bar " )
gives me
temp.hs:14:18 : Could n't match expected type ` [ Char ] ' against inferred type `b ' `b ' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for `useFoo1 ' at temp.hs : 13:25
In the first argument of `f ' , namely `a '
In the expression : f a In the expression : ( f a , f " bar " ) temp.hs :14:23 : Could n't match expected type `a ' against inferred type ` [ Char ] ' `a ' is a rigid type variable bound by the type signature for `useFoo1 ' at temp.hs : 13:12
In the first argument of `f ' , namely ` " bar " '
In the expression : f " bar " In the expression : ( f a , f " bar " )
Absent the forall , the type checker assumes that the function I 'm providing works for some type a , and attempts to determine just which type that happens to be .
That is , the compiler is allowing me to be a little ambiguous with my type signature , figuring that there is a particular type I have in mind and that it will use type inference to determine what that would be .
But then I try to use the function on two different types -- b and String -- and therefore is quite upset .
( In fact , it is already upset because , the way I 've written the signature for useFoo1 , Haskell assumes that a and b must be distinct , and in fact this is what those errors above are telling me : a is not the same as b , nor is it the same as String . )
While this application is nice , as I alluded above , in my mind the killer application is tracking tainted data .
Here are two common scenarios where this is something you want to do :
You have some function which accepts untrusted user input , and you want to be certain that whatever value it returns has been scrubbed clean .
This is handy for a function like , say , useUserInputToBuildSQLQuery .
( There are many other ways to solve this problem , of course . )
.
( There are many other ways to solve this problem , of course . )
You have a function which allocates some resources , uses them , then frees them , and you want to make sure it does n't return a dangling handle .
( I 'm not aware of another way of solving this problem , and again would appreciate any comments with other ideas . )
The best example of that second scenario is Haskell 's ST monad .
Code that executes with the ST monad is able to create mutable variables .
If you have a function that is written in the ST monad , you can execute it using the runST function , whose signature is
Prelude > :m +Control.Monad.ST Prelude Control.Monad.ST > :t runST runST :: ( forall s. ST s a ) -> a
The key to how this works is the forall in the signature of runST .
In essence , it is preventing code in the ST monad from returning one of these mutable variables .
So the following code works :
{-# LANGUAGE Rank2 Types #-} import Control .
Monad.ST import Data .
STRef exampleST :: ST s Int exampleST = do myMutableVar <- newSTRef 0 modifySTRef myMutableVar (
-> n+1 ) n <- readSTRef myMutableVar return n ... * Main > runST exampleST 1
but the following code does not :
{-# LANGUAGE Rank2 Types #-} import Control .
Monad.ST import Data .
STRef exampleST1 :: ST s ( STRef s Int ) exampleST1 = do myMutableVar <- newSTRef 0 modifySTRef myMutableVar (
-> n+1 ) return myMutableVar ... * Main > runST exampleST1 : 1:0 : Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected Quantified type variable `s ' escapes
In the first argument of `runST ' , namely `exampleST1 '
In the expression : runST exampleST1
In the definition of `it ' : it = runST exampleST1
People who read my blog will not be surprised when I mention that Oleg Kiselyov and Chung - chieh Shan have shown that this approach can be used to implement region based resource management with good granularity .
( This is a paper I 've been bringing up a lot recently , as it is the underpinning of memory management in Potential . )
Conclusion .
Haskell has a reputation for being hard to learn , though I feel this reputation is a bit dated now that we have good resources like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good and Real World Haskell .
Certainly one of the hardest parts about learning Haskell is that so many of the examples of " good Haskell " that we hold up rely on many of the features I mentioned above , and most of them seem foreign to new Haskellers .
That 's hard to avoid : Haskell is , after all , a research testbed .
I do n't know if you 'll feel the same way as I do , but after gaining some experience with using these tools in my own code , it is frustrating to leave them behind when working in other languages .
Every language has its seed of grace , elegance , and brilliance that , if it gets into you and grows , will make you into a zealot .
I feel that these are Haskell 's seeds .
It ’s easy to appreciate the quality of a John Deere tractor .
A tractor ’s usefulness benefits everyone from the farms that earns a living to the people that consume the food down the line .
What you might not think of is the side in which farming and tractors as well as the people that bring them to life consider the process an art .
You may have seen some recent press in the Des Moines Register about The Figge Art Museum in Davenport , across the river from Deere HQ in Moline , Illinois that they have opened a permanent gallery to display the best of John Deere corporate art on a rotating basis .

What ’s more is that John Deere headquarters is a work of art in and of itself .
Then President William Hewitt turned to renowned architect Eero Saarinen ( the creator of the St. Louis Arch , Washington Dulles International Airport , and The MIT Kresge Auditorium to name a few ) to create a truly unique presence .

As stated on the official Deere website :
Hewitt emphasized that , while he wanted a headquarters that was unique , it must reflect the character of the company and its employees .
“ The several buildings should be thoroughly modern in concept but should not give the effect of being especially sophisticated or glossy .
Instead , they should be more ‘ down to earth ’ and rugged , ” he wrote .
What Saarinen designed was a complex of three buildings .
The main office building , which is seven stories high , rises from the floor of a wooded ravine and faces two ponds .
A glass - enclosed bridge connects the main building to a product - display building and a 400 - seat auditorium .
Saarinen satisfied Hewitt ’s instruction that the buildings look down to earth by using Cor-ten steel for the exterior structure of the building .
Cor-ten® , a material that resists corrosion by forming a protective coating of iron oxide , develops an earthy color as it ages , much like newly plowed soil .
Developed for railroad track construction and other uses , this marked the first use of Cor-ten® in an architectural application .
We leave you with some of the best John Deere art we ’ve found on the web – enjoy !

The Pirate Bay returned to the business of providing its BitTorrent technology to freetards earlier today with a new bandwidth supplier in the unlikely form of the Swedish Pirate Party , after the site was offline for the best part of a day .
The Pirate Party ’s Rick Falkvinge said in a statement this lunchtime that his anti-copyright outfit was the new host of TPB ’s homepage and search engine .
German ISP CB3ROB ( Cyberbunker ) - which had been the previous bandwidth provider - was slapped with an injunction in the Hamburg district court last week .
Unsurprisingly , TPB went offline yesterday after Cyberbunker complied with the court order .
That particular company had been threatened with hefty fines and prison sentences if it ignored the court 's demands .
TPB periodically dies on its arse each time one of its bandwidth hosts is dragged through various courts in Europe .
Now , the Swedish Pirate Party has taken over hosting of TPB ’s homepage and search engine by telling The Register it was “ the last link in the chain ” to keep the infamous BitTorrent tracker website ticking over .
" Compared to what we already provide to activists around the world , this is completely within our budget and is n’t going to strike us financially , " the Pirate Party 's Rick Falkvinge told El Reg .
" Our IT department has confirmed it ’s within our bandwidth budget , and that ’s all I care about . "
However , Falkvinge would not tell us how much money his party was spending on the operation and was vague about the technology underpinning its bandwidth service .
" We ’re not running the servers as such ; we ’re just the last link in the chain , " he said before confusingly adding : " We are the Pirate Bay ’s ISP for the homepage and search engine but not for the other parts of the site . "
Falkvinge declined to comment on who was hosting the rest of the website .
" We do n’t see no reason to end this bandwidth arrangement , " he said and confirmed that there was currently about 400,000 Swedish kronor in the party 's kitty and 20,075 members signed up to the anti-copyright cause .
The party spokesman was also bullish - or deluded - about Sweden 's upcomimg election on 19 September .
" The instant we are in Parliament we are going to rewrite the rules , " proclaimed Falkvinge .
He told us that the Swedish Pirate Party 's servers were located in a former Cold War bunker set deep within Stockholm , and when pushed he also admitted that the outfit was " signed up to several ISPs " in the country .
" We run the [ Pirate Party 's website 's ] location in the mountain , but apart from that we buy bandwidth from several other ISPs , " said Falkvinge .
He refused to tell the Reg which ISPs the party was buying its bandwidth from but did confirm it currently has two of them on the books .
So presumably if the entertainment industry pursues the Pirate Party 's ISP then The Pirate Bay could once again be knocked overboard . ®
In just the past seven days , residents of Guatemala and parts of neighboring Honduras and El Salvador have had to cope with a volcanic eruption and ash fall , a powerful tropical storm , the resulting floods and landslides , and a frightening sinkhole in Guatemala City that swallowed up a small building and an intersection .
Pacaya volcano started erupting lava and rocks on May 27th , blanketing Guatemala City with ash , closing the airport , and killing one television reporter who was near the eruption .
Two days later , as Guatemalans worked to clear the ash , Tropical Storm Agatha made landfall bringing heavy rains that washed away bridges , filled some villages with mud , and somehow triggered the giant sinkhole - the exact cause is still being studied .

Which Bits Of London Get Photographed The Most ?
Big Ben ?
Possibly .
London Eye , probably .
Canning Town , probably not .
It 's easy to make guesses at the most photographed locations around town , but the rise in geolocated imagery now provides actual data .
Eric Fischer has used over 73,000 photos from Flickr and Picassa , overlaid on an OpenStreetMap layer , to generate this view of London ( larger image here ) .
Naturally , the West End , South Bank and Tower Bridge areas resemble a haemorrhaging Etch - a - Sketch .
There are clear peaks in the City corresponding to St Paul's , Monument , and the Gherkin .
Photogenic spots outside of the centre are also represented , such as Greenwich and Kew .
And we presume that 's Wembley to the top left .
Eric has extended the idea to many cities around the world in his Geotaggers ' World Atlas .

For the second time this year , someone has stolen actor Charlie Sheen 's car and driven it off Mulholland Drive .
A passerby called police at 2:53 a.m. Tuesday to report a car had been driven off a cliff in the 13300 block of Mulholland Drive , said Los Angeles Police Officer Carlos Amaya .
Firefighters found the silver 2010 Mercedes - Benz at the foot of a cliff but did not find a driver or passengers inside or nearby .
Police traced the license plate number to Sheen .
They went to his home a few miles away in Sherman Oaks , where the actor said he was n't aware his vehicle was missing and said he had last seen the car in his driveway at 4 p.m .
It 's the latest episode in a spate of troubles for Sheen , who has starred in the television comedy " Two and a Half Men " and the films " Platoon " and " Wall Street . "
The USA have qualifed for the knockout stages of the World Cup in the most dramatic circumstances , defeating Algeria 1- 0 .
There were plenty of chances throughout and both sides hit the woodwork , but it seemed that neither side would find a crucial winner .
But deep into injury time , Landon Donovan popped up to strike a historic goal .
Algeria may not have shown much intent against England , but they were quickly onto the front foot against the Americans .
Straight from kick - off a long ball forward picked out Rafik Djebbour , whose knockdown found Karim Matmour but the striker volleyed spectacularly over .

Top of the Match sponsored by Turkish Airlines Landon Donovan
Player rating : 7.5
" One terrific pass in the first half so nearly released Michael Bradley for an opening goal .
At the end , Donovan was the main man , scoring the decisive goal .. " Djebbour had the best of the early chances , pouncing on another long ball forward that was hopelessly missed by Jay DeMerit .
With time at the edge of the edge of the box , the AEK Athens man chested the ball down but volleyed against the bar .
Immediately play swept up the other end of the field but Rais M'Bolhi saved Herculez Gomez ’s ambitious strike .
In the early stages of the match , the States were limited , lacking incision in the final third of the pitch .
Les Fennecs were rather more direct , shooting at every opportunity , though too often feebly .
With 20 minutes played , finally the USA created a clear chance .
A strong break down the centre of the field from Michael Bradley was strongly arrested by a fine challenge but the ball broke kindly to Gomez , whose initially shot was blocked by M’Bolhi .
The rebound fell kindly for the striker , whose shot - come - cross was tapped home by Clint Dempsey , whose effort was wrongly disallowed for offside .
Penetrative play became increasing rare as the half wore on .
The Stars and Stripes enjoyed the better of the possession and territory , but it was the North Africans who were looking more purposeful when attacking .
Ten minutes before the interval , the USA would create another wonderful chance .
Landon Donovan had flashed in and out of the game in the early stages but released a terrific pass to Bradley .
The midfielder ’s first touch was excellent but Madjid Bougherra ’s presence was enough to take some of the sting from the shot , which was saved .
Moments later Jose Altidore had one of the misses of the World Cup .
Another strong run from Bradley allowed the coach ’s son to pick out Donovan , who eliminated the goalkeeper with a little dink .
From no more than six yards , the Villarreal forward lashed over the top with only a couple of defenders to beat on the line .
Efforts from range were very much the order of the day , and strikes from Karim Matmour and Dempsey were both denied by saves prior to the interval .

Landon 's hope brings glory | Donovan 's late strike took States from third to first
Rabah Saadane ’s side came out after the interval with intent , but they lacked the creativity to really create a string of chances .
Matmour was caught offside when seemingly through on goal before Rafik Halliche headed off - target .
The USA nearly struck the opening goal totally against the run of play .
Altidore ’s pace carried him clear of Bougherra down the left hand side , allowing the attacker to pick out Dempsey on the edge of the area .
With time to spare the midfielder took aim , but shot against the inside of the post and then sliced wide of an open goal from a tight angle when the ball had the good grace to bounce back to him .
Play switched quickly from end - to - end , but both defences were a credit to their side , with a sliding clearance from Carlos Bocanegra from a Belhadj cross especially impressive .
Algeria goalkeeper M’Bolhi then blocked a dangerous cut - back from substitute Benny Feilhaber as the game grew increasingly stretched and frantic .
Halfway through the second period , the Stars and Stripes missed a glorious chance .
Steve Cherundolo ’s centre was thumped goalward by Edson Buddle , though M’Bolhi was well positioned to make a block .
Play quickly shifted to the opposite penalty box , but Ziani dragged his shot wide .
Algeria still offered a meaningful threat on the counter , with Yebda shooting over and Abdelkader Ghezzal firing into the arms of Howard .
The USA were still doing much of the pressing , but their star men were being kept quiet .
Bradley stuck a free kick sweetly but it was straight at M’Bolhi , who punched clear .
A similar chance was smacked wildly over by Dempsey and Buddle wasted an opportunity when played in behind the Algerian defence by a long punt .
A goal seemed that it was n’t arriving , but as play became broken in stoppage time , the USA countered at an exposed Algerian defence down the right .
Though an initial shot was blocked by the custodian , Donovan followed up to smash low into the net .
For a long period of the game , it seemed the USA lacked the quality in front of goal to book a place in the last 16 , but the Stars and Stripes ’ record scorer came up trumps with their World Cup hopes preparing to die .
The Australian government appears confused as to whether or not it will try to pass laws concerning net filtering before a general election .
The Australian Labor party has previously promised to pass laws that would oblige ISPs to apply net filters to block pornography and other illegal content .
Critics argue that the measures are badly thought out , and likely to result only in lower net speeds and a suppression of information on controversial subjects while failing to block access to illegal content for those with enough internet savvy to bypass controls .
A spokesman for Australian Communications Minister Stephen Conroy told The Australian last week that plans to introduce net filter legislation had been postponed at least until August , leaving virtually no time to get the laws through Parliament before an October general election .
However , later a different spin doctor on the Conroy team said the government remained committed to its plans to introduce mandatory net filters .
Without giving a timetable for legislation she told told the AAP news agency that earlier reports of a post-election delay were " incorrect " .
Anger that Australia was about to apply internet controls as draconian as anywhere in the world outside China prompted cyberactivists to organise a partially successful DDoS against Australian government websites back in February .
Meanwhile Google , one of the net industry critics of the filtering plans , said that removing RC - rated content from YouTube would threaten free speech on politically controversial subjects such as euthanasia . ®
Recently I " ve been messing around with python bytecode , as a result I now know approximately how the python virtual virtual machine works at a bytecode level .
I 've found this quite interesting but other then satisfying my own curiosity had no benefit from this knowledge .
Until today I was wondering which code would be more efficient :
a += 1 if b is not None : a += 2
if b is None : a += 1 else : a += 3
From a style point of view I 'd prefer to write the first : I find it slightly more readable since it's got fewer indented blocks and it uses one line less on my screen .
But my gut feeling tells me the second is faster , particularly if b is not None ( this because in the first sample we'd do 2 add operations instead of one if b is not None ) .
But now I can verify my gut feeling !
All I need to do is compile both fragments and use the disassembler to investigate :
>>> co1 = compile ( sample1 , ' ' , ' exec ' ) >>> dis.dis( co1 ) 2 0 LOAD_NAME 0 ( a ) 3 LOAD_CONST 0 (1 ) 6 INPLACE_ADD 7 STORE_NAME 0 ( a ) 3 10 LOAD_NAME 1 ( b ) 13 LOAD_CONST 2 ( None ) 16 COMPARE_OP 9 ( is not ) 19 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 35 4 22 LOAD_NAME 0 ( a ) 25 LOAD_CONST 1 ( 2 ) 28 INPLACE_ADD 29 STORE_NAME 0 ( a ) 32 JUMP_FORWARD 0 ( to 35 ) >> 35 LOAD_CONST 2 ( None ) 38 RETURN_VALUE >>>
co2 = compile ( sample2 , ' ' , ' exec ' ) >>> dis.dis( co2 ) 2 0 LOAD_NAME 0 ( b ) 3 LOAD_CONST 2 ( None ) 6 COMPARE_OP 8 ( is ) 9 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE 25 3 12 LOAD_NAME 2 ( a ) 15 LOAD_CONST 0 (1 ) 18 INPLACE_ADD 19 STORE_NAME 2 ( a ) 22 JUMP_FORWARD 10 ( to 35 ) 5 >> 25 LOAD_NAME 2 ( a ) 28 LOAD_CONST 1 ( 3 ) 31 INPLACE_ADD 32 STORE_NAME 2 ( a ) >> 35 LOAD_CONST 2 ( None ) 38 RETURN_VALUE
My analysis of this is pretty simple : count the number of instructions for when b is None and for when b is not None .
b is None b is not None sample1 10 15 sample2 11 10
So ultimately the best performance depends on whether b will be None or not .
However the difference in the best case is only one instruction , but the difference in the worst case is a whole mighty 4 instructions !
This would seem to confirm my gut feeling : the ugly code is better .
It also makes me wonder if this is not the sort of optimisation a compiler should be doing : create the bytecode for sample2 regardless of the source code ( I 'm not a compiler guy and do realise it might not be as simple as that since python is a dynamic language which allows you to change stuff , including executed code , at runtime , yada yada ) .
There 's one more catch tough : I seriously doubt each python instruction can be executed in the same time !
So let 's use timeit to actually verify this .
I 'm omitting the trivial code , but this is the result :
$ python3 test .py sample1 , b is None : 0.128307104111 sample2 , b is None : 0.128338098526 sample1 , b is not None : 0.244062900543 sample2 , b is not None : 0.12109208107
To be honest , the result is exactly as speculated : the first sample is slower when b is not None , all others are pretty much the same .
The one odd thing is the pretty much doubling of time for the bad case , this suggest the python virtual machine is spending most of the time doing the INPLACE_ADD instruction while all others are probably very quick .
Anyway , in conclusion I guess you can speculate about performance and get an idea by knowing what bytecode will be generated .
But at the end of the day you 'll get a simple and better answer by simply using timeit .
So knowing something about python bytecode still has n't gained me any benefit .
It was still an interesting exercise tough .

Acarreadores del material pétreo cerraron accesos y sacaron a obreros
OAXACA
El retraso de casi tres meses en el inicio de la construcción del parque eólico La Venta III mantiene en la incertidumbre a Santo Domingo Ingenio y a los directivos de la empresa española Iberdrola , que ganó la licitación para producir 101 megawats de electricidad con el viento , equivalente para iluminar 80 mil viviendas , con una inversión de 170 millones de euros ( 2 mil 700 millones de pesos ) .
“ El proyecto debió comenzar a construirse en marzo sobre un polígono de mil hectáreas , pero sólo trabajamos dos días porque los encargados de acarrear los materiales pétreos cerraron los accesos y desalojaron a los obreros ” , dijo el representante de los 80 campesinos que rentaron sus tierras para la construcción del parque eólico , Narciso Ramos Cabrera .
La molestia de los empresarios privados se hizo público durante la reciente visita que realizó el presidente Felipe Calderón a España , donde Ignacio Sánchez Galán , presidente de Iberdrola , el mayor productor eólico del mundo , le pidió que elimine “ escollos ” y resuelva “ presiones de particulares ” que bloquean el inicio de la construcción del parque La Venta III .
“ No estamos en contra del proyecto , sólo exigimos que la empresa Iberdrola eleve los pagos por el acarreo de los materiales pétreos y que incremente el salario de los obreros ” , argumentó el ex alcalde de esta localidad , Valdemar Gómez , integrante del llamado Frente Común que bloqueó los accesos al polígono donde se construirá el parque eólico .
“ Nos preocupa que por la inestabilidad social la inversión se vaya a otra parte de la región del istmo , sobre todo porque aquí en el pueblo se agotó el trabajo desde que cerró el ingenio azucarero en 2004 y muchos tuvimos que emigrar ” , dijo Víctor Gómez , uno de los obreros que espera el inicio de la obra y que durante 43 años se desempeñó como cortador de caña .
La incertidumbre comienza a apoderarse de los campesinos que rentaron sus tierras , donde antes sembraban caña y ahora exploran el sorgo .
“ Si se cae la inversión de La Venta III es posible imaginar que también se vengan abajo los proyectos para construir aquí los otros tres parques eólicos denominados Oaxaca I , II y III , que planean generar 300 megawats de electricidad ” , dijo Narciso Ramos .
Los integrantes del Frente Común de Santo Domingo Ingenio , que no tienen tierras rentadas y tampoco son obreros , han pedido que la empresa Iberdrola pague un poco más de ocho pesos por el primer kilómetro de acarreo y algo más que los cuatro pesos y cincuenta centavos que ofrece por kilómetro subsecuente .
“ Esas son tarifas del año pasado ” , explicó Valdemar Gómez .
Empresas eólicas en problemas
La construcción de los parques eólicos en el sur de Oaxaca , donde según estudios del Instituto de Investigaciones Eléctricas , hay una capacidad para generar 25 mil megawats de electricidad , ha enfrentado el reclamo social en diversos municipios .
El proyecto inicial del corredor eólico del Istmo es el de generar los primeros 2 mil 500 megawats de electricidad .
En 2008 , la construcción del parque eólico Eurus , que produce 250 megawats en la localidad de La Venta , a cargo de la empresa Acciona , fue suspendida tres meses y reanudó operaciones después de liquidar a 400 obreros .
El parque eólico Bi Ne Stipa ( Viento con fuerza o fuerza de los vientos ) , a cargo de la compañía Gamesa , en El Espinal , suspendió sus operaciones 15 días después que arrancó el 1 de abril , por presiones de los dueños de las tierras que demandaron la revisión de los contratos .
La empresa Eléctrica del Valle de México , que inició operaciones en abril en La Mata , para producir 70 megawats , enfrentó el cierre de sus accesos .
Al margen de esos problemas , empresas eólicas vienen enfrentando el robo de cables de acero , lo que retrasa la operación de los aerogeneradores .
Staring day after day at images of oil billowing from an undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico , many Americans are struggling to make sense of the numbers .
On Monday , BP said a cap was capturing 11,000 barrels of oil a day from the well .
The official government estimate of the flow rate is 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day , which means the new device should be capturing the bulk of the oil .
But is it ?
With no consensus among experts on how much oil is pouring from the wellhead , it is difficult — if not impossible — to assess the containment cap ’s effectiveness .
BP has stopped trying to calculate a flow rate on its own , referring all questions on that subject to the government .
The company ’s liability will ultimately be determined in part by how many barrels of oil are spilled .
The immense undersea gusher of oil and gas , seen on live video feed , looks as big as it did last week , or bigger , before the company sliced through the pipe known as a riser to install its new collection device .
Enlarge By Tony Avelar , AP Hazel Soares , 94 , gets her picture taken with some of her classmates before the start of commencement exercises at Mills College in Oakland on Saturday .
OAKLAND , California ( AP ) 
It 's never too late to earn your college degree .
Just ask 94 - year - old Hazel Soares .
The woman was one of about 500 undergraduates to pick up diplomas Saturday during a commencement ceremony at Mills College , an all - women 's school in Oakland .
" It 's taken me quite a long time because I 've had a busy life , " said Soares .
" I 'm finally achieving it , and it makes me feel really good . "
Soares , who has six children and more than 40 grandchildren and great - grandchildren , is believed to be the world 's second oldest person to graduate from college .
Nola Ochs of Kansas became the oldest when she graduated from Fort Hays State University three years ago at age 95 , according to the Guinness Book of World Records .
Ochs , now 98 , topped that academic feat Saturday , when she received her master 's degree in liberal studies from Fort Hays .
Born in Richmond , Calif. , in 1915 , Soares had wanted to attend college right after she graduated from Roosevelt High School in Oakland in 1932 , but that was during the Great Depression .
" Unless you had some help , it would have been impossible to go to college , " Soares said .
" However I never lost the desire to go . "
Soares married twice , raised six kids and worked as a nurse and event organizer before she retired and decided to return to pursue her dream of obtaining a college education .
" We are really amazed and very proud of my mom , " said Regina Hungerford , Soares ' youngest child .
" The biggest thing that we can all learn is that we 're never too old . "
At Saturday 's commencement , she was congratulated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who delivered the keynote speech , and was cheered by her classmates .
" She 's really an incredible inspiration , " said Sandeep Brar , who also graduated Saturday .
Soares does n't plan to relax now that she finally has her degree .
The art history major hopes to work as a docent at a San Francisco Bay area museum .
Through her experience , she hopes others realize that it 's never too late to get a college education .
" There 's no reason why you could not go back , " Soares said .
" Some people do give up the idea or postpone the idea .
It 's too late .
It 's too much work .
They may not realize that once you try it it 's exciting to go to school . "

Would you like a lightweight PDF reader that integrates nicely with Office and Windows 7 ?
Here we look at the new Nitro PDF Reader , a nice PDF viewer that also lets you create and markup PDF files .
Adobe Reader is the de-facto PDF viewer , but it only lets you view PDFs and not much else .
Additionally , it does n’t fully integrate with 64 - bit editions of Vista and Windows 7 .
There are many alternate PDF readers , but Nitro PDF Reader is a new entry into this field that offers more features than most PDF readers .
From the creators of the popular free PrimoPDF printer , the new Reader lets you create PDFs from a variety of file formats and markup existing PDFs with notes , highlights , stamps , and more in addition to viewing PDFs .
It also integrates great with Windows 7 using the Office 2010 ribbon interface .
Getting Started
Download the free Nitro PDF Reader ( link below ) and install as normal .
Nitro PDF
Reader has separate versions for 32 & 64 - bit editions of Windows , so download the correct one for your computer .
Note : Nitro PDF
Reader is still in Beta testing , so only install if you ’re comfortable with using beta software .
On first run , Nitro PDF Reader will ask if you want to make it the default PDF viewer .
If you do n’t want to , make sure to uncheck the box beside Always perform this check to keep it from opening this prompt every time you use it .
It will also open an introductory PDF the first time you run it so you can quickly get acquainted with its features .
Windows 7 Integration
One of the first things you ’ll notice is that Nitro PDF Reader integrates great with Windows 7 .
The ribbon interface fits right in with native applications such as WordPad and Paint , as well as Office 2010 .
If you set Nitro PDF Reader as your default PDF viewer , you ’ll see thumbnails of your PDFs in Windows Explorer .
Unfortunately , this only works in 32 bit editions of Windows ; if you ’re using a 64 bit version , you ’ll only see the Nitro PDF logo on PDF files .
Hopefully this will be fixed before the final release .
If you turn on the Preview Pane , you can read full PDFs in Windows Explorer .
Adobe Reader lets you do this in 32 bit versions , but Nitro PDF works in 64 bit versions too .
The PDF preview even works in Outlook .
If you receive an email with a PDF attachment , you can select the PDF and view it directly in the Reading Pane .
Click the Preview file button , and you can uncheck the box at the bottom so PDFs will automatically open for preview if you want .
Now you can read your PDF attachments in Outlook without opening them separately .
This works in both Outlook 2007 and 2010 .
Edit your PDFs
Adobe Reader only lets you view PDF files , and you ca n’t save data you enter in PDF forms .
Nitro PDF
Reader , however , gives you several handy markup tools you can use to edit your PDFs .
When you ’re done , you can save the final PDF , including information entered into forms .
With the ribbon interface , it ’s easy to find the tools you want to edit your PDFs .
Here we ’ve highlighted text in a PDF and added a note to it .
We can now save these changes , and they ’ll look the same in any PDF reader , including Adobe Reader .
You can also enter new text in PDFs .
This will open a new tab in the ribbon , where you can select basic font settings .
Select the Click To Finish button in the ribbon when you ’re finished editing text .
Or , if you want to use the text or pictures from a PDF in another application , you can choose to extract them directly in Nitro PDF Reader .
Create PDFs
One of the best features of Nitro PDF Reader is the ability to create PDFs from almost any file .
Nitro adds a new virtual printer to your computer that creates PDF files from anything you can print .
Print your file as normal , but select the Nitro PDF Creator ( Reader ) printer .
Enter a name for your PDF , select if you want to edit the PDF properties , and click Create .
If you choose to edit the PDF properties , you can add your name and information to the file , select the initial view , encrypt it , and restrict permissions .
Alternately , you can create a PDF from almost any file by simply drag - and - dropping it into Nitro PDF Reader .
It will automatically convert the file to PDF and open it in a new tab in Nitro PDF .
Now from the File menu you can send the PDF as an email attachment so anyone can view it .
Make sure to save the PDF before closing Nitro , as it does not automatically save the PDF file .
Conclusion
Nitro PDF
Reader is a nice alternative to Adobe Reader , and offers some features that are only available in the more expensive Adobe Acrobat .
With great Windows 7 integration , including full support for 64 - bit editions , Nitro fits in with the Windows and Office experience very nicely .
If you have tried out Nitro PDF Reader leave a comment and let us know what you think .

Even though Lost has only been around since late 2004 , and even though a single game can take that many years or more to develop , the connection between these two geek hobbies is already surprisingly strong .
Hidden references ( the numbers , the hatch , polar bears ) and clever cameos ( Jack , Desmond , Locke ) pop up in nearly every genre and on nearly every system .

No , this does n't count …
Here are the 16 we 've discovered .
How many more are out there ?

Pitching a perfect baseball game is no easy feat .
It 's only happened 16 times since 1900 , but of course in real life baseball they only have one season a year .
With thousands of players playing several seasons between the game 's release and the May 1 contest deadline , there were plenty of entries to the 2K Sports contest as early as two days after the game hit store shelves .
However only one could be the first , and that one is Alabama 's Wade McGilberry .

" It was actually my wife who convinced me to go for it .
I never thought I 'd actually win a million dollars playing a video game , it 's all still sinking in for me . "
Wade threw a verified perfect game on the first day of the competition , a feat thought by many to be impossible .
He went on to add , " The game itself was fantastic - I 'm glad I bought it either way - but I have to say , this is a nice return on my investment . "
Congratulations , Wade !
Now you can buy a PlayStation 3 and a copy of MLB 10 The Show !
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has disrupted a long - running online scam that allowed offshore fraudsters to steal millions of dollars from U.S. consumers -- often by taking just pennies at a time .
The scam , which had been run for about four years years , according to the FTC , provides a case lesson in how many of the online services used to lubricate business in the 21st century can equally be misused for fraud .
" It was a very patient scam , " said Steve Wernikoff , a staff attorney with the FTC who is prosecuting the case .
" The people who are behind this are very meticulous . "
The FTC has not identified those responsible for the fraud , but in March , it quietly filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Illinois .
This has frozen the gang 's U.S. assets and also allowed the FTC to shut down merchant accounts and 14 " money mules " -- U.S. residents recruited by the criminals to move money offshore to countries such as Bulgaria , Cyprus , and Estonia .
" We 're going to aggressively seek to identify the ultimate masterminds behind this scheme , " Wernikoff said .
According to him , the scammers found loopholes in the credit card processing system that allowed them to set up fake U.S. companies that then ran more than a million phony credit card transactions through legitimate credit card processing companies .
Wernikoff does n't know where the scammers obtained the credit card numbers they charged , but they could have been purchased from online carder forums , black market Web sites where criminal buy and sell stolen information .
The scammers stayed under the radar by charging very small amounts -- typically between $ 0.25 and $ 9 per card -- and by setting up more than 100 bogus companies to process the transactions .
U.S. consumers footed most of the bill for the scam because , amazingly , about 94 percent of all charges went uncontested by the victims .
According to the FTC , the fraudsters charged 1.35 million credit cards a total of $ 9.5 million , but only 78,724 of these fake charges were ever noticed .
Typically they floated just one charge per card number , billing on behalf of made - up business names such as Adele Services or Bartelca LLC .
As credit cards are increasingly being used for inexpensive purchases -- they 're now accepted by soda machines and parking meters -- criminals have cashed in on the trend by running this type of unauthorized charging scam .
" They know that most of the fraud detection systems wo n't detect anything under $ 10 and they know that consumers wo n't complain about a 20 cent fee , " said Avivah Litan , an analyst with the Gartner research firm who follows bank fraud .
" What 's different here is the scale , and that they got away with it for so many years , " she said .
In March Alexsandr Bernik of Roseville , California , was sentenced to 70 months in prison for running a similar scam .
He put tens of thousands of charges on Amex accounts , each ranging from $ 9 to $ 15 .
Neither federal authorities nor American Express would explain how Bernik obtained his card numbers .
Bernik made his charges on behalf of a fictional corporation called Lexbay Ltd. , but in the FTC case , the scammers would mimic legitimate companies -- taking real federal tax I.D. numbers and then setting up fake businesses with nearly identical names that appeared to be located nearby .
In a move that apparently tricked credit card processors into granting it a merchant account , Adele Services , for example , was set up to mimic a legitimate Bronx , New York group called Adele Organization .
When the scammers tried to register merchant accounts with credit card processors , the processors would do some investigating , but using tricks like these , the scammers were always one step ahead .
In fact , the FTC 's description of their operation reads like a textbook on how to set up a fake virtual corporation in the Internet age .
The criminals used a range of legitimate business services to make it appear to credit card processors as though they were legitimate U.S. companies , even though the scammers may have never set foot in the U.S .
For example , using a company called Regus , they were able to give their fictional companies addresses that were very close to the companies whose tax IDs they were stealing .
Regus lets companies operate " virtual offices " out of a number of prestigious addresses throughout the U.S. -- the Chrysler Building in New York for example -- forwarding mail for as little as US $ 59 per month .
Mail sent to Regus locations was then forwarded to another company , called Earth Class Mail , which scans correspondence and uses the Internet to deliver it to customers in pdf format .
They used another legitimate virtual business service -- United World Telecom 's CallMe800 -- to have phone calls forwarded overseas .
To further make it seem as though their companies were legitimate , the scammers would set up fake retail Web sites .
And when credit card processors asked them to provide information about company executives , they handed over legitimate names and social security numbers , stolen from ID theft victims .
When they had to log into payment processor Web sites , they would do this from IP addresses that were located near their virtual offices , again evading payment processor fraud detection services .
One of the largest payment processors in the U.S. , First Data , was a favorite of the scammers .
Of the 116 fake merchant accounts the FTC uncovered , 110 were with First Data .
The scammers also set up bogus accounts with Elavon and BBVA Compass .
First Data would not comment on the measures it had taken to improve its merchant vetting process , but the company did confirm that it cooperated with the FTC investigation .
To get the money out of the U.S. , the scammers had to recruit money mules .
These were U.S. residents who were recruited online , often with spam e-mail messages .
Under the impression that they were helping offshore businesses , the money mules set up bank accounts and helped the fraudsters move money offshore .
In a letter to the judge presiding over the case , one of the mules , James P. Smith of Brownwood , Texas , says he worked for one of the scammers for four years without realizing that anything illegal was going on .
Smith now says he is " ashamed " to be named in the FTC action , and offers to help catch his former boss , who used the name Alex Moore .
The FTC's Wernikoff believes that whoever is responsible for this crime lives outside of the U.S. , but with the money - cashing operation now busted up , the scammers will have to start again from scratch , if they want to keep bilking consumers .
And criminal investigators now have a trail to follow .
" Does it prevent the people from ultimately responsible from building up again from scratch ? " he asked .
" No .
But we do hope that this seriously disrupts them . " .

The number of American soldiers seeking treatment for opiate abuse has skyrocketed over the past five years , at a time when the U.S. military has been surging forces into the heart of the world 's leading opium producer .
Pentagon statistics obtained by FoxNews.com show that the number of Army soldiers enrolled in Substance Abuse Program counseling for opiates has soared nearly 500 percent -- from 89 in 2004 to 529 last year .
The number showed a steady increase almost every year in that time frame -- but it leaped 50 percent last year when the U.S. began surging troops into Afghanistan .
Army troop levels in Afghanistan went from 14,000 as of the end of 2004 to 46,400 as of the end of 2009 .
The Army did not break down the opiate - use data to show how many of the soldiers had been deployed to Afghanistan or what specific opiates they were using ; opiate drugs include morphine , codeine and heroin .
Lt. Col. Christopher Garver , a U.S. Army spokesman , said the military has been monitoring the uptick and is " concerned about it . "
He said the numbers reflect use not only of heroin , but of prescription drugs , that the abuse may not be " directly correlated to previous deployments , " and that the increase could reflect an increase in reporting abuse -- not just drug use itself .
But the abundance and accessibility of heroin in Afghanistan surely account for part of the jump , said Lt. Col .
Tony Shaffer , an Army Reserve officer who served in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2004 .
Shaffer said heroin abuse had " started to get out of hand " when he was in the country .
He said a " black market " existed where troops on U.S. bases would trade goods to local Afghans in exchange for heroin .
" It sounds like it kind of went way beyond that , " he said after learning about the statistics .
" It 's inevitable .
...
It 's available .
It 's right there . "
Shaffer , who now works with the Center for Advanced Defense Studies , said the availability of the product combined with high stress levels from multiple tours of duty amounts to a dangerous mix that can lead to hard drug abuse .
As a potential measure of Army stress levels , suicides have steadily climbed in recent years .
The Army reported there were 160 possible suicides among active - duty soldiers in 2009 , up from 140 the year before .
The opiate - use statistics were first obtained by the watchdog group Judicial Watch , which requested them through a Freedom of Information Act inquiry and provided them to FoxNews.com .
The Army confirmed the authenticity of the report .
Chris Farrell , director of investigation with Judicial Watch and a former Army intelligence officer , said he sought the data to see what kind of impact Afghanistan 's locally produced drug supply may be having on U.S. troops .
" This whole situation detracts , obviously , from mission readiness , " he said , noting that actual hard drug use is probably far higher than the numbers show .
" It 's a public interest issue . "
David Rittgers , a former Special Forces officer who served in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2004 , said he did n't see opiate abuse among U.S. forces while he was in the war zone , though it was " rampant " in the Afghan forces .
But he said the abuse of drugs ranging from painkillers to heroin could also occur after soldiers return home from deployment and have trouble readjusting to life in the States .
" This is an outlet , just as alcohol abuse is an outlet , " said Rittgers , who is a reserve JAG officer and clarified that he is not a Pentagon spokesman .
While the number of soldiers seeking treatment has risen dramatically , urinalysis drug tests in Afghanistan do not reflect the trend .
According to the Army data , soldiers tested positive for heroin use just twice in the past three years .
Western forces have given mixed signals about how heavily they are targeting opium drug production in Afghanistan , a major source of funding for the Taliban .
The DEA said last month that opium seizures rose 924 percent in 2009 .
But recent reports have said the military is focusing far more on fighting the Taliban than in cutting off the opium supply at the source .
While some say going after opium farming worsens relations between Western forces and the local population , others say eradication is critical .
Gen . Barry McCaffrey , the former U.S. drug czar , said during a speech to the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers last year that the military risks exposing its troops to drug abuse problems if it does n't destroy the opium crops .
" I 'd be astonished if we do n't see soldiers who find 10 kilograms of heroin and pack it up in a birthday cake and send it home to their mother with a note that says , ' Do n't open this package until I 'm home , ' " he said , according to an article on the speech in the Palm Beach Post .
To think like the rational adversary , you have to think
1 . If I think he 'll screw me over , I 'll screw him over .
and
2 . If I think he 'll be nice , I "ll screw him over .
1 is very rational .
Everyone with a spine thinks that , and it 's honestly what 's best for everyone .
2 is VERY uncommon .
I really do n't believe anyone can really think like that without being a sociopath .
The failing of centralized ideology is that often , it will try to subvert both 1 and 2 at various times .
Christianity will tell you to turn the other cheek and that friendly nonbelievers will go to hell , and fascism will tell you to always follow orders even if you will personally suffer and that the people in other cultures need to be exploited for the benefit of the mother country .
We are all simply humans , and the creation of these fascist abstractions like God and the State exists solely to obscure this simple fact .
Much has been made of laminin having a cross shape .
But should we look for such “ signs ” to prove the accuracy of God ’s Word ?
Keywords : laminin , cross , Christianity , icon , molecules , biology , extracellular matrix , ECM , cells , truth , Jesus Christ , signs , God's Word
Over the past few months we have received numerous questions concerning a popular Christian icon — the protein laminin .
Laminin , interestingly , is in the shape of a cross ( see here ) .
In fact , a quick Internet search turns up multiple websites selling T - shirts , mousepads , stickers , coffee mugs , and a host of other items with a picture of the laminin protein .
These items usually include a catch phrase such as “ Great designers always leave their mark ” or “ Fingerprint of The Creator . ”
As a molecular biologist , I can certainly appreciate excitement concerning a protein ( which really shows what a science nerd I am ! ) , but a protein as an icon of Christianity ?
What Is Laminin ?
Laminin is a protein that is part of the extracellular matrix in humans and animals .
The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) lies outside of cells and provides support and attachment for cells inside organs ( along with many other functions ) .
Laminin has “ arms ” that associate with other laminin molecules to form sheets and bind to cells .
Laminin and other ECM proteins essentially “ glue ” the cells ( such as those lining the stomach and intestines ) to a foundation of connective tissue .
This keeps the cells in place and allows them to function properly .
The structure of laminin is very important for its function ( as is true for all proteins ) .
One type of congenital muscular dystrophy results from defects in laminin .
How Has Laminin Become an Icon of Christianity ?
An argument that has become quite common in modern Christianity is well illustrated by relation of the structure and function of laminin to biblical truths .
This little , unknown protein became popular after it was used in a sermon .
The topic of laminin quickly appeared in many emails and blogs , and eventually its shape made its way into merchandising ( e.g. , T - shirts and coffee mugs ) .
In a sermon , Louie Giglio asks how we can know that God will hold us together ( which he infers from Psalm 33 ) .
He states , “ That ’s really what we want to know today , and I ’ll tell you how you can know today that God will always hold you together , no matter what . ”
Mr. Giglio then discusses the function of laminin ( as glue ) , and its structure ( a cross ) in the body .
He relates this to Colossians 1:17 , which states , “ He [ Christ ] is before all things , and in him all things hold together . ”
His argument is basically that God designed laminin in the shape of a cross and gave it the particular function of “ glue ” in the body so that we can know ( in his words ) the truth that Christ holds all things together .
What Is the Problem with This Type of Argument ?
While I appreciate Mr. Giglio ’s passion for the Word , I would suggest that this type of argument is not a good one to use .
( See God ’s Pharmacy for a similar example . )
The main problem with this type of argument is that it appears that something outside of Scripture ( in this case , laminin ) is vital to know the truthfulness of a biblical truth .
Laminin is used to prove a biblical truth .
However , we should never use our fallible , finite understanding of the world to judge the infallible Word of God .
What we observe in the world can certainly be used to confirm God ’s Word ( and it does ) , but our finite observations are not in a position to evaluate the infinite things of God .
Only if we start with the Bible as our ultimate standard can we have a worldview that is rational and makes sense of the evidence ( see “ Atheism : An Irrational Worldview ” and “ Evolution : The Anti-Science ” ) .
The structure of laminin was not made popular until 2008 , yet I have no doubt that many Christians before that time have trusted the truth presented in Colossians 1:17 because it is God ’s Word .
Would Colossians 1:17 be any less true if laminin were not in the shape of a cross ?
No .
If five years from now we discover that the laminin protein actually has a different shape ( in fact , some electron micrographs of the protein do not resemble a cross at all , see here , p. 149 ) , would that change the truth found in Colossians 1:17 ?
No , because our belief in the truthfulness that Christ holds all things together should start and end with God ’s Word alone !
Looking for Signs
Unfortunately this type of argument — which effectively treats our fallible , finite knowledge of the evidence as superior to God ’s Word — is very popular in today ’s society , especially among young people .
As a former Christian college professor , I have a lot of experience with college students .
I lost track of the number of times students came into my office and told me they were going to switch majors or date someone or decide to do something because God had given them a “ sign . ”
I always posed a series of questions to them after hearing about their “ sign ” :
Had they been praying and asking for God ’s guidance ?
Had they been studying the Bible ?
Had they been talking with spiritually mature mentors ?
Usually this was met with a half - hearted “ yes , ” and then it was back to telling me about the amazing “ sign . ”
Certainly God can use signs to reveal things , and that is evident from Scripture .
In Luke 2:12 an angel tells the shepherds , “ This will be a sign to you :
You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger . ”
However , Jesus also admonishes those that improperly seek signs ( Matthew 16:4 ) .
In today ’s “ fast food ” society , many people prefer the “ drive - thru ” when it comes to knowing God ’s truths .
A sign is much quicker than studying and reasoning from the Scriptures , taking the time to pray , and discussing God ’s Word with other believers .
Young Christians have started doubting God ’s Word ( especially the book of Genesis ) because this is what is drummed into them from the secular world through much of the media and most public schools .
Many desperately want to accept the claims of Scripture but have been taught to think , improperly , that the unaided mind is the ultimate standard for acquiring knowledge .
That is why the type of argument used with the laminin protein likely resonates with them and many other Christians as well .
As one blogger said , “ I Believe God Is Sending Us A Message Saying Im [ sic ]
Here And Im [ sic ] Holding You Together . ”
Yet Proverbs 1:7a tells us , “ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ” ( see also Colossians 2:3 ) .
Consider what happens when people try to prove the resurrection of Christ ( a biblical truth ) using unaided reasoning .
Science is clear on this one : dead people do not come back to life .
So , does that prove that Jesus did not resurrect ?
Of course not !
Science and human reasoning are not the limit of what is possible ;
God is the limit .
Scripture should be our ultimate standard to understand this miraculous event .
Starting with unaided reasoning and reading our own ideas into the Bible can lead us to all sorts of absurd conclusions .
For example , the Ebola virus , which causes a horrific form of hemorrhagic fever that usually results in death , happens to have the structure of what is commonly referred to as a shepherd ’s crook .
The Bible tells us that Jesus is the Good Shepherd ( John 10:14 ) .
So , if the shape of laminin supports the biblical truth that Christ holds all things together , then what would we conclude about the Good Shepherd from the shape of the Ebola virus ?
And if laminin can represent a cross , then why not a sword ( Ephesians 6:17 ; Hebrews 4:12 ) ?
As Christians , we cannot allow our fallible , finite interpretations to supersede the Word of God ( 2 Peter 1:20 ) .
Conclusion
Romans 1:20 makes it clear that we can know God through what He has made .
God certainly designed the laminin protein and gave it a structure that allows it to perform the function He designated for it .
In fact , one of the early papers on the structure and function of laminin said this : “ Globular and rodlike domains are arranged in an extended four - armed , cruciform shape that is well suited for mediating between distant sites on cells and other components of the extracellular matrix ” ( emphasis mine ) .

Anger over the death of a man allegedly at the hands of two undercover police officers in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria has sparked anger across the nation and condemnation by human - rights organizations and a Facebook group dedicated to finding out what happened to Khaled Mohamed Saied .
On Sunday , security forces outside the Interior Ministry in the capital , Cairo , broke up a march by 200 protesters before allowing it to resume about 300 yards away amid tight security .
Demonstrators , carrying banners that read " Trial for Khaled Saied 's murderers , " were demanding an investigation into Saied 's death .
Protesters shouted that " Khaled was murdered " and lay the blame on Interior Minister Habib Adli .
Following his death on June 6 , human - rights groups , including Amnesty International , said that Saied was arrested in an Internet cafe by two undercover policemen , who tortured and beat him to death at the entrance of a nearby building .
Photos of Saied 's beaten face and body spread across social - networking websites .

Advertisement Flights have landed at a number of UK airports for the first time in six days following the lifting of restrictions caused by a volcanic ash cloud .
The Civil Aviation Authority allowed a phased reopening of airspace after a reassessment of the risk to aircraft .
It said its safety tests showed that plane engines had " increased tolerance levels in low ash density areas " .
BAA , which operates many of the UK's airports , said people should contact their airlines before travelling .
" Not all flights will operate during the early period of opening , and we will do everything we can to support airlines and get people moving , " a spokesman said .
Some restrictions will remain on flights in UK airspace , but they will be much less stringent than before .
Dame Deirdre Hutton , of the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) , said there had been detailed consultation with experts to reassess the tolerance of planes to the ash cloud .
The CAA said it was a " situation without precedent " and that decisions had been made based on " thorough gathering of data and analysis " .
" The major barrier to resuming flight has been understanding tolerance levels of aircraft to ash , " the CAA said .
" Manufacturers have now agreed increased tolerance levels in low ash density areas . "
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis , who made the initial announcement , denied the decision to reopen airspace was the result of pressure from the airline industry .
He told BBC Two 's Newsnight programme : " The issue at stake here has been the assessment of the safety authorities as to what is the safe way in which planes can fly when there is a presence of ash .
" The fact which has changed in the last week is we have had a volcanic eruption and having to assess safe levels of ash content in the atmosphere within which planes can fly has been an urgent issue which the safety authorities have had to deal with . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " This solution has been reached as a result of the close working between the government , the Civil Aviation Authority , airlines and the manufacturers , and will allow the thousands of UK citizens stranded abroad to return home to their families .

" We will of course continue to monitor the situation closely ; as we have said throughout safety is our primary concern , " he added .
But shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers said Labour 's " misjudgement and mismanagement " had " badly let down " the travelling public and urged the Prime Minister to immediately announce a full inquiry into the " fiasco " .
She added : " Six days into the crisis , we 're suddenly told that there are actually levels of ash which are compatible with safe flying .
The question angry passengers and airlines are already asking is why the government had n't worked this out before the crisis occurred . "
After the lifting of the restrictions , the first British Airways flight to touch down from Heathrow was a service already in the air from Vancouver , which landed shortly before 2200 BST .
The airline 's chief executive Willie Walsh said he was pleased with the decision , but said it would take weeks to get back to normal levels of operation .
" We 're now at British Airways going to start the difficult task of getting our stranded customers back home but I think this is an airlift that is unprecedented but we will make every effort to get our people back home . "
He said " lessons can be learned " and added : " There will be plenty of time for a post - mortem of what has happened over the last few days . "
Everyone felt that if the pilot was happy to fly then we were happy to get on

Passengers relieved at UK return
He said parts of the UK airspace could have been opened several days ago .
" My personal belief is that we could have safely continued operating for a period of time .
I think there were occasions when the decision to close airspace could have been justified . "
EasyJet said it planned to resume " some services across the UK and continental Europe from tomorrow morning , " but added that the level of disruption meant it would be several days before the schedule returned to normal .
Flights have been grounded across the UK and much of Europe since Thursday following the eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull .
The eruption sent vast amounts of ash into the atmosphere which poses a threat to aircraft jet engines .
Despite the lifting of the ban , it will be some time before flights return to normal .
Flight restrictions had already been eased across much of Europe earlier in the day but it was thought likely that it would be a few days before regular flight schedules would return .
Some flights have left Paris , Amsterdam and Frankfurt , but airspace in Germany and Ireland remains restricted .
As tens of thousands of Britons prepare to return home , the UK Border Agency warned people to expect long queues at passport as staff attempt to process large numbers of returning travellers .

Ash chaos as it happened : Day 6
A spokesman said : " We are manning as many passport desks as possible . "
The first passenger off the first flight into Heathrow - the BA84 from Vancouver - was Neil Rogers , from Little London , near Reading , who said the atmosphere on board was " great " .
" It 's good to be back .
It 's quite something to be the first back , " he said .
Asked about the volcanic ash , he said : " It 's one of those things you can't do anything about .
" As we were coming into land I was quite concerned as we were coming through the cloud . "
Among among early arrivals at Heathrow was TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn Bowen who had been on holiday with his family in Mauritius .
An estimated 150,000 Britons have been stranded abroad during the six - day shutdown of UK airspace to commercial flights .
Anyone concerned about the safety of a British national who is still stranded abroad can call a Foreign Office helpline on 020 7008 0000 , or visit its website .
Stranded Britons should contact their local embassy , high commission or consulate .

WASHINGTON — Some topics are so inflammatory that they are never discussed without first inserting a number of caveats .
And so , when Anthony Cordesman , a foreign policy dignitary in this town ’s think tank circuit , dropped an article on Wednesday headlined “ Israel as a Strategic Liability , ” he made sure to open with a plethora of qualifications .
First , he noted , America ’s commitment to Israel is motivated by morality and ethics — a reaction to the Holocaust , to Western anti-Semitism and to American foot - dragging before and during World War II that left European Jews slaughtered by the Nazis .
Second , Israel is a democracy with the same values as the United States .
Third , the United States will never abandon Israel , and will help it keep its military edge over its neighbors .
And America will guard Israel against an Iranian nuclear threat .
But once Mr. Cordesman had dispensed with what in the newspaper world is called the “ to - be- sure ” paragraphs , he laid out a dispassionate argument that has gained increased traction in Washington — both inside the Obama administration ( including the Pentagon , White House and State Department ) and outside , during forums , policy breakfasts , even a seder in Bethesda .
Recent Israeli governments , particularly the one led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Mr. Cordesman argued , have ignored the national security concerns of its biggest benefactor , the United States , and instead have taken steps that damage American interests abroad .
“ The depth of America ’s moral commitment does not justify or excuse actions by an Israeli government that unnecessarily make Israel a strategic liability when it should remain an asset , ” Mr. Cordesman wrote , in commentary for the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies , where he is the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in strategy .
“ It is time Israel realized that it has obligations to the United States , as well as the United States to Israel , and that it become far more careful about the extent to which it tests the limits of U.S. patience and exploits the support of American Jews . ”

Labor Markets in Flux Spanish Youth Part of the Lost Generation

The archetypal alcoholic writers were Faulkner , Fitzgerald , Hemingway and O’Neill .
As Tom Dardis showed in his fine study The Thirsty Muse ( 1989 ) , only O’Neill managed to give up drinking , after which he wrote the masterpieces The Iceman Cometh and Long Day ’s Journey into Night .
The others had sacrificed the creative drive by early middle age .
They swallowed the myth that to be a good writer , you had to be a drinking writer .
With addicted artists – whether they took alcohol , opium , or thorn apple – the prosaic truth is that they created art despite their dependency , and not because of it .
For the first time in the 24 years that the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study has been conducted , the domestic brands have managed to surpass the imports .
Led by new entries from Ford and General Motors , domestic brands , as a whole , have done better but four out of the five top places still went to the imports .
Overall , the industry average for initial quality is 109 problems per 100 vehicles ( PP100 ) in 2010 , increasing slightly from 108 PP100 in 2009 .
However , initial quality for domestic brands as a whole has improved by 4 PP100 in 2010 to an average of 108 PP100 - - slightly better than the initial quality of import brands , which averages 109 PP100 in 2010 .
Top honors went to Porsche , which had just 83 PP100 on average , followed closely by Acura on 86 , Mercedes - Benz on 87 , Lexus on 88 and Ford close behind on 93 .
The top spot in 2009 went to Lexus .
According to the findings , substantial improvements by many domestic models -- including the Ford Focus , Ram 1500 LD and Buick Enclave -- drove the overall improvement of domestic automakers in 2010 .
Each year the Initial Quality Study compiles the statistics on the number of problems new owners face over the first 90 days of ownership .
The study claims to be an excellent predictor of long - term durability , and therefore a good basis for consumer decisions on new car models that do n't yet have a proven track record .
This is because high quality generally translates into reduced re-engineering costs and lower warranty expenses during a vehicle ’s life cycle .
High quality , or at least the perception of , can also enhance an automaker ’s reputation for reliability , which is a critical purchase consideration for many consumers these days .
Incidentally , of the brands surveyed , last place went to Land Rover , which suffered from an average of 170 problems per hundred vehicles .
Below is a list of the top 100 brands and their associated PP100 :
Porsche 83
Acura 86
Mercedes - Benz 87
Lexus 88
Ford 93
Honda 95
Hyundai 102
Lincoln 106
Infiniti 107
Volvo 109

A consortium of independent film producers is hitting a stumbling block in its plan to simultaneously sue thousands of BitTorrent users for allegedly downloading pirated movies .
Time Warner Cable is refusing to look up and turn over the identities of about a thousand of its customers targeted in the lawsuits , on the grounds that the effort would require three months of full - time work by its staff .
The brouhaha dates to March , when the U.S. Copyright Group launched its mass - litigation campaign , suing thousands of BitTorrent users by the IP addresses they used when feeding and seeding films like Steam Experiment , Far Cry , Uncross the Stars , Gray Man and Call of the Wild 3D .
Unlike the similar music - industry lawsuit campaign , which spread its lawsuits out over years , the filmmakers hit ISPs around the country with subpoenas for hundreds of customers at a time , demanding Time Warner Cable comb through its records to identify past users by IP address .
Court filings suggest that none of the broadband providers is happy about servicing the mass subpoenas , but Time Warner Cable is fighting them in court , arguing that serious law enforcement requests for information could fall by the wayside if the company is forced into becoming the research arm of the independent film producers .
" Given its current staffing , it would take TWC nearly three months of full - time work by TWC 's subpoena compliance group , and TWC would not be able to respond to any other request , emergency or otherwise , from law enforcement during this period , " the company said in a court filing .
" TWC has a six - month retention period for its IP lookup logs , and by the time TWC could turn to law enforcement requests , many of these requests could not be answered . "
Time Warner says it can only reasonably forward the names of 28 account holders per month .
Given that there are about a thousand IP addresses linked to Time Warner , that process could take years to learn the identities of the account holders , the filmmakers complain .
The filmmakers are now threatening to sue Time Warner for allegedly facilitating copyright infringement by fighting the demands for subscriber information in court .
The U.S. Copyright Group cites the Supreme Court 's 2005 Grokster decision , in which the justices cleared the way for lawsuits targeting companies that induce or encourage file sharing piracy .
" To the extent TWC 's tactics are just that –- letting the public know that TW is a good ISP for copyright infringers , because TWC will fight any subpoenas related to infringers ' activities –- TWC exposes itself to a claim for contributory copyright infringement , " ( .pdf ) Thomas Dunlap , the Copyright Group 's lead counsel , said in a federal court filing Tuesday .
Dunlap said Time Warner " is more intent on trying to avoid compliance , while currying favor with its subscribers and potential subscribers . "
The Grokster decision paved the way for a federal judge two weeks ago to declare file - sharing - software maker LimeWire liable of facilitating copyright infringement on a massive scale , because it did not take " meaningful steps " to mitigate infringement .
The Grokster ruling , though , has never been interpreted as barring an ISP from challenging subpoenas in court .
Time Warner told the District of Columbia judge presiding over the case that responding to 28 IP address lookups per month " is the outer limit of what TWC can reasonable handle " ( .pdf ) .
Any more would be " excessively burdensome and expensive . "
Neither Dunlap nor Time Warner immediately responded for comment .
Comcast has tentatively agreed to forward the account holders ' names , but reserved the right to object .
CableVisions Systems , according to court records , is working on a " resolution " to the same issue faced by Time Warner Cable .
All targeted ISPs were given until May 31 to file a motion to object to disclosing account holders ' names .
The indie filmmakers are taking a different tactic from their commercial counterparts .
The Motion Picture Association of America , for the most part , has limited its lawsuits to BitTorrent sites themselves — like The Pirate Bay , TorrentSpy and Isohunt .
The RIAA 's lawsuits against 20,000 alleged music pirates were focused on old - school file sharing systems like Kazaa and Limewire .
BitTorrent file sharing is more complicated , with downloaders and uploaders collecting in transient swarms of so - called seeders and leechers .
In the Indie cases , the offending IP address were sniffed out by Guardaley IT , a German peer - to - peer–surveillance firm .

Rescuers arrive to free trapped man as he finishes amputating his own arm
Life or death decision : Jonathan Metz sawed off his arm after it became trapped in a furnace
An American man is recovering after cutting his own arm off after it became stuck in a broken furnace in his basement .
Jonathan Metz started cutting three days after becoming stuck while he tried to fix the unit , as he began to smell his flesh rotting .
The 31 - year - old had almost cut through the limb when rescuers arrived , his friends having raised the alarm when he failed to arrive at work and a softball game .
Police forced their way into his Hartford , Connecticut , apartment and found him in agony , his severed arm having succumbed to gangrene .
The amputation was completed in hospital .
' There was a little bit of fat that remained and he was in and out of consciousness , ' said Dr Scott Ellner , Metz 's surgeon at Hartford 's Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center .
' It sounds like maybe there was a nerve there that prevented him from completing the amputation . '
Metz , who lives alone , had been trying to replace the boiler fins on his furnace on Sunday when his arm became trapped .
Friend Luca DiGregorio said he and other friends grew worried when Metz failed to attend work or social engagements .
Metz also did not answer the doorbell when DiGregorio visited his home on Wednesday , where he said he saw Metz 's dog ' yipping at the back door ' .
DiGregorio called police , who found Metz in the basement .
Trapped : Metz , 31 , performed the amputation three days after it became stuck in the broken unit at his home in Hartford , Connecticut
' I was a little worried , especially when the first cop showed up , ' DiGregorio said .
' Then more showed up , and then the ambulance showed up , so it got a little nerve - racking . '
Firefighters ripped apart the furnace with heavy tools , including a spreader normally used to take the door off a car .
Once they did so , the arm ' just gave away , because his arm was already infected and the tissue was non-viable ' , fire chiefs said .
Officials did n't know what type of tools Metz used to attempt the amputation , saying he was mumbling during the rescue operation .
They said Metz drank some of the water that had leaked from the furnace to help him stay alive .
Dr David Shapiro , a trauma specialist who also operated on Metz , said he could not have lived much longer .
' I 've never experienced somebody who had the ability to go through something like this , ' Dr Ellner said .
' He provides a lot of inspiration for myself , not just as a physician but as a human being . '
Dr Shapiro said that although there was still some concern about infection , Metz was expected to survive .
He will have to undergo more surgery to prepare the arm for a prosthetic .

Gulf oil spill :
What 's at stake
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The numbers being batted around when it comes to how much the oil spill will ultimately cost BP and the local Gulf of Mexico economies are huge .
$ 3 billion .
$ 14 billion .
One politician put it at over $ 100 billion .
The range is so big because two important questions remain unanswered :
When will the leak be sealed , and will most of the oil wash ashore ?
Until those are answered no one will know the pricetag of the damages for sure .
But there have been studies done looking at what 's broadly at stake , and the number is quite large indeed .
The four biggest industries in the Gulf of Mexico are oil , tourism , fishing and shipping , and they account for some $ 234 billion in economic activity each year , according to a 2007 study done by regional scholars and published by Texas A&M University Press .
Two thirds of that amount is in the United States , with the other third in Mexico .
If the Gulf of Mexico were a country , it would be the 29th largest economy in the world .
Oil and gas
Ironically , the largest chunk of that money is generated by the oil and gas industry , and they may ultimately be the ones that lose the most .
Oil and gas interests generate $ 124 billion or 53 % of the total money , according to Jim Cato , a former economics professor at the University of Florida and one of the authors on the study .
As of Thursday , all new offshore drilling in U.S. waters in the Gulf remained closed following the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig last month , which claimed 11 lives and left an uncapped oil well leaking thousands of gallons a day into the water .
Oil production from existing wells has been largely unaffected and drillers have been busying themselves with wells begun before the explosion .
But the longer the ban remains intact , the harder the economic bite .
" If the moratorium is continued through June , lost revenue from shallow water drilling is estimated at $ 135 million , " said a letter Friday from ten senators urging a lifting of the ban .
The ban may eventually be lifted , but how much more the oil industry will have to pay for royalties or spill prevention , plus restricted access to new drilling sites , remains to be seen .
Tourism
Tourism is the second largest industry in the Gulf , and it ranks right behind oil .
About 46 % of the Gulf economy , or over $ 100 billion a year , is from tourism dollars , according to the A&M report .
With tourism , it 's not necessarily the oil that washes up on the beach that hurts the industry , but how much oil people think will wash up on the beach .
And people seem to think it will be bad .
In Florida , state tourism officials recently told CNN they 're getting cancellations as far as three months out .
In Mississippi it 's even worse .
Ken Montana , President of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Tourism Commission , said cancellation rates are running at nearly 50 % .
" The perception is that everybody has oil on the beach and we are all closed up , " Montana told CNN .
" No beaches are closed , period . "
Fishing and shipping
Fishermen are perhaps the most directly impacted by the spill .
The government has already closed over 20 % of federal waters for fishing activities and many of them are out of work .
But commercial fishing and shipping together only account for 1 % of the Gulf 's total economic activity .
While the number is small in terms of Gulf cost dollars , it does not factor in the impact a shut down in shipping could have , which could halt grain and other cargo from traveling up and down the Mississippi River .
According to the Port of New Orleans , no disruption in shipping is foreseen .
The Coast Guard has set up five washing stations for ships to get scrubbed if they come into contact with the oil , but so far none have been used , said a port spokesman .
What 's at stake
Obviously , the oil spill is n't going to shut down the Gulf 's entire economic output .
When the spill first happened , researchers at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , who also contributed to the A&M report , estimated the economic damages might be $ 1.6 billion .
That number included $ 400 million in direct economic costs , and another $ 1.2 million in services provided by wetlands that might be compromised -- things like water filtration and such .
But that number was arrived at when the oil spill was estimated to be 1,000 barrels a day , said David Yoskowitz , chair of socio-economics at Harte .
As many as 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil were spewing into the ocean every day , according to government scientists , which could make this disaster twice the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill .
Moreover , both the Harte study and the A&M report only look at the Gulf of Mexico .
Yet there are reports that the oil is getting caught up in the so - called loop current , which could bring it up the eastern seaboard .
" If that happens , all bets are off , " said Yoskowitz .
The anticipation for the 2010 World Cup was big enough .
But with the added value of naked women painted in versions of our favorite soccer teams ( every team is our favorite team when it comes to nakedness ) , it ’s reaching a feverish pitch .
At least it is over here .
There are no subliminal messages here .
No shadowy cocks to try and find hidden on a woman ’s chest .
We were n’t sure who we were going to root for during the games , but it ’s clear as hell now .
Hello Portugal .
You ’re officially forgiven for all your past transgressions .

Rand Paul gives his victory speech after winning the Senate Republican primary election in Bowling Green , Kentucky , at Bowling Green Country Club May 18 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Jake Stevens
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A conservative who won the Republican Party nomination for U.S. senator in Kentucky tried on Thursday to repair the damage on Thursday from comments he made that suggested he did not fully support civil rights laws .
Rand Paul , a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement who won the nomination on Tuesday , suggested in a Wednesday interview with MSNBC that he opposed part of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that outlawed racial segregation .
He said he did not support a part of the law that made it a crime to discriminate on the basis of race .
Democrats jumped on the comment and sought to portray Paul , who will face a Democratic candidate in the November 2 election for the U.S. Senate seat from Kentucky , as out of the mainstream .
“ Rand Paul is promoting a narrow and rigid ideology and has repeatedly rejected a fundamental provision of the Civil Rights Act , ” said Jack Conway , the Democrat who will run against Paul .
Paul issued a statement that said he abhorred racial discrimination and backed the 46 - year - old law .
“ Even though this matter was settled when I was two , and no serious people are seeking to revisit it except to score cheap political points , I unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , ” he said .
Republicans are seeking to make big gains against strong Democratic majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives in the November elections .
We would like to adjust our LIR IPv6 Training Course depending on the country we are in .
Therefore we looked at the " IPv6 RIPEness " ( pun intended ) of the LIRs in that particular country .
We created a rating system , in which LIRs can get up to four “ stars ” for IP v6 services , depending on the following criteria : IPv6 allocation , visibility in the Routing Information Service ( RIS ) , route6 object in the RIPE Database and reverse DNS delegation set up .
Overall , 8 % of LIRs have achieved four - star IPv6 RIPEness .
Please find below more detailed results and a description of the methodology used .
Detailed Results
The graph below shows the percentage of LIRs with zero to four stars for each country in the RIPE NCC service region that has five or more LIRs .
This provides an indication of the level of IP v6 deployment in a specific country and in the RIPE NCC service region as a whole .
Figure 1 : Level of IP v6 deployment per country ( April 2010 )
The graph shows that 27 % of all LIRs in the RIPE NCC service region have at least one IP v6 allocation .
And 8 % have achieved four - star IPv6 RIPEness .
Slovenia shows the best results : 67 % of LIRs in Slovenia have at least one star , while 25 % have four stars !
In absolute numbers that means 8 out of their 34 LIRs have achieved four star IPv6 RIPEness .
The bad news is that , overall , almost three quarters of all LIRs ( indicated by the white bars on the graph ) have not even requested IP v6 space yet .
That is why we are targeting our IP v6 courses for LIRs to those countries with the smallest IP v6 ripeness ratings .
The results of this study help the RIPE NCC to adjust the course material to the levels of IP v6 deployment in a given country .
Please watch also the IPv6 ripeness movie that shows the IPv6 RIPEness ratings over time for the period between January 2004 and May 2010 .
Methodology
We looked at all LIRs registered in the RIPE NCC service region and determined their home country based on their Reg - ID ( country - code.name ) .
We realise that the actual location , or even some of the services the LIR provides , might be in a different country , or in multiple countries .
In order to earn the first star , an LIR must have received an IPv6 allocation , or a PI assignment .
Requesting IP v6 address space and fulfilling the criteria for an initial allocation is relatively easy : the organisation simply has to “ have a plan for making sub-allocations to other organisations and / or End Site assignments within two years . ”
Additional stars can be earned if :
The IPv6 prefix is visible in the Routing Information System .
For us , this means that the prefix is announced ; it can happen , though , that address space is announced to peers and upstreams , but is still not visible in RIS .
A route6 object for the IPv6 prefix is registered in the RIPE Database .
Note that this is not absolutely necessary for deploying IP v6 , but it is a measure of good housekeeping .
Some transit providers or Internet Exchange Points use route ( 6 ) objects as a requirement for accepting customers or peers .
The RIPE NCC Routing Registry training course explains this in detail .
Reverse DNS is set up for the IP v6 prefix .
This is not strictly necessary for a working IP v6 service , but it is seen as good practice .
If an LIR has multiple IPv6 address allocations , de-aggregated prefixes , multiple route6 objects or less specific reverse DNS delegation , that LIR would still only receive one star in each category in the rating system .
In order to anonymise the results , we decided to only show countries that have more than five LIRs .
Please also note that this rating system does not guarantee that an LIR that has four stars has a working IP v6 setup .
On the other hand , an LIR that has one star only ( that means it has an IPv6 allocation but does not fulfill any of the other criteria ) may very well have a functioning IP v6 network ( just has n't done very good housekeeping ... yet ) .
All measurements are based on data in the Internet Number Resource Database ( INRDB ) .
Fifth Star
We wish to complete our rating with a fifth star based on reachability .
We have several ideas , but we are curious to hear from you – what do you think is a good way to measure reachability ?
Here are some suggestions :
a ) ping the " pingable " address in the route6 object as proposed in
http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-haberman-rpsl-reachable-test-04.txt
The advantage of this approach is that the measurement is neutral and objective .
The disadvantage is that the existence of the pingable attribute is voluntary , and even the registration of a route6 object is not strictly necessary for fully deploying IPv6 .
In addition , this attribute is not yet implemented in the Routing Policy Specification language ( RPSL ) .
b ) observe addresses from the allocated IP v6 range connecting to www.ripe.net ( during certain time period )
The advantage of this method is that no extra effort is needed from LIRs .
The disadvantage is that not everyone may connect to www.ripe.net during the measurement period .
Next steps
As a next step we are considering assigning badges for those LIRs that have 4 stars .
They could be shown next to the LIR 's name on the RIPE NCC 's web site .
This might act as an encouragement for other LIRs to get their houskeeping in order and earn more stars .
We are also considering including this information in the LIR Locator tool .
Questions to you
We would like to hear from you what you think about this rating system in general .
Please consider the following questions specifically :
Do you agree that we tag your LIR 's name with the “ IPv6 RIPEness " badge ?
Which reachability criteria do you prefer for the fifth star ?
The first 50 LIRs with “ Four Star IPv6 RIPEness ” that write to us at ncc _at_ ripe _dot_ net ( subject : IPv6 RIPEness ) , will receive one T - shirt of your choice ( and size ) – either RIPE Labs , or IPv6ActNow .
* Preliminary data shows $ 19.8 bln outflow for all funds
* Analyst : Market volatility making investors skittish
* Drawing down retirement funds for living expenses
BOSTON , June 15 ( Reuters ) - Investors pulled $ 7.3 billion out of U.S. equity mutual funds in May , according to a preliminary analysis by Lipper released on Tuesday , suggesting nervousness about wild market moves and recent price declines .
Major U.S. stock market indexes tumbled from late April to early June after reaching their highest levels since September 2008 .
The month of May was also notable for the still unexplained " flash crash " on May 6 , when the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI plunged some 700 points in just minutes before sharply rebounding .
The equity fund outflows were part of total U.S. mutual fund outflows of $ 19.8 billion in May , the fifth consecutive month of net withdrawals for the $ 12 trillion fund industry , said Lipper , a Thomson Reuters company .
The largest outflows were from institutional money - market funds , totaling $ 42.6 billion , reflecting corporate treasurers ’ frustration over low yields , said Lipper Research Manager Jeff Tjornehoj .
Withdrawals from equity funds reversed net inflows in the first four months of 2010 as more investors started to put the 2008 bear market behind them .
Of May ’s equity fund withdrawals , some $ 6 billion was pulled from large - cap growth funds , the Lipper figures showed .
“ There ’s definitely a skittishness on the part of equity fund investors , ” Tjornehoj said .
“ It ’s probably just the hot money moving back and forth , but it ’s definitely been tilting toward outflows for the last several weeks . ”
He said he also suspects a good portion of the outflows were from unemployed investors drawing down 401 ( k ) retirement - savings accounts for living expenses .
Although the deep U.S. economic recession ended in late 2009 , high unemployment is lingering , forcing more Americans to dip into their savings to stay afloat .
Lipper ’s figures matched other studies showing a declining interest in equities .
In a study issued June 7 , Financial Research Corp in Boston forecast that flows to equity funds are likely to slow this year due to uncertainty and market volatility .
According to Lipper ’s preliminary data , the categories with the biggest inflows in May included institutional U.S. government money market funds , used by many corporate treasurers , and retail money market funds , with about $ 19 billion of inflows combined .
The third - largest category was precious metals funds , which had inflows of $ 5.3 billion in May .
Tjornehoj said gold funds and similar vehicles are seen by investors as likely to hold their value against inflation .

KARLSRUHE , Germany , May 14 ( UPI ) -- A German citizen whose home WiFi network was used for illegal file - sharing by an unknown party was fined by a court for failing to secure the network .
The Karlsruhe court said the defendant , whose information was not released , shared blame for illegal music - downloading and file - sharing because the wireless network was not password protected , allowing anyone in range to use it to access the Internet , the BBC reported Friday .

" Private users are obligated to check whether their wireless connection is adequately secured to the danger of unauthorized third parties abusing it to commit copyright violation , " the court said .
The owner , who was away on vacation at the time of the unauthorized WiFi network access , was not found guilty of copyright violation , but was found to have a degree of responsibility for the action .
The court fined the homeowner $ 123 .
New results from an investigation into Antarctica 's potential contribution to sea level rise are reported by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory ( LDEO ) and the National Oceanography Centre in the journal Nature Geoscience .
Thinning ice in West Antarctica is currently contributing nearly 10 per cent of global sea level rise and scientists have identified Pine Island Glacier ( PIG ) as a major source .
As part of a series of investigations to better understand the impact of melting ice on sea level an exciting new discovery has been made .
Using Autosub ( an autonomous underwater vehicle ) to dive deep and travel far beneath the pine Island Glacier 's floating ice shelf , scientists captured ocean and sea - floor measurements , which revealed a 300 m high ridge ( mountain ) on the sea floor .
Pine Island Glacier was once grounded on ( sitting on top of ) this underwater ridge , which slowed its flow into the sea .
However , in recent decades it has thinned and disconnected from the ridge , allowing the glacier to move ice more rapidly from the land into the sea .
This also permitted deep warm ocean water to flow over the ridge and into a widening cavity that now extends to an area of 1000 km² under the ice shelf .
The warm water , trapped under the ice , is causing the bottom of the ice shelf to melt , resulting in continuous thinning and acceleration of the glacier .
Lead author Dr Adrian Jenkins of British Antarctic Survey said , " The discovery of the ridge has raised new questions about whether the current loss of ice from Pine Island Glacier is caused by recent climate change or is a continuation of a longer - term process that began when the glacier disconnected from the ridge .
" We do not know what kick - started the initial retreat from the ridge , but we do know that it started some time prior to 1970 .
Since detailed observations of Pine Island Glacier only began in the 1990s , we now need to use other techniques such as ice core analysis and computer modelling to look much further into the glacier 's history in order to understand if what we see now is part of a long term trend of ice sheet contraction .
This work is vital for evaluating the risk of potential wide - spread collapse of West Antarctic glaciers . "
Co-author Stan Jacobs adds : " Since our first measurements in the Amundsen Sea , estimates of Antarctica 's recent contributions to sea level rise have changed from near - zero to significant and increasing .
Now finding that the PIG 's grounding line has recently retreated more than 30 km from a shallow ridge into deeper water , where it is pursued by a warming ocean , only adds to our concern that this region is indeed the ' weak underbelly ' of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet .
Increased melting of continental ice also appears to be the primary cause of persistent ocean freshening and other impacts , both locally and downstream in the Ross Sea . "
There is only a hint of a smile on Bradley ’s face in the United States team media guide .
His countenance is made more severe by a balding pate and an often furrowed look , as if he is squinting into a bright light or being asked a question whose premise he disagrees with .
But Bradley can also be funny and self - deprecating when he lets down his guard .
Asked to describe his days at Princeton , from which he graduated with a history degree in 1980 , he said simply , “ Not a good student ; decent player . ”
If he crammed for exams as an undergrad , Bradley ’s coaching method is one of full immersion .
“ He has a DVD player taped to his forehead , ” defender Jay DeMerit said , laughing .
Bradley has exhaustively studied the world ’s best club teams  Barcelona of today , A.C. Milan of the late 1980s and early ’90s  and from this dogged research , his own style has emerged , built on the belief that the toughest teams to beat are the ones that remain the most organized , compact and disciplined .
Ones that move collectively forward and backward and side to side .
That take advantage of the little moments , when possession is won or lost , when hustle can create an opportunity and sloth can puncture a team ’s invulnerability .
By his count , Bradley still keeps boxes of videotapes of the A.C. Milan teams that won European titles in 1989 and ’90 while coached by Arrigo Sacchi .
Occasionally , midfielder Stuart Holden said , Bradley still shows them to his players .
Meanwhile , his intense research of the Americans ’ World Cup opponents  England , Slovenia and Algeria  led him to watch as many as 50 matches a week .

“ We ’ve never been better prepared , ” midfielder Landon Donovan said .
Apparently no detail is too small to overlook .
At a news conference the day before the United States faced the Czech Republic in an exhibition on May 25 in East Hartford , Conn. , Donovan went to take a seat on the dais when Bradley instructed him to sit to his right .
Bocanegra was positioned to his left .

I 'll try and post some of my new " hair style " soon !
The White House has announced a new initiative aimed at bringing the federal government into the online identity space in a major way .
Via a post on the White House blog , the administration has announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace ( NSTIC ) .
The blog post has a link to a new Department of Homeland Security - hosted site for the initiative , which has already been seeded with suggestions that can be ranked via Reddit - style voting .
The site also contains a link to an initial draft [ PDF ] of the strategy , and DHS is encouraging interested parties to submit comments on the draft .
The basic idea behind the proposal is the creation of a trusted " Identity Ecosystem , " where users , businesses , and the government can voluntarily carry out transactions secure in the knowledge that everyone is who they say they are , and where users do n't have to give up any more information than is necessary to complete a transaction .
Or , as the draft document puts it , it 's " an online environment where individuals , organizations , services , and devices can trust one another through proper identification and authentication . "
The draft takes pains to steer clear of any notion that this will be a form of a federally mandated national ID card — the voluntary nature of participation in the ecosystem is stressed repeatedly throughout .
It 's also the case that the plan envisions multiple private - sector ID providers , each of which can issue credentials to users ( or institutions , or devices , or any other entity that needs an ID ) and all of which are linked at the highest level via a federated service that 's managed by the government .
The idea here is that if I get my credentials from , say , Google , and you get yours from Facebook , we should both be able to use those same credentials to buy from Amazon .
As long as you 've been validated by one of the approved ID providers , you should be able move about the ecosystem freely .
The notion that users should have control over how much information is revealed in a transaction plays a big role in the document .
The example that the DHS draft proposal gives is a movie theater ticket clerk , who looks at a driver 's license to see if a ticket buyer is old enough to purchase a ticket to an R - rated movie .
The license contains the necessary birthdate information , but it also has a lot of other info that the ticket clerk does n't need access to , like a home address and license number .
The Identity Ecosystem would let users give up only the info that is required by the other party in the transaction , and nothing more .
The draft document has a number of small inset boxes under the repeated heading " Envision It ! " (! ) , where hypothetical scenarios enabled by the plan are described .
For instance , the first one reads :
An individual voluntarily requests a smart identity card from her home state .
The individual chooses to use the card to authenticate herself for a variety of online services , including : Credit card purchases ,
Online banking ,
Accessing electronic health care records ,
Securely accessing her personal laptop computer ,
Anonymously posting blog entries , and
Logging onto Internet e-mail services using a pseudonym .
Few privacy advocates are likely to get excited when envisioning the above scenario , despite the voluntary nature of participation .
These identity services are often subject to serious " mission creep " — just think about the number of mandatory uses that every corner of the public and private sectors have found for the Social Security Number , a number that is , on paper at least , merely a way to track payments and benefits for a very specific government program .
Given what has happened with the SSN , it 's not at all hard to imagine that a voluntary state ID would quickly morph into a mandatory state ID , unless of course you withdraw from the web of modern commerce .
Along with the potential privacy concerns that such an ID might raise ( more on this topic , below ) , there 's also the possibility that a single sign - on for multiple services will make our identities less secure .
Either it will be possible to steal my credentials and impersonate me throughout the entire ecosystem , or there will have to be some kind of rock - solid biometric component to authentication .
Anonymous blog posting ?
Perhaps ironically , the proposal expects that people will use the Identity Ecosystem to post to blogs anonymously ; in this respect the draft 's authors are clearly cognizant of the free speech implications of online anonymity .
Such anonymous posting would work because there 's a third party between the anonymous user and the blog provider who can vouch that the user is legit , and can perhaps even transmit payment for blog hosting and related services on behalf of the user .
The problem , of course , is that for people who are serious about online anonymity , the only kind that counts is when nobody knows who 's behind the blog post or the Wikileaks upload .
Given the fact that every single US - based service provider , from telcos to wireless carriers to Google and Amazon , will give you up to the authorities when they come knocking , the only thing the NSTIC approach changes is the number of addresses to which the subpoena or national security letter is mailed .
Instead of contacting your ISP to track you down , the government will also have to contact your ID provider in order to get your full identity .
But while no government - backed identification system could ever be expected to provide users with strong anonymity of the kind that will protect you from the government itself , more limited degrees of anonymity are still useful .
While you 'd want to stay far away from any products of NSTIC if you 're anonymously posting videos of the police to your blog , if your aim is to anonymously blog about something like living with HIV , then NSTIC will probably work .
Barium sulfate suspension , often simply called barium , is a contrast agent used during X - rays .
[ 1 ]
Specifically it is used to improve visualization of the gastrointestinal tract ( esophagus , stomach , intestines ) on plain X - ray or computed tomography .
[ 2 ]
It is taken by mouth or used rectally . [ 3 ]
Side effects include constipation , diarrhea , appendicitis , and if inhaled inflammation of the lungs .
[ 2 ]
It is not recommended in people with intestinal perforation or bowel obstruction .
[ 2 ]
Allergic reactions are rare .
[ 1 ]
The use of barium during pregnancy is safe for the baby ; however , X - rays may result in harm . [ 4 ]
Barium sulfate suspension is typically made by mixing barium sulfate powder with water .
[ 1]
It is a non-iodinated contrast media . [ 5 ]
Barium sulfate has been known since the Middle Ages . [ 6 ]
In the United States it had come into common medical use by 1910 .
[ 7 ]
It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines . [ 8 ]
Some versions contain flavors to try to make it taste better . [ 1 ]
Medical uses [ edit ]
Barium sulfate suspensions are provided by a radiologist or radiographer in advance of , or during a CT scan or fluoroscopic study to allow for better visualization of the gastrointestinal tract , such as in upper or lower gastrointestinal series .
In upper gastrointestinal series , the patient is instructed to take nothing by mouth , which means to abstain from eating and drinking ( fasting ) , with the exception of drinking the barium sulfate suspension .
The amount of time for this fast may vary , depending on the instructions given by the imaging facility and the area of the body to be scanned , but generally lasts for several hours prior to the scan .
The patient generally skips one meal , along with abstaining from all liquids , clear or otherwise , during this time .
Consumption of the barium sulfate suspension begins 90 minutes to two hours prior to the CT / Fluoroscopic scan , as instructed in the patient education provided .
For a Barium Swallow or Dysphagiagram the barium is consumed after the study begins to discern if the patient has difficulties swallowing or masticating .
Consumption is paced , beginning two hours before the scan is to occur , with levels marked on the provided container indicating how much is to be consumed between each of the two hours prior to the test .
A small portion of the suspension is reserved for the minutes just before the test , to ensure that as much of the gastrointestinal tract as possible is coated .
After the scan is complete , the patient is encouraged to eat and drink normally , with special attention to plenty of fluids .
The barium sulfate is excreted through defecation , so extra fluid intake helps prevent constipation , which is a possible side effect ( see Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library for an example of a possible patient education instruction sheet ) . [ 9 ]
Side effects [ edit ]
Some patients with allergies or sensitive stomachs may choose to discuss alternatives to the barium sulfate suspension with their radiologist , but most patients find the common side effects more of an annoyance than a serious problem .
Among the possible side effects , listed on MedlinePlus are nausea and diarrhea , which may begin as soon as 15 minutes after consumption begins and may persist through the day after the test is completed .
Other side effects may include a feeling of weakness , pale skin , ringing in the ears , constipation , and vomiting . [ 10 ]
Patients may be strongly encouraged to avoid vomiting , as expelling a substantial quantity of the suspension may void its effect on the CT scan and produce unusable results , requiring a retest .
As with most medications , if any severe side effects are experienced the patient is encouraged to contact their doctor or local poison control center immediately .
Taste and texture [ edit ]
Oral barium sulfate suspensions are sometimes described as having the consistency of a very thick glass of milk , or a very thin milkshake . [ 11 ]
Some patients may experience the texture as a chalky liquid , similar to calcium carbonate containing liquid antacids and with a slight medicinal taste .
Dr. Roscoe Miller , in his article , " Flavoring Barium Sulfate " , noted that taste thresholds vary per person , [ 12 ] and patient toleration of the medicine also varies .
The suspension is typically homogeneous , smooth , and white in color .
When the suspension is stored at room temperature ( some labels suggest 25 °C ) , " warm , thick milk " is a common description of the general weight and consistency of the drink .
If the test requires the suspension to travel quickly through upper gastrointestinal tract it may be given chilled . [ 13 ]
Many preparations of barium sulfate have added flavors to make them easier to tolerate .
In general , the flavor is considered unpleasant , and is dependent on the exact makeup of the drink . [ 14 ]
Artificial flavors vary per preparation , and include vanilla , banana , pineapple , lemon , and cherry , among others .
Because of the ease of the actual test , the paced two - hour consumption of the barium sulfate suspension is often considered the worst part of a CT scan .

The photographer holds an iPhone at a shop of German telecommunications provider Deutsche Telekom on Feb. 23 in Berlin .
AT&T , wireless provider for Apple 's iPhone , on Monday will become the first major mobile phone company to stop offering new smartphone customers a single monthly price for unlimited Internet access — likely presaging an industry shift to charges based on how much people use their phones to access videos , music and data .
AT&T expects the new pricing to boost sales .
" Some customers , up until now , have been hesitant to sign up for a $ 30 monthly data plan " for unlimited access , says Ralph de la Vega , CEO of AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets .
Existing customers can switch to the new pricing or keep their current all - you - can - eat service .
Newcomers will have two options :
Under the DataPlus plan , subscribers can pay $ 15 a month for 200 megabytes of data ; that would handle about 400 photos or 100 minutes of streaming video .
The DataPro plan offers 10 times that capacity , 2 gigabytes , for $ 25 .
AT&T will send text alerts to customers near their limits .
DataPlus customers who go over will be charged $ 15 for an additional 200 MB .
DataPro users will pay $ 10 for an extra 1 GB .
AT&T says 65 % of its smartphone customers use less than 200 MB a month , and 98 % use less than 2 GB .
But , largely due to the success of the iPhone , AT&T " has the most loaded and most used data network in the U.S. , " says Roger Entner , head of telecom research at Nielsen .
And just 3 % of AT&T 's smartphone customers account for as much as 40 % of its data traffic , contributing to slow transmissions and dropped calls .
AT&T must control heavy users , or at least get them to pay more , Entner says .
With the limited airwave spectrum available for wireless broadband , he adds , it 's just a matter of time before other providers — including Verizon , Sprint and T - Mobile — switch to usage - based pricing .
Verizon Wireless CEO
Lowell McAdam said last week that it would " make sense " to have such pricing later this year when his company introduces a speedy 4G service .
Apple 's new iPad tablet also uses AT&T 's wireless service .
The new pricing will offer those customers 2 GB for $ 25 a month ; current customers can keep their unlimited service offer for $ 29.99 a month .
IPhone customers who pay an extra $ 20 a month soon will be able to use the phones to provide Internet connections for laptops or other devices .
That process , called tethering , will be available on 3G iPhones this summer when Apple releases a new operating system , AT&T says .

A church - league basketball coach has been accused of trying to pay a $ 2,500 bribe to two basketball officials to throw games , state police said .
Michael Kman , 45 , of Enola , is the coach for Our Lady of Lourdes team in the Harrisburg CYO youth league .
Kman is accused of sending several text messages to two basketball officials , asking them to officiate specific games and offered $ 2,500 per game to fix certain games , police said .
He has been charged with solicitation to rig a public contest and harassment .
“ I would just keep it to myself and tell only people that were really , really close to me , ” Cindy Nguyen said after class .
“ We want to have our personal , private space . ”
That blurred line between public and private space is what Common Sense tries to address .
“ That sense of invulnerability that high school students tend to have , thinking they can control everything , before the Internet there may have been some truth to that , ” said Ted Brodheim , chief information officer for the New York City Department of Education .
“ I do n’t think they fully grasp that when they make some of these decisions , it ’s not something they can pull back from . ”
Common Sense bases all its case studies on real life , and insists on the students ’ participation .
“ If you just stand up and deliver a lecture on intellectual property , it has no meaning for the kids , ” said Constance M. Yowell , director of education for the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , which has provided financing .
But some media experts say that in focusing on social issues , Common Sense misses some of the larger , structural problems facing children online .
“ We ca n’t make the awareness of Web issues solely person - and relationship - centered , ” said Joseph Turow , a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania .
Children should learn things like what a cookie or a Web virus is , and how corporations profit from tracking consumers online , he said .
In San Francisco , the Schools of the Sacred Heart , related boys ’ and girls ’ schools , met with parents earlier this year to discuss their Common Sense pilot program with Sister Anne Wachter , the head of the girls ’ school .
“ The messes they get into with friends , or jumping onto someone ’s site and sending a message , ” she said .
“ They do n’t know , sometimes , how to manage the social , emotional stuff that comes up . ”
O Departamento de Doenças Sexualmente Transmitíveis , Aids e Hepatites Virais do Ministério da Saúde liberou uma nota técnica sobre a possibilidade de resultados falso - positivos em testes imunoenzimáticos para HIV entre pessoas que receberam a vacina contra o vírus da gripe suína .
» Siga o Terra no Twitter
Conforme o departamento , devido à forma acelerada de produção industrial da vacina contra o vírus H1N1 , não há no momento dados disponíveis sobre todos os efeitos colaterais , porém foi observado que pessoas que tomaram a vacina , ao fazer o teste de HIV - 1 apresentaram falsos positivo , ou seja , os resultados indicaram que o vírus da aids está presente , quando , na verdade , não está .
De acordo com o Ministério da Saúde , isso ocorre porque , ao tomar a vacina , o corpo começa a produzir anticorpos Imunoglobina M ( IgM ) , primeira defesa do organismo contra infecções .
Nesse processo , a presença de anticorpos dirigidos a outros agentes infecciosos que podem ser similares ao HIV , produziriam resultados falso positivo nos exames .
Segundo a orientação do departamento de DSTs , em caso de teste positivo , é recomendada a realização de uma verificação o resultado .
O segundo exame não deve ser reagente em caso de reação cruzada com anticorpos produzidos em resposta à vacina contra o vírus da gripe suína .
Ainda assim , o resultado negativo nestes testes não descarta a infecção pelo HIV , já que o paciente pode estar no estado de soro conversão , ou outra enfermidade que interfira nos resultados .
O Ministério da Saúde recomendou que os profissionais responsáveis pelo diagnóstico do HIV - 1 devem informar aos pacientes que receberam a vacina da gripe suína sobre a possibilidade de resultado falso positivo nos testes .
Caso necessário , também devem convocar os pacientes para a realização de nova coleta após 30 dias , até que o diagnóstico seja definitivo .

If digital artist Alex Varanese had a time machine , he'd go back to 1977 with a suitcase full of modern electronics and make zillions .
Plus , the cheeky print campaign for Varanese 's wood - paneled laptops and cellphones guarantees consumers that he 's not a time - traveler !
Varanese 's series — ALT / 1977 : WE ARE NOT TIME TRAVELERS — is an experiment in totally unethical , cross-chronal entrepreneurship .
Here 's Varanese 's rationale for shanghaiing these devices back to the past :
What would you do if you could travel back in time ? [.... I'd ] grab all the modern technology I could find , take it to the late 70's , superficially redesign it all to blend in , start a consumer electronics company to unleash it upon the world , then sit back as I rake in billions , trillions , or even millions of dollars .
I 've explored that idea in this series by re-imagining four common products from 2010 as if they were designed in 1977 : an mp3 player , a laptop , a mobile phone and a handheld video game system .
I then created a series of fictitious but stylistically accurate print ads to market them , as well as a handful of abstract posters ( you know , just for funsies ) .

If I had a time machine , I 'd do the exact same thing , but bring back slightly more outmoded technology to punish the past for screwing up the present .
I 'd be like , " Hey past !
Here 's a garbage bag full of Laserdiscs , Virtual Boys , and Zunes !
This is what you get for being so backwards . "

For years , Cathie Adams has been the President of the Texas affiliate of Phyllis Schlafly ’s Eagle Forum , until she was elected Chair of the state Republican Party last year .
So I guess it should come as no surprise that Gov. Rick Perry would attend a Texas Eagle Forum event at which Don McLeroy received a “ Patriot Award ” for his efforts to remake the state ’s textbooks and curriculum … or that Perry would use his appearance to demand to know whether voters worship government or God :
Gov. Rick Perry painted the upcoming election as a religious crusade to take back the soul of the country during a Thursday night speech to the conservative Texas Eagle Forum .
While Perry has invoked God and country before , his 14 - minute speech to the 500 gathered , most of them delegates to the Texas Republican state convention , was stronger and more strident than previously .
“ We will raise our voices in defense of our values and in defiance of the hollow precepts and shameful self - interests that guide our opponents on the left , ” Perry said to the receptive audience .
He said the November election is bigger than “ red states and blue states , conservatives or liberals , stimulus or budget cuts . ”
“ We are in a struggle for the heart and soul of our nation , ” Perry said .
“ That ’s the question : Who do you worship ?
Do you believe in the primacy of unrestrained federal government ?
Or do you worship the God of the universe , placing our trust in him ? ”
…
Featured at the event was national Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly , who said she is heartened by shifts in public attitudes .
She cited the diminished influence of big media , the majority of Americans considering themselves conservatives and anti-abortion , and the overall pervasive feeling that come November , “ conservatives know they can win . ”
The group presented its Patriot Award to State Board of Education leader Don McLeroy , who led the board for the past two years as it tackled curriculum standards for English , science and social studies .
A GLOBAL library movement , which gives visitors the chance to borrow people rather than books , is set to take place at Dudley Library .
The St James 's Road library will be hosting the ' Human Library ' event on Saturday , allowing readers to take out a ' living book ' from a varied catalogue of choices .
The movement , which first began in Denmark in 2000 , will see ten everyday borough residents become a book for the day .
Visitors will be able to browse through the living book catalogue in advance of event and reserve the book of their choice .
The borrower will then be able to return to the library on Saturday afternoon , when they will be able to spend half an hour talking to their chosen living book .
Many of the living books are people who have overcome challenges or have led fascinating lives and members of the public will be able to talk to them about the extraordinary journeys they have been on .
The living books include a pensioner who grew up in Gornal during the war years and is now a very active resident in their community and a young person who left school with no qualifications , but is now inspiring others to achieve in education .
Other volunteers who will be sharing their tales during the event , include the Mayor of Dudley , cllr Peter Miller and an Asian woman who set up a group to empower other women .
Councillor David Simms , cabinet member for housing , libraries and adult learning , said : “ We ’re really pleased that local people are willing to give up their time to take part in this project at the library , I hope it will go a long way in breaking down stereotypes within the community and lead to further events like this in the future . ”
For more information and to reserve a Living Book in advance , contact Dudley Library on 01384 815560 between 9 am to 7 pm .

Since the market collapsed back in 2008 we 've seen the real estate market take a nosedive .
People who bought at the height of the market ( assuming that real estate would always appreciate ) found themselves in a situation where their homes had dropped significantly in value .
My wife and I are a part of the group who have taken a significant hit , our home value has dropped by over $ 40,000 .
Many people , especially those who bought homes without a down payment , or with a sub - prime loan are now finding that they also owe more on the home than it is currently worth .
According to a report by First American Core Logic , a real - estate data firm , more than 11 million families are in “ negative equity ” , that is , they owe more on their home than it is worth .

Thankfully we are n't underwater , but what about those people who are ?
What are they to do ?
A growing group of people are saying that for most of those people it would make complete sense to just walk away from their mortgage , stop paying , and take the credit score impact of a foreclosure .
They call it a “ strategic default “ .
My question is this .
Is it OK to walk away from your mortgage if you have the money to pay , just because you 're underwater and have negative equity ?
Credit Score Impact Of Foreclosure
There are a lot of things to consider when you 're thinking about walking away from your home .
First of all , you need to consider the financial impact of walking away from your mortgage .
One of the most obvious impacts a foreclosure will have on your financial life is on your credit score .
Now , I 'm not one of those people who will tell you to constantly check your credit score and rely on it for everything , but the fact is that it does play a part in a lot of things these days , so you can't completely ignore it .
So what impact does a foreclosure or delinquent payment have on your credit ?
Fair Isaac pulled back the curtain a bit and revealed a little bit about what kind of a credit score impact those things might have :
30 days late : 40 – 110 points
90 days late : 70 – 135 points
Foreclosure , short sale or deed - in - lieu : 85 – 160
Bankruptcy : 130 – 240
So having a late payment , a short sale , foreclosure or bankruptcy can have a pretty significant impact on your credit score , and mean you 'll have to improve credit score later .
In any of those situations it is going to show up on your account and have pretty negative impact .
What does a lower FICO score potentially mean ?
Absorbing a big credit - score hit can make many transactions more costly .
It 's not just paying more for credit card debt and auto loans , insurance can cost more as well .
The average savings for someone with a good versus mediocre credit score is about $ 115 a year for auto insurance and $ 60 for home , according to Loretta Sorters , of the Insurance Information Institute .
A low credit score can even make it harder to rent a home because landlords often use credit scores to weed out prospective renters .
So having a foreclosure , short sale or even late payments can mean you 'll end up paying more for a variety of things .
Definitely a huge impact to consider when you 're thinking about walking away .
Moral Dilemma Or Just A Contractual Transaction ?
While walking away from your mortgage will obviously have a negative financial impact , especially as it relates to your credit score , this still is n't enough for many people to not consider it .
There are still those who are just having a hard time making ends meet , and while they can still make the payments , they would prefer to just walk away from the hefty mortgage on their underwater home , because they do n't want to lose upwards of $ 50 - 100,000 ( or more ) on their home value .
Why take the hit when the bank can better absorb the blow ?
It does seem to make sense on the surface , but now we need to ask the question , is backing out of a mortgage contract an OK thing for a homeowner to do , or is it morally wrong to back out of a contract you are still able to fulfill ?
Personally I tend to come down on the side of paying your obligations if you 're able .
I like to think that a contract is something you live up to .
You knew the terms of the deal when you signed up , and now you should live up to it if you can .
We need to be responsible for the obligations that we 've made .
Others would counter that a strategic default is a legitimate option that is even spelled out in the mortgage contract , where specific ramifications of a foreclosure or short sale are spelled out for the homeowner .
To exercise those options is just a a part of the legal transaction .
I understand that argument , but do n't agree with it .
Just because the ramifications of missing payments or defaulting are spelled out in a contract , does n't mean it is an acceptable or desirable thing to do .
Also , there is nothing in the mortgage agreement that makes your continued payment contingent upon the value of the home going up !
It is a risk that you take !
What do you think ?
Should morality come into play when making a decision about a strategic default ?
Is it just a contractual transaction , and should we not feel bad about defaulting or going into foreclosure ?
Tell us what you think in the comments !

The bash man page has long had the following bug listed : " It 's too big and too slow " ( at the very bottom of the man page ) .
If you agree with that , then you probably wo n't want to read about the " new " associative arrays that were added in version 4.0 of bash .
On the other hand , if you 've ever used any modern Office Suite and seen code - bloat at its finest and just think the bash folks are exaggerating a bit , then read on .
There 's nothing too surprising about associative arrays in bash , they are as you probably expect :
declare - A aa aa [ hello ] = world aa [ ab ]= cd
The - A option declares aa to be an associative array .
Assignments are then made by putting the " key " inside the square brackets rather than an array index .
You can also assign multiple items at once :
declare - A aa aa =([ hello ] = world [ ab ] = cd )
Retrieving values is also as expected :
if [ [ $ { aa [ hello ] } == world ] ] ; then echo equal fi bb = $ { aa [ hello ] }
You can also use keys that contain spaces or other " strange " characters :
aa [ " hello world " ]= " from bash "
Note however that there appears to be a bug when assigning more than one item to an array with a parenthesis enclosed list if any of the keys have spaces in them .
For example , consider the following script :
declare - A b b = ([ hello ] = world [ " a b " ]= " c d " ) for i in 1 2 do if [ [ $ { b [ " a b " ] } == " c d " ] ] ; then echo $ i : equals c d else echo $ i : does not equal c d fi b [ " a b " ]= " c d " done
At the top , b [ " a b " ] is assigned a value as part of a parenthesis enclosed list of items .
Inside the loop the if statement tests to see if the item is what we expect it to be .
At the bottom of the loop the same value is assigned to the same key but using a " direct " assignment .
Then the loop executes one more time .
One would expect that the if test would succeed both times , however it does not :
$ bash ba.sh 1 : does not equal c d 2 : equals c d
You can see the problem if you add the following to the end of the script to print out all the keys :
for k in " $ {! b[ @ ] } " do echo " $ k " done
The result you get is :
$ bash ba.sh 1 : does not equal c d 2 : equals c d a \ b a b hello
You can see here that the first assignment , the one done via the list incorrectly adds the key as a\ b rather than simply as a b .
Before ending I want to point out another feature that I just recently discovered about bash arrays : the ability to extend them with the += operator .
This is actually the thing that lead me to the man page which then allowed me to discover the associative array feature .
This is not a new feature , just new to me :
aa =( hello world ) aa+ =( b c d )
After the += assignment the array will now contain 5 items , the values after the += having been appended to the end of the array .
This also works with associative arrays .
aa =([ hello ] = world ) aa+ =( [ b ] = c ) # aa now contains 2 items
Note also that the += operator also works with regular variables and appends to the end of the current value .
aa = " hello " aa+ = " world " # aa is now " hello world "
For more on using bash arrays look at the man page or check out my earlier post .
Julian Assange , the Australian founder of the whistleblower website Wikileaks , says he had his passport taken away from him at Melbourne Airport and was later told by customs officials that it was about to be cancelled .
Last year Wikileaks published a confidential Australian blacklist of websites to be banned under the government 's proposed internet filter .
Australian - born Julian Assange
The Age has been told that Assange 's passport is classified '' normal ' ' on the immigration database , meaning the Wikileaks director can travel freely on it .
Assange told The Age his passport was taken from him by customs officials at Melbourne Airport when he entered the country last week after he was told '' it was looking worn ' ' .

One of the driving forces behind the development of Virtual Memory ( VM ) was to reduce the programming burden associated with fitting programs into limited memory .
A fundamental property of VM is that the CPU references a virtual address that is translated via a combination of software and hardware to a physical address .
This allows information only to be paged into memory on demand ( demand paging ) improving memory utilisation , allows modules to be arbitrary placed in memory for linking at run-time and provides a mechanism for the protection and controlled sharing of data between processes .
Use of virtual memory is so pervasive that it has been described as an one of the engineering triumphs of the computer age [ denning96 ] but this indirection is not without cost .
Typically , the total number of translations required by a program during its lifetime will require that the page tables are stored in main memory .
Due to translation , a virtual memory reference necessitates multiple accesses to physical memory , multiplying the cost of an ordinary memory reference by a factor depending on the page table format .
To cut the costs associated with translation , VM implementations take advantage of the principal of locality [ denning71 ] by storing recent translations in a cache called the Translation Lookaside Buffer ( TLB ) [ casep78 , smith82,henessny90 ] .
The amount of memory that can be translated by this cache is referred to as the " TLB reach " and depends on the size of the page and the number of TLB entries .
Inevitably , a percentage of a program 's execution time is spent accessing the TLB and servicing TLB misses .
The amount of time spent translating addresses depends on the workload as the access pattern determines if the TLB reach is sufficient to store all translations needed by the application .
On a miss , the exact cost depends on whether the information necessary to translate the address is in the CPU cache or not .
To work out the amount of time spent servicing the TLB misses , there are some simple formulas :
Cycles tlbhit = TLBHitRate * TLBHitPenalty Cycles tlbmiss_cache = TLBMissRate cache * TLBMissPenalty cache Cycles tlbmiss_full = TLBMissRate full * TLBMissPenalty full TLBMissCycles = Cycles tlbmiss_cache + Cycles_ tlbmiss_full TLBMissTime = ( TLB Miss Cycles ) / ( Clock rate )
If the TLB miss time is a large percentage of overall program execution , then the time should be invested to reduce the miss rate and achieve better performance .
One means of achieving this is to translate addresses in larger units than the base page size , as supported by many modern processors .
Using more than one page size was identified in the 1990s as one means of reducing the time spent servicing TLB misses by increasing TLB reach .
The benefits of huge pages are twofold .
The obvious performance gain is from fewer translations requiring fewer cycles .
A less obvious benefit is that address translation information is typically stored in the L2 cache .
With huge pages , more cache space is available for application data , which means that fewer cycles are spent accessing main memory .
Broadly speaking , database workloads will gain about 2 - 7 % performance using huge pages whereas scientific workloads can range between 1 % and 45 % .
Huge pages are not a universal gain , so transparent support for huge pages is limited in mainstream operating systems .
On some TLB implementations , there may be different numbers of entries for small and huge pages .
If the CPU supports a smaller number of TLB entries for huge pages , it is possible that huge pages will be slower if the workload reference pattern is very sparse and making a small number of references per-huge - page .
There may also be architectural limitations on where in the virtual address space huge pages can be used .
Many modern operating systems , including Linux , support huge pages in a more explicit fashion , although this does not necessarily mandate application change .
Linux has had support for huge pages since around 2003 where it was mainly used for large shared memory segments in database servers such as Oracle and DB2 .
Early support required application modification , which was considered by some to be a major problem .
To compound the difficulties , tuning a Linux system to use huge pages was perceived to be a difficult task .
There have been significant improvements made over the years to huge page support in Linux and as this article will show , using huge pages today can be a relatively painless exercise that involves no source modification .
This first article begins by installing some huge - page - related utilities and support libraries that make tuning and using huge pages a relatively painless exercise .
It then covers the basics of how huge pages behave under Linux and some details of concern on NUMA .
The second article covers the different interfaces to huge pages that exist in Linux .
In the third article , the different considerations to make when tuning the system are examined as well as how to monitor huge - page - related activities in the system .
The fourth article shows how easily benchmarks for different types of application can use huge pages without source modification .
For the very curious , some in - depth details on TLBs and measuring the cost within an application are discussed before concluding .
1 Huge Page Utilities and Support Libraries
There are a number of support utilities and a library packaged collectively as libhugetlbfs .
Distributions may have packages , but this article assumes that libhugetlbfs 2.7 is installed .
The latest version can always be cloned from git using the following instructions
$ git clone git://libhugetlbfs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libhugetlbfs/libhugetlbfs
$ cd libhugetlbfs $ git checkout - b next origin / next $ make PREFIX= / usr / local
There is an install target that installs the library and all support utilities but there are install - bin , install - stat and install - man targets available in the event the existing library should be preserved during installation .
The library provides support for automatically backing text , data , heap and shared memory segments with huge pages .
In addition , this package also provides a programming API and manual pages .
The behaviour of the library is controlled by environment variables ( as described in the libhugetlbfs . 7 manual page ) with a launcher utility hugectl that knows how to configure almost all of the variables .
hugeadm , hugeedit and pagesize provide information about the system and provide support to system administration .
tlbmiss_cost.sh automatically calculates the average cost of a TLB miss .
cpupcstat and oprofile_start.sh provide help with monitoring the current behaviour of the system .
Manual pages are available describing in further detail each utility .
2 Huge Page Fault Behaviour
In the following articles , there will be discussions on how different type of memory regions can be created and backed with huge pages .
One important common point between them all is how huge pages are faulted and when the huge pages are allocated .
Further , there are important differences between shared and private mappings depending on the exact kernel version used .
In the initial support for huge pages on Linux , huge pages were faulted at the same time as mmap ( ) was called .
This guaranteed that all references would succeed for shared mappings once mmap ( ) returned successfully .
Private mappings were safe until fork ( ) was called .
Once called , it 's important that the child call exec ( ) as soon as possible or that the huge page mappings were marked MADV_DONTFORK with madvise ( ) in advance .
Otherwise , a Copy - On - Write ( COW ) fault could result in application failure by either parent or child in the event of allocation failure .
Pre-faulting pages drastically increases the cost of mmap ( ) and can perform sub-optimally on NUMA .
Since 2.6.18 , huge pages were faulted the same as normal mappings when the page was first referenced .
To guarantee that faults would succeed , huge pages were reserved at the time the shared mapping is created but private mappings do not make any reservations .
This is unfortunate as it means an application can fail without fork ( ) being called .
libhugetlbfs handles the private mapping problem on old kernels by using readv( ) to make sure the mapping is safe to access , but this approach is less than ideal .
Since 2.6.29 , reservations are made for both shared and private mappings .
Shared mappings are guaranteed to successfully fault regardless of what process accesses the mapping .
For private mappings , the number of child processes is indeterminable so only the process that creates the mapping mmap ( ) is guaranteed to successfully fault .
When that process fork ( ) s , two processes are now accessing the same pages .
If the child performs COW , an attempt will be made to allocate a new page .
If it succeeds , the fault successfully completes .
If the fault fails , the child gets terminated with a message logged to the kernel log noting that there were insufficient huge pages .
If it is the parent process that performs COW , an attempt will also be made to allocate a huge page .
In the event that allocation fails , the child 's pages are unmapped and the event recorded .
The parent successfully completes the fault but if the child accesses the unmapped page , it will be terminated .
3 Huge Pages and Swap
There is no support for the paging of huge pages to backing storage .
4 Huge Pages and NUMA
On NUMA , memory can be local or remote to the CPU , with significant penalty incurred for remote access .
By default , Linux uses a node - local policy for the allocation of memory at page fault time .
This policy applies to both base pages and huge pages .
This leads to an important consideration while implementing a parallel workload .
The thread processing some data should be the same thread that caused the original page fault for that data .
A general anti-pattern on NUMA is when a parent thread sets up and initialises all the workload 's memory areas and then creates threads to process the data .
On a NUMA system this can result in some of the worker threads being on CPUs remote with respect to the memory they will access .
While this applies to all NUMA systems regardless of page size , the effect can be pronounced on systems where the split between worker threads is in the middle of a huge page incurring more remote accesses than might have otherwise occurred .
This scenario may occur for example when using huge pages with OpenMP , because OpenMP does not necessarily divide its data on page boundaries .
This could lead to problems when using base pages , but the problem is more likely with huge pages because a single huge page will cover more data than a base page , thus making it more likely any given huge page covers data to be processed by different threads .
Consider the following scenario .
A first thread to touch a page will fault the full page 's data into memory local to the CPU on which the thread is running .
When the data is not split on huge - page - aligned boundaries , such a thread will fault its data and perhaps also some data that is to be processed by another thread , because the two threads ' data are within the range of the same huge page .
The second thread will fault the rest of its data into local memory , but will still have part of its data accesses be remote .
This problem manifests as large standard deviations in performance when doing multiple runs of the same workload with the same input data .
Profiling in such a case may show there are more cross - node accesses with huge pages than with base pages .
In extreme circumstances , the performance with huge pages may even be slower than with base pages .
For this reason it is important to consider on what boundary data is split when using huge pages on NUMA systems .
One work around for this instance of the general problem is to use MPI in combination with OpenMP .
The use of MPI allows division of the workload with one MPI process per NUMA node .
Each MPI process is bound to the list of CPUs local to a node .
Parallelisation within the node is achieved using OpenMP , thus alleviating the issue of remote access .

In this article , the background to huge pages were introduced , what the performance benefits can be and some basics of how huge pages behave on Linux .
The next article ( to appear in the near future ) discusses the interfaces used to access huge pages .

With the incredible number of amazing places to eat in Portland , the problem with finding a cheap meal is not actually locating cheap food but , rather , narrowing your list so the sheer quantity of choices does not overwhelm you .
Which is where this story starts .
This article began as the five best places for cheap eats .
But , this being Portland , our initial list numbered well into the triple digits .
So we cut food carts from the list ; you do n't need us to tell you where to find a cheap meal at a cart .
We cut happy hour ; that 's more a snack than a meal .
We cut breakfast .
We limited the cost to $ 10 per person .
And we still had more than five contenders .
So we threw the original premise out and decided to list the five tried - and - true places we go to , again and again , when we want something hot and fast and have $ 10 or less in our pockets .
This list is n't inclusive ; it is n't meant to be .
Instead , it is a starting point for when you are broke and hungry and too impatient to narrow down to a manageable few the hundreds of cheap eats Portland offers .
Trust us ; it can't be done .
Pine State Biscuits
The atmosphere at Pine State Biscuits is one of joy .
The cashier cheerily takes your order .
The cooks happily make it .
And the customers delightedly chat and munch and laugh and slurp in this small place filled with big noise .
And why would n't they be happy ?
They are all talking about , making or eating biscuits .
The cheapest , and best , of the biscuit sandwiches is the McIsley ( $ 6 ) .
The McIsley is a fat , Southern - style biscuit , cut in half , slathered with sweet pickles , honey and grainy Dijon mustard , and topped with a piece of white - meat chicken that was dragged through buttermilk , breaded and fried .
The result is a sweet and tangy sandwich that is far more satisfying than you should rightfully expect from a meal built on a solitary biscuit .
The perfect side dish to the McIsley is the Hash Browns ( $ 2.50 ) , which , despite the plural , is actually just one , enormous hash brown .
Crispy brown potato on the outside , creamy golden potato on the inside and seasoned with Old Bay throughout , The Pine Street Biscuit Hash Brown has great flavor and great texture , making this the hash brown all other hash browns yearn to be .

Michael 's Italian Beef & Sausage Co .
Anyone can find a cheap burger .
After all , you can't turn around in this town without tripping across a burger place -- or at least a place that includes burgers on the menu .
But a good hot dog ?
That is a rare find .
Which is where Michael 's comes in .
With its cheery red counter stools , clean white tables and bright pendant lights , Michael 's is exactly what you would expect a hot dog place to be : warm , friendly and not at all complicated .
Except when it comes to toppings .
Before you order a hot dog here , you need to understand your five topping choices .
The pepperoncinis and the raw and sauteed onions are just straightforward pepperoncinis and onions -- no special sauce or cooking technique makes them anything other than what they are .
The two pepper toppings , on the other hand , are a bit more involved .
On one hand , there are the hot peppers .
A marinade of chili peppers , carrots , celery and garlic , they 're actually fairly bland , providing more heat than flavor .
But on the other hand are the craveworthy mild peppers :
Although they are simply sliced bell peppers , they are cooked to a meltingly sweet perfection , making them the topping of choice .
The kosher Chicago Style Frank with The Works ( $ 4.25 ) comes with the usual fixings ( mustard , relish , pickle , raw onions and tomatoes ) on a pillowy white roll .
While you can add any of the toppings you prefer , we ask for the mild peppers because their sweetness is a perfect counterpoint to the meaty frank .
If you are , alas , not a hot dog person , you can get a sandwich at Michael's .
Here 's the trick to keeping it cheap :
Get a half - sandwich .
The best of the seven available is the Chicago - style Italian Sausage ( $ 3.95 / half ) .
Made of ground pork roast , it has a wonderfully crisp skin , comes with beef gravy and peppers and onions , and is served on Italian bread so fresh that chards of crust rain on the table with every bite .
And , as with the hot dog , you get your choice of topping .
Here , too , the mild peppers are perfect .

Thien Hong
When you think cheap food , you think Chinese .
At least , we always do .
Interestingly , however , the food at Thien Hong is n't the cheapest on our list -- at least , not until you factor in the multiple servings ( at least three or four ) you get per dish .
Once you do , the price drops proportionately .
And , based on the number of takeout bags customers leave the place with , we 're not the only ones stretching our one meal into several .
The decor at Thien Hong is a 1980s - style symphony of synthetics :
Walls are decorated with clusters of limp fabric roses alternating with deep green blinds while the floor is crowded with sticky vinyl banquettes set cheek - to - jowl with blindingly glossy tables .
If you are really broke , the cheapest , most filling dish you can order is the BBQ Pork Noodle Soup ( $ 5.75 / small , $ 6.50 / large ) .
Although the broth is fatty and weak , it is satisfyingly hot ; there is an abundance of thick pork slices and long thin noodles ; the green onions and lettuce are fresh and crisp ; and the quantity is so huge that the small size filled four soup bowls , making this a decent lunch for two .
One of the best vegetable dishes on the menu is the Eggplant in Hot Garlic Sauce ( $ 7.75 ) .
Think Chinese eggplant cooked into mushy submission , drenched in a sauce rich with minced garlic and chilies , topped with a scattering of crunchy raw green onions , and served with a large container of slightly gummy white rice .
Together , the dishes are filling and comforting with their soft nursery school texture .
If you can afford it , the one dish you should not leave Thien Hong without trying is the Pepper - salted Squid ( $ 10 ) .
The squid is deep - fried perfection : neither greasy nor limp .
The squid is tender and succulent while the breading is crisp and dry and peppery .
Spooned on top of the squid were crunchy green onion greens and onions , a perfect complement to the sweet fish .
4-10 p.m. Tuesday - Saturday ; 6749 N.E. Sandy Blvd. ; 503-281-1247
Meat Cheese Bread
If you want to eat cheaply at Meat Cheese Bread , you need to think not meat , not cheese , not bread , but lettuce .
Because the cheapest , tastiest lunch is not a sandwich ; it 's a salad .
With only four tables plus a streak of counter space , the bright and inviting Meat Cheese Bread is a small gem on the main street of a predominantly residential neighborhood .
The restaurant feels like the polar opposite of Pine State Biscuits -- somber , quiet , focused -- but the food is equally good .
The star of the menu is the Wedge ( $ 5.50 ) , a riff on a classic 1950s - style salad .
At its base is an enormous wedge of what is undoubtedly one of the least nutritious , but dearly beloved , greens : iceberg lettuce .
This is drenched with a tangy blue cheese dressing heavy with chunks of cheese .
Sprinkled on top is a generous handful of salty bacon pieces .
And , next to this mountainous salad is a single , sliced , soft - boiled egg .
The only off note in this incredible salad are the croutons , which are so fine , they occasionally grit between your teeth .
If you prefer sandwiches , the best deal is the Roasted Mushroom ( $ 6.95 ) .
The thick portobello mushrooms have the texture and satisfaction of meat without its heaviness ; the onions are grilled until they are sweetness itself ; the frisee adds a clean , peppery crunch ; and best of all , the chevre adds a piquant note that marries perfectly with the smoky mushrooms .

Por Que No
This is the place to go when you are so broke you can't even find enough change to make $ 5 or , if you can , you can't decide if you want to spend it on chicken , beef , pork or vegetarian .
The most expensive taco here is an extravagant $ 4 ( and 50 cents less from 3 to 6 p.m. daily and 3 p.m. to closing on Tuesday ) , with most tacos priced at $ 2.75 or $ 3 .
The decor is mismatched chairs and communal tables , red walls and exposed beams , pictures and books and statues and tchotchkes -- with strings of tiny lights hung in what little space is left .
The atmosphere is lively , the sound level is formidable , and the place is so enthusiastically crowded that you can't help bumping elbows and backsides as you make your way to your table .
The most flavorful taco on the menu is the Carne Asada ( $ 3 ) .
Cubes of beef served with a spicy salsa roja ( a garlic , chile , tomatillo sauce ) , grilled onions and a generous handful of cilantro ( generous , as in , do n't order if you do n't truly love cilantro ) -- and served with an eighth of a lime that they should ( but do not ) insist you squirt onto your taco , because the zip of the lime juice brightens and enhances the flavor of your food -- it makes up in taste what it lacks in size .
Now , the tacos are so cheap that you can surely afford ( and likely want ) another .
A good second choice is the Calamari ( $ 3.50 ) .
The squid , sauteed with a chili seasoning , is cooked until tender , not chewy .
It 's topped with salsa roja and a palate - cleaning mix of diced tomatoes and green peppers , and finished with crema , a Mexican version of creme fra
FRANCE is drawing up a law to ban the full - face Islamic veil from all public spaces , despite a warning from experts that it could face a legal challenge .
Government spokesman Luc Chatel said the bill would be presented to ministers next month and would go beyond a mere ban on women wearing the niqab and the burqa while dealing with French officials .
" We 're legislating for the future .
Wearing a full veil is a sign of a community closing in on itself and a rejection of our values , " he said .
Last month , the State Council - France 's top administrative authority - warned President Nicolas Sarkozy against a full ban on the veil , suggesting instead an order that women uncover their faces for identity checks or for state business .
But there remains broad support in parliament for a full ban and the Government is determined to press on with legislation , which it says would affect only around 2000 Muslim French women who cover their faces .
Haim Saban spoke with an Israeli TV interviewer ( Channel 10 ) about the Obama administration .
From Coteret .
Note the Arabic he uses , on Nakba memorial week :
Saban :
The situation is a disaster [ the word used was the Arabic Harta , which has a coarser connotation ] , if you want me to put it in simple words .
[ Correspondent Gil ] Tamari :
He compares the relations with Obama to the difficult years Israel had with George Bush Sr .
Saban :
We had the days with Bush Sr. , with Shamir .
We got over it and moved on and we had 16 great years with Clinton and then with Bush , and this too shall pass .
Look , I do n’t think Obama is anti-Israeli , like people think he is .
His goal is to achieve peace , just like our goal is to achieve peace .
The way he wants to do it may not be the way some people in Israel would like it , and especially the members of the right .
Tamari : Saban , who donated millions to the Clintons as well , is not at all happy with what he sees .
Did you have a chance to talk about this with Hillary ?
Saban : I had the chance to talk to Hillary about a lot of things including this and I also talked to Rahm Emanuel and Rahm Emanuel for instance told me ‘ I am more hawkish than 50 percent of the people in Israel . ’
I do n’t know where he got that survey but that is what he said .
They are not anti-Israelis .
Look , they are from the left .
The left , left of which there is not much space to the wall , I agree , and this is their ideology .

If your media has become obsolete , it might be an inconvenience in your life -- but at worst , you 've probably only lost the ability to watch your copy of ( hey , I wo n't judge ) .
In the world of science , though , obsolete media can sometimes mean the loss of irreplaceable data .
That 's a problem NASA has run into in the past .
In the mid-1960s , it stored information from five lunar orbiter missions onto miles of analog tape , which was state - of - the - art for the time , but pretty quaint by today 's standards .
Still , even with woefully underpowered computers , they were able to create detailed maps of the lunar surface , and pinpoint exact landing sites for the upcoming Apollo 11 mission .
When that mission was over , though , the tapes were largely forgotten .
They collected dust in an archive for more than 40 years , and the refrigerator - sized machines that could read them were slowly sold off or destroyed .
Today , an engineer named Dennis Wingo is working to resurrect that data .
He co-leads the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project -- which , as the name implies , is working to pry all that old data off of the tapes .
So far , he 's been successful , thanks to a combination of skill and pure luck .
Wingo 's team located one of the only NASA computer tape drives left in existence , and carefully restored it to its former glory in order to digitize the old tapes onto modern hard drives .
But Wingo 's work is n't just for the sake of nostalgia .
His team 's high - res scans of the Lunar Orbiter images are providing a sort of cosmic time capsule of the Moon 's surface in 1965 .
By comparing the number of craters in those images to the number of craters there today , Wingo says researchers can calculate how many objects -- even tiny ones -- have hit the Moon in the last four decades .
With that information , he says , it 's possible to figure out the risk of micrometeor impacts that future manned missions could face .
( If we end up building a lunar base , he reasons , we 'll want to know exactly what might be falling on it . )
Wingo is also using his data recovery skills on tapes from NASA 's NIMBUS satellites , which recorded the temperature of the Earth 's surface in the mid-60s using infra-red sensors .
In the process , they yielded an extensive data set spanning the entire globe , capturing a snapshot of hurricane season , ocean currents , even the extent of arctic and antarctic ice .
it 's information that could be invaluable for climate change research .
Wingo thinks there 's an important lesson in all this .
Although the march of technology will ( almost ) always move forward , we should n't forget the machines of the past .
Because as NASA 's forgotten tapes have shown , they 've still got some important things to say .
( Above : the iconic " Earthrise " image -- the first ever taken of the Earth from the Moon 's perspective .
The original image as seen in 1966 appears on the bottom ; Dennis Wingo's re-scanned copy is at the top ) .

A female fig wasp descends through the ostiole into the center of the fig plant 's syconium .
See more insect pictures Mark Moffet / Minden Pictures / Getty Images
To really understand the wasp - eating dilemma associated with figs , you have to first look at the closely connected life cycles of both the plant and the insect .
The current mutual relationship between the two did n't happen overnight .
It 's the result of millions of years of evolution .
The fig plant and the fig wasp both have the same goal : reproduction .
For this to happen , a fig plant needs to share its genetic material ( in the form of pollen ) with another of its kind , and the fig wasp needs a place where its larva can grow and feed .
Think of the fig wasp as a tenant , and the fig plant as a landlord who takes payment in the form of pollen .

What we call a fig ( a structure called the syconium ) is more inverted flower than fruit , with all its reproductive parts located inside .
After a female fig wasp flies over from the fig plant she emerged from , she must travel to the center of the syconium to lay her eggs .
To get there , she climbs down through a narrow passage called the ostiole .
The passage is so cramped that the tiny fig wasp loses her wings and antenna during her claustrophobic trek .
Once inside , there 's no getting back out and flying to another plant -- but is she in the right place ?
This content is not compatible on this device .
Fig plants boast two kinds of figs : male caprifigs and female edible figs .
If a female wasp enters a caprifig , she 'll find male flower parts that are perfectly shaped to hold the eggs she 'll eventually lay .
The eggs will grow into larvae , which will develop into male and female wasps .
After hatching , the blind , wingless male wasps will spend the remainder of their lives digging tunnels through the fig .
The female wasps then emerge through these tunnels and fly off to find a new fig -- carrying precious pollen with them .
If a female fig wasp enters an edible fig , she eventually dies from exhaustion or starvation .
The female flower parts include a long stylus that hinders her attempts to lay her eggs .
She may die , but she succeeds in delivering the much - needed pollen first .
So a fig farmer winds up with caprifigs full of wasp eggs and edible figs full of seeds .
Though edible figs may not be filled with baby wasps , does n't this mean that these figs contain a lot of female wasps who died of loneliness ?

The owl and the ( very large ) pussycat
This tiny owl looked like it was about to be eaten for breakfast when it accidentally fell into the lion enclosure at a zoo !
The tawny owl chick tumbled from its nest and hopped right up to Indu , a two - metre- long Asiatic lion .
Zoo visitors raised the alarm , but it was too dangerous for anyone to go into the enclosure to rescue the owl .
The big cat was n't interested in its new feathery friend though , and the owl later flew to safety .
Paignton Zoo keeper Lucy Manning said : " The tawny owls nested in a lime tree in the lion enclosure .
One day the chick just turned up on the ground .
" Indu peered at it for a while ...
I think it was too small to eat . "
Asiatic lions live in India and are really rare , but this time the owl seemed to be the endangered species !

As the World Cup kicks off , many football fans from the UK 's celtic nations say they will support ABE - Anyone But England .
Why does this inflame so much passion on both sides ?
When Fabio Capello's men run out to begin their World Cup campaign in Rustenburg , their shirts gleaming in the South African evening sun , an unknown number of their fellow British citizens will be cheering .
For the USA .
On June 18 , the same group will support Algeria .
Five days later , it will be Slovenia whom they get behind .
And if Rooney , Lampard , Terry and company make it past the group stages , these UK passport holders have a handy phrase to remind them with whom their loyalties will lie : Anyone But England .
The T - shirts support any team but England at this year 's World Cup Few subjects on football message boards generate more ire , head - shaking and mutual antipathy between the constituent nations of the union than that of ABE .
To plenty of England supporters , the phenomenon is an unseemly grudge - fuelled display of bitterness by those with an inferior international record .
Meanwhile , to a certain breed of Welsh , Scottish and Northern Irish fans , it is either a natural expression of friendly rivalry with one 's near - neighbours or a necessary corrective to the perceived arrogance of an English - dominated media , which appears not to be able to discuss a soccer tournament without copious references to Bobby Moore and 1966 .
As the historian Eric Hobsbawm observed , a nation of millions " seems more real as a team of 11 named people " .
Consequently , football has become emblematic of ongoing trends such as devolution ; Scottish , Welsh and Irish nationalism ; and English resentment over the West Lothian question .
I have to say , it does wind you up when you switch on the TV and hear about ' England expects '
Dr Martin Johnes
When Dunblane - born Andy Murray , now Britain 's tennis number one , said that he would be supporting anyone other than England in the 2006 World Cup , he faced a furious backlash from English Wimbledon fans who wondered why they , in turn , should be expected to support him .
Scottish Murray insisted his remarks had been taken out of context , and had only been part of friendly banter with Tim Henman , his English predecessor at the summit of UK tennis .
But the PR damage was clearly done , and Murray is now reported to be backing the English squad in this year 's tournament .
It was the Scots ' turn to be outraged in February , when police visited an Aberdeen clothes shop to warn staff that a T - shirt on display bearing the ABE slogan could be construed as racist .
Predictably , the store would go on to report a surge in orders for the garment .
VIEW FROM NORTHERN IRELAND
Dr David Hassan , senior lecturer in sports studies at the University of Ulster " There are certainly those in Northern Ireland who would be quite happy to see England win the World Cup .
There are others who consider this prospect fundamentally unpalatable .
The majority of people like to see England lose - and ideally on penalties or as the result of some obvious injustice .
The majority of the nationalist and republican population clearly want to see the English defeated , though perhaps not until the latter rounds of the tournament , and supporters of the NI team have a footballing rivalry with the English , which means they would be pleased to see England beaten too - albeit for different reasons .
It 's a heady mix of rivalries around sport , politics , colonialism and nationalism . "
But it seems little coincidence that the replacement of union flags by St George 's Crosses among England fans first widely observed during Euro 1996 coincided with developments in Celtic politics that would subsequently see devolution in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland within a few years .
Fervent England supporter Mark Perryman , author of Ingerland : Travels With A Football Nation and a proponent of a tolerant , progressive English patriotism , says many of his fellow fans are perplexed and even hurt by this hostility from sides they would traditionally have backed when their own were not playing .
" I do n't expect anyone in Scotland , Wales or Northern Ireland to support England - they 've got their own countries to support , " he crackles down a phone line from South Africa .
" Actively supporting whoever 's playing us , though , just seems pathetic .
We should all get over it .
" The driving force behind English nationalism is n't the English - it 's the Scots .
They have their own anthem , their own banknotes and now their own parliament .
We do n't have any of that . "
But defenders of ABE deny that the phenomenon is politically motivated .
Hamish Husband , of the Association of Tartan Army Clubs , is a Carlisle United supporter who has lived in England for much of his life , and insists that football rivalries between national squads are no different from those displayed by fans of club sides .
In 1977 jubilant Scottish fans trashed the Wembley goalposts " England and Scotland first played each other in 1872 - it 's the oldest international football rivalry in the world , " he says .
" There 's nothing political about it all .
" The overwhelming majority of the Tartan Army have absolutely no animosity towards England fans as people .
It 's no different from Liverpool fans wanting Manchester United to lose in Europe . "
At any rate , Mr Husband insists that ABE is far less prevalent than is normally supposed , pointing to a recent YouGov / Daily Mail poll which suggested that while 24 % would support any opponent of England , the same proportion wanted England to win .
By far the biggest group - 38 % - said they did not mind whether the Auld Enemy did well or badly .
Indeed , no less an authority than the Craig Levein , manager of the Scottish national team , has said he hopes the English have a good World Cup .
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond of the pro-independence Scottish National Party has likewise wished Fabio Capello and his men well .
But what does appear to push many into the ABE camp is a perception that the media and business presume everyone in Britain is an England fan .
Mars faced a backlash when it brought out a range of chocolates wrapped in the St George 's Crosses - some of which made their way north of Hadrian 's Wall and west of Offa 's Dyke , to the indignation of some locals .
Andy Murray ruffled English feathers with a throwaway remark Dr Martin Johnes , a history lecturer at Swansea University , has studied anti-Englishness among football fans in Wales .
He believes ABE is generally far rarer among supporters of the Welsh national team than among fans of club sides like Cardiff and Swansea , who play in English leagues , or rugby fans , who see their sporting rivalry with England as one of equals .
But he says media coverage of international football can turn otherwise - harmonious neighbours against each other .
" I have to say , it does wind you up when you switch on the TV and hear about ' England expects ' and 1966 , " he says .
" Over the course of the tournament , I suspect more people will end up ABE than at the start .
" Only about 10 % of Welsh people want independence .
All we 're looking for is respect - to be treated as equals . "
ABE , then , may be about no more than three small nations feeling that they have to go that extra mile to distinguish themselves from a big nation .
But it may be too much to hope that anyone will blow the whistle on the grievances and grudges it provokes .
Below is a selection of your comments .
As a Celtic supporter who will support Rangers in Europe , I do despair at this anti-English attitude all the time .
Maybe this explains why I have lived in England longer than I have in Scotland .
My kids and partner never support anyone but Scotland .
My support for England only changes when Scotland are involved - not the case this time sadly .
John , Horsham West Sussex
It 's the arrogance thing , definitely .
We Welsh cheerfully accept that our team never make the grade .
On many occasions , England has only narrowly qualified for international competitions , then proceed to announce that they have the team to win it , when they so blatantly do n't .
They never make the grade - 1966 excepted .
If they took the viewpoint that " we 're lucky to be here and we 're going to enjoy it and do our best " then there would be a lot more support .
As it is , the " we 're going to bring the cup home " attitude is as unhelpful as it is unrealistic - especially if it comes down to penalties once more .
Meurig , Caerdydd Meurig , I do n't think it 's arrogance .
I am keen for England to win and tell people I think we can / will win .
But in my heart I am realistic and know we have a reasonable side that can get to the quarters on merit and can win if the wind blows the correct direction .
The media hype is all part of the fun getting people wound up , and I think if you have two flags on the car you should have both a St George and a Union flag because ultimately England are representing the island as far as I 'm concerned .
Mike , North York Can I get a T shirt for ABF ( Anything but Football ) .
The social stigma of being completely ambivalent about football has dogged me for years .
It is impossible to say " I do not like football " in any public context without people trying to shout you down or sway your opinion .
I have no interest in it , no allegiances , no opinions , nothing .
It is not England I am failing to support , it is football .
I simply do n't care who wins .
I wish no ill to the England team , nor any other , I simply find the whole game pointless and meaningless , hence I shall not be supporting anyone but England , I shall be trying to find a way to spend the next three weeks with anything but football
Ian Hart , Wellingborough , England As an Irishman ( from the Republic ) I always support Ireland first , England second and my adopted home Australia third .
But it must be pointed out that all things English suffer from the more rabid opinions of the British media .
When I mention that I enthusiastically lend my voice and hope to England 's chances in any international , to my Australian , Irish , Scottish etc mates , many admit that they do too .
But , and there is a caveat , they all would love to see England in a final with their home teams only to see the Lion and Unicorn be utterly humiliated in defeat .
Fair enough .
Ultimately what many of us worry about is that should England win , would the nation be as good at being winners as they are at being losers ?
I know many Australians who refuse to support their national teams in cricket and rugby union because both teams have shown themselves to be less than humble champions .
To quote Sir Terry Pratchett : " The thing about football - the IMPORTANT thing about football - is that it is not just about football . "
Malcolm Hamilton , Adelaide , SA
In 1998 Scotland opened the tournament with a game against Brazil ; roll forward a few days to England 's first game ( Algeria I think ) , cue Des Lynam opening the coverage , " The tournament started four days ago , but this is where it really begins . "
This type of attitude is what turns off the Celts , it 's really not political .
I would n't be surprised if there is an ABG campaign in Austria .
Stephen Jamieson , East Kilbride Well , I 'm half Scottish and half English living in Wales .
I have always supported my " heritage " countries ( except when they play each other and then I hope for a draw ) and have added Wales to the mix as I 've met many fine folk here .
However , this time I will be an ABE .
Why ?
Because I have a moral abhorrence of the on - the - record politics of the England manager who believes that General Franco was a jolly sound chap who did marvellous things for Spain .
Too many of our ancestors have perished fighting the ideals that the England manager holds dear so , much as it pains me to do so , I will hope that England leave asap and then follow tradition by sacking him .
Dave , Newport
This analysis totally ignores the historical impact of English dominance of the Celtic nations and other parts of the world .
As a descendant of Irish grandparents , who socialises in the Irish community most of the time , this antipathy does very much exist and is real .
I support England as I was brought up here and England is my homeland , but I am very proud of my Irish heritage as well .
Ironically with the ABE sentiment that exists amongst the Celts , why do they so fervently support English PL teams such as Man Utd , Liverpool etc .
A case of having one 's cake ... perhaps .
Tony , Coventry , England
This article is an excellent example of the media perpetrating the Anyone But England myth , you can't even get the Andy Murray context correct - the journalist involved has repeatedly said it was a joke by Murray in response to teasing of Scottish football by Englishmen .
Put simply , I do n't support England because I 'm not English .
I wo n't be supporting Brazil , Germany , Italy or anyone else at the World Cup either , because I 'm not of those nationalities .
Kelly , Edinburgh Born Scottish , living in England , this article glosses over the main argument , which is the national re-assignment of a success or failure .
Andrew Murray is hardly ever referred to as Scottish in the media , he is British , whereas when the English hooligans were causing havoc abroad , they are also referred to as British , not English .
When the Scottish hooligans caused problems in the 70s , they were Scottish .
The media cannot and should not have it both ways .
I am proud to be supporting ABE .
A Jarvie , Manchester , England I was born in England to English parents but now live in Scotland .
I love and support both countries and am proud ( for the most part ) to be British .
When it comes to supporting a sports team I think everyone has the right to support who they want to .
However , I am saddened by the ABE slogan because it has come about due to continued simmering resentment and bitterness that has nothing to do with sportsmanship .
Chris
Hoy is my role model as a sports personality , he is classy , has integrity , is obviously proudly Scottish first and respectfully British second .
We are a nation that shares so many similarities ( whether you like it or not ) , including a love of the beautiful game .
I say come together as a nation to enjoy the next three weeks , whatever team you support .
Susie McRae , Aberdeen I am happy to go along with the ABE thing , it 's always a fun thing to rib your English mates about , if Scotland are n't there are we just supposed to forget the friendly rivalry , hold hands and support the same team ?
Where would all the humour go ?
No , we carry on supporting North Korea over England ( if they are playing ) .
Jamie , Amsterdam / Edinburgh I 'm English , but I still " support " ( if that is the word ) ABE on the straightforward grounds that an early exit for the England team minimises the amount of vandalism and violence associated with any given tournament .
I still have n't forgotten the national shame of a Russian student ( not a football fan ) being stabbed to death in Brighton during Euro ' 96 simply because a group of England fans thought he had a German accent .
Ian Kemmish , Biggleswade " But what does appear to push many into the ABE camp is a perception that the media and business presume everyone in Britain is an England fan . "
This sums it up perfectly for me .
Aside from the fact that football is perceived to be a sport full of over - paid yobs and thugs , the media in general seem to forget that there are people who can't stand the sport , and certainly do n't want some of these players to be seen as ambassadors for their country , or indeed any other of the " home nation " countries .
Am I going to be an ABE ?
Nope , as I 've supported England in the past Rugby World Cup championships when Wales have n't been there .
I 'm just going to ignore the competition full - stop .
Jamie Stevens , Connah's Quay , Wales
Me too .
I am English , but have only a very mild interest in football and then only for important matches like the World Cup or Cup Final .
I find this insistence that " the whole country is behind our team " very annoying and the constant dwelling on VERY long ago glories is intensely embarrassing .
I will be winding up the saddos in my office by announcing my support for a real underdog , such as Paraguay .
Alison , UK I am a Scot by birth and I agree entirely with the notion that it is the mass hysteria surrounding the England football team which drives us to ABE .
A few weeks back I was fairly ambivalent , but the build - up has been so in your face , I was browsing ABE T - shirts online last night with the full intention of buying one .
I work for a large multinational company with many colleagues from European nations - and yet the business is also now forcing the " Come on England " mentality upon us in our workplace .
If everyone would just calm down and stop getting so worked up , then ABE would be far less well - supported than at present .
Paula , Southampton Dr Martin Jones is absolutely correct in his analysis of the media contribution to ABE .
The vast majority of Scots , Welsh and Northern Irish have no axe to grind with the England players or manager and would wish them well on a personal basis .
However the media 's persistence in mentioning England and 1966 at every opportunity ( sometimes even during commentaries on games not involving England ) and their expectation that England will dominate is what really gets people 's backs up .
Kim , Aberdeen , UK
You have successfully answered your own question .
Just take a look at the only fan picture you 've chosen to display , that of of the now well - behaved Scots fans " trashing " Wembley 's goalposts 30 plus years ago .
How is that relevant to this article ?
Perhaps if the entire media were n't so biased toward England , and the Celtic nations did n't have it thrust down there throats so much , they might think differently .
I hope England do n't win , we 'll never hear the end of it .
June , London I think it 's just racism .
I had the misfortune of having to work around the Newport , Gwent area during the 2000 World Cup .
In the pubs , the TV was off during England games .
While at work I was n't allowed access to either the hot drink , cold drinks or food facilities , as I was told " because you 're English " .
Honestly , for those few weeks I found unchecked racism highly entertaining , but I can tell it would get incredibly annoying after a few years of it .
Nic , Nottingham I personally think that the ABE campaign is one of the most misguided ideas in football .
If I was to label myself I would say that I am an Irish Nationalist and I shall be supporting England throughout this World Cup .
What has the English team of World Cup 2010 got to do with Scottish , Irish or Welsh politics ?
Not one thing .
It is stupid to think " I do n't like what the English have done to my country over the past centuries , so I hope that the football team loses . "
I watch the premier league week in week out , I support Man Utd .
Why then should I stop supporting players that I enjoy watching every week just because they now form one team ?
The national pride and camaraderie that goes hand in hand with the English and their football team is something to be admired , and should be embraced by the home nations when their teams are not playing .
And I for one shall be adopting England ... until Republic of Ireland qualify .
Mark , Belfast
What is wrong with people ?
The build - up to the World Cup may be a strain if you are not a football fan but it is no worse than other sporting event , such as the Olympics , Wimbledon etc ...
Support whoever you wish but do n't use it as a reason to be spiteful .
At the end of the day , supporting anyone but England in order to offend will not affect the outcome of the games .
Jaelithe , Plymouth , England Yeah OK , but it 's fun to wind up Engerlunders .

A large scale genetic analysis of multiple prostate cancer samples , published online by Cell Press on June 24th in the journal Cancer Cell , is providing exciting new insight into the disease and may lead to more effective treatment strategies .
In addition , the freely available genetic and clinical outcome data obtained in the study represents a valuable public resource for the cancer research community .
Prostate cancer is clinically diverse with some patients developing fatal metastatic disease within a couple of years and others living for decades .
This suggests that prostate tumors may have a substantial underlying genetic diversity .
Although large - scale genomic characterization projects have provided helpful insight into the molecular classification of many other types of cancer , similar studies of prostate cancer have proven to be more of a challenge .
" Our current knowledge of prostate cancer genomes is largely based on small groups of patients , " says senior study author , Dr. Charles Sawyers from Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
" To obtain a more comprehensive picture of prostate cancer genomics , we adopted an integrated comprehensive approach to analyze 218 primary and metastatic prostate cancer as well as 12 cell lines . "
Dr. Sawyers and colleagues found that an integrative analysis revealed a much higher frequency of alterations in the androgen receptor pathway than previously suspected , including amplification or mutation of the NCOA2 gene , an amplifier of androgen receptor output .
Importantly , the pattern of DNA copy number alterations defined subsets of low - and high - risk disease in primary samples , raising the possibility of a test that could predict who needs aggressive therapy versus watchful waiting .
" Taken together , our findings clarify the role of several known cancer pathways in prostate cancer , implicate several new ones , and provide a blueprint for clinical development of pathway inhibitors , " says Dr. Sawyers .
All the data obtained in the study was made available through an easily accessible web - based application .
" The high prevalence of prostate cancer , which is the most common malignancy in males , and the relative paucity of large comprehensive genomic datasets in the disease make this a unique public resource for the cancer research community , " concludes Dr. Sawyers .
When the Environmental Protection Agency abruptly retreated on its investigation into water contamination in a central Wyoming natural gas field recently , it shocked environmentalists and energy industry supporters alike .
Industry advocates see the EPA ’s turnabout as an overdue recognition that it had over - reached on fracking .
Environmentalists see an agency systematically disengaging from any research into the safety of drilling .
FLUSHING TOWNSHIP , Michigan —
A small group of residents became fed up with the way government was going and decided to make a change .
They attracted their like - minded friends who were against any tax increases and believed government needed to cut spending .
That small group became a larger movement and they began to win elections .
Sound familiar ?
Well , this Tea Party movement started two years ago in Flushing Township .
As the Taxed Enough Already crowd and other anti-establishment groups gain traction nationwide , they ’re well - established — and actually have been the establishment around here since 2008 .
With the election of Terry Peck as supervisor earlier this month , it is now well in power with five votes on the seven - member board .
“ The biggest part of ( the change ) is the economy , ” said Peck .
“ I think the economy dictated where voters were going . ”
The Tea Party has gained notoriety for their “ do n’t raise taxes , cut government spending ” rhetoric , made especially popular by former Alaska Gov. and Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin and the like .
Nationally the Tea Party and other anti-establishment groups have been turning heads by winning elections , despite the odds .
Established congressmen both Republican and Democrat — with the backing of heavy Washington hitters — have been uprooted in Pennsylvania , West Virginia and Utah .
The uproar in Flushing Township started after the township board decided days after a failed police millage increase in May 2008 to put it back on the ballot in November .
That peeved residents such as Ken Bueche .
“ It was like my vote did n’t count , ” said Bueche , 63 , who supported Tea candidates .
“ It made me mad and I said it ’s time to make a change . ”
Subsequently , a majority of the board was ousted in August 2008 giving seats to Gardner , who teamed up with Tea- minded Mark Purkey , Bill Noecker and Don Schwieman .
They gained a fifth with incumbent Democrat Scott Minaudo , joined their voting block after the election .
Schwieman started moving away from the Tea ideals in 2009 and was recalled earlier this year after residents complained about his new policies and a drunk driving arrest .
He was replaced with Peck , a vocal proponent of cutting government spending .
The Flushing Township board has cut vastly , from the township park to the police department .
“ The choices that we ’re making now in the township , you are going to see these same choices around Michigan and the U.S. , ” said township trustee Mike Gardner , who also is the head of the Genesee County Tea Party .
“ It takes a very strong - minded politician to stand up and say we are n’t going to raise taxes and we are going to cut spending . ”
Jack Minore , chair of the Genesee County Democratic Party , called the Tea stronghold in Flushing Township a fluke in Genesee County , which traditionally leans heavily Democratic .
“ It ’s possible that it can come into the township offices , ” he said .
“ But virtually all offices in Genesee County trend Democratic . ”
And , Minore criticized their aggressive cutting — including eliminating the one full - time staffer at the Flushing Township Nature Park , which he called a “ gem ” to county residents .
Township resident Gary Whitmire , who considers himself a conservative Republican , believes the cuts have gone too far .
He ran unsuccessfully for trustee in 2008 and opposed last year ’s police layoffs
“ I ’m not in favor of giant government , but government has an important place to serve the people , ” said Whitmire , 59 .
“ It provides services that it can do for us and ca n’t be done any other way . ”
Bill Ballenger , editor of the Inside Michigan Politics , said the state has n’t yet seen how much — if any — political muscle the Tea Party has .
It is being tested though .
The Republican Primary in the 1st Congressional district , where Democrat Bart Stupak is retiring , is key to seeing where the Tea Party is in Michigan .
He said the two favorites are
Dan Benishek , the Tea Party candidate , and state Sen. Jason Allen , the established Republican candidate .
“ If
Benishek
Tim , I love you , but I have n't loved you the same way since you called Alison 's lovely and slim model - size 4 max - " zaftig . "
I was impressed by the use of the word , I admit .
But the girl was so THIN !
What gives ?!
( CNN ) -- Greenpeace is well - known for taking direct action in the name of saving the environment , but key to its campaigning now is the collective power of the Internet and social media , says Greenpeace 's executive director , Kumi Naidoo .
Naidoo was talking to CNN about a recent campaign to stop Nestlé using palm oil sourced from plantations that it says are responsible for deforestation , primarily in Indonesia .
Palm oil is used in a variety of consumer products , from chocolate to washing powder , and is used by numerous companies across the world , not just Nestlé .
According to Greenpeace and other activist groups , rising demand for it has led to virgin rainforests being cleared to make way for new plantations .
Central to the Greenpeace campaign was an online video posted in March -- a mock Kit Kat chocolate bar advert that shows an office worker biting into a bloody orangutan 's finger instead of a piece of chocolate .
The video got more than a million hits , drawing attention to the issue and public scrutiny of Nestlé policy .
Naidoo says the attention was in part because the company at first tried to ban the video for copyright infringement .
The Swiss multi-national subsequently received numerous complaints about its palm oil policy on its Facebook and Twitter pages .
Less than a month after the video was first shown , Nestlé stopped all purchase of palm oil from Sinar Mas , one company Greenpeace claimed was causing deforestation in Indonesia .
Nestlé made the announcement in an April letter addressed to Greenpeace , and also reiterated its existing green credentials : a commitment to a moratorium on the deforestation of rainforests , its commitment to use only certified sustainably sourced palm oil by 2015 and a pledge not to use suppliers that provide blends of palm oil from non-sustainable sources .
Read the letter in full here .
Naidoo says in future Greenpeace will continue to work with companies , not just chastise and shame them through public campaigns .
" We 've got lots of dialogue going on with a range of companies .
Even with Nestlé we had been talking with them , but if talk does not deliver the results , we have to create the possibility for millions of people who care about the environment to send a clear message , " said Naidoo .
" Those [ companies ] that do n't have products that are sold to the public , the challenge there is slightly different , but when you have a company that sells a product directly to the global public you have a greater ability to leverage things more quickly . "

MILITARY veterans have long been accustomed to a relatively easy mortgage process .
Even borrowers with no down payment or a low credit score were usually granted V.A. loans , in large part because the Department of Veterans Affairs insures a quarter of the loan amount .
But about two years ago , lenders began limiting the conditions under which they would offer these mortgages , and industry executives say that since the start of the year , all the nation ’s major lenders have followed suit .
“ It ’s been a tightening across the board , ” said Nathan Long , the chief executive of VAMortgageCenter.com , an online broker of V.A. mortgages .
Lenders will still offer V.A. loans with no down payment , he said , but “ if you have a credit score of 610 , the best thing to do is work on your credit and try again in a couple of months , because you do n’t really have any options . ”
BP ‘ totally in charge of the news ’ about oil leak , energy expert says
As the latest effort to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico meets with failure , the idea of nuking the immediate area to seal the oil underground is gaining steam among some energy experts and researchers .
One prominent energy expert known for predicting the oil price spike of 2008 says sending a small nuclear bomb down the leaking well is “ probably the only thing we can do ” to stop the leak .
ADVERTISEMENT
Matt Simmons , founder of energy investment bank Simmons & Company , also says that there is evidence of a second oil leak about five to seven miles from the initial leak that BP has focused on fixing .
That second leak , he says , is so large that the initial one is “ minor ” in comparison .
Simmons spoke to Bloomberg News on Friday , before BP announced that its latest effort to plug the leak , known as the “ top kill ” method , had failed .
“ A week ago Sunday the first research vessel … was commissioned by NOAA to scour the area , ” he said .
They found “ a gigantic plume ” growing about five to seven miles from the site of the original leak , Simmons said .
Simmons said the US government should immediately take the effort to plug the leak out of the hands of BP and put the military in charge .
“ Probably the only thing we can do is create a weapons system and send it down 18,000 feet and detonate it , hopefully encasing the oil , ” he said .

His idea echoes that of a Russian newspaper that earlier this month suggested the US detonate a small nuclear bomb to seal the oil beneath the sea .
Komsomoloskaya Pravda argued in an editorial that Russia had successfully used nuclear weapons to seal oil spills on five occasions in the past .
Live Science reports :
Weapons labs in the former Soviet Union developed special nukes for use to help pinch off the gas wells .
They believed that the force from a nuclear explosion could squeeze shut any hole within 82 to 164 feet ( 25 to 50 meters ) , depending on the explosion ’s power .
That required drilling holes to place the nuclear device close to the target wells .
A first test in the fall of 1966 proved successful in sealing up an underground gas well in southern Uzbekistan , and so the Russians used nukes four more times for capping runaway wells .
ADVERTISEMENT
Simmons also told Bloomberg that the idea to use radical measures like a nuclear bomb to seal the leak is probably not being contemplated by decision - makers “ because BP is still totally in charge of the news and they have everyone focused on the top kill . ”
Asked by a Bloomberg reporter about the risks involved in setting off a nuclear bomb off the coast of Louisiana , Simmons argued that a nuclear explosion deep inside a well bore would have little effect on surrounding areas .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If you ’re 18,000 feet under the sea bed , it basically wont do anything [ on the surface ] , ” he said .
Joe Wiesenthal at Business Insider says the idea of using nukes will be getting a lot of attention now that the “ top kill ” procedure has failed .
Next , the so - called “ nuclear option ” is about to get a lot of attention .
In this case , of course , nuclear option is not a euphemism .
It ’s the real idea that the best way to kill this thing is to stick a small nuke in there and bury the well under rubble . …
By the middle of the coming week , it will be all over cable news , as pundits press The White House hard on whether it ’s being considered and why not .

The following video was broadcast on Bloomberg News , Friday May 28 , 2010 .
Boston Molasses Disaster
Theoccurred in the North End Park area of Boston , Massachusetts at the Purity Distilling Company facility on January 15 1919 .
At the time , molasses was America 's primary sweetener , used to make all types of confectionery , and also rum
A 50 - foot - tall molasses tank containing as much as 2.5 million gallons of molasses exploded .
The explosion was of sufficient force to cut the girders of the nearby elevated railroad and lift a train off the rails .
Some nearby buildings were also collapsed by the blast .
The molasses flowed out in a wave between 8 and 15 feet high , moving at 35 miles per hour and exerting a force of 2 tons per square foot .
Twenty - one people were killed and 150 injured as the hot molasses crushed , asphyxiated , and cooked many of the victims to death .
It took over six months to remove the molasses from the cobblestone streets , theaters , businesses , automobiles , and homes .
Purity Distilling paid $ 1 million in damages .
The cause of the accident is not known with certainty .
It is thought the tank may have been overfilled due to the impending passage of Prohibition , or it may have burst due to fermentation occurring within , or by the unusual increase in the local temperatures that occurred over the previous day ( the air temperature rose from 2 °F to 40 °F over that period ) .
An Air India Express plane from Dubai overshot the table - top runway at the Mangalore airport on Saturday morning and plunged over a cliff into a wooded valley , killing 158 persons .
There were 160 passengers and six crew members on board Flight IX - 812 .
The passengers included 137 adults , 19 children and 4 infants .
Eight passengers survived miraculously .
The plane burst into flames after the crash , which occurred at 6.10 a.m .
The captain of the flight , Z. Glusica , a British national of Serbian origin , and his co-pilot H.S. Ahluwalia are among the dead .
Nine passengers did not board the flight , according to the manifest .
Mohammad Usman , a survivor , who was in seat no .
19 said : “ I heard a horrible sound when the plane landed .
Within a few seconds it caught fire and the flames spread inside .
I crawled out from a crack near the left wing .
I removed my seat belt in time and saved myself . ”
Another survivor , Joel Prathap D'Souza , astounded airport officials when he turned up at the arrival wing for immigration formalities .
Fire tenders had a tough time reaching the inaccessible crash site .
Residents of the nearby Kenjar village rose to the occasion , throwing themselves selflessly into the rescue work , carrying bodies out of the burning wreckage .
Police said all 158 bodies were recovered by evening .
Reasons unclear
The reasons for the crash are as yet unclear .
Minister of State for Civil Aviation Praful Patel said an enquiry by the Directorate - General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) had been ordered .
The pilot did not report any problem or deficiency either during the course of the flight or on its final stretch .
The weather was relatively normal with a visibility of six kilometres , calm winds and no rain .
The runway was dry , Mr. Patel said .
Captain Glusica had 10,200 hours of flying experience , out of which 7,630 were as pilot - in - command .
He was familiar with the airport and had made 19 landings there , last touching down at the Mangalore airport in November 2009 .
Co-pilot Ahluwalia , based in Mangalore , had 3,650 hours of flying experience , and he too was familiar with the airfield .
Heart - rending scenes
The scene at the Government Wenlock Hospital , where most of the bodies of the victims were brought , was one of untold grief .
Relatives and friends had to perform the terrible task of identifying their loved ones from among bodies charred beyond recognition .
Said Vasanthi Shetty of B.C. Road , Mangalore : “ I identified my sister Rama Satish by her gold ornaments . ”
Flight operations remained suspended till 2 p.m. Hundreds of passengers going to Abu Dhabi , Kolkata and New Delhi were stranded for several hours .
I have this problem !
No idea how to fix it though - I think it might have started when I installed a photo frame widget , bt stayed when I uninstalled it .
Ca n't say for sure though

Bologna , August 2 , 1980 .
It was a hot Saturday morning , the first weekend of Italy ’s traditional holiday month , and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna ’s central railroad station .
In the midst of that noisy crowd someone stopped midway between the second - class waiting room and the coffee bar , put down a heavy suitcase , and quickly left the station .
The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives , perhaps stable nitroglycerine , connected to a timer .
At exactly 10:25 AM it exploded , ripping through the crowd , tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls , and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies .
In the bloody aftermath , rescue squads worked for over twelve hours to pull the dead and maimed from the rubble .
As they labored , a young neofascist entered a telephone booth across town and dialed Bologna ’s leading newspaper .
“ This is the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei , ” he said .
“ We claim responsibility for the explosion in the railway station . ”
The final toll : eighty - five dead — the eldest an eighty - six - year - old man , the youngest a three - year - old child — and more than two hundred wounded .
Eight weeks later , on the evening of September 26 , a young man , Gundolf Koehler , tried to place six pounds of explosives in a refuse can at the entrance to Munich ’s Oktoberfest .
The bomb went off , killing him and twelve others , wounding 215 people .
On Koehler ’s body were found documents linking him to the illegal paramilitary Defense Sport Group of the neo -Nazi Karl - Heinz Hoffmann , who styles himself the “ spiritual descendant ” of Adolf Hitler and who has organized military maneuvers in southern Germany for his followers .
Arrested along with twenty - four of his militants , Hoffmann was later released for lack of evidence .
A week later in Paris a twenty - six pound bomb exploded in front of the rue Copernic synagogue , where hundreds of Jews were gathered for sabbath services .
The bomb killed four persons and wounded thirteen ; if it had gone off twenty minutes later , when services would have ended , it would have killed scores of worshipers leaving the synagogue .
The act was claimed by the European National Fasces ( FNE ) , the same group that had machine - gunned five Jewish buildings in Paris a week earlier .
These latest of neofascist massacres have awakened Europeans to what many of them had managed not to see : the maturation over the last five years of what analysts now call Eurofascism — loosely associated but politically aligned neo -Nazi groups , many of them dedicated to terrorism , all of them intent on saving Europe from the twin evils of capitalism and Marxism .
While their membership is relatively small , they are well funded and some have access to training camps in Lebanon .
In an interview given eight days before the Munich explosion , the PLO leader Abu Ayad revealed that in late 1979 two members of Hoffmann ’s group were captured in Lebanon and confessed to him that they and some thirty other European fascists were training at the Falangist camp at Aquru , northeast of Beirut .
The Germans told Ayad that their Italian comrades …
Liberal Democrat David Laws has resigned as Chief Secretary to the Treasury after admitting he claimed expenses to pay rent to his partner .
He said he could not carry on with the " crucial work " on the Budget while dealing with the implications of the revelations in the Daily Telegraph .
He had earlier apologised and said he would pay back the £ 40,000 he claimed .
Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy Nick Clegg paid tribute to Mr Laws saying they hoped he would return .
The Yeovil MP said he wanted to keep his relationship with James Lundie private .
' Did wrong '
Mr Laws is the first resignation to hit the coalition government , just three weeks after it was formed .
He was one of the Liberal Democrat negotiators who hammered out the deal before joining the cabinet as a key member of Chancellor George Osborne 's team .
Mr Laws said he had informed both David Cameron and Nick Clegg , but it had been " his decision alone " .
In his resignation letter to Mr Cameron , he wrote : " The last 24 hours have been very difficult and distressing for me , and I have been thinking carefully about what action I should take in the interests of the government , my constituents and - most important of all - those whom I love .
" I am grateful for the strong support which I have received from my friends , family , and from you , the deputy prime minister and the chancellor .
This support has been incredibly important , but nonetheless , I have decided that it is right to tender my resignation as chief secretary to the Treasury . "
Explaining his decision , he said : " I do not see how I can carry out my crucial work on the Budget and spending review while I have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations .
" I can not now escape the conclusion that what I have done was in some way wrong , even though I did not gain any financial benefit from keeping my relationship secret in this way . "
He added : " Most importantly , I have an overriding responsibility to those I love most , and who I feel I have exposed to scrutiny in this way .
" I have pursued a political career because of my sense of public duty , but I have too often put this before the interests of those I love most .
It is time to redress the balance . "
Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Danny
Alexander will take over the post , Downing Street has announced .
' Integrity '
Responding to Mr Laws ' resignation letter , Mr Cameron said he was an " honourable man " , adding : " I hope that , in time , you will be able to serve again . "
Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had always admired Mr Laws ' integrity and he hoped he would one day be able to return to government .
He said Mr Laws ' privacy had now been " cruelly shattered " .
Mr Cameron wrote : " The last 24 hours must have been extraordinarily difficult and painful for you .
" You are a good and honourable man .
I am sure that , throughout , you have been motivated by wanting to protect your privacy rather than anything else .
" Your decision to resign from the government demonstrates the importance you attach to your integrity .
" In your short time at the Treasury , you have made a real difference , setting the government on the right path to tackle the deficit which poses such a risk to our economy . "
Mr Clegg said : " I very much hope that when those questions are answered there will be an opportunity for him to rejoin the government because , as everyone has seen in recent weeks , he has so much to contribute to national life .
" When all is said and done , this has come about because of David 's intense desire to keep his own private life private .
His privacy has now been cruelly shattered .
" I 'm sure I speak on behalf of all fair - minded people when I say that I hope that David , and all those people close to him , will now be granted the privacy which he has always craved . "
The chancellor said he was " very sorry " to lose Mr Laws from the Treasury .
Mr Osborne said : " It was as if he had been put on earth to do the job that was asked of him .
" I spoke to David several times over the last 24 hours and I have a huge admiration for the way he has conducted himself in the most difficult circumstances .
" I completely understand and respect his decision to step down .
Public life should have a future place for such an honourable , talented person . "
Former Liberal Democrat MP
Lembit Opik who is a friend of David Laws , said he was the victim of a " witch hunt " .
He said : " I think this is a national tragedy , not least because it suggests that - on matters which are nothing to do with a person 's personal competence to do a job - they can still be pushed out of Parliament . "
Google has finally announced its long - rumored TV efforts at Google I/O. Senior product manager Rishi Chandra said during the Thursday keynote that " video should be consumed on the biggest , best , and brightest screen in your house , and that 's the TV , " and that it hoped to combine the Web and TV - viewing experience in ways that others have yet to do .
Up front , Google TV will come either in the form of a set - top box or will be built into certain TVs ( launch partners include Intel , Sony , and Logitech ) .
The OS is based on Android and the built - in browser is a version of Google Chrome with the Flash 10.1 plugin .
Google plans to open the source code for Google TV and add its own set of APIs so that it can be further extended by developers .
The hardware will all be Atom - based , and it should start appearing on store shelves in the fall of 2010 .
The experience will be search - driven , which is unsurprising given that , well ... it 's Google we 're talking about .
Users can enter search terms and get results from the Web and what 's currently being broadcast on TV , as well as videos from YouTube and other sites .
There will be a " home screen " where you can add bookmarks to your favorite channels , shows , websites , music , photo albums , and so on .
From the looks of it , the home screen will have a very Boxee - like interface , with a list of your applications , watch list , and more on the left .
That 's right : as expected , third - party developers will be able to write Android - based apps to run on the Google TV , again similar to the Boxee interface .
Some companies ( like Netflix and Amazon Video on Demand ) have already created native apps to run from the Google TV home screen .
Rishi said Google decided to go ahead with the Google TV because the TV world is currently separate and isolated from the rest of the world .
The TV world is a simplified and analog recreation of what 's happening in more interactive mediums , like the Web .
As such , users are forced to choose between accessing the Web ( via mobile devices , tablets , or their computers ) or TV , which is a loss for users .
Google wants to combine the two into a " single seamless experience " by allowing users to turn their TV into an interactive experience with the Web .
And , at least according to the demo at Google I/O ( which encountered some technical difficulties due to an overloaded WiFi network ) , it looks like Google TV will offer users plenty of options when it comes to consuming content .
A search for a popular show like House will return results for the show on Hulu , Fox 's website , individual show downloads on Amazon , or the regular TV schedule — if you want to record it on your DVR , you can do so right from the Google TV interface .
Naturally , Google TV will also come with a giant , TV - optimized YouTube interface called " YouTube Leanback . "
Designed to be used from a couch , it wo n't just be limited to the Google TV ( though that 's the obvious reason for its existence ) ; the beta interface will be rolled out on the YouTube website within weeks so that non-Google TV users can use it from their HTPC boxes or wherever .
As usual , Google is not making any of the hardware itself .
In typical Google form , the company has instead implemented a remote control protocol that will allow third - party developers to build their own software for controlling Google TV from other devices .
During the demo , Google showed an Android phone app that utilized the OS 's built - in voice search to activate a feature on the Google TV box — say what you want to look for and the TV will automatically display it .
Clearly , this opens up many opportunities for controlling devices to fit every user 's preferences , and you can even have multiple devices associated with Google TV at once if you so choose .
Clearly , the company is throwing a lot of weight behind Google TV , and so far , it looks very promising for the geek crowd .
This is basically a way to combine all of the extensive benefits of an HTPC into a set - top box without most of the downsides — interfaces made for computer use instead of couch use , and limited control interfaces , to name a few .
And , of course , because of the openness of the OS , there 's potential for Google TV to be turned into a healthy game distribution platform as well .
The real measure of success will come if and when the mainstream crowd catches on to Google TV — there are so many options available that it may be overwhelming for the average TV viewer .
Still , we 're excited about the possibilities and are looking forward to giving Google TV a test run when it becomes available .

CLEVELAND , Ohio —
When Michigan State men's basketball coach Tom Izzo said he did not speak with LeBron James before turning down the Cavaliers ' offer to become head coach earlier this week , it shook up some Cavaliers fans .
With James choosing not to take an active part in the Cavs ' coaching search , it was assumed by some -- and reported by some media outlets -- the franchise player and the organization were not communicating .
With his free agency now just a couple weeks away , that was interpreted as James putting distance between himself and the home team .
But while James does not plan to commit to anything regarding his future until after July 1 , he is not operating in a blackout with the Cavs .
According to both a team source and a source close to James , the Cavs and the two - time Most Valuable Player continue to be in contact .
Both sides said the communication has been standard for the off - season .
James has met face - to - face with team officials recently , and the Cavs ' front office has been in regular contact with Leon Rose , James ' agent .
Related content
The Cavs have been in contact with all of their potential free agents , including Shaquille O'Neal , Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Jawad Williams .
Publicly , the Cavs have declined to discuss their recent communications with James , which fed speculation the sides were not talking .
James has said he would not talk to potential coaching candidates , but it is possible James has been consulted on what types of candidates the Cavs pursue .
James has until June 30 to pick up his player option of $ 17.1 million for next season , which he is not expected to do , or to sign an extension of his current contract with the Cavs .
By letting the contract expire and then starting over with a new deal with the Cavs or another team , James would lose about $ 1.9 million on a maximum contract over the next three seasons because of the shrinking salary cap .
For this reason , the Cavs are expected to offer James a max extension before July 1 and might already have .
However , all signs point toward James declining those choices and proceeding to unrestricted free agency .
Coaching update : The Cavs are planning a second interview with Byron Scott next week and might be drawing closer to offering him the coaching job .
Scott , who has one of the most impressive resumes of coaches on the market , has interest in the Lakers ' coaching job if Phil Jackson does not re-sign .
But with the champion Lakers in position to threepeat , the general belief is Jackson will look to return if cleared by his doctors .
According to a source , while Scott has long had an interest in coaching the Lakers , he is very intrigued by the Cavs ' job and coaching James .
Scott , a former Hornets coach , still is quite close with New Orleans guard Chris Paul , who is one of James ' closest friends .

Like most people , I grew up idolizing pop culture , candy and womenâs shoes .
But as time went on I grew older and wiser and came to the sad realization that many of my heroes were nothing more than smoke and mirrors that sometimes had a penchant for masturbating in adult theaters .
The truth is rough .
And for that reason I figured I owed it to myself and all the disenfranchised youths of the world who grew up to learn that they could never become a member of GI Joe no matter how hard they tried to teach those bastards a lesson .
The thing about taking on your childhood hopes and dreams is that , arguably , you are never prepared for that .
Have you ever successfully fought the Harlem Globetrotters ?
Donât make me laugh .
No , for this , serious and focused training would be in order .
Luckily , as an Internet comedy writer , I have nothing but loneliness and free time , so arranging this was not a problem .
Bigfoot
The Heartbreak
There was a time when I was around seven or so when I was pretty much confident I could either be Bigfoot or live with him .
Did I carry a lot of lead paint - saturated toys in my mouth as a child ?
Possibly .
But Harry and the Hendersons clinched it for me that Bigfoot was awesome and probably just misunderstood .
If I could find him , domesticate him and train him to play tag , we would be the best of friends for all eternity .
It was as foolproof a plan as I had ever devised .
For a solid year I was all about Bigfoot .
I even attempted an expedition to track him down about a block from my house .
I found tracks that I at first thought were his but later decided were probably just hobo tracks or âbum shufflins .â 
I lived in a really shitty part of town .
Have you ever seen a person who claims to have seen Bigfoot ?
These are the people that carnies turn away at the gates to the circus because they canât handle the stress of this kind of shit .
As I grew older , my mind wrestled with the realization that one of two things was occurring â either Bigfoot was a hoax or he had a preternatural attraction to mental retardation of the most dire sort .

Vengeance
Some research when I was old enough revealed that most Bigfoot sightings were not even something plausible , like a diseased monkey or an unhygienic mountain man .
Mostly they were just dickheads in ape costumes .
Any reported sightings of footprints ?
Frauds and hobo shufflins .
Bigfootâs stubborn insistence on not existing had let me down .
Worse yet , the guy who played Harry in the movie actually contracted AIDS on the set of Harry and the Hendersons during a blood transfusion .
Fuck you so hard , Bigfoot .
If I wanted to teach Bigfoot a lesson Iâd have to go toe - to - toe with him in a manner heâd understand : cold brutality .
Now , arguably , fighting a beast Iâd just acknowledged had let me down by virtue of not actually existing would be a bit of a challenge but if Iâd learned nothing else from numerous montages in 80s fight films it was that no adversary could stand up to a dude whoâd gone through one .
Bigfoot was in for some shit .
Iâm gonna kick you right in your hairy chest box .
Pussy .

I did some Googling to find some cryptozoologists , the people who study things like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster while pretending to be actual scientists and not just despicable frauds who waste other peopleâs valuable time .
Once I found one willing to talk to me on the phone , I laid it out bluntly :
How can I kill Bigfoot with my bare hands , or at least mess him up real bad ?
My cryptozoologist friend began explaining how Bigfoot is obviously a very endangered and peaceful being of high intelligence .
I had to cut him off .
I donât give a fig if heâs the hairy , bastard child of Stephen Hawking and Mother Theresa , the son of a bitch stole my hopes and dreams and heâll be lucky if he gets away with a black eye and some ball kicks .
I was hung up on .
A guy who pretends to study Bigfoot for a living was too professional to continue our discussion .
This Bigfoot rabbit hole full of bullshit goes very deep .
Regardless , once the ninja stars I ordered off the Internet show up heâs going to wish he never existed .
Which he doesnât .
One of the things that attracted me to Thich Nhat Hanh was his embodiment of what he called “ engaged Buddhism . ”
While Buddhist monastic life and retreats have their crucial place , our day - to - day actions and their kamma are what show whether we are developing sila — the moral and ethical awakening this is every bit as important as concentration and insight .
In this light , I want to speak about the growing environmental tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico .
I ’m sure we ’ve all been staggered by the sheer scale of the disaster , as every two to three days the ruptured BP oil well spews out the same amount of oil as the entire Alaskan Exxon Valdez oil spill !
And yet , BP and others keep downplaying the extent of the catastrophe :
I ’ve just made a highly informative post on the oil spill at Goodheart ’s Extreme Science ( link below ) .
I hope you will take a look , because it offers ways we can help and urge officials to take effective actions that have not been implemented yet .
Specially , this post argues that we need to enlist the aid of nature herself in the form of oil - eating microbes .
These amazing little beings have already proven themselves hugely effective at other oil spills , as is explained in a very important video I ’ve embedded in the post .
Please take a look at :
The BP Oil Disaster — Send in the Microbes !
So often we may feel helpful in the face of huge problems , but here ’s a case were we can urge officials and the government to expand their efforts and consider all technologies in battling the oil .
The embedded video in the post demonstrates how effective these amazing little beings have been in helping with past oil spills .
No doubt most readers of this blog are already sending their prayers and spiritual energies to the Gulf and every being there .
When things feel overwhelming it ’s so important that we not underestimate what prayers and directed loving - kindness meditation can do to bring a healing .
The people of the Gulf , and the countless beings , great and small , affected by this catastrophe need our help in every way .

The next time you are sitting in a car dealership negotiating a purchase , make sure you are sitting on a hard chair – you will drive a harder bargain .
Psychologists have found that the texture and feel of objects around us , even those we are sitting on , can affect the way we think and behave .
In an experiment in which volunteers engaged in mock haggling over the price of a car , those sitting in hard , cushionless chairs were tougher negotiators than those in soft , comfortable ones .
" It is behavioural priming through the seat of the pants , " said John Bargh of Yale University .
" Our minds are deeply and organically linked to our bodies . "
In a series of six experiments , researchers from Yale , Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed how our sense of touch – the first of our senses to develop – influences our social interactions throughout life .
Interviewers handed the CV of a job applicant were more likely to rate them as serious about their work if the CV was presented on a heavy clipboard than a light one .
They also rated their own accuracy in the task as more important .
Volunteers asked to do a jigsaw puzzle and then read a story about an exchange between two people were more likely to judge the relationship between the pair as adversarial if the puzzle pieces were rough , not smooth .
In a similar experiment , volunteers given a hard wooden block to handle before being told about an interaction between a boss and an employee were more likely to judge the employee as rigid and strict than those given a soft woollen blanket to handle .
The results , published in the journal Science , build on a 2008 study by Dr Bargh which showed that volunteers given a warm cup of coffee to hold briefly were more likely to judge other people as caring and generous than if they held a cold drink instead .
Christopher Nocera , co-author of the study , said : " Touch remains perhaps the most underappreciated sense in behavioural research .
People often assume that exploration of new things occurs primarily through the eyes .
While the power of vision is irrefutable , this is not the whole story . "
The warm and gentle touch of a mother is equated with comfort and safety , and roughness and hardness with its opposite .
These are the first physical concepts that a child develops which are later manifested in abstract ideas like a warm smile and a hard heart .
They help create the scaffold on which the adult later makes social judgements , the researchers say .
The authors write : " First impressions are liable to be influenced by the tactile environment , and control over the environment may be especially important for negotiators , pollsters , job seekers and others interested in interpersonal communication .
The use of " tactile tactics " may represent a new frontier in social influence and communication . "
Mr Nocera said : " Our work suggests greetings involving touch , such as handshakes and cheek kisses , may have critical influences on our social interactions in an unconscious fashion . "
Dr Bargh said touch was an important sense not only for exploring the world but for shaping our understanding of it , reflected in expressions such as " weighing in with an opinion " , " having a rough day " or " taking a hard line " .
Alastair Heseltine is a Canadian artist who makes art and objects by interweaving wood ( he especially loves willow ) .
We were knocked out by his woodpile and by his artist ’s statement ; we do n’t know when we ’ve seen one that said so much in so few words :
“ I am a sculptor working with mixed media relating to the environment .
Imagery is guided by the inherent nature of material and by construction systems evolved through mindful observation and play .
I also draw from the full spectrum of routines and activities that support my practice : Design , craft production , farming and rural life . ”

WASHINGTON  “ I spent the summer before college reading Shakespeare and staring out the window and occasionally being a roadie for my friend ’s band , ” says Eve Tushnet , the celibate , gay , conservative , Catholic writer .
That was all good fun , she says upon meeting in Union Station , but she was ready for more , although she knew not what .
“ I was hoping for something very different in college . ”
It is common , this freshman urge for self - invention .
The football player tries his hand at poetry ; the classical violinist fiddles in a bluegrass band .
But Ms. Tushnet  whose parents , Mark Tushnet and Elizabeth Alexander , are a well - known liberal Harvard law professor and a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer , respectively  did not imagine that she would become a Roman Catholic , nor that 10 years after graduation , her voice , on her blog and in numerous articles , would be one of the most surprising raised against same - sex marriage .
As the hundred or so daily readers of eve-tushnet .
blogspot.com , and a larger audience for her magazine writing , know by now , Ms. Tushnet can seem a paradox : fervently Catholic , proudly gay , happily celibate .
She does not see herself as disordered ; she does not struggle to be straight , but she insists that her religion forbids her a sex life .
“ The sacrifices you want to make are n’t always the only sacrifices God wants , ” Ms. Tushnet wrote in a 2007 essay for Commonweal .
While gay sex should not be criminalized , she said , gay men and lesbians should abstain .
They might instead have passionate friendships , or sublimate their urges into other pursuits .
“ It turns out I happen to be very good at sublimating , ” she says , while acknowledging that that is a lot to ask of others .
We ’re eating kinda - Hawaiian chicken sandwiches made with grilled soy - pepper jelly marinated chicken tenderloins , bacon , asiago cheese , juicy grilled fresh pineapple slices , red onions , spring mix and mayonnaise .
There is a bar and grill a few blocks from where we live that serves a delicious Hawaiian hamburger .
The cheese , burger , pineapple , teriyaki sauce and mayo combine to form heaven in a bite .
I was craving said burger the day I made this little number .
Instead of making it a hamburger I when for a slightly healthier option and made it with grilled chicken tenderloin .
If you really want to keep it healthy , substitute the bacon with ham or Canadian bacon and instead of mayo brush the buns with more of the soy - pepper jelly sauce .
Also , if you are feeling REEEEAAAALLY lazy you can just use a bottle of teriyaki sauce to marinate the chicken rather than making the soy - pepper jelly sauce .
In my opinion , chicken is never as good as a burger but this hit the spot and staved off my craving for the day !
A Chicken Sandwich Recipe , by Amanda
Kinda - Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich
For the marinade :
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/4 cup spicy pepper jelly , as hot as you can find ( we used ghost chili jelly )
* If you cannot find spicy pepper jelly add 1 / 4 to 1/ 2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and 1 /4 cup of any pepper jelly .
1 1/2 lbs chicken breast tenderloins , ( about 8 tenderloins )
4 fresh pineapple slices
1 red onion , peeled and sliced in 1/2 " rings
1 tsp canola oil , or other flavorless oil
8 slices of thick - cut bacon , cooked
4 oz asiago cheese
mayonnaise
spring mix
4 hamburger buns of choice
kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
Place all ingredients for the marinade into a small sauce pan over medium heat .
Heat until the jelly has dissolved into the soy sauce , stirring occasionally , about five minutes .
Remove from heat and cool to room temperature , about 20 to 30 minutes .
Add chicken to a resealable plastic bag .
Pour marinade over chicken tenderloins and toss to coat completely .
Seal the bag , removing as much air as possible to emulate a vacuum seal .
Refrigerate .
Marinate the chicken , chilled , for 4 to 24 hours .
Prepare grill for medium - high heat .
Preheat oven to 400 degrees .
Toss pineapple and red onion slices with canola oil and sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper .
Remove chicken from marinade and place on preheated grill over direct heat .
Place pineapple and red onions on grill as well .
Grill chicken , pineapple and red onions for 3 - 4 minutes .
Flip and grill for another 3 to 4 minutes until chicken is cooked through and pineapple and red onions are nicely charred and softened .
Prepare the sandwiches : place the bottom half of the hamburger buns onto a sheet pan .
Place 2 slices of bacon and 2 tenderloins onto each bottom bun .
Add 1 oz asiago cheese on top of each set of tenderloins .
Place pan in preheated oven for 3 to 4 minutes until cheese has melted .
While the cheese is melting spread mayo evenly over the inside of the top buns .
To finish the sandwiches , layer 1 slice of grilled pineapple , several slices of grilled onion rings and a handful of spring mix onto each of the bottom buns .
Replace the top buns to form 4 completed sandwiches .
Serve immediately and enjoy !

The black dashed line cutting through Marie Antoinette is used to represent the placement of the zipper .
It 's not actually part of the design .
And the text translates to read " let them eat cake . "

Leroy_Hornblower on June 26 , 2010 at 04:45:42 Artist Plu Shu : Brioche might not actually be cake , but I found multiple sources that say " Qu'ils mangent de la brioche " is where the famous " let them eat cake " saying came from .
In the end I guess it really does n't matter since I 've read that historians have never found any proof of her actually saying those infamous words .
Thanks again everyone .

As improvisers we are always looking to create new harmonic concepts or to find new ways of soloing over traditional changes that are innovative and creative .
Actually , for the past sixty years jazz musicians have been playing the same basic set of standard tunes , each generation making their stylistic mark on the history of the music .
This is a lot of development and after the innovations of Parker , Trane , Miles and countless others it seems like every possible way to play over these progressions has already been done … twice .
One area left to really explore , though , is chromatic improvisation and from listening to some of the great players today , it seems that this concept is becoming an essential part of the vocabulary for modern jazz musicians .
Now , this is not just using chromatic scales or playing free jazz , but constructing lines , patterns , triads and arpeggios that move in different directions chromatically ; a concept that has infinite possibilities .
For example , look at the figure below of a very simple line using this structure :
In the above example , the line is composed of whole steps that descend chromatically .
This same idea can be applied to larger intervals ( fourths , sixths , tritones , etc. ) , triads ( major , minor , diminished , augmented and inverted ) and even chord progressions to create new possibilities for improvisation .
Players today like Dave Liebman and George Garzone have explored these concepts in depth and have even developed their own methods for chromatic improvisation .
This trend really began with Miles in the mid-60 ’s when he was playing with his second great quintet with Wayne , Herbie , Ron Carter and Tony Williams .
Because of the freeness and daring of this group , playing complex chromatic lines really worked well , especially with a rhythm section that could go anywhere at any moment .
Check out this video of the quintet playing Joshua and listen to how Miles uses chromatic lines and patterns throughout his solo…actually , check out everybody ’s playing , this whole band is so killing it ’s scary .
Where to start
Playing these close chromatic structures works well over modal and complex progressions , as well as conventional changes simply for the fact that these types of lines have no strong tonal center .
When you use these devices in effective places within your solos though , they can add harmonic tension and forward motion to your lines .
The trick is to incorporate these patterns into your playing and technique after establishing an approach to improvising that is diatonically based .
When we learn music theory and start to improvise , we use material that is based largely upon diatonic construction or modes of the major scales .
Gradually , as we progress , we add some altered or non-traditional scales like the octatonic , diminished , or whole tone scales to our vocabulary .
Still , at the core , everything is rooted to diatonic modes and their resulting progressions .
Coming from this type of musical education , lines that move in intervals and patterns not found in the traditional modes ( i.e. chromatic movement ) can feel foreign at first and will take some work to get them in your ears and under your fingers .
What you must do to gain familiarity and eventually facility with these patterns , is create exercises aimed at acquiring this technique .
Start simple with isolated exercises and then slowly build upon those concepts until you are creating your own vocabulary .
Practice in 4 Directions
Just as practicing your diatonic scales in all four directions covers all possible variations , shedding these chromatic patterns in all four directions will ensure that these lines will be in your fingers .
For our purposes here , we ’ll take one intervallic pattern ( whole steps moving chromatically ) and explore it ‘s variations .
Start with this example and take it through all four directions ascending and descending :
Down Down
Down Up
Up Up
Up Down
Emphasize Goal Notes
Once these exercises become comfortable , start to think of how you can use these devices in your soloing .
Playing with these kinds of lines can be especially effective in creating momentum in your lines towards a goal note or strong arrival point .
One of the reasons this technique is so effective is that the chromaticism acts as a harmonic tension , building towards a resolving note .
Try aiming for a chord tone as the arrival point of your chromatic based line .
In the following example over the chord E - 7 , the resolution point of each chromatic structure is a chord tone ( the root , 3rd and 5th ) :
Chromatic lines over ii-V’s
Continuing with the idea of aiming for goal notes over one chord , try to write down some lines that work over a progression and resolve on the final chord .
Since ii -V ’s occur in countless standards , having some new material to navigate this common progression will be very beneficial .
Try constructing a line built upon ascending and descending chromaticism , for example :
Where to go from here
Approaching improvising from this type of mindset opens up new possibilities because the structure of the line and relationship of the intervals become the focal point rather than the accompanying chords .
The above examples are only a glimpse of what is possible when you incorporate close chromatic structures into your lines .
Just keep watching that clip of Miles to see what ’s possible .
Here are a few things to think about and to look into to expand your technique and knowledge of chromatic concepts :
OPERATION Flintlock has begun .
American special forces have been descending on Burkina Faso , Mali , Mauritania and Senegal in a joint exercise , expected to last another week or so , to combat Islamist terrorism in the region .
It is the latest stage of an evolving partnership between America and much of west Africa .
Over several years , Americans have been training their counterparts in these countries in everything from marksmanship and parachuting to the more touchy - feely stuff of winning over hearts and minds .
When the Americans first started talking about al - Qaeda 's threat in the Sahara , many were sceptical .
But a sharp increase in the rate of attacks in the past 18 months by what the jihadists call “ al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ” , usually abbreviated to AQIM , have convinced even cynics that a threat of sorts does exist .
When AQIM emerged three years ago out of a ruthless Algerian guerrilla outfit called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , better known by its French abbreviation GSPC , it seemed intent on uniting north African jihadists to wage war on Europe .
It has largely failed on that score , having been squeezed by Algeria 's security forces , who have broken up many of its cells .
Instead , the group is now concentrating on softer targets in a belt of countries farther south .
Armies in the Sahel , that wide stretch of land just south of the Sahara , have increasingly often clashed with Islamist fighters .
A handful of Westerners have been killed and a dozen of them who had been kidnapped in the region last year ended up in the hands of AQIM .
It is not clear how many of those seizures were carried out by the group 's own fighters , thought to number a few hundred , rather than freelancers who passed them on .
But ransom payments have certainly swelled AQIM 's coffers .
Though payments are never officially confirmed , negotiators speak of millions of dollars changing hands to free captives .
AQIM is still holding two Spaniards .
Only one hostage , from Britain , whose government refuses to pay ransoms to terrorists , has been killed .
Like other rebellious types in the region , such as the Tuaregs of Mali and Niger , AQIM 's fighters have long blurred the lines between Islamist militancy and organised crime .
Kidnapping is a relatively new business and follows years of smuggling illicit goods across the Sahara to Europe .
In recent years Latin American drug gangs have been funnelling a lot of cocaine through west Africa , making the trans - Saharan route far more lucrative .
An American - led sting operation in Ghana and the discovery of a burnt - out Boeing aircraft in the desert in Mali have led to claims that AQIM has a big role in the drug trade .
Drug and security specialists say the Islamists are just one of several groups involved .
But AQIM is plainly rattling several governments .
It plays on local grievances .
Its bountiful cash is a lure to young men living in poverty in the desert .
The authorities of northern Nigeria are especially worried .
The country was the original home of the young man with explosive underpants who tried to blow up an American airliner over Detroit at Christmas .
An additional worry for Western governments is that the AQIM threat may have widened divisions within the region .
Algeria is frustrated by the apparent inertia and alleged lack of backbone shown by some of its southern neighbours .
Mali , for instance , was accused of feebleness when it freed some Islamists earlier this year in exchange for a French hostage .
In the coming weeks the co-operation between American trainers and local security forces will be rigorously tested .

SYDNEY , April 21 / PRNewswire / -- Freelancer.com , the world 's # 1 outsourcing marketplace for small business , today released the FreelancerAPI , the world 's first sophisticated API for tasking humans from software .
Futurist and Scientists hypothesise about a coming technological singularity ; a point in time in the future where it is believed that man-machine intelligence will explode , accelerating technological progress at a rate so quickly that the future will be radically different from today .
So different , that as mere mortals , limited by the human brain , we cannot even comprehend this future .
Whether or not the singularity will eventuate , man and machine became closer today with the launch of the FreelancerAPI .
For over 60 years , humans have programmed computers through software .
This API , for the first time , provides a sophisticated programming interface for humans , for use by software .
This API allows software for the first time to send sophisticated and complex tasks such as real engineering or problem solving to humans , retrieve the results and pay for the completed work .
" The possibilities with this API are endless , " said Matt Barrie , Chief Executive of Freelancer.com .
" Imagine , for example , a computer trying to train itself on some complex classification program via machine learning or other artificial intelligence techniques ; for the first time this software might decide to request the solution from humans .
Software can now simply post a job and hire one , three or 500 humans ; software can now literally assemble an army overnight to solve complex problems . "
" More powerfully , software might use this API to improve itself , perhaps even perpetually , " he continued .
" Imagine a trivial example of software that controls a store selling virtual goods ; the software might be able to stock the store full of content using the API , soliciting humans to generate more content and retaining the freelancers whose content sells .
Provided the store continues to make a profit ( or has money in the bank to pay freelancers ) , this might continue perpetually .
We look forward to where this might take us . "

Prensa Latina
April 20 , 2010 -- Cochabamba , Bolivia -- Bolivia 's President Evo Morales
Ayma condemned the capitalist system in the opening session of the World People 's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth today .
Morales , speaking at the April 20 conference inauguration , started his speech with a slogan , " Planet or death , we shall overcome " .
He said that harmony with nature could not exist while 1 per cent of the world 's population concentrates more than 50 per cent of the world 's riches .
Capitalism is the main enemy of the Earth , only looking for profits , to the detriment of nature , and capitalism is a bridge for social inequality .
More than 15,000 representatives from five continents were present at the Esteban Ramirez Ecological Stadium in Tuquipaya when Morales read a letter to future generations to alert of the danger the planet faces .
The letter , written by Morales , said the Earth is giving signals by means of earthquakes , seaquakes , tsunamis , hurricanes , droughts and typhoons , so there is a great need to protect the planet .
In his letter , Morales called the attention to climate migrants , 50 million people going from one place to another , a number that could increase to up to 200 million in 2050 , because of negative environmental impacts .
Bolivia 's president called on the peoples of the world to join together to face those who kill people and purchase weapons .
If capitalism is not changed or eliminated , measures adopted to defend Mother Earth will be precarious and temporary .
Morales criticised the 15th UN climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark , as a place where the voices of entire peoples and social organisations were not heard .
" It is necessary that the UN member countries listen and respect the will of the peoples of the world " , he said .
He confirmed the creation of an alternative organisation of the peoples of the world in defence of nature .
The World People 's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth will conclude on April 22 with the celebration of International Day for the Mother Earth at the Felix Capriles Stadium in Cochabamba , Bolivia .
This is a Bolivian proposal approved by the UN General Assembly in
2009 .
According to the Bolivarian Information Agency , taking part in the summit are the presidents of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Ecuador , Rafael Correa ; Paraguay , Fernando Lugo ; Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega ; and Bolivia , Evo Morales .
Also present are two Nobel laureates : Argentinean Adolfo Perez Esquivel and Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu , among other personalities .
More than 50 scientists , social movement leaders , researchers , academics and artists have agreed to speak on 14 panels , including NASA scientist Jim Hansen ; Bill McKibben , environmental journalist and leader of 350.org ; Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva ; best - selling author Naomi Klein ; Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano ; Miguel D’Escoto , former president of the UN General Assembly ; Lumumba Di-Aping , former lead negotiator for the G77 ; along with leaders from leading environmental organisations and communities at the frontline of climate change .
Democracy Now ! : Evo Morales Opens Climate Change Conference in Tiquipaya
April 21 , 2010 -- Democracy Now !
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re broadcasting from Tiquipaya , just outside Cochabamba .
And today we are going to be joined by the hour — for the hour by Bolivian President Evo Morales .
But first , we go to the opening day of the global conference on the World Peoples ’ Summit on Climate Change and Rights of Mother Earth .
As the peoples ’ climate change talks here move into their third day , thousands of participants from across Latin America and around the world are streaming into the small Bolivian town of Tiquipaya to discuss how to slow the impact of global warming .
Anjali Kamat and Rick Rowley filed this report on Tuesday ’s opening ceremony .
ANJALI KAMAT : Fifteen thousand people from around the world gathered under the hot Andean sun on Tuesday morning for the official opening of the World Peoples ’ Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth .
Bolivian music , indigenous ceremonies and the Bolivian army ’s honor guard were on hand to greet the first indigenous president of the Plurinational State of Bolivia , Evo Morales .
PRESIDENT EVO MORALES : [ translated ]
People of the world , honor guard of Bolivia , greetings .
ANJALI KAMAT : In a forty - minute address , President Morales outlined the failures of Copenhagen and Bolivia ’s alternative proposals to tackle climate change .
He warned that the world faced a stark choice between capitalism and survival .
PRESIDENT EVO MORALES : [ translated ]
We are here because in Copenhagen the so - called developed countries failed in their obligation to provide substantial commitments to reduce greenhouse gases .
We have two paths : either Pachamama or death .
We have two paths : either capitalism dies or Mother Earth dies .
Either capitalism lives or Mother Earth lives .
Of course , brothers and sisters , we are here for life , for humanity and for the rights of Mother Earth .
Long live the rights of Mother Earth !
Death to capitalism !
ANJALI KAMAT : The Bolivian government has promised to present the outcomes of this popular conference to the 192 nations involved in the official UN climate change discussions .
Participants said they hope this conference would have a greater political impact in the UN - sponsored talks .
CONFERENCE PARTICIPANT : [ translated ]
Copenhagen basically was by and for the authorities .
It was for the leaders of the countries .
This is a gathering of the people .
And as people who suffer the consequences , we share our concerns and our expectations .
This is a movement .
It is a first step to mobilize the whole world , to search for another kind of civilization , another kind of relationship with nature .
And I think that if we , the people , come together , we can generate a worldwide movement .
That is the road we are on .
ANJALI KAMAT : Social movements , indigenous organizations , environmental groups , labor unions and individual activists from five continents have flooded into the small town of Tiquipaya in the last few days to take part in the summit .
Saeed Ali Mousavi is a religious student from Iran .
SAEED ALI MOUSAVI : [ translated ]
We need to change the world .
We need to destroy capitalism .
And we can .
All the people united here show that it is possible and that we can do this .
We are all people who cannot and do not want to accept that capitalism is the global power .
LESLIE BORGES : [ translated ]
My name is Leslie Borges of Brazil .
The summit is very important because it is one of the few times that people bring their struggles , their flags and their opinions directly to decision makers .
This is a unique moment .
SPIRITCHILD : My name is Spiritchild .
I ’m from the artist and activist collective called Movement in Motion , grassroots organization .
Basically we ’re — we use hip - hop to document social movements .
We talk about the bus depots in Harlem , all the smoke and the smog that ’s coming through to the South Bronx , so we have asthma .
And we talk about the connections between South Bronx asthma to Katrina disasters to the Maldives , Tuvalu , and , you know , things of that issue , and , you know , connecting to climate change , so trying to have a global movement , express it through hip - hop , through social arts and things of that nature .
And hopefully we can keep this going .
CARLOS ARRIEN : My name is Carlos Arrien , and my organization is BoliviaSol .
This small country of eight million people could throw a gauntlet and stand on its feet and say , you know , this stuff about Mother Nature is not just quaint , it ’s not just beautiful , it ’s not just nice .
It ’s real .
And we have to do something about it .
And here is — you know , here is Tiquipaya , and here is , you know , this and that , and we ’re going to make it happen and open the door to the participation of people who have been shut out of this process of coming to terms with , you know , global warming and climate change .
So it ’s an extraordinary event , and that ’s why we ’re here .

I came here to Cochabamba for this conference with a group of folks that are from indigenous communities , as well as underrepresented communities across the United States .
And the reason that we wanted to come to Bolivia is because historically these climate conversations are happening without our voices being at the table .
And that ca n’t continue .
This has to — in order for it to work , the solutions have to really include everyone ’s voice , and especially demographically , as the numbers are changing in the United States , we have to be at the table .
And I think what makes this conference different than what we saw in Copenhagen is that we ’re here .
In Copenhagen we were n’t here .
And if you talk to people around here , everyone shares the common vision that we are the ones we ’re waiting for .
We share the vision that we are the ones that can create the solution , all the way from the president to all of us who are here as individuals representing different organizations and the grassroots .
We all believe now that we can do it together in solidarity .

Planeta o Muerte — Evo Morales and the Revolutionary Politics of Mother Earth By Roberto Lovato , New America Media via CMPCC April 21 , 2010 — Bolivia — Bolivian President Evo Morales seems testier today than when he told me during a 2007 interview , " For 500 years , we have had patience . "
The urgency felt by Morales and the more than 15,000 people from 150 nations attending the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth ( CMPCC ) was evident from the first sentences uttered by the host and convener of this unprecedented gathering in Tiquipaya , a small town just north of Cochabamba , home of the historic “ water war ” that helped sweep Morales into power .
In a 21rst century twist on “ Revolucion o Muerte ” ( revolution or death ) , the slogan that powered Latin American revolutionary movements of the '60s and ' 70s , the generally soft - spoken Morales opened the conference by shouting “ Planeta o muerte ! ” ( planet or death ) .
Morales slogan drew raucous responses from the diverse and mostly dark - skinned crowd filling a stadium that bore more flags of Indigenous nations than it did of nation states like Bolivia .
Having sung just prior to Morales invocation the song “ Oye - amigo - tu - tierra - esta - en - peligro ” ( Listen friend , your earth is in danger ) , a variation on the Spanish language version of “ The people united will never be defeated ” , the crowd was ready to accept Morales ’ challenge .
Morales choice of opening words as well as his convening of this unprecedented global mobilisation reflects less a greening of revolutionary movements or a revolutionising of green movements , and more of something else , something even more ambitious : inspiring a new era in hemispheric and global politics , one that fuses the best of Indigenous , leftist , labour , environmentalist and other movements in the effort to save Panchamama ( Mother Earth ) .
The welcome from the President of the Plurinational State of Bulibiya ( Bolivia in Quechua ) also marks another stage in the remarkable rise of an Indigenous former coca - grower and immigrant ( Morales migrated to Argentina in his youth ) who has become the de-facto leader of this hybrid global movement that links the rights of humans to what organisers have coined the “ Universal Rights of Mother Earth . ”
“ Without equilibrium between people , there will be no equilibrium between humans and nature ” , said Morales , who proposed the CMPCC following what he and all attendees here consider the failure of the top - down driven Copenhagen round of climate talks to secure commitments to emissions reductions that will keep temperature rises to less than 2 degrees centigrade .
The unapologetically anti-capitalist philosophy , program and approach of the CMPCC and Morales ( i.e. “ Either capitalism dies or Mother Earth dies ” ) stand in direct conflict with the approach taken by the leaders of industrial nations behind the Copenhagen agreement .
Critics came to Tiquipaya , a suburb of Cochabamaba , out of dismay with the “ Copenhagen consensus , ” which was brokered behind closed doors and rapidly ratified with little time for discussion and no connection to issues being discussed here : climate migration , agriculture and food sovereignty , climate debt , Indigenous peoples and 14 other issues organisers say they will push during the next round of UN - sponsored climate talks taking place in Mexico this November .
Also reflecting the alternative cosmovision ( world view ) of the burgeoning movement are proposals for the creation of , among other things , a climate justice tribunal that would establish an international legal framework to criminalise and punish those perpetrating climate crimes against the rights of Mother Earth and humanity .
Filling the air of the Tiquipaya and rooting all of the proposals of the CMPCC is what writer Eduardo Galeano called in a statement read by the Uruguayan ambassador to Bolivia , “ the voices of the past that speak to the future ” .
Sponsoring a conference with the radical approach of the CMPCC puts Morales , the first Indigenous head of state in Bolivia , a majority Indigenous country , in direct conflict with another head of state whose election marked a historic political and racial shift , US President Barack Obama , who also played an active role in the Copenhagen “ consensus “ .
The failure of Copenhagen caused Evo Morales and other leaders on climate change to call for the ( CMPCC ) conference ” , said Lim Li Lin , senior legal and environment researcher at the Third World Network , a global rights group based in Malaysia .
“ By leading Copenhagen , Obama helped provide a platform for the alternative leadership of the movement led by President Morales . ”
The growing conflict between the political interests and agendas embodied by Obama and Morales was on full display recently as the United States decided to cut aid for climate change to Bolivia , Ecuador and other countries opposed to the Copenhagen accord .
Representatives of some of the governments attending the conference also told me that the Obama administration and other industrialised nations were applying pressure on countries not to attend the CMPCC .
And , though he may not intend it , Morales ' leadership of the revolutionary movement for the rights of Mother Earth also appears to be overshadowing ( at least momentarily ) the hemispheric and global left leadership of his ally and fellow conference attendee , Hugo Chavez , who has received similar treatment from the Obama administration around drug enforcement and other aid .
Bursting with enthusiasm under the blaring hot sun filling the stadium that shook with chants of “ Ole , ole , ole , ole , Evo , Evo ” , Marcelina Vargas , a Quechua - speaking member of the Peasant Confederation of Peru , accepted Morales ’ Planeta o Muerte ( Kay Pa Chachu o wanyuychu in Quechua ) .
“ For our people , for everybody , water is life .
In Peru , we ’re defending Panchamama ( Mother Earth ) from companies with US and Canadian investments , companies that are contaminating our water ” , said Vargas , who wore one of the ubiquitous hats and ponchos seen throughout the region .
“ Evo is an expression of our movement and I feel happy he ’s helping the world see our ways . ”
Save the planet from capitalism , Morales says By Franz Chávez Cochabamba , Bolivia -- April 21 , 2010 -- IPS via PWCCC – Activists meeting at the people ’s conference on climate change in this Bolivian city booed a message from United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon but cheered at host President Evo Morales ’s chant of “ planet or death ! ”
A football stadium in Tiquipaya , in the suburbs of Cochabamba , was inflamed Tuesday ( April 20 ) with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius and the fervour of around 20,000 environmental activists and delegates from 125 nations .
But although they were invited , presidents from the region failed to show up for the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , which ends April 22 .
The stadium , ablaze with the multi-coloured traditional garments of different Andean and Amazonian native communities and the flags of people from different countries around the world that contrasted with the cold formality of presidential summits , served as the stage for Morales , of Aymara descent , to call for an “ inter - continental movement ” in defence of Mother Earth .
The UN secretary - general ’s message , read out by the head of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) , Alicia Bárcena , on the first day of the people ’s conference , was interrupted by catcalls and whistles from activists in protest against the exclusion of grassroots groups from policy making on climate change .
“ We came with all respect to listen to the people , you invited us here .
If you do n’t want us to be here we can leave , ” Bárcena said .
“ For capitalism , we are merely consumers and a source of labour , and we have the right to say capitalism is the enemy of the planet ” , Morales said , buoyed up by the cheers of the thousands of participants who have flocked to the dusty streets of this outlying Cochabamba district that is home to around 3000 people .
“ Justice is only possible with solidarity , equality and respect for the rights of Mother Earth and for the atmosphere , water and the new model of development ” , he said .
“ Capitalism is the chief enemy of humanity , synonymous with inequality and destruction of the planet ” , he said , calling on people to organise at the grassroots level to save the planet .
Morales suggested starting with simple steps like the use of biodegradable kitchen utensils like clay plates instead of disposable plastic .
He also lashed out at transgenic crops and junk food .
Ecuadorean Indigenous leader Franklin Columba concurred with Morales , saying that reaching a balance with nature was essential to saving Pachamama or Mother Earth .
“ The Council of Wise Elders says that care and love are needed to keep nature clean .
That is the true awareness that human beings must achieve ” , he told IPS as the delegates to the conference were enjoying Afro-Bolivian and traditional Andean music .
Nicolás Charca , a Quechua Indian from the Canchis province of Peru , talked about unifying the movements , and expressed deep concern over pollution caused by the oil and mining industries .
But “ not only the developed countries are to blame ” , Mitsu Miura , a Japanese researcher into Andean cultures , told IPS in a friendly tone .
“ We would be closing our eyes if we only held the industrialised countries responsible . ”
Linda Velarde from New Mexico in the southwestern United States , who has been an Indigenous rights activist for 40 years , challenged participants to take action now and stop consuming products that pollute .
She said she does not agree with the idea of eliminating capitalism , and pointed out that not everyone in the US is a consumerist and that many are in favour , for example , of reforestation policies .
Another activist from the US , Kety Esquivel with Latinos in Social Media , said capitalism has committed “ abuses ” because money , which was created for use as an exchange mechanism , ended up using people instead .
“ I ’m gringa , Mexican and Guatemalan ” , Esquivel told IPS , describing her multi-ethnic origin and her stance in favour of humanity as a whole .
Voice of civil society loud and clear in Cochabamba
By Daniela Estrada
April 19 , 2010 -- Tierramérica via Bolivia Rising --
The success of the climate change conference taking place in the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba will depend on how unified civil society ultimately is in its efforts to influence the next United Nations climate summit , in Mexico , say Latin American activists .
The World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , April 19 - 22 , convened by Bolivia 's President Evo Morales , is expected to bring together some 12,000 people from 130 countries , including international personalities , representatives from citizens ' groups and government officials .
The bulk of the debate will be led by civil society , which tends to oppose the market - based mechanisms proposed by most governments to fight climate change , and this is fuelling doubts about just how much impact the Bolivian forum will have on the official climate talks taking place within the United Nations .
Only presidents who are close to Morales are attending the Cochabamba conference , such as Rafael Correa of Ecuador , Fernando Lugo of Paraguay , Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela .
Other governments , like those of Brazil and Chile , will not participate .
" I think it 's a very important space for coming together , where it will be possible to discuss and come to agreement on our positions and strategies , but that depends on the organisations that participate " , Colombian Lydia Fernanda Forero , member of the council of the Hemispheric Social Alliance , told Tierramérica .
The Hemispheric Social Alliance , an umbrella of grassroots organisations and networks from Canada to Chile , will have a greater presence in Cochabamba than it did at Klimaforum 2009 , the civil society summit held in December in parallel to the Copenhagen 15th Conference of Parties ( COP 15 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change .
" Thanks to ( President ) Morales we have a rainbow of social and political entities behind this issue that we could n't have even dreamed of four months ago " , including student and labour groups , said Eduardo Giesen , the Latin America coordinator of Friends of the Earth International 's climate justice program .
For Alejandro Yianello , of Argentina 's Piuké Ecologist Association , " it 's an advance that there are other actors discussing the issue " besides those associated with COP 15 .
He told Tierramérica that he applauds the Cochabamba conference 's shift of the focus towards " the rights of Mother Earth . "
Massioli , of the Brazil 's Movement of Landless Rural Workers ( MST , Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra ) and of Vía Campesina International , said in an interview with Tierramérica that the conference will not be a " trade fair " but rather " an important space for information , reflection , dialogue and coordination among peoples " .
The conference 's 17 working groups will deal with issues like the structural causes of global warming and the Bolivian proposal to create an international tribunal for climate justice and convene a climate referendum of the peoples of the world .
Also up for discussion is the situation of Indigenous peoples and of " climate migrants " , and possible solutions for financing the transfer of technologies necessary for communities to adapt to the effects of climate change .
" Morales 's call synthesises what many social movements in Latin America have been proposing in a fragmented way " , which poses a big challenge to the organisations , said Lucio Cuenca , director of the Latin American Observatory of Environmental Conflicts , in Chile .
Mexico , which will host the COP 16 in December 2010 -- an effort to reverse the failure of the Copenhagen meet -- is represented in Cochabamba by delegates from at least seven environmental groups .
" Our general proposal is to say ' no ' to the false solutions against climate change offered by nearly all governments , such as market mechanisms that do not have mitigating effects " , Miguel Valencia , an organiser of Klimaforum 2009 , told Tierramérica .
" Cochabamba can be a democratic space for developing organisational capacity to build accord within civil society " , said Claudia Gómez , of the non-governmental Mexican Centre for Environmental Law .
But not everyone sees this forum as an opportunity to strengthen civil society 's role in the climate change debate .
The non-governmental Wildlife ( Vida Silvestre ) Foundation , which last month in Argentina led the campaign to turn out the lights to fight climate change , will not participate in the conference " due to budget issues " and because " it is more a meeting for indigenous organisations " , said foundation member María José Pachá .
" It 's not a UN meeting " , she said .
Hernán Giardini , delegate from Greenpeace Argentina , is participating in the Bolivia meeting , but told Tierramérica that he hopes it does n't turn into an alternative process to that of the UN .
It is the United Nations where decisions are made , he said .
In contrast , the director of the non-governmental Sustainable Chile Program , Sara Larraín , believes the Cochabamba conference represents precisely the possibility of recuperating " international democratic governability " , given the failure of the official talks .
" We believe the people 's conference is a fundamental space because if a pole of subversion and response is not created , and if we do n't take the floor from the governments , there is no possibility that the negotiations will advance " , Larraín stated to Tierramérica .
" We are going with the expectation of the creation of a genuine social and popular movement that takes up the environmental questions -- in this case the climate crisis -- as a social and socio-political problem , and that it is constituted beyond the non-governmental environmental organisations " , said Friends of the Earth 's Giesen .

Abstract The Hawaiian Islands are an ideal location to study the response of tropical forests to climate variability because of their extreme isolation in the middle of the Pacific , which makes them especially sensitive to El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) .
Most research examining the response of tropical forests to drought or El Niño have focused on rainforests , however , tropical dry forests cover a large area of the tropics and may respond very differently than rainforests .
We use satellite - derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) from February 2000 - February 2009 to show that rainforests and dry forests in the Hawaiian Islands exhibit asynchronous responses in leaf phenology to seasonal and El Niño - driven drought .
Dry forest NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation compared to rainforest NDVI .
Rainforest cloud frequency was negatively correlated with the degree of asynchronicity ( Δ NDVI ) between forest types , most strongly at a 1 - month lag .
Rainforest green - up and dry forest brown - down was particularly apparent during the 2002–003 El Niño .
The spatial pattern of NDVI response to the NINO 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature ( SST ) index during 2002 –2003 showed that the leeward side exhibited significant negative correlations to increased SSTs , whereas the windward side exhibited significant positive correlations to increased SSTs , most evident at an 8 to 9 - month lag .
This study demonstrates that different tropical forest types exhibit asynchronous responses to seasonal and El Niño - driven drought , and suggests that mechanisms controlling dry forest leaf phenology are related to water - limitation , whereas rainforests are more light - limited .

Introduction
The response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability such as El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) serves as an important analogy for ecosystem responses to projected future climate change .
Tropical ecosystems are particularly important for understanding the mechanisms of vegetation response to climate change because they are undergoing rapid change [ 1 ] and play a unique role in the global carbon cycle [ 2 ] .
One study has shown that net primary production has been increasing in recent years with the largest increase occurring in tropical ecosystems , most likely due to declining cloud cover and associated increase in solar radiation [ 3 ] .
Most research examining the response of tropical forests to drought or El Niño have focused on rainforests in the Amazon [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , Panama [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] or Southeast Asia [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , even though tropical dry forests cover a large area of the tropics and may respond very differently compared to rainforests .
One of the few studies that included different forest types was by Condit et al . [ 10 ] .
They assessed the growth and mortality of tree species across a precipitation gradient in a Panamanian tropical forest .
Contrary to the response of Southeast Asian forests , mortality was not elevated at wet and intermediate forests during the 1998 El Niño drought , but was at the dry forest site .
Instead , tree growth was observed to be higher during 1998 and this was hypothesized to be related to increased photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR ) during the 1998 El Niño , consistent with the relationship between light and forest phenology proposed by Wright and van Schaik [ 13 ] .
Recent controversy over satellite - observed dry season green - up in Amazon forests has highlighted the lack of understanding of tropical forest productivity and their response to drought , ENSO , and projected future climate change [ 14 ] .
The difficulty in interpreting forest response to drought in the Amazon may be attributed to different methods in processing the satellite data [ 14 ] and apparent inconsistencies between satellite - observed green - up [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and plot - based evidence of mortality and biomass loss [ 7 ] .
The Amazon basin is subject to large fires , contributing to increased aerosols , which may confound the effect of cloud cover on incoming solar radiation [ 15 ] .
Additionally , the hydrologic cycle of the Amazon basin has been shown to be unique , recycling a significant portion of its own precipitation from evaporation in the same basin [ 16 ] .
Thus changes in solar radiation attributed to cloud cover may be unique to the Amazon basin .
Previous studies have hypothesized that an increase in cloud cover during the wet season explained a decline in productivity , but did not include cloud data .
For these reasons it remains unclear whether a reduction in clouds during a drought results in increased productivity , and if this mechanism is specific to the large expanses of Amazonian forests .
The Hawaiian Islands are an ideal location to study the response of tropical forests to climate variations because of their extreme isolation in the middle of the Pacific , which makes them unique as signals for climate variability [ 17 ] .
The greatest source of interannual climate variability in the Hawaiian Islands is ENSO [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
El Niños result in drought - like conditions for the Hawaiian Islands and increased precipitation during La Niña , in part because they receive a majority of their precipitation from the northeast trade winds , but also because they are located in the subsidence zone of the Hadley cell [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] .
Greater subsidence is expected to correspond to a reduction in cloud cover during El Niño events .
Both tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests occur in Hawaii and these forests offer clear signals of forest phenology and productivity response to tropical Pacific climate variations such as ENSO .
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) from satellite data is capable of measuring photosynthetic activity and seasonal to interannual changes in leaf cover as measures of forest leaf phenology .
NDVI is a ratio between the red and infrared spectral regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to be associated with photosynthetic activity [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] and aboveground net primary productivity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
In this paper we examine the NDVI of rainforests and dry forests and examine its relationship to precipitation and cloud cover during seasonal and El Niño - driven drought .
We test the hypothesis that rainforests and dry forests exhibit different responses to drought and that this difference is attributed to a reduction in clouds over rainforests .
Methods Satellite data Terra MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ) NDVI from the Vegetation Indices ( VI ) 16 - day 250 - m product ( MOD13Q1 ) Collection 5 was used to assess leaf phenology from February 2000 - February 2009 .
Pixel quality filtering conformed exactly to Samanta et al . [ 14 ] , who have challenged methods in other satellite studies .
Valid pixels had a “ MODLAND_QA ” flag equal to 0 ( “ good quality ” ) or 1 ( “ check other QA ” ) .
Checking “ other QA ” included filtering out data with clouds ( adjacent cloud , mixed clouds , and possible shadow ) , aerosols ( high and climatology aerosols ) , and possible shadow .
Pixels centered over fifteen dry forest sites , which occur within regions where potential evapotranspiration ( PET ) exceeds mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) as defined by Price et al . [ 28 ] , were averaged for a representative dry forest phenology time - series ( Figure 1 ) .
Dry forest sites were selected based on their dominance of native species , location in a managed and protected area versus private land , and closed - canopy cover .
Pixels centered over nine rainforest sites were averaged for a representative rainforest phenology .
Rainforest sites were selected from the 2008 Hawaii GAP Analysis Program ( HI - GAP ) vegetation data from locations that were native species - dominated , closed - canopy , and with at least 30 % of the NDVI data passing the VI quality threshold above .

Nine rainforest ( blue ) and fifteen dry forest ( red ) sites across six of the main Hawaiian Islands with precipitation isohyets ( black lines ) .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011325.g001
Cloud frequency over each rainforest pixel was identified using the “ Clear_sky_days ” layer in MODIS Land Surface Temperature ( LST ) 8 - day 1 - km product ( MOD11A2 ) Collection 5 .
This layer is defined using the MODIS Cloud Mask product ( MOD35 _L2 ) algorithm , which is based on a combination of multiple visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests including spectral regions not used for NDVI .
Clear - sky pixels at a confidence of ≥ 95 % over land ≤ 2000 m and ≥ 66 % over land > 2000 m , plus an examination of 32 - day temporal variations , are provided for each day in the 8 - day LST dataset [ 29 ] .
Days that did not pass the binary ( yes / no ) clear - sky test ( “ Clear Sky ” flag = 1 ) were totaled for each 8 - day period at each rainforest site , averaged over all rainforest sites , and then averaged by month , which is referred to as cloud frequency .
Precipitation and SST data Hydronet archived precipitation data from NWS NOAA were averaged into monthly totals from original 15 - minute data .
Representative leeward ( dry side of islands ) precipitation was created from an average of fourteen stations on the leeward sides of Oahu , Molokai , Maui , Lanai , and Big Island , and representative windward ( wet side of islands ) precipitation was an average of eight stations on the windward sides of Kauai , Oahu , Maui , and Big Island .
Although the Hydronet archive includes more stations , some had considerable data quality issues such as missing data for an entire month , therefore not all Hydronet stations were included in the analyses .
Leeward stations and windward stations were all significantly ( P≤0.05 ) and positively associated within each group .
The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) Optimum Interpolation ( OI ) version 2 ( v2 ) NINO 1.2 , 3 , 3.4 , and 4 Sea Surface Temperature ( SST ) indices ( generated using in situ and satellite SSTs as well as SSTs simulated by sea ice cover ) were used to assess El Niño or La Niña conditions .
Pearson correlations were performed to determine the association between SST and precipitation during ENSO events .
Data analysis NDVI anomalies were calculated by subtracting each 16 - day composite value from the 9 - year mean ( February 2000 – February 2009 ) of that day and then anomalies were averaged into monthly values .
Precipitation anomalies were calculated by subtracting monthly averages from the 9 - year mean .
The annual mean , minimum , maximum , and minimum subtracted from maximum were calculated for NDVI and precipitation anomalies , as well as annual cumulative precipitation totals .
Spearman rank correlation tests were used to assess the relationship between rainforest and dry forest NDVI and precipitation for each year .
The degree of asynchronicity in rainforest and dry forest NDVI was identified by subtracting dry forest NDVI from rainforest NDVI using 3 - month moving averages , which we have defined as Δ NDVI .
Thus , the greater the difference between dry forest and rainforest NDVI , the greater the value of Δ NDVI .
Pearson product moment correlations were calculated between Δ NDVI and rainforest cloud frequency .
Maps of Spearman rank correlations were produced on a pixel - by - pixel basis between monthly NDVI anomalies and NINO 3.4 SST index during the 2002 –2003 El Niño .
Discussion
We have identified asynchronous rainforest and dry forest responses in leaf phenology to seasonal and El Niño - driven drought .
Although both rainforest and dry forest regions experienced reduced precipitation during the 2002 –2003 El Niño , only dry forests exhibited a brown - down response .
Rainforests exhibited a green - up and this coincided with a reduction in cloud frequency and greater asynchronous leaf phenology ( Δ NDVI ) .
Berlin et al. [ 30 ] observed that certain cloud forest tree species on Maui showed peaked leafing during the dry season , which coincided with peaks in temperature and solar irradiance .
In Neotropical rainforests experimental tests of light limitation from cloud cover [ 9 ] , plot - based inventories on tree growth and mortality [ 10 ] , and flux tower evidence of higher incident radiation during dry periods [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] provide supporting evidence that a reduction in cloud cover can increase incoming solar radiation , which results in enhanced forest productivity during dry periods .
Our results suggest a similar explanation for Hawaiian rainforest green - up during drought .
An alternative explanation for dry season green - up in Hawaiian rainforests is related to nutrient availability , which has been shown to decline at high levels of precipitation [ 33 ] .
Results from a precipitation gradient on Maui demonstrated a reduction in net primary productivity ( NPP ) in very wet regions ( > 3500 –4000 mm / yr ) consistent with a decline in nutrient cycling , particularly nitrogen availability [ 33 ] .
Additionally , the decline of epiphytes in cloud forests was observed during the 1982 –1983 El Niño on Maui [ 17 ] , which could result in a green - up during drought if epiphytes covering green leaves dampened spectral greenness .
In spite of these alternative hypotheses , our results show a consistent NDVI pattern related to clouds .
We do not argue that rainforests are drought insensitive but reveal a more complicated process of both light and water limitations on photosynthesis .
For example , the very dry summers of 2007 and 2008 show lower rainforest NDVI values relative to the 9 - year mean , and importantly there is no corresponding decline in clouds during this period .
Understanding of tropical dry forest response to drought is consistent with the browning - down observed in the satellite NDVI .
Neotropical dry forests are known to respond to water limitations during drought [ 34 ] , [ 10 ] .
There have been few studies of Hawaiian dry forest phenology , but Stratton et al . [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] showed that many dry forest trees obtain water from shallow soils and thus are more vulnerable to drought .
Van Riper III [ 37 ] described species - specific differences in dryland species on Mauna Kea , Big Island with some species showing the greatest canopy density during the dry summer months , while other species were more tightly coupled with precipitation .
Reconciling inconsistencies between satellite observations , flux tower measurements , and plot - based surveys will require further understanding of what spectral greenness indicates in terms of carbon storage and plant growth .
One important difference may be that measurements of woody biomass are capturing a slower turnover pool compared to leaves and litter , which is a faster turnover pool [ 38 ] , [ 32 ] .
However , equally as important is attention to differences in species composition , species - specific traits , species diversity , and forest type .
Condit et al. [ 39 ] , [ 10 ] have identified important differences in the drought response of forest species between size classes ( saplings vs. large trees ) , life history ( light - gap specialists vs. generalists ) , and forest types ( dry vs. wet forests ) that impede a generalized understanding of tropical forest response to drought .
Huete et al . [ 4 ] contrasted responses from pastures , which exhibited dry season declines in EVI ( Enhanced Vegetation Index ) , to intact forests showing dry season boosts in EVI .
They suggested that the removal of deep - rooted trees in land converted to pasture reduced access to deep soil water .
However , in Hawaii large regions showing a brown - down response to El Niño are forests and shrublands , as well as grasslands and pastures .
Asynchronous response was related to the wet - dry habitat transition , not forest - grassland transition .
Nonetheless it remains unclear what the roles of species - specific traits , demography , life history , and other biological factors play on the asynchronous phenology of these forest types .
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that Hawaiian rainforests and dry forests exhibit asynchronous leaf phenology during seasonal and El Niño - driven drought .
During dry seasons , dry forest NDVI showed decreasing greenness while rainforest NDVI showed increasing greenness .
Dry forest NDVI was more tightly coupled with precipitation compared to rainforest NDVI .
The degree of asynchronicity between forest types ( Δ NDVI ) was negatively correlated with cloud frequency , most strongly at a 1 - month lag .
Our results suggest that a reduction in clouds over the rainforest during dry periods may have increased solar radiation resulting in a dry season green - up .
Rainforest green - up and dry forest brown - down was particularly apparent during the 2002 –2003 El Niño , which was a period of low precipitation and few clouds .
The spatial pattern of NDVI response to the NINO 3.4 SST index showed that the leeward side exhibited significant negative correlations to increased SSTs , whereas the windward side exhibited significant positive correlations to increased SSTs , most evident at an 8 to 9 - month lag .
This study demonstrates that different tropical forest types exhibit asynchronous responses to seasonal and El Niño - driven drought , and suggests that mechanisms controlling dry forest leaf phenology are related to water - limitation , whereas rainforests are more light - limited .

This time , it 's a pair of Bat - eared Fox pups photographed just days ago by In Cherl Kim .
Bat - eared Foxes are mostly nocturnal animals that live in small groups consisting of mated pairs and their young .
The pairs live in dens and typically raise two to five pups together .
Mated pairs are very social and are monogamous , although it is unknown if they mate for life .

God , this is depressing .
The industrial sector is just about extinct , corporations are fleeing the country to exploit cheap foreign labor , unions are gasping their last breaths , and 6.8 million Americans have been unemployed 27 weeks , or longer ( the numbers are higher in places like Detriot , which has 30 percent unemployment , but the media does n’t really focus on that reality ) .
But there is good news !
Well , kind of .
If your trade is oil spill clean - up , you ’re experiencing a bonanza right now .
Hundreds of contractors and subcontractors are doing jobs both complex and mundane , whether it ’s building the robots that BP sends 5,000 feet underwater to capture live video of the broken wellhead or providing boats to skim oil from the water ’s surface .
And then there is the cottage industry that has sprung up overnight to support the 24,600 cleanup workers , catering their meals , hauling away their trash and supplying portable toilets .
“ There ’s money flowing in the streets , ” said Michael E. Hoffman , director of research at Wunderlich Securities , a Memphis - based brokerage firm .
America may be losing the race to evolve technology , and alternative fuels , but at least we still lead the way in creating horrible catastrophes that our unemployed masses can then toil to clean up .
Ever the barometer of compassionate altruism , Wall Street immediately rushed to figure out who would be the winners of the BP disaster .
The financial sector does n’t price superfluous biological waste like sea turtles , or oceans because things like endangered pelicans do n’t make the right people money .
However , Wall Street does know how to price stuff like hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic dispersants .
Within two weeks of the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion , the stock price of Clean Harbors , a Boston - based hazardous - waste management company , shot up more than 20 percent .
During the same period , Nalco Holding Co. , which makes the chemical dispersant Corexit , rose to nearly a year high .
Sure , Nalco , made a killing during the disaster .
It helps that one of its board members , Rodney F. Chase , is a former BP board member .
That cozy relationship provides Nalco with unique access to the big business of oil spill cleanup .
The Wapost article does n’t mention that stuff ( why get messy ? ) but it does include this nugget :
The cleanup business wo n’t necessarily see a bonanza , however , because margins can be low in the industry .
And stock prices of both Clean Harbors and Nalco have come down since their highs , especially after critics began questioning whether Nalco ’s product Corexit was too toxic to be used in the ocean .
Yeah , that whole “ poisoning the oceans ” thing can be a real downer .
Meanwhile , the EPA has quietly released the full list of ingredients of Corexit 9500 and Corexit 9527 .
The list includes 1,2 - Propanediol ; 2 - butoxy - ethanol ; 2 - sulfo-Butanedioic acid , 1,4 - bis ( 2 - ethylhexyl ) ester , sodium salt ( 1:1 ) ; Sorbitan , mono -( 9Z ) - 9-octadecenoate ; Sorbitan , mono - ( 9Z ) - 9- octadecenoate , poly ( oxy - 1,2 - ethanediyl ) derivss . ; Sorbitan , tri -( 9Z ) - 9-octadecenoate , poly ( oxy - 1,2- ethanediyl ) derivs ; 2 - Propanol , 1-(2- butoxy - 1- methylethoxy ) - ; and Distillates ( petroleum ) , hydrotreated light . …
The independent watchdog group OMBWatch cites the New Jersey Department of Health to point out possible dangers of one of the the ingredients .
The document indicates 2 - butoxy - ethanol : “ may be absorbed through the skin ; should be handled as a CARCINOGEN–WITH EXTREME CAUTION ; can irritate the skin and eyes with possible eye damage ; can irritate the nose and throat ; can cause nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal pain .
can cause headache , dizziness , lightheadedness , and passing out and may damage the liver and kidneys . ”
Of course , Wall Street does n’t give a shit about kidneys because it ’s been illegal to buy or sell them in the U.S. since 1984 .
Perhaps if a kidney market existed , the giants of Flesh Industry would be crying to protect their fertile organ crops .
Alas , the human body can not be bought and sold as commodities , nor can sea turtles .
Nor can oceans .
And so we ’re witnessing a free - for - all where giant industries get to first poison our environment , and then make a killing as they “ clean it up , ” using poisons that make workers sick , and will inflict unknown consequences upon our environment .
While there ’s plenty of guilt to go around in the private sector , the government ’s performance is n’t any better .
Lisa Murkowski’s resolution to strip the EPA of its power to regulate carbon ( ! ) just barely failed 47 - 53 in the Senate .
I ’ll repeat that : Murkowski wanted to strip the EPA ( the Environmental Protection Agency ) of their job protecting the environment .
In a sense , even though organs markets have been illegal for over two decades , the US government sold its citizens and the environment to corporations a long time ago .
Companies like BP are free to recklessly drill in the ocean , kill 11 rig workers , dump tens of millions of gallons into its fragile ecosystem , kill and maim endangered species , and then poison humans .
All that matters is they keep drilling because the only product valued by Wall Street is the oil .
Everything else is just stuff in between the Big Players and the Profit .
The worst that happens is BP ’s CEO gets pulled into the White House for a firm “ talking to ” by the president , who really is at the mercy of these titans because they fund the Village ’s stupid electoral pageants .
It ’s the same kabuki theater we witnessed with Goldman Sachs .
Executives shuffle into a Senate hearing committee , look sheepish for a few hours , and then exit stage left to continue their pillaging .
Occasionally , when the serfs begin to mutter that something just does n’t feel right , and the leader looks too passive , the president ’s disgusting PR team tells him to say something transparently idiotic like he ’s going to “ kick some ass . ”
I ’d be happy with some regulation , but that seems less likely than Obama taking a 2×4 to Hayward ’s thick skull .
Actually , now that I ’ve typed that out , producing “ CEO stress dolls ” for unemployed Americans to bash the shit out of is a great idea .
You could have a Lloyd Blankfein doll , a Tony Hayward doll , a Don Blankenship doll , etc .
I love this idea .
They could be made in the USA , for the USA .
It ’ll create jobs and potentially launch an entire industry .
I will send all kinds of digital high - fives to anyone who photoshops a mockup of the CEO Dolls .

Drill , Baby , Drill ?
Public Is Saying No , Baby , No

The first political casualty of the Deepwater Horizon disaster appears to have been the quasi- populist fervor for increased offshore oil drilling :
Just a quarter of Americans back expanding offshore drilling in the wake of the BP oil spill , and most fault federal regulators for the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll .
(…)
Before the spill , the Obama administration lifted the moratorium on drilling in U.S. coastal waters as a way to address the country ’s energy needs .
But most Americans now want fewer offshore wells ( 31 percent ) or the amount kept at current levels ( 41 percent ) .
Perhaps as a consequence of the spill , public support for oil and gas drilling in general is also significantly lower than it was a year ago .
And as Americans have become increasingly skeptical about such exploration , some elected representatives are now questioning what the government is doing to ensure that offshore exploration can take place safely .
(…)
About half of the poll respondents , 49 percent , now see the gulf spill as part of a broader problem with such drilling .
Support for drilling in general has slipped from 64 percent last August to 52 percent now .
This massive swing in public opinion is also being mirrored in states directly affected by the spill like Florida , where a recent poll shows a majority of Florida voters opposing offshore oil drilling by a 51 % to 42 % margin .
Before the oil pill , the same poll had Florida voters favoring offshore drilling by a 66 % to 27 % margin .
None of this should come as a surprise .
As the spill became worse and worse by the day in the weeks after April 20th , it was fairly clear that the enthusiasm for offshore drilling , motivated mostly by the at - the - pump cost of gasoline , was not sufficiently deep to survive and environmental disaster of this scope , and that the natural reaction of the public would be to say that we need to take a step back and figure out what went wrong before blindly going off to “ Drill , Baby , Drill ” with the former Governor of Alaska .

There 's wind on the ground and over the water and filling the sky in a way God never , ever , intended ( WHOOOSH ) and -- as it spills out uncontrollably -- blowing at speeds ( WHOOOSH ) fast enough to lift up cows and houses and allegorical crones on bicycles I 'm reminded of the opening scene of the environmental disaster film The Wizard Of Oz .
( In fact FEMA is ( WHOOOSH ) dispatching the Army Corps of Engineers just in case someone gets trapped ( WHOOOSH ) under a house ! )
We got cell phone calls all over the ground ... fax transmissions smashed through the windshields of cars ... and iPhone data strewn from Sacramento to the Mexican boarder .
How in God 's name ( TUMBLEWEED BLOWS BY ) are we going to breathe with all this air in the air ?
How are we ( AUTOMOBILE BLOWS BY ) going to clean it up ?
How are animals going to survive when their natural habitat has been contaminated by all this 02 ?!
( THIS BEING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ...
FREE -RANGE BREAST IMPLANT BLOWS BY !)
And the State has been REALLY slow to respond .
YES , there are now kites in the air .
And YES the WSA ( Weathervain Society of America ) is rushing to the site with all the farm fowl inspired roof art that they have in their arsenal .
But why Governor Schwarzenegger has n't dispatched the hot air balloons ...
NOBODY KNOWS .
But the worse part ...
I now find out that some asshole in the GREEN MOVEMENT allowed these WIND FARMS to be built right near SOLAR FARMS and so ( WHOOOSH ) what is going to happen when all this extra wind somehow manages to DESTROY THE SOLAR FARM and ( WHOOOSH ) next thing we know ... we 're dealing with THE FUCKING SUN SPILLING ALL OVER THE DESERT !
WHY DIDN'T WE LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICANS AND STICK WITH A SAFE ENERGY SOURCE LIKE OIL !?!?!

Facebook is fixing a Web programming bug that could have allowed hackers to alter profile pages or make restricted information public .
The flaw was discovered last week and reported to Facebook by M.J. Keith , a senior security analyst with security firm Alert Logic .
The bug has to do with the way that Facebook checked to make sure that browsers connecting with the site were the ones they claimed to be .
Facebook 's servers use code called a " post_form_id " token to check that the browser trying to do something -- liking a group , for example -- was actually the browser that had logged into the account .
Facebook 's servers check this token before making any changes to the user 's page , but Keith discovered that when he simply deleted the token from messages , he could change many settings on any Facebook account .
" It 's like putting locks on a bunch of stuff but not locking them , " he said in an interview .
Keith could make users ' private information public , change or read profile information , even add new contact e-mail addresses , he said .
" It 's pretty bad ; you can do a lot of damage with it , " he said .
Facebook worked with Alert Logic to fix the bug , known as a cross - site request forgery ( CSRF ) , Facebook spokesman Simon Axten confirmed in an e-mail message .
" It 's now fixed , " he said .
" We 're not aware of any cases in which it was used maliciously . "
But as of late Tuesday afternoon , Pacific time , after Axten sent his e-mail , Facebook had not completely fixed the issue .
For testing purposes , Keith created a Web page with an invisible iFrame HTML element that he programmed in Javascript .
When the IDG News Service clicked on this page while logged into Facebook , it made the Facebook user automatically " like " several pages with no further interaction .
That 's pretty much how an attack would have worked , Keith said .
A victim would need to be tricked into clicking on a malicious Web site that contained the Javascript code that exploited the CSRF flaw .
Facebook has been under a lot of heat recently by users who feel it has n't done enough to protect their privacy , and embarrassing technical glitches like this do n't help the social - networking company 's case .
Earlier this month , Facebook had to temporarily pull its chat feature , after another bug let users eavesdrop on their friends ' private chat sessions .
Competition for the U.S. light bulb market intensified Monday as Home Depot said it 's begun selling a " breakthrough " LED , only a month after General Electric and Cree announced similar products .
As the venerable incandescent begins its Congress - mandated phaseout in 2012 , the once staid light bulb sector is seeing a frenzy of new , more efficient CFLs ( compact fluorescent lamps ) , halogens and LEDs ( light emitting diodes . )
Home Depot says the new 9 - watt , $ 20 ECOSMART LED bulb , made in the United States , uses about 80 % less energy than a 40 watt incandescent and contains no mercury as do most CFLs .
It 's also recyclable and dimmable .
If installed in a newborn 's room today , " it will probably not have to be replaced until the child is ready to graduate college , " says Home Depot 's Jorge Fernandez in the announcement , which adds that the bulb could save $ 155 in energy costs over its life and pay for itself in less than two years .
" The ECOSMART LED bulb is a significant leap forward from Thomas Edison 's 130 year - old invention , " says Zach Gibler , chief executive office of Lighting Science Group Corporation , its manufacturer .
Cree , a leading LED manufacturer whose products have been used in the Pentagon , announced last month a new , more efficient LED platform .
Also last month , General Electric said it has a new 40 - watt replacement LED bulb that 's expected to consume just 9 watts , provide a 77 % energy savings and last more than 25 times as long .
" This is a bulb that can virtually light your kid 's bedroom desk lamp from birth through high school graduation , " John Strainic , GE Lighting 's global product general manager said in the announcement , which adds the bulb will last 17 years if used four hours daily .
GE says its Energy Smart LED , expected to retail for $ 40 to $ 50 , contains no mercury , is cool to the touch and should offer full brightness from the moment it 's turned on .
It 's made with Cree XLamp XP - G LEDs .
GE says the bulb will be available later this year or early next year , but a prototype will be on display this week in Las Vegas at Light Fair 2010 , an annual trade show .
The initial peopling of North America from Asia occurred approximately 15,000 - 18,000 years ago .
However , estimations of the genetic diversity of the first settlers have remained inaccurate .
In a report published online in Genome Research , researchers have found that the diversity of the first Americans has been significantly underestimated , underscoring the importance of comprehensive sampling for accurate analysis of human migrations .
Substantial evidence suggests that humans first crossed into North America from Asia over a land bridge called Beringia , connecting eastern Siberia and Alaska .
Genetic studies have shed light on the initial lineages that entered North America , distinguishing the earliest Native American groups from those that arrived later .
However , a clear picture of the number of initial migratory events and routes has been elusive due to incomplete analysis .
In this work , an international group of researchers coordinated by Antonio Torroni of the University of Pavia in Italy performed a detailed mitochondrial genome analysis of a poorly characterized lineage known as C1d.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is passed down through the maternal lineage , and mtDNA sequence markers are extremely useful tools for mapping ancestry .
Similar to other haplogroups that were among the first to arrive in North America , C1d is distributed throughout the continent , suggesting that it may have been also present in the initial founding populations .
However , C1d has not been well represented in previous genetic analyses , and the estimated age of approximately 7,000 years , much younger than the other founding haplogroups , was likely inaccurate .
To resolve these inconsistent lines of evidence , the group sequenced and analyzed 63 C1d mtDNA genomes from throughout the Americas .
This high - resolution study not only confirmed that C1d was one of the founding lineages in North America 15,000 to 18,000 years ago , but revealed another critical insight .
" These first female American founders carried not one but two different C1d genomes , " said Ugo Perego of the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation and primary author of the study , " thus further increasing the number of recognized maternal lineages from Beringia . "
These findings raise the number of founding maternal lineages in North America to fifteen .
Furthermore , this work emphasizes the critical need for comprehensive analysis of relevant populations to gather a complete picture of migratory events .
Alessandro Achilli of the University of Perugia , a coauthor of the report , suggests that the number of distinct mitochondrial genomes that passed from Asian into North America is probably much higher .
" These yet undiscovered maternal lineages will be identified within the next three to four years , " Achilli noted , " when the methodological approach that we used in our study will be systematically applied . "
Scientists from the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation ( Salt Lake City , UT ) , the University of Pavia ( Pavia , Italy ) , the University of Perugia ( Perugia , Italy ) , the University of Santiago de Compostela , ( Santiago de Compostela , Spain ) , Innsbruck Medical University ( Innsbruck , Austria ) , and the University of Beunos Aries ( Buenos Aires , Argentina ) .

While she was the chief executive of EBay , Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman shoved a subordinate who later received a confidential six - figure settlement , according to a report published by the New York Times on Monday .
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2007 at the company ’s San Jose headquarters , as EBay communications employee Young Mi Kim was helping Whitman prepare for an interview with Reuters .
The story was based on interviews with current and former employees at the online auction firm who declined to give their names because the matter was “ deemed to be strictly confidential , ” the paper said .
According to their accounts , Whitman got angry , uttered an expletive and pushed Kim , or “ physically guided ” her out of the conference room .
Kim left the company for a short time after the incident , but returned and is now a senior manager for corporate communications .
Neither Whitman nor Kim commented on the details of the incident , but their statements confirmed that a significant quarrel had occurred .

“ In any high - pressure working environment , tensions can surface , ” Whitman said in a statement .
“ Young Mi and I had a professional disagreement which we put behind us .
She and I continued to work together at EBay , where I valued her skilled counsel and thorough professionalism . ”
Sarah Pompei , a spokeswoman for Whitman ’s gubernatorial campaign , declined to comment on whether the disagreement became physical , as the newspaper reported .
“ Meg is a serious , results - focused boss , ” Pompei said .
“ A verbal dispute in a high - pressure working environment is n’t out of the ordinary . ”
Kim , who could not be reached for comment Monday , confirmed to the New York Times that a disagreement had occurred .

“ Yes , we had an unfortunate incident , but we resolved it in a way that speaks well for her and for EBay , ” she said .
“ And ultimately , I came back to the company , which is not something I had to do . ”
According to the report , Kim threatened legal action and received a confidential six - figure settlement that one source told the New York Times was “ around $ 200,000 " after mediation suggested by EBay .
The paper also reported that Henry Gomez , then president of an EBay subsidiary and now a senior advisor to Whitman ’s gubernatorial effort , “ counseled ” Whitman about the incident .
The campaign declined to make Gomez available for an interview Monday .
EBay declined official comment on Monday .
“ Meg Whitman and Young Mi Kim have commented on the matter in response to questions from The New York Times .
We have nothing to add , ” the company said in a statement .
Whitman , who is making her first run for office , has offered as a credential her experience running EBay , a skill set that she says could help her fix California ’s troubled finances .
But this is not the first time experiences from her corporate life have come back to haunt her in this campaign .

She was accused of age discrimination while at FTD , a lawsuit that also resulted in a confidential settlement , and at EBay she received special access to lucrative stock offerings made by the investment house Goldman Sachs .
After a lawsuit by EBay stockholders alleged that she had received the stock in exchange for steering EBay banking business to Goldman Sachs , Whitman returned nearly $ 1.8 million in profits .

WOW !!
I just found some old drawings from the DS9 days , and here are some from one of my favorite episodes , “ Far Beyond the Stars . ”
The premise of the episode is that Sisco is taken back in time where he is a black writer in a 1950 ’s publishing house , all the characters from the show , whether they are aliens are something else , are seen here in total human form , HAAA !
As the story goes , all the writers are awaiting there assignments , and the way it works is the editor walks in with a pack of drawings and he proceeds to dump them out across the table … the illustrations are of science fiction wonders , spacecraft , UFO ’s , Alien abductions etc .
From here , each writer grabs a drawing and then writes a story based on that single image .
Sisco gets a drawing of a very stylized space station which is a 50 ’s version of the DS9 station .
What you ’re about to see today are some of the drawings that were in that pouch .
Mike Okuda made my fav into a magazine cover and the rest are just plane fun .
HEY !!
this must be where my fondness for pin ups started !!!

Henning Solberg has confirmed that he will switch to an S2000 Ford for the four asphalt rounds of this year 's World Rally Championship season .
The Norwegian will return to Stobart 's World Rally Car line - up on his preferred gravel surface for the remaining rallies of that type , but will drive the S2000 Fiesta under the Stobart M - Sport banner in Bulgaria , Germany , Corsica and Catalunya .
" I 've heard nothing but good reports about the new Ford Fiesta S2000 so far , and it will be interesting to drive it in Bulgaria and give my opinion on how I feel it runs compared to the Ford Focus RS WRC , " said Solberg .
Ford team boss Malcolm Wilson hopes that Solberg can contribute to the development of the S2000 car .
" The Fiesta is the platform for the next generation of WRC cars and this gives Henning the chance to be right at the forefront of the development cycle , " Wilson said .
" We look forward to receiving the feedback from Henning that his experience within the WRC can provide . "
Stobart had already announced that P - G Andersson would take Solberg 's place for Bulgaria .
It has yet to reveal its plans for the other asphalt rallies .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Believing that a moon base is essential for exploration of the solar system , Japan has recently announced plans to send humanoid robots to the moon to construct a robot lunar base .
As part of the $ 2.2 billion project , the robots will begin surveying the moon around 2015 , and then build the unmanned base near the moon ’s South Pole by 2020 .
A Japanese government panel chaired by Katsuhiko Shirai , President of Waseda University , has developed a rough outline of the project .
First , the robots , weighing about 660 pounds each , will begin by surveying the moon , taking images of the surface , collecting rocks , and returning the rocks to Earth via rocket for seismographic research .
Later , robots will be sent to the moon to construct the lunar base for themselves .
According to the government panel , the robots and the unmanned moon base will be powered by solar panels .
The robots will be controlled from Earth , but will also have a high degree of autonomy that enables them to operate on their own to perform certain tasks .
Ultimately , the base could serve as a starting point for future robot colonizers , and even human colonizers .

BUSAN , South Korea ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s top economies scrapped plans for a universal global bank tax on Saturday , giving countries plenty of wiggle room over how to make banks pay for their bailouts in future .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speaks during a news conference at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Busan June 5 , 2010 .

Finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries ended a two - day meeting to review progress on a string of initiatives agreed last year to make the financial system safer and protect taxpayers from having to pay for bank rescues again .
Attempts to introduce a global bank levy were finally ditched in the face of opposition from Japan , Canada and Brazil whose banks needed no public aid during the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
“ There is no agreement to proceed with an ex ante bank tax , ” said Canadian Finance Minister , Jim Flaherty .
The G20 said it recognized there was a range of policy approaches and that it will approve a set of principles later this month in Toronto on how to protect taxpayers .
British Finance Minister George Osborne reiterated his pledge to introduce a UK bank tax regardless of what other countries do and will spell out his plans in a budget report on June 22 .
“ Different countries will do different things but to have it under the umbrella of the G20 is going to be helpful , ” Osborne told reporters .
Britain was forced to shore up the banking sector and rescue several individual firms .
BASEL BACKING
The meeting did not agree any new regulation or alter deadlines for implementing steps agreed last year .
But ministers sought to keep plans for tough new Basel III bank capital and liquidity rules on course for implementation by the end of 2012 despite deep - seated concerns among several countries .
“ We are on track to deliver the proposals at the Seoul summit in November .
Ministers are fully engaged in finding the right compromises , ” Financial Stability Board Chairman , Mario Draghi , told reporters .
Several finance ministers signaled that a lengthy phase - in for Basel III beyond 2012 was now inevitable .
Draghi , who overseas implementation of the G20’s financial reform pledges , said Basel was not expected to take full effect by that deadline .
“ The key thing is to start the implementation in 2012 .
Then we will kind of find out what are the most appropriate transition times , ” Draghi said .
Banks warn that piling on tougher requirements too soon will force them to raise fresh capital at the expense of being able to lend to aid economic recovery .
Draghi said two percentage points of higher capital requirements would halve the probability of systemic risk .
Osborne said there was “ some room for variation ” over a tougher definition of bank capital but “ everyone understands this is the absolute central part of creating a safer and better regulated global banking system . ”
COMMODITIES TARGETED
The G20 also agreed to speed up introduction of measures to improve transparency , regulation and supervision of hedge funds , credit rating agencies , bank pay and off - exchange traded derivatives .
“ We are also committed to improve the functioning and transparency of commodities markets , ” the G20 statement said .
Some policymakers have accused speculators of abusing commodities markets .
Draghi played down expectations that the G20 will usher in a slew of additional measures beyond what it agreed last year .
“ We have a priority , it ’s to move forward on Basel III , ” Draghi said .
Despite the failure to make headway on a universal bank levy and slippage in full Basel III roll - out , policymakers noted that the United States is expected within weeks to approve the most sweeping reform of financial rules since the 1930s that will introduce the bulk of G20 reform pledges .
The European Union is also well advanced in adopting new rules on supervision and hedge funds , with a draft law on derivatives regulation due next month .
Elena Salgado , economy minister of EU president Spain said more EU regulation was needed for credit ratings agencies , which lacked transparency and accountability .
“ To have a European credit ratings agency is another issue ; perhaps it would be good , but it ’s something that cannot be done from one day to the next , ” Salgado told Reuters .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a landmark overhaul of financial regulations but the Senate put off action until mid-July , delaying a final victory for President Barack Obama .
Still , the 237 to 192 vote in the House marked a win for Obama and his fellow Democrats , who have made the most sweeping rewrite of Wall Street rules since the 1930s a top priority in the wake of the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis .
“ That ’s why we are here today , to make sure that never happens again , ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
“ We will pass the toughest set of Wall Street reforms in generations . ”
Analysts say Obama is all but certain to get the measure on his desk eventually , but Democrats ’ hopes of sending a bill to him to sign into law by the July 4 Independence Day holiday were dashed .
The death of Democratic Senator Robert Byrd and cold feet among Republican allies has complicated efforts to round up the votes needed in the Senate .
A week - long break following the July 4 Independence Day holiday means the Senate wo n’t act until the week of July 12 , at the earliest .
The bill would impose tighter regulations on financial firms and reduce their profits .
It would boost consumer protections , force banks to reduce risky trading and investing activities and set up a new government process for liquidating troubled financial firms .
With congressional elections approaching in November , Democrats have ridden a wave of public disgust at an industry that has awarded itself fat paydays while the rest of the country struggles with high unemployment .
Wall Street and Republicans have tried to delay the bill or lessen its reach , but the measure has actually gotten tougher during its year - long journey through Congress .
Republicans say the bill would hurt the economy by burdening businesses with a thicket of new regulations .
They also point out that it ducks the question of how to handle troubled mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which Democrats plan to tackle next year .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which own or guarantee half of all U.S. mortgages , have received a total of about $ 145 billion in taxpayer bailouts since being seized by the government in September 2008 .
Their regulator has said he does not know how much more taxpayer support they will need .
“ All this bill before us does is perpetuate the same dumb regulation that got us into this financial pickle in the first place , ” said Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling .
Democrats have seized the opportunity to link their political foes with an unpopular industry .
Obama on Wednesday accused Republicans of being out of touch with the American people for opposing reforms , and others echoed his line of attack on the House floor .
“ Republicans have sided with big Wall Street banks at every opportunity , ” said Democratic Representative Luis Guitierrez .
“ If it helps Wall Street banks , they favor it , but if it helps Main Street and regular Americans , they wo n’t vote for it . ”
SCRAMBLING IN THE SENATE
As Democrats marched to victory in the House , their colleagues in the Senate scrambled for votes .
Byrd ’s death left Democrats one vote shy of the 60 needed to overcome procedural hurdles in the 100 - seat chamber , and Democrats have yet to nail down support from Republican moderates whose votes will be needed to advance the bill .
Those Republicans -- Susan Collins , Olympia Snowe and Scott Brown -- had voted for an earlier version , but they objected to a $ 17.9 billion tax on large financial institutions that was added last week to cover the bill ’s costs .

Democrats stripped out the tax in a last - minute negotiating session on Tuesday to address their concern .
All three moderates said they were still studying the final bill before deciding how to vote .
Collins said she was inclined to support it , while Snowe said it was a “ possibility ” that she could vote for it .
“ We ’re just trying to work it out and I am sure we will be able to , but it ’s important to get it right , ” Snowe said .
Brown , who won significant concessions earlier in the process , also declined to say how he would vote .
“ It ’s morphed into something different than it began with and I think it ’s appropriate to read it , ” he said of the 2,000 - plus page bill .
Democrats could also pick up needed support from their own side of the aisle .
Maria Cantwell , one of two Democrats who voted against the bill earlier , said she might reconsider .
Democrat Christopher Dodd , the bill ’s chief advocate in the Senate , said lawmakers should not vote against it just because they do n’t like one or two elements .
“ No one ’s going to get everything they want in this bill , I certainly did n’t , ” he said .
“ I ’ve done everything I know how to do to accommodate my colleagues to make this as fair , as balanced , as thoughtful as I possibly could . ”
Representative Barney Frank , the Democrat who has overseen the bill in the House , said he would try to revive that tax on banks in separate legislation .
Even after Obama signs the bill into law , its final impact will remain unclear for several years while regulators work to put it into effect .
Congress also could pass another bill to fix technical mistakes in the legislative language , said an aide to Frank .
A US woman has been accused of stabbing her husband with scissors because she was unhappy with his performance in bed .
Michelle Thomas , 26 , was arrested on Tuesday after police were called around 1 am to the couple ’s house in the east Texas town of Hudson , Lufkin Daily News reports .
The man told police Ms Thomas became angry with him after a sex session left her unsatisfied .
He said Ms Thomas grabbed a pair of scissors and began slashing him , according to court papers .
The court affidavit states police found the man with superficial cuts to his chest , thumb and knee .
Ms Thomas alleges her partner was drunk , threw her onto the bed and began choking her .
But police found no injuries on Ms Thomas , according to the affidavit .
The man said he only touched Ms Thomas during the sexual encounter .
Ms Thomas was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , although the man told officers he did n’t want to press charges , according to Lufkin Daily News .
Ms Thomas faces up to 20 years in jail .
Phipps inexplicably found himself planning to see a movie with Jenkins , a gesture typically reserved for real friends .
ATLANTA — Despite making no deliberate efforts to engage with his coworker beyond the point of pleasant acquaintance , Eric Phipps said Thursday he was astonished to discover he had inadvertently forged a personal bond with fellow web developer Michael Jenkins .

Phipps , 31 , told reporters that the interactions with his coworker , which for two years had been confined to job - related matters and breezy small talk , first took an unplanned turn toward authentic friendship this past March .
According to Phipps , he and Jenkins happened to leave the office at the same time one day and decided to kill half an hour at a nearby bar before heading off to separate evening engagements .
" I figured we 'd just talk about work stuff for a little bit and then be on our way , " said Phipps , adding that he was n't even sure at the time if Jenkins drank .
" But next thing I knew , he was telling me about the problems he 's having with his pool , and I was promising to lend him my copy of The Wild Bunch . "

" And the bizarre thing is , I was legitimately enjoying myself , " added Phipps , citing his coworker 's intelligence and sense of humor as well as the surprising abundance of interests they shared .
" How did this happen ? "
While Phipps assumed that his collegial but limited relationship with Jenkins would resume once they were back at the office , he soon realized it would be impossible to interact with his coworker in the surface - level , noncommittal way he was accustomed to .

† " It 's like everything had shifted , " Phipps said .
" All of a sudden , I was stopping by his cubicle to ask about his woodworking project , and he was at mine giving me the name of a good chiropractor my sister should try for her back spasms .
Then somehow I suddenly had his personal e-mail address . "
Even as long lunches with Jenkins became an everyday activity , Phipps told reporters he never expected their camaraderie to extend past the " best friend at the office " level .
But that barrier was shattered last Thursday , when Phipps ' neighborhood softball team needed an extra player for their weekend game .

" I got a call from the captain asking if I knew anyone who could sub in , and before I could stop myself , I told him I had a buddy who used to play in college , " said Phipps , referring to the man he once knew only as " polo - shirt guy . "
" I called him my buddy .
I did n't say ' coworker ' or even ' buddy from work . '
I said buddy .
That 's something you say about an actual friend . "
It was perhaps that escalation , Phipps acknowledged , that cleared the path for Jenkins to invite him to a barbecue a couple of weeks later — an event whose guests did not include any other coworkers .
Not until he was bouncing Jenkins ' 4 - year - old daughter on his knee did Phipps realize the full impact of the unintentional befriending .

" No going back now , " Phipps said .
" There 's been talk of carpooling , and he mentioned a cabin he owns near a good fishing spot .
He 'll probably end up being godfather to one of my kids . "
When reached for comment , Jenkins readily acknowledged his relationship with Phipps .

" Yeah , Phippsy 's a great guy , " Jenkins said .
" Though he tends to over think things . "
Attention women : until your farts start
smelling like cinnamon buns , quit bitching .
I 'm tired of women bitching when guys fart .
Farting around a woman is like listening to a radio permanently stuck on the wailing bitch station : " I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FARTED . "
Yeah it 's real hard to believe that guys have the ability to let out air from their colons , call Ripley .
Women shriek non -stop about how bad guys stink when they fart , then they act like they fart sunshine and kittens from their assholes when they rip one .
Women farts smell like old men :
Not only is the elusive potpourri poop - chute a myth , a woman 's fart is embarrassing whereas a guy 's fart is something to behold , like a fine wine you swish in your mouth and spit out to savor the flavors .
A real fart is beefy , has a density greater than or equal to the air surrounding it , consists of the unmistakable scent of broccoli , and usually requires wiping afterwards .
When a woman farts , it can best be described as " efficient . "
The sound is a modest toot ; a minimalistic , almost innocent sounding release .
A true testament to the jumbled bundle of neurons that goes into mapping every woman 's brain to her asshole .
The efficiency comes from the ratio of reek to weak ( how bad her fart smells in proportion to how weak - sounding it was ) .
The farting double - standard is bullshit .
Women giggle and put their hand up to their mouths , as if to say " oops !
I 'm cute ! "
No bitch , you 're not cute .
Your shit stinks .
Either fart loud and deny it , or do n't fart at all .
Leave the farting to men , at least we know how to get the job done .
2,380,573 women think they do n't get caught when they let one rip .

Zoomooz.js
Zoomooz is : 6KB gzipped and 18 KB minified .
This includes everything but jQuery .
Make any web page zoom .
Latest version : 1.1.9 ( Nov 11 , 2013 , hacky fix for the back and forward buttons # 66 )
Zoomooz is a jQuery plugin for making web page elements zoom .
It can be used for making Prezi like slideshows and for zooming to images or other details .
Quirky transformations
You can zoom to elements that have been translated , scaled and skewed , and they will morph correctly .
Try by clicking on these :
Skew
Scale
Rotate
There is some interesting stuff happening in the background to make the morphings work .
To learn about them , read the Animate between complex transforms wiki page .
Adding Zoomooz to your web page
Just add this to your web page head and you should be up and running with Zoomooz :
< script src= "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js " ></script >
< script src= " jquery.zoomooz.min.js " ></script >
The easy way to zoom
Simply add " zoomTarget " to the element you want to zoom to when clicked on :
< div class= " zoomTarget " > This element zooms when clicked on .</div >
You can also add some additional attributes for tuning the animation as data fields of the element :
< div class= " zoomTarget " data - targetsize= " 0.45 " data - duration= " 600 " > This element zooms when clicked on .</div >
For documentation of the data fields , have a look at the Settings section .
Note , that adding Zoomooz to your existing web site without doing any markup changes might not work , since calculating exact positions and transformations in browsers is a bit of tricky .
Starting with one of zoomooz examples or an empty page with minimal css markup is easier to get working than to try to bolt zoomooz into an existing , complex web page .
Here is a demo , click on the elements :
Target 1 Target 2 Target 3
By adding a " data - closeclick " value to a zoom target , you can make the image zoom out when the element is clicked for second time , see here :
Target 1
( click twice ) Target 2
( click twice ) Target 3
( click twice )
Zooming inside a container
You can make only part of the page zoom by adding two blocks outside the zooming elements , a " zoomContainer " and outside it a " zoomViewport " :
< div class= " zoomViewport " > < div class= " zoomContainer " > < div class= " zoomTarget " > Target 1</div > < div class= " zoomTarget " > Target 2</div > </div > </div >
Here is a demo , click on the elements :
Target 1 Target 2 Target 3 Target 4 Target 5 Target 6
Adding prev/next buttons
You can also add previous and next buttons for zooming to elements in a specific order .
You can use this to make slide shows , for example .
To do this , add " zoomButton " elements to control the animation :
< div class= " zoomViewport demo " > < div class= " zoomContainer " > < div class= " zoomTarget " > Target 1</div > < div class= " zoomTarget " > Target 2</div > </div > </div > < div class= " zoomButton " data - type= " prev " data - root= " .demo " ></div > < div class= " zoomButton " data - type= " next " data - root= " .demo " ></div >
Here is a demo , try clicking on the arrow buttons :
Target 1 Target 2 Target 3 Target 4 Target 5 Target 6
< >
Zooming jQuery way
To make an element zoom when clicked on , you can use " zoomTarget ( ... ) " :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #element " ) .zoomTarget ( ) ; } ) ;
This automatically makes also the parent element clickable for the user to be able to zoom back .
Another alternative is to handle the zooming yourself , with something like :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #element " ) .click ( function ( evt ) { $ ( this ).zoomTo({targetsize:0.75 , duration:600} ) ; evt.stopPropagation ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
This is more flexible , but wo n't give you all the automagical niceties , such as a nice pointer cursor when hovering over the element .
Settings
There are a number of settings you can add to the " zoomTarget " elements and pass to " zoomTo " functions in a map .
The settings configure how the zooming behaves .
For elements with the " zoomTarget " class , you can set the settings by adding a " data - settingname " attribute to the element , for example :
< div class= " zoomTarget " data - scalemode= " width " data - nativeanimation= " true " > Click me</div >
List of all settings :
settings = { // zoomed size relative to the container element // 0.0 - 1.0 targetsize : 0.9 , // scale content to screen based on their size // " width " |" height " |" both " scalemode : " both " , // animation duration duration : 450 , // easing of animation , similar to css transition params // " linear " |" ease " |" ease - in " |" ease - out " |" ease - in - out " | [ p1,p2,p3, p4 ] // [ p1, p2, p3 , p4 ] refer to cubic - bezier curve params easing : " ease " , // use browser native animation in webkit , provides faster and nicer // animations but on some older machines , the content that is zoomed // may show up as pixelated .
nativeanimation : true , // root element to zoom relative to // ( this element needs to be positioned ) root : $ ( document.body ) , // show debug points in element corners .
helps // at debugging when zoomooz positioning fails debug : false , // this function is called with the element that is zoomed to in this // when animation ends animationendcallback : null , // this specifies , that clicking an element that is zoomed to zooms // back out closeclick : false , // do n't reset scroll before zooming .
less jaggy zoom starts and ends on // mobile browsers , but causes issues when zooming to elements when scrolled // to a specific distance in document , typically around 2000 px on webkit .
preservescroll : false } // settings can be set for both the zoomTo and zoomTarget calls : $ ( " #element " ) .zoomTo( settings ) ;
Browsers and platforms
Zoomooz works quite reliably on Firefox 3.6 or newer , on Safari 3 or newer and on recent versions of Chrome .
Based on a quick test , seems to work fine on IE9 as well , but there may be bugs .
Opera support has not been tested recently .
The only large group of users that is not supported at all is those still stuck with IE8 .
Luckily , the share of IE8 users is currently 11 % and it is dropping quickly .
Zoomooz requires 1.4 . or newer and has been tested with jQuery 1.9 .
i Phone and iPad
Zoomooz works even on iPad and iPhone .
Watch a video of Zoomooz on a first generation iPad .
Currently the zooming inside a container works much better on them than zooming the whole page .
Whole page zooming can be made to work if " overflow : hidden " is set for the " html " and " body " elements , but then the page scrolling is lost .
Demos

Known issues & troubleshooting
Some known issues :
Weird things happen when browser scrolls after zooming has happened .
Should catch these and prevent .
On iOs devices , zooming inside container sometimes freezes the scrolling .
Have n't investigated what is causing this .
Margins on zoomable elements can cause problems .
Having a main container inside the body tag sometimes helps with full page zooming .
Small text renders ugly .
See this example for a hack to work around this .
Rotation goes sometimes via the wrong direction .
Building
Easiest way to use Zoomooz is to use the pre-generated " jquery.zoomooz.min.js " file .
However , you may also combine and minify the javascript files by yourself .
For build instructions , have a look at the Zoomooz github page .

KABUL , Afghanistan June 10 , 2010  --
As thousands of American troops pour into southern Afghanistan , insurgents have launched a vicious offensive against the Afghans supporting the surge .
In the last day a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a wedding hosted by an anti-Taliban tribal leader , and insurgents publicly hanged someone who they labeled a spy for local troops .
The Afghan accused of spying was a 7 - year - old boy .
He was hanged from a tree in front of a crowd in Helmand 's Sangin district , where more than a thousand British troops are based .
He was the son and grandson of prominent tribal leaders , one of whom had recently spoken out against the Taliban , according to local journalists .
" A 7 - year - old boy can not be a spy , " President Hamid Karzai said in a press conference in Kabul .
" A 7 - year - old boy can not be anything but a 7 - year - old boy , and therefore hanging or shooting to kill a 7 - year - old boy ... is a crime against humanity . "
The hanging occurred hours before a man walked into the main section of a wedding just north of Kandahar City and pulled the trigger on a suicide vest , killing more than 40 and injuring more than 70 , including the groom .
The groom 's family had opposed the Taliban , and his uncle , the local tribal leader , had successfully organized a militia against insurgents , according to Ahmed Wali Karzai , the head of the provincial council and the president 's brother .
Taken together , the grisly incidents will serve as a warning that American soldiers and Marines have not yet guaranteed security for those Afghans willing to help them .
And that will make the surge into southern Afghanistan more difficult .
American commanders admit they need local help in order to defeat an insurgency deeply embedded into the ethnic and tribal population of Helmand and Kandahar .
Today the top American commander in Afghanistan admitted the military had not yet won over skeptical local leaders in Kandahar , and that it was taking longer than he anticipated to do so ahead of a summer surge .
Taliban Denies Bloody Attack on Wedding
" I think it will take a number of months for this to play out .
But I do n't think that 's necessarily a bad thing .
I think it 's more important that we get it right than we get it fast , " Gen .
Stanley McChrystal told reporters in Brussels on the sidelines of a NATO conference .
The wedding attack occurred in Arghandab district , which American officials have held up as an example of progress .
In the last year more than 50 soldiers died among its lush pomegranate fields , and the district is approximately 60 percent controlled by Western troops and the Afghan government , according to American military officials .
Early last year , it was an insurgent safehaven .
The village where the wedding took place , Nagan , is on the border of Arghandab and Zhari , a much less secure district where many of Arghandab 's leaders have fled .
Nagan had been safe for years because of local elders had successfully rallied villagers to oppose Taliban presence , according to Wali Karzai .
The bomber walked into the wedding ceremony at approximately 9 p.m .
His detonation was so powerful , body parts ended up in trees outside the compound .
" Some people were waiting for food , others were dancing inside a big tent , when I heard a deafening blast , " a survivor named Aminullah told Reuters .
" The dust went up in the sky and I saw dead bodies everywhere .
Women and children were screaming .
I thought it was end of the world . "
The Taliban denied responsibility , and some villagers told the Associated Press they saw helicopters above the wedding and blamed Western troops for firing into the wedding .
But NATO said none of its troops were involved , and the provincial governor held a press conference where he blamed insurgents and said ball bearings had been found in victims ' bodies -- a sign that a suicide bomb had been used .
" On one side they target people who are in favor of the government .
Then at the same time , they do n't want people to know their real face , " Gov. Tooryalai Wesa said , referring to the Taliban 's denial .
Taliban 's Shocking Attacks Warn Afghan to Not Cooperate With U.S .
The attacks have not been limited to Afghans .
The first 10 days of June have been one of the deadliest stretches of the war for American troops .
At least 19 have died , and McChrystal today acknowledged that the war would get more violent as troops deployed to areas where NATO has not had a significant presence .
" I think it 's likely that our casualties and violence will continue to rise particularly through the summer months .
They could rise well into the fall . "
McChrystal told ABC News in Brussels .
" We are pressuring the enemy and they are reacting to that .
As we predicted , violence would go up the more places we were , the more forces we used to take the momentum away from the enemy . "
But a day like yesterday will help reinforce local leaders ' doubts about the Americans ' ability to protect them .
Yesterday afternoon , insurgents dragged a member of the Kandahar provincial council out of his house and killed him , the Associated Press reported .
According to a new set of rules issued by the State Department , Americans can get passports matching their gender identity — with a doctor ’s note .
“ Beginning June 10 , when a passport applicant presents a certification from an attending medical physician that the applicant has undergone appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition , the passport will reflect the new gender .
The guidelines include detailed information about what information the certification must include .
It is also possible to obtain a limited - validity passport if the physician ’s statement shows the applicant is in the process of gender transition .
No additional medical records are required .
Sexual reassignment surgery is no longer a prerequisite for passport issuance . ”

In November of 2000 , Americans sat on the edge of their seats waiting to find out who would be the next president .
Protests were held , counter protests were organized to meet the challenge and everyone had an opinion .
The 2000 election remains capable of igniting passionate debate .
Some look it as the time that the Supreme Court stole an election for George W. Bush .
Some mark it up to Al Gore having the campaign skills and spinal fortitude of a slime mold .
There are those who rue Florida ’s hanging chads and aging Jewish voters for Buchanan .
And not a few still point to those tense days as proof that Ralph Nader is a festering sore on the ass of the Republic .
Any or all of them could be right .
But when you read Alexander Zaitchik ’s new book , Common Nonsense : Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance , you ’ll turn the last page with the understanding that election 2000 brought something far more sinister than Bush / Cheney down upon America .
Worse , you ’ll know that it ai n’t over yet .
Beck was working in Tampa at the time , unsuccessfully trying to break into conservative talk radio .
In fact , he was about to be let go because he was terrible at his job , saved only by Clear Channel ’s local monopoly .
But when Bush v. Gore came to a head in Florida and Beck was one of the few local voices on the airwaves , Clear Channel saw the opportunity and went national with Beck .
That exposure formed the foundation for his current media empire , and the experience turned Beck into the “ real conservative ” he is today .
No more making fun of rednecks : from then on , Beck would fashion himself as one .
If you ’re hoping to read a book - length rant against Beck and all that he stands for , then this is n’t for you .
This is not Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot .
It ’s a careful and studious look at Beck : part biography , part deconstruction and incredibly readable from the first page to the last .
Listed as “ Current Affairs , ” Common Nonsense is written like the best history .
Zaitchik moves the focus between the tree and the forest with incredible dexterity , giving the reader depth as well as context .
Both are frightening .
I found myself comparing the feel of Zaitchik ’s book to The Heart of Darkness , particularly the sense of foreboding that builds as the reader understands more and more of what makes Beck tick , or more accurately , what makes him particularly unhinged and dangerous .
Kurtz “ went native , ” a respectable thing to do in my book .
Beck went Mormon , which is like going native but without any of the positives .
And at least Kurtz had the good grace to live with the natives ; for all of Beck ’s soft - focus talk about the “ real America , ” the man lives in a mansion in Connecticut and takes a limo to work .
I ’ll let you read the book to find out what kinds of crackpot conspiracies Beck subscribes to and the kind of hard Mormon rightwingism that he ’s bringing into mainstream American culture .
A god among the natives he may be , but he ’s not off the corporate reservation : he ’s just packaging the fascism in a way that would make Goebbels proud .
My compulsion to dog -ear every page containing important information , a laugh - out - loud turn of phrase or Zaitchik wielding stinging , sarcastic wit deformed my review copy .
The reader never has far to go between examples like , “ Weirder still is the fact that Beck has successfully grown a mass following while stumbling through a remedial self - education in U.S. democracy , which reflects the carnival mirrors inside his mind as much as it does the reality he struggles , in futility and desperation , to comprehend , ” and “ It seemed that the [ Tea Party ] protesters ’ main enemies were Russian history and apostrophes . ”
They ’re all great , but Zaitchik plays them subtly enough that they never detract from his presentation of vital information .
And that ’s what makes this book special .
A great many writers from the left could have spent 258 pages lobbing insults at Beck .
Zaitchik takes the high road , blending straight biography with solid , investigative journalism .
Sometime in the future , professors will be assigning Common Nonsense and historians will be referencing it .
Read it .
It ’s not going to make you feel better , but it will give you a much deeper understanding of America ’s current insanity .
DUBLIN , Ireland —
The President of the Republic of Ireland , Mary McAleese , has praised the universality of the Baha 'i teachings and the contribution its members make to the life of their nation .
" You are marked out as people with values that are worth observing , worth learning from , worth looking at , worth imitating and so never be in any doubt of the value you are every single day in this world , " President McAleese told a gathering of some 60 Baha 'is during her first ever visit to the national Baha'i Centre in the Irish capital .
" Something you probably do not know , and I am sure it is true of many of you , is that in and through your lives , you are extraordinary ambassadors for your Faith , " she said in impromptu remarks .
President McAleese , first elected as Ireland 's President in 1997 , made her special visit to the Baha'i Centre on 30 April to mark the Festival of Ridvan , the anniversary of Baha 'u ' llah 's declaration in 1863 that He is the most recent in a line of divine Messengers that includes Buddha , Jesus , Krishna , Mohammed , Moses , Zoroaster , and others .
The President also expressed concern about the persecution of Baha 'is in other countries .
She said it was both sad and remarkable that a Faith with such principles would attract , in any shape or form , violence from others .
" And on this evening I think we just keep in our hearts those who are paying such a dear price for their fidelity to that simple human and divine charism that reaches right into the heart of humanity , " said President McAleese .
" How fortunate all Irish people are to live in a State where followers of all religions or none are free to practice , " she added , according to The Irish Times , which covered her visit .
During the reception , President McAleese was presented with a specially bound edition of the Baha'i book , The Hidden Words of Baha'u 'llah , in both English and the Irish language .
Brendan McNamara , the Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha 'is of the Republic of Ireland , described the President 's visit as " a milestone - a very joyous occasion . "
" She was very generous and spoke with everybody present , " said Mr. McNamara , " particularly taking time to encourage the youth - in whatever they were doing - to make a contribution to the future of Ireland . "

On June 27th , at approximately 3:30 AM , a taxi cab operator called 911 to report that his cab had just been stolen from the 1800 Block of Yale Avenue North .
According to the driver , he had just picked up a fare near 5th Avenue and Stewart Street and had taken him to the 1800 Block of Yale Ave .
N. Once he arrived at the location , the fare refused to get out of the cab .
The driver then got out of cab to open the rear door to get him out .
Instead of getting out , the fare locked the doors and hopped between the front seats and into the driver ’s seat .
He fled in the cab , leaving the driver behind .
Officers located the stolen cab with the suspect still in it on the off - ramp to Swift / Albro from southbound I - 5 .
He was arrested without incident .
The suspect was extremely intoxicated .
Officers determined that he had been involved in a disturbance earlier in the evening in Belltown .
Following his arrest , the suspect was processed for DUI .
The 28 year old male was later booked into the King County Jail for Investigation of Auto Theft with additional charges of DUI .

Sex / City 2 : Best movie review ever
Please do n't die .
The answer is ... fine .
Samantha 's vagina is doing fine .
She rubs yams on it , okay ?
She takes 48 vagina vitamins a day .
It accepts unlimited male penises with the greatest of ease .
Now let us never speak of it again .
Sex and the City 2 makes Phyllis Schlafly look like Andrea Dworkin .
Or that super - masculine version of Cynthia Nixon that Cynthia Nixon dates .
Or , like , Ralph Nader ( wait , bad example Schlafly totally does look like Ralph Nader in a granny wig ) .
SATC2 takes everything that I hold dear as a woman and as a human working hard , contributing to society , not being an entitled **** like it 's my job and rapes it to death with a stiletto that costs more than my car .
It is 146 minutes long , which means that I entered the theater in the bloom of youth and emerged with a family of field mice living in my long , white mustache .
This is an entirely inappropriate length for what is essentially a home video of gay men playing with giant Barbie dolls .
But I digress .
Let us start with the " plot . "
Carrie Bradshaw :
At the end of the first SATC movie ( 2008 ) after eleventy decades of chasing his emotionally abusive jowls through the streets of Manhattan Carrie finally marries Mr. Big , the man of her shallow , self - obsessed dreams .
It has now been two years since their nuptials .
Carrie already hates it .
She hates that he sits on the couch .
She hates that he eats noodles out of a take - out box .
She hates that he wants to spend quality time with her in their incredibly expensive and gaudy apartment .
She hates that he bought her an enormous television .
When Big suggests that they spend a couple of days a week in separate apartments ( they own TWO apartments , because life is hard ! ) , Carrie screeches , " Is this because I 'm a bitch wife who nags you ? " Congratulations .
You have answered your own question .
Miranda Redhairlawyerface : Miranda is a lawyer who has red hair .
She also has a child .
As a working woman , Miranda is forced to miss every single one of her child 's incessant science fairs ( as though children know anything of science ! ) .
Also , her lawyer boss is a cartoon dick .
Miranda quits her job , and everyone is much happier .
This is because women should not work .
It is terrible for the children .
Charlotte Goldsteinjewyjewsomethingsomethingblatt : Life for Charlotte is unbelievably difficult .
As a wealthy stay - at - home mom with two children and a live - in , full - time nanny , she sometimes has to bake cupcakes !
Also , one time her little child got finger paint on a piece of vintage cloth .
Therefore , Charlotte cannot stop crying .
" How do the women without help do it ? " Charlotte ( crying ) asks Miranda .
" I have no **** ing idea , " Miranda replies .
Then they toast their disgusting glasses of pink syrup .
To " them . "
To the " women without help . "
" If I was n't rich , I 'd definitely just kill myself right away with a knife ! " says everyone in this movie without having to actually say it .
Clink !
Samantha Jones : I told you we are never to speak of this .
In order to escape their various imaginary problems , our intrepid foursome traipses off to dark , exotic Abu Dhabi ( " I 've always been fascinated by the Middle Eastdesert moons , Scheherazade , magic carpets ! " ) .
When they arrive , Carrie , because she is a professional writer , announces , " Oh , Toto  I do n't think we 're in Kansas anymore ! "
Each woman is immediately assigned an extra from Disney 's Aladdin to spoon - feed her warm cinnamon milk in their $ 22,000 - per - night hotel suite .
Things seem to be going great .
But very quickly , the SATC brain trust notices that it's not all swarthy man-slaves and flying carpets in Abu Dhabi !
In fact , Abu Dhabi is crawling with Muslim women and not one of them is dressed like a super - liberated diamond - encrusted **** ing clown !!!
Oppression !
OPPRESSION !!!
This will not stand .
Samantha , being the prostitute sexual revolutionary that she is , rages against the machine by publicly grabbing the engorged penis of a man she dubs " Lawrence of My - Labia . "
When the locals complain ( having repeatedly asked Samantha to cover her nipples and mons pubis in the way of local custom ) , Samantha removes most of her clothes in the middle of the spice bazaar , throws condoms in the faces of the angry and bewildered crowd , and screams , " I AM A WOMAN ! I HAVE SEX ! "
Thus , traditional Middle Eastern sexual mores are upended and sexism is stoned to death in the town square .
At sexism 's funeral ( which takes place in a mysterious , incense - shrouded chamber of international sisterhood ) , the women of Abu Dhabi remove their black robes and veils to reveal this is not a joke the same hideous , disposable , criminally expensive shreds of cloth and feathers that hang from Carrie et al . 's emaciated goblin shoulders .
Muslim women :
Under those craaaaaaay - zy robes , they 're just as vapid and obsessed with physical beauty and meaningless material concerns as us !
Feminism ! **** yeah !
If this is what modern womanhood means , then just **** ing veil me and sew up all my holes .
Good night .

We 've been thinking it for two long years .
All of us .
Gnawing our cheeks at night , clutching at sweaty sheets , our faces hollow and gray , our once - bright eyes dimmed by the pain of too many questions .
Sometimes we cry out , en masse , to a faceless god and a cold , indifferent universe that holds its secrets close .
What ... rasps the death rattle of our collective sanity .
What is the lubrication level of Samantha Jones 's 52 - year - old vagina ?
Has the change of life dulled its sparkle ?
Do its aged and withered depths finally chafe from the endless pounding , pounding , pounding cruel phallic penance demanded by the emotionally barren sexual compulsive from which it hangs ?
If I do not receive an update on the deep , gray caverns of Jones , I shall surely die !
Please do n't die .
The answer is ... fine .
Samantha 's vagina is doing fine .
She rubs yams on it , okay ?
She takes 48 vagina vitamins a day .

Good night .
If you are one of these ‘ libertarians ’ , who oppose amnesty for migrant workers , who oppose open borders and freedom of travel , employ and commerce , this letter is addressed to you .
Dear “ Libertarians ” ,
I notice a lot of you like to say that brown people in third world countries accept low - wage , hard - labor jobs because that ’s better than the alternative ( namely : subsistence farming ) .
You argue that this is how the invisible hand of the “ free market ” works .
No , it ’s fucking not .
The only reason they are condemned to these choices is because they had the misfortune of being born in some banana republic , some petty dictatorship , or some ass - backward third - world country .
Viz. , some place you ‘ libertarians ’ would never — ever — want to find yourselves ; you would kick , punch , claw , gouge and shoot your way out .
You would climb mountains , cross deserts , or navigate shark - infested oceans in order to find something better .
But when I bring up immigration , I ’m not talking about you .
I ’m talking about them .
You ’re worried that if people emigrate , you might not pull down $ 18 / hour plus benefits to be a high school custodian — as if being compelled by the forces of supply and demand to accept a $ 13 / hour gig instead is a degradation even remotely similar to being locked in some craphole third - world country making $ 100 shoes for 8 cents a day .
You ’re saying , “ I ’m all for the free market as long as I get to play by a different set of rules [ than immigrants and residents of LDCs ] ” .
But that ’s not how a “ free market ” works .
You do not get to exempt yourself from the workings of the free market and still call it a “ free market ” .
The same forces which might compel a migrant worker to pick cherries in Traverse City , or to work ‘ illegally ’ doing midnight shifts at the gas station , may also compel you to sacrifice that vacation home , or the third flat - screen TV , or the brand - new car for your daughter ’s sweet sixteen , or your microbrews , or your Marlboros or your expensive tennis shoes and video games — so that those oppressed and disenfrachised can feed their fucking families .
Take a good , long , hard look in the mirror .
You are not an advocate of the ‘ invisible hand ’ .
You are an apologist for the ‘ invisible fist ’ , punching all of humanity in the throat , forever .
Sincerely ,
David Zemens
" I am inclined to think that cakes and ale prevail most freely in times that are perilous and when sources of sorrow abound . "
Anthony Trollope
There 's nothing quite like sharing generous slices of mouthwatering homemade cake with family or friends .
In making a cake you are taking advantage of some magical scientific transformations to create something sugary , delicate and delicious that everyone will love – and love you for .
Like many people , I was inducted into cake making at the apron of my mother .
Some of my most treasured memories are of scooping fairy cake mixture into little paper cases , dipping my fingers into the melted chocolate icing , and the satisfaction of eating the misshapen creations for tea .
Making cakes like these might seem like an ageless tradition , but actually this type of light , airy cake is a relatively new invention .
The first skilled bakers were probably the ancient Egyptians .
At this time cakes were basically breads , with egg , fat and honey added to create the recognisable essence of cake : richness and sweetness .
The earliest English cakes were still essentially bread , their main distinguishing characteristics being their shape – round and flat – and that they were hard on both sides as a result of being turned during baking .
Cakes as we know them today only came on the scene during the 18th and 19th centuries when the lightness created by the leavening power of yeast was replaced , first by eggs , and then by chemical raising agents such as bicarbonate of soda .
Raising agents provided a greater leavening power than yeast with much less time and effort .
A classic of risen cakes is the English pound cake , on which the Victoria sponge is based .
These cakes generally contain equal weights of the four major ingredients : structure - building flour and eggs ; and structure - weakening fat and sugar .
This recipe provides the perfect balance of these ingredients .
With any more fat or sugar the delicate scaffold of egg and flour collapses , making a dense , heavy cake ( like a fruit cake ) .
Recipe
250 g ( 10 oz ) of self raising flour
250g ( 10 oz ) of caster sugar
250g ( 10 oz ) of butter ( at a cool room temperature ) or margarine
Five lightly beaten eggs ( assuming each egg weighs about 50g ( 2oz ) )
Pinch of salt
Take the sugar and fat and beat together until the mixture reaches a fluffy consistency similar to whipped cream .
This can be done either by hand if you are feeling strong , otherwise use an electric whisk .
Much of the tender , melt - in - the - mouth texture of cake comes from gas bubbles , which subdivide the batter into fragile sheets .
The majority of this air is added in this initial stage by vigorous mixing of the fat and sugar – a process called " creaming " .
Air is carried along on the rough surfaces of the sugar crystals .
This is why we use caster sugar , as the smaller the crystals , the more air is incorporated .
These bubbles of air are encased by a film of fat , creating a foam .
Creaming can be hard work .
In 1857 Miss Leslie ( an American author of popular cookbooks ) described a technique that would allow cooks to beat eggs " for an hour without fatigue " but then advised : " to stir butter and sugar is the hardest part of cake making .
Have this done by a manservant . "
Take a break from beating and collect some of the mixture on your finger to taste .
Notice how the smooth buttery flavour hits your mouth first , and then the sweetness comes in as the gritty sugar dissolves in your saliva .
Notice that the mixture is lighter and softer than butter on its own : this is all the air you have incorporated .
Also notice how the fat coats the inside of your mouth .
It is this coating ability that allows the fat to play another crucial role , that of a " shortener " .
The fat coats the starch and protein of the flour with an oily film , and in so doing reduces the formation of tough ( bready ) gluten .
Fruit purees can also take on this role .
This leads to a cake that has a tender and " short " crumb .
In factory cake - making , creating a fat that is plastic enough to spread over a large surface area of flour grains but soft enough to form globules requires the application of much science .
Companies spend a lot of time mixing blends of various vegetable oils to get the perfect properties .
At home , however , the third role of fat for me takes precedence : flavour .
That 's why I use butter .
Although the fluidity is n't carefully controlled it always makes great cakes , and has done for hundreds of years .
As a child , the overriding characteristic of cakes was the sweetness of refined sugar .
However , the role of sugar in cake is much more complex .
Initially it carries air bubbles into the mixture .
It has a tenderising effect , as it softens flour proteins .
It also lowers the caramelisation point of the batter , allowing the cake crust to colour at a lower temperature .
Finally , it helps to keep the cake moist and edible for several days after baking .
Salt is another vital ingredient as it acts both as a taste enhancer and to strengthen the gluten network .
Beat the eggs into the mixture and then gently fold in the flour , preferably with a metal spoon .
Beaten egg is added to the mixture to stop the fat - coated air bubbles , created by creaming , from collapsing when heated .
The egg proteins conveniently form a layer around each air bubble .
As the temperature of the cake rises in the heat of the oven this layer coagulates to form a rigid wall around each bubble , preventing it from bursting and ruining the cake 's texture .
The eggs also provide the majority of the liquid ( water ) for the cake mixture .
You will know the water provided by the eggs is sufficient – it usually is – if the mixture forms a thin coat on the back of a metal spoon .
If it does n't , add a little water or milk to loosen up the mixture .
Tasting is vital at every step of cake making , and I love tasting this stage , despite the raw eggs .
For me the very buttery , sugary taste is the taste of childhood – the treat of cleaning the bowl out with a spoon .
It you concentrate you can taste the eggs and flour as gentle background flavours .
The flour gives the mixture a slightly pasty texture , which makes it stick to the inside of your mouth .
It was during the 17th century that eggs became the dominant ingredient for raising cakes , gradually replacing yeast .
This was before chemical raising agents , so all of the air in the cake had to be added by vigorous beating .
One early recipe states that four eggs should be " beaten together for two hours " to lighten a fine biscuit bread .
These air bubbles were then trapped during the baking , a little like in a soufflé , to produce a light and fluffy cake .
This all changed with the discovery of chemical leavening agents such as those in self - raising flour .
The chemical leavening agent is essentially baking powder : a blend of a dried acid ( for example cream of tartar and sodium aluminium sulphate ) and an alkali ( sodium bicarbonate known commonly as baking soda ) .
Adding water ( and heat ) to this mixture allows the acid to react with the alkali to produce carbon dioxide gas .
This is trapped in the tiny air pockets of the batter that were made when you creamed the fat and sugar .
This means you do n't have to add as much air in your mixing because the chemical leavening agent will do some of the work for you .
In fact , the quality of modern leaveners and other ingredients ( and equipment like the electric whisk ) means that mixing all the ingredients together all at once can still produce a light cake .
However , I think the traditional method of beating the butter and sugar first is the most satisfying .
Flour takes the role of structure - builder within the cake .
The starch in the flour is a reinforcing agent that stiffens and helps strengthen the egg foam .
Some of the proteins in the flour join together to create an extensive network of coiled proteins , known as gluten .
It is this gluten that holds the cake together .
Its elastic nature allows the batter to expand during baking ( to incorporate gases ) and then it coagulates into a strong network that supports the heavy weight of sugar and shortening .
The gentle folding action used to incorporate the flour avoids breaking the bubbles you have worked so hard to put into the mixture .
It also reduces gluten formation because although this is vital to the structure of the cake , excessive beating creates too much gluten , resulting in a cake with a heavy , bready texture .
Modern cake flour is made from " soft " wheats with a low protein content , as opposed to bread flour which is " hard " with a high protein content .
Divide the mixture between two greased 20 cm cake tins .
I always use my little finger to scrape the excess mixture from the spoon into the tins .
My mother used to say that the little finger is the cleanest .
While I doubt this , the habit has been passed down to me through her genes .
As I pour the mixture into the tins I love to watch its gloopy consistency , its slightly grainy texture and marvel at its rich yellow colour .
The beautiful yellow comes from the eggs and from carotene in the butter , the same chemical that makes carrots orange .
It originates in the grass on which the cows have grazed .
Place in a pre-heated over at 180C for around 25 - 30 minutes .
There are few things better than sitting in a kitchen as it fills with the smell of baking .
So make a cup of tea and relax for the next 30 minutes , letting the warm smells emanating from the oven envelope you .
The smell of warm butter ; the slightly sulphury smell of the eggs as they coagulate ; the dark caramelising smell of the browning reactions ( and , if you get distracted , the acrid smell of burning ) .
Over time the smells get darker , richer , more caramelised .
Baking a cake on a cold , drizzly , miserable day can't help but make you feel better about the world .
Baking can be broken into three stages : expansion , setting and browning .
As the batter temperature rises , the gases in the air cells expand the stretchy gluten from the flour , then the chemical leavening agents release carbon dioxide .
As the batter reaches 60C , water vapour begins to form and expand the air cells even further .
Carbon dioxide and water vapour account for approximately 90 % of the subsequent expansion of the batter , the remaining 10 % being due to thermal expansion .
At around 80C , the risen batter adopts its permanent shape as the egg proteins coagulate , the starch granules absorb water , swell and form a gel , and the gluten loses its elasticity .
The texture produced at this point is then held until the cake is set by the coagulation of the egg and flour proteins , producing the familiar porous structure of the cake crumb .
Finally , flavour - enhancing browning ( Maillard ) reactions take place on the now dried surface .
It is at this point you have to decide whether the cake is ready – one of the most critical points in the whole process .
The cake will shrink slightly away from the walls of the tin and the crust will spring back when touched with a finger .
Because the batter has coagulated , a wire or thin knife poked into the cake should come back clean .
After removing the cake from the oven , let it stand in the tin for about 10 minutes , then loosen and turn out gently onto a wire rack to cool .
Avoid excessive handling while hot .
Something not quite right ?
If the oven temperature was too low then the batter will have set too slowly , and expanding gas cells will have coagulated to produce a coarse , heavy texture , making the upper surface sink .
If the oven was too hot then the outer portions of the batter will have set before the inside has finished expanding , which produces a peaked , volcano - like surface with excessive browning .
While the cake cools , make some of your favourite icing and apply generously .
Mine is butter icing – 2:1 icing sugar to butter by weight , beaten together with a little lemon juice or milk .
At last , you can cut a lovely thick slice , sit down with another cup of tea in a comfy chair and enjoy a quiet moment with your beautiful creation .
It might not be as good as your mum's but it will taste great and everyone will want a slice .

Series : Writing Great Documentation
A series of articles laying out the tools , tips , and techniques I ’ve learned over the years I ’ve spent helping to write Django ’s docs .
What to write November 10th , 2009
Tech docs can take a bunch of different forms ranging from high - level overviews , to step - by - step walkthroughs , to auto - generated API documentation .
Unfortunately , no single format works for all users ; there ’s huge differences in the way that people learn , so a well - documented project needs to provide many different forms of documentation .
At a high level , you can break down the different types of documentation you need to provide into three different formats :…
Technical style November 11th , 2009
Now that I ’ve discussed what kinds of technical documentation to write , I can move on to the question of how to actually develop a writing style that produces great technical documentation .
Learn to write Unfortunately , there are n’t any shortcuts here .
The best way to learn how to write great documentation is to first learn how to write ( anything ) .
There are some important differences between technical documentation and your average prose , but a solid foundation of good written communication skills is an irreplaceable prerequisite . …
Update May 17 , 2017 : Python packages NumPy , SciPy , and Matplotlib are now optimized with Intel ’s Math Kernel Library for better performance in the current release of ActivePython .
Test out the latest enhancements –download ActivePython 2.7 or 3.5 Community Edition .
With the rise in visibility of the extensive use of Python in Finance driven by the recent SEC proposal to require that most asset - backed securities issuers file a python computer program to model and document the flow of funds ( or waterfall ) provisions of the transaction , we thought it timely to ask the “ must - have ” Python packages for finance would be , so we asked our financial Pythonistas to tell us what they thought in a short survey on the topic .
NumPy , SciPy and matplotlib head up the list and are obvious “ must - haves ” for finance .
The ever - popular MySQL database ’s python binding remains a popular choice .
As those financial front - office types are loathe to give up Excel , and insist on their financial datasets being collected in Excel spreadsheets , xlrd made the list as a necessity .
Here are the survey results in order of their top choice rankings :
NumPy – the fundamental library needed for scientific and financial computing with Python as it contains a powerful N - dimensional array object , advanced array slicing methods , convenient array reshaping methods and libraries with numerical routines for basic linear algebra functions , basic Fourier transforms and sophisticated random number capabilities .
SciPy – a suite of scientific tools for Python .
It depends on the NumPy library , and it gathers a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package .
SciPy provides modules for statistics , optimization , numerical integration , linear algebra , Fourier transforms , signal processing , image processing , genetic algorithms , ODE solvers and special functions Matplotlib – A numerical plotting library that provides production quality 2 - D numerical plotting functionality in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms .
MySQL for Python – A pure Python binding for MySQL , allowing the user to integrate MySQL execution into any Python script .
PyQT - a popular Python binding of the cross- platform GUI toolkit Qt. xlrd – Library for developers to extract data from Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files ( also see xlwt ) RPy2 – RPy2 is a simple Python interface for R , able to execute any R function from within a Python script .
NetworkX –
This tool is used for analyzing network data SymPy – SymPy contains nearly all of the same functionality ( algebraic evaluation , differentiation , expansion , complex numbers , etc. ) as SimPy , but is contained in a pure Python distribution .
Boost .
Python –
This C++ library enables seamless interoperability between C++ and Python ( see ) PyMC – PyMC implements the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm as a Python class , providing flexibility when building your model .
PyMC is also highly extensible , and well supported by the community .
SimPy – Short for “ Simulation in Python ” , an object - oriented , process - based discrete - event simulation language , making it a wholesale agent - based modeling environment written entirely in Python .
Pycluster – This package contains efficient implementations of hierarchical and k - means clustering ..
NLTK – Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing ( NLP ) for the Python programming language .
An honorable mention should go to wxpython , a set of Python extension modules that wrap the cross - platform GUI classes from wxWidgets that received a number of write - in votes .
If you are interested in using Python as a platform for financial analysis , modeling or other research , most of these packages including NumPy , SciPy and Matplotlib come standard with the ActivePython Community Edition – free to use in development and internal testing , and supported by the community .
As well , production usage , technical support and legacy versions of Python are provided with ActivePython Business Edition , Enterprise Edition , and OEM licensing .
These distributions are recommended for use in business - or mission - critical applications .

In an effort to explain what Rand Paul meant when he suggested that private businesses should be able to discriminate against black people , most writers have assumed that the Tea Party fave is no racist but instead a dogmatic , do n’t - tread - on - me libertarian .
As TPM convincingly points out today , the GOP ’s Kentucky Senate candidate ’s ( now recanted ) statements about the 1964 Civil Rights
Act fall well within the libertarian mainstream .
It would be a mistake , however , to assume that Paul ’s views are motivated by little more than a naive ideology .
As I ’ve noted , Paul and his father , GOP Congressman Ron Paul , have a long history of close associations with hard - core racists .
And moreover , Paul is by no means a rigid libertarian .
In reality , Paul and his father espouse a hybrid of libertarian and Republican political beliefs that skews far to the right of typical libertarians :
Abortion
While most libertarians are pro-choice , both Rand and Ron Paul support government regulation of abortion .
Ron Paul would leave the issue up to states while Rand Paul favors a constitutional amendment banning the procedure .
Gay Marriage
Ron Paul voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment of 2004 , which would have limited marriage to unions of one man and one woman , but he favored Texas legislators ’ efforts to “ oppose any attempt by rogue judges to impose a new definition of marriage on the people of my state . ”
Rand Paul is likewise opposed to gay marriage .
True libertarians , however , typically fight all government regulation of marriage , be it same - sex or otherwise , and do n’t tend to moralize on the subject .
Gitmo
Perhaps most troubling to many libertarians , Rand Paul has come out in support of the military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , which his father wants to shut down .
“ Foreign terrorists do not deserve the protections of our Constitution , ” Paul wrote on his website .
“ These thugs should stand before military tribunals and be kept off American soil .
I will always fight to keep Kentucky safe and that starts with cracking down on our enemies . ”
Commenters on libertarian message boards were appalled .
While there ’s certainly nothing inherently wrong or hypocritical with diverging from the libertarian mainstream , Paul ’s willingness to make exceptions to the typical libertarian creed raises questions in the context of his statements on civil rights .
Why was Paul comfortable with setting aside libertarian concepts in the case of Gitmo , but not in the case of defending the rights of racial minorities ?
Is this a glimpse into where his true sympathies lie ?
In a farmer 's field two miles east of Jackson , Tenn. , there 's a helicopter rotor blade sticking straight out of the ground .
Another medical helicopter has crashed .
Another three people are dead .
It 's sad , but not surprising .
The medical helicopter industry has more than tripled in size over the last two decades , expanding from 200 helicopters in 1988 to 668 in 2008 .
While the pilots and crew endeavor to save lives , they also put their own at risk : flying to the scenes of accidents in often remote , dark locations , landing not on pads but in fields and on streets .
But though the industry is the most dangerous sector of commercial aviation , it operates with some of the least safety regulation .
Officially , " … the pilot is responsible for [ the ] safety of [ the ] aircraft and deciding whether to go forward or not , " Lynn Lunsford , a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration , told CNN within hours of the crash .
In other words , if he crashes , it 's his fault .
No one knows yet what caused the accident in Tennessee ; the National Transportation Safety Board wo n't release its preliminary report until 10 days after the crash .
But according to local news reports , there was a thunderstorm moving across eastern Tennessee when the helicopter went down , about an hour before sunrise .
The sheriff of Haywood County , where the crash happened , told a local TV news reporter that when he heard about the crash , his first thought was to wonder why anybody would fly a helicopter in such bad conditions .
If the pilot flew into bad weather on a dark night , causing him to lose sight of the ground ( known in industry speak as inadvertent flight into Instrument Flight Rule conditions ) , the crash may well be his fault .
But there are broader forces at work here .
Helicopter ambulances have crashed 149 times since 1998 , killing 140 people and seriously injuring dozens more .
An industry created to save lives actually has the highest rate of fatal accidents in all of commercial aviation .
In fact , working onboard a medical helicopter is the most dangerous profession in America , with a higher risk of death than fishermen , steel workers or loggers .
If the safety board determines that weather did play a role , then this latest crash fits the pattern of fatal accidents that has plagued medical helicopters since the 1970s .
The board 's first report on the crash epidemic , published in 1988 , found that most air ambulance accidents happen when the pilot can't see , either because of weather or dark night conditions : " Weather - related accidents are the most common and most serious type of accident experienced by EMS helicopters . "
Every study since then has found the same pattern .
The FAA has known for 22 years why medical helicopters kill so many people .
For 21 of those years , no safety standards were introduced to rectify the problem .
According to John Allen , director of the FAA 's Flight Standards Service : " There are only so many rule - making processes that can be accommodated at any one time because it takes research and lawyers and it's not something that the faint of heart should embark upon . "
The FAA 's faint heart is finally on the mend .
Allen announced in 2009 that the agency would begin the years - long process of writing mandatory rules for the medical helicopter industry .
The first rule should be requiring all air ambulances to be equipped with night vision goggles , which would help helicopter pilots see on dark nights and avoid bad weather .
Next the FAA should require Terrain Awareness Systems , also mandatory on all airliners , for every medical helicopter .
The systems measure the distance to the ground and warn pilots to pull up when they fly too close .
The agency also should require all medical helicopters to have flight data recorders to help crash investigators figure out what went wrong , improve training and avoid future accidents .
Finally , the FAA must get serious about the weather .
According to early reports , the closest weather station to the farmer 's field where this helicopter crashed was at a regional airport 23 miles away .
That 's a lot of room for intense storm cells to hide in .
For years , the FAA has investigated the idea of building more weather stations to track low - altitude storm fronts in rural areas away from airports , which would give air traffic controllers the tools they need to detect small , violent storms and help helicopter pilots steer clear .
Hospital Wing , the company that operated the crash helicopter , is not required to operate a flight control center where qualified dispatchers help pilots decide whether it 's safe to fly , and use sophisticated weather tracking overlaid atop moving digital maps to help pilots avoid bad weather .
For years , the National Transportation Safety Board has urged the FAA to make medical helicopters safer by requiring all companies to have such control centers .
It should do so , now .

The ensuing suboptimal adrenal response can be greatly improved through the use of nutritional and herbal therapy .
Vitamins and minerals can be used to prevent metabolic disturbances and to act as cofactors in the production of adrenal hormones .
Herbal medicine is effectively used to tone , restore and enhance the function of the adrenal glands as well as reduce symptoms of adrenal fatigue .
Feeding and supporting the adrenal glands is an essential part of reducing the impact of stress .
Dr. James Wilson specialises in adrenal fatigue and states that it occurs when " stress overextends your body 's capacity to compensate . "
As a result , he says , the " adrenal glands become fatigued and are unable to continue responding adequately to further stress . "
The adrenal glands influence factors throughout the entire body .
They need correct nutrition & herbal medicine reduce stress & enhance physical function .
The effect of modulating adrenal function is far reaching ; such is the impact of an impaired stress response on the entire body .
A low functioning adrenal stress response will impact negatively on nearly all body systems , with effects on the digestive system , immune response , mental and cognitive performance , reproductive health and many more body processes .
Supporting healthy adrenal function can , therefore , be life changing for many individuals .
Using Nutritional Therapy to Support Adrenal Function
When seeking support for adrenal health , a nutritional protocol will likely include vitamin C , B5 , B6 , B1 , magnesium and zinc .
Evidence shows that all these nutrient levels can plummet during times of stress .
The adrenal glands have one of the highest vitamin C concentrations in the body .
Studies have shown that stress and high cortisol levels deplete levels of these nutrients .
As well as being required for the production of nearly all adrenal hormones , vitamin C is also involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters , including many of the " feel good " neurotransmitters such as serotonin .
Pantothenic acid ( B5 ) has been coined the " antistress " vitamin .
It is required for proper adrenal function and helps manufacture adrenal hormones which in turn assist in counteracting the stress response .
Deficiencies of this vitamin have been shown to be directly related to impaired adrenal function .
Both vitamins B1 and B6 are essential cofactors in the production of adrenal hormones .
Thiamine ( B1 ) has been shown to protect the adrenal gland from functional exhaustion secondary to surgery .
B6 is involved in the manufacture of all amino acid neurotransmitters .
It helps the nervous system function , assists cognitive performance and reduces anxiety and stress .
Both zinc and magnesium are depleted with stress and are required for healthy adrenal , immune and thyroid activity .
A lack of magnesium has been shown to exacerbate the stress response ( Seelig 1991 ) .
Herbal Medicine Therapy for Adrenal Health
While there are a whole host of plants which are clinically proven to enhance resilience and tonify the nervous system and enhance relaxation , two stand - out herbs should always be considered specifically for adrenal health - Glycyrrhiza glabra ( Liquorice ) and Rehmannia glutinosa .
Licorice is one of the most highly esteemed herbs for treating conditions associated with lowered adrenal function .
The steroidal compounds of licorice produce an anti-inflammatory response similar to hydrocortisone , as well as mimicking adrenal corticosteroid activity , increasing the half - life of circulating cortisol in the body .
The British Herbal Compendium indicates licorice for adrenocortical insufficiency and autoimmune Addison 's disease ( a disease characterised by destruction of the adrenal cortex . )
Rehmannia glutinosa is a herb used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine , and regarded by Western herbalists as an adrenal tonic which supports the adrenal cortex and pituitary during times of prolonged stress .
As Zi Ge et al ( 1994 ) have suggested , the herb is thought to regulate the activity of the adrenal cortex by promoting the function of the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal axis and the release of steroid hormones .
In combination with a healthy lifestyle , regular exercise and relaxation a herbal and nutritional product designed to support the adrenal glands is very supportive in modern life .

San Luis Police officers guilty of drug smuggling
May 3 , 2010
By KAREN VELIE
CalCoastNews has learned that two San Luis Obispo police officers have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of bringing misbranded Mexican prescription drugs into the United States at the San Ysidro port of entry south of San Diego .
The officers , Dan McDow and Armando Limon , pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors in exchange for no jail time and a year of unsupervised probation , according to court documents obtained by CalCoastNews .
Last Sept. 15 , the two officers were stopped and detained while reentering the U.S. from the Mexican border town of Tijuana , said Lauren Mack , spokesperson for Immigration and Customs in San Diego .
The officers were attempting to bring more than 800 pills , including both uppers and diet pills , into the United States .
Neither officer had prescriptions for the Spanish labeled drugs .
McDow and Limon were placed on paid leave on Sept. 16 after the city learned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were investigating them .
The officers earned more than $ 150,000 during the investigation .
As of March 11 of this year , Limon had received $ 75,393 in total pay and benefits and , for McDow , that amounts to $ 75,817 .
The officers remain on paid administrative leave .
Update :
This story has been updated to include some drug types as well as the quantity of pills .

Today Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter signed a law that authorizes government - licensed medical marijuana dispensaries .
" Primary caregivers , " who are allowed to grow cannabis for patients under the voter - approved constitutional amendment that legalized the medical use of marijuana in 2000 , will now be limited to five patients each and generally will be permitted to grow no more than six plants per patient ( although exceptions can be made based on medical necessity ) .
Yet the law also allows larger - scale dispensaries to stay open , provided they obtain state and local licenses , grow at least 70 percent of their marijuana , operate at least 1,000 feet from the nearest school , and meet various other requirements .
The Marijuana Policy Project says " hundreds " of the state 's existing dispensaries will be able to stay in business , although municipalities would be allowed to ban them altogether .
Another bill signed by Ritter today requires that doctors who recommend marijuana have " bona fide " relationships with their patients :
The new law will require doctors to have completed a full assessment of the patient 's medical history , to talk with the patient about the medical condition that has caused them to seek marijuana and to be available for follow - up care .
The law also prevents doctors from getting paid by dispensaries to write recommendations .
Colorado now joins New Mexico , Rhode Island , Maine , New Jersey , and Washington , D.C. , on the list of jurisdictions that explicitly authorize medical marijuana dispensaries .
The new rules eliminate the ambiguity that had allowed the DEA to continue raiding cannabis suppliers despite the Obama administration 's policy against prosecuting those who comply with state law .
If the DEA raids state - licensed dispensaries in Colorado ( or elsewhere ) , it will be clear that the alleged shift in policy means nothing in practice .
Medical marijuana advocates plan to challenge the provision that permits local governments to ban dispensaries , which in theory could lead to statewide prohibition , contrary to the state constitution 's medical marijuana provision .
“ Maradona ’s crazy !
He does n’t know what he ’s doing ! ” is the general attitude towards Argentina ’s manager since he took over 18 months ago .
The first part is undeniably correct – Maradona is crazy .
He celebrated a crucial goal late on in qualifying by diving along a rain - sodden pitch , Klinsmann - style , and when Argentina finally secured qualification , he sat down in the post - match press conference in front of the gathered journalists , and immediately declared , ‘ You lot take it up the a **e ’ .
He is definitely crazy .
But perhaps , actually – he might know what he ’s doing .
His rant was excessive , offensive and not atypical , but in a sense he ’s just doing what Sir Alex Ferguson has always done at Manchester United or what Jose Mourinho has done at Porto , Chelsea and then Inter – creating an ‘us versus them ’ mentality to enhance team spirit , which is reminiscent of the last time Argentina won the World Cup , in 1986 – where Maradona inspired them to the trophy under the management of Carlos Bilardo , now acting as Argentina ’s general manager .
When those two joined forces for their first World Cup , in 1986 , they famously felt everyone was out to get them .
“ We had to leg it out of the country , even the government were asking for my head , ” Bilardo would later recount .
Their sense of triumph in adversity was a theme throughout that tournament , and when Fifa ’s cameras captured the dressing - room celebration of a demented Diego waving his shirt in the air after the final and bellowing “ we dedicate this to all of you , the f*** ing whore that gave birth to you ” , the clip was slotted into an otherwise classy edit of the tournament and released as a successful film , Hero .
Marcelo Mora y Araujo at Guardian.co.uk
Those Inter omissions
Then again , the feeling of incompetence is probably more inspired by his selection decisions .
He has called up a ridiculous number of players during his relatively short tenure as coach , but the other side of the story is that Argentina have one of the the most settled first XIs in the tournament .
Arguments about the composition of that XI can go on for days .
The omissions of Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Zanetti are both shocking and unsurprising in equal measure – shocking that two Champions League winners and two of the best players in the world in their respective positions have been left out , but unsurprising given Maradona has not shown much love to either since he took over .
But then , how many criticizing Maradona ’s selection have actually seen Argentina ’s games to judge the usefulness of either to the side ?
Zanetti was widely considered to be playing very badly when Argentina were at their worst during qualification .
Building a good international side is not about selecting the 11 ( or 23 ) players performing well at club level , and at least Maradona understands that , in his own way .
And besides , now the squad selections have been made , the players omitted are fairly irrelevant .
Argentina still have one of the best squads in the tournament , and within that , a solid first XI .
Whereas England are still trying to find their best shape and seemingly have no idea who to play in the fairly crucial central midfield roles , Spain have a dilemma about whether to play one or two strikers , and France appear to have stumbled upon a brand new formation days before the World Cup , Diego Maradona ’s Argentina line - up has been predictable for months .
The starting XI
So let ’s just say it then – Sergio Romero in goal .
A back four of Nicolas Otamendi , Martin Demichelis , Walter Samuel and Gabriel Heinze .
Javier Macherano sitting ahead of the defence , with Juan Veron as the deep - lying playmaker .
Angel di Maria on the left , Jonas Gutierrez on the right .
Lionel Messi playing in a classic
No 10 role , and Gonzalo Higuain as the striker .
With the exception of Walter Samuel , those players started in Argentina ’s last day 0 - 1 victory in Uruguay to seal qualification , and that exact XI started Argentina ’s friendly away in Germany in March , also a 0 - 1 win .
Who would have thought it , taking pre-World Cup friendlies seriously and giving your chosen eleven time to gel ?
It seems like a rather good idea – maybe it ’ll catch on .
The pre-tournament friendly
Argentina ’s final friendly before the World Cup was a rather tame affair , a 5 - 0 thrashing of a half - hearted Canada side , who were missing many of their best players after a predictable club v country row , it being the middle of the Canadian season .
Argentina , too , were without key players – having contested the Champions League final just two days before , central defenders Samuel and Demichelis were unavailable , although this barely mattered considering Argentina rarely needed to defend against a feeble Canadian attack .
Nicolas Burdisso came in at centre - back , Otamendi shifted across from right - back next to him , Gutierrez moved back to right - back and Maxi Rodriguez came in on the right of midfield .
They were also without Messi , who had picked up a knock in training , and was replaced by Carlos Tevez .
The final deviation from Maradona ’s favoured XI was an appearance for Javier Pastore ahead of Juan Veron – and if anyone is to test Maradona ’s conservatism , it is Pastore .
A skilful , creative attacking midfielder who has been wonderful for Palermo this season , Pastore is another fairly classic Argentina No 10 .
Messi ’s brilliance has largely kept Pastore away from the inevitable ‘ New Maradona ’ tag ( interestingly , Pastore ’s former Huracan teammate Matias de Federico has been labelled ‘ The New Messi ’ , which seems like quite a watershed moment in football ) but having been largely ignored when playing in Argentina , Pastore is now one of those players you feel might just come from ( relatively ) nowhere to have a big impact at the World Cup .
Full - backs who are n’t allowed past the halfway line
Despite the absences , the basic shape of the team remained clear against Canada .
Firstly , this is as ‘ flat ’ a flat back four as you will ever find in any top - class side in the world .
Maradona has repeatedly insisted that he wants his defenders to purely defend , and despite us being at a stage in football where rampaging full - backs are all the rage and are arguably the most important players in the team , Maradona does not want his to attack .
“ Why do they need to cross the halfway line ? ” , he recently asked .
“ That ’s what my wingers are for . ”
Gutierrez ’s natural attacking instincts meant that he naturally got forward more than Otemandi would have at right - back , but on the opposite side Gabriel Heinze largely followed his instructions – being involved in build - up play and receiving the ball from midfield when it was on his side of the pitch ( do n’t think that the full - backs are literally shying away from the ball ) , but when the ball was in possession on Argentina ’s right , Heinze stayed level with his two centre - backs .
The defensive nature of the full - backs means Argentina can afford to play only one holding midfielder , when many sides play two .
Mascherano plays a role both more energetic and cultured than with Liverpool , where he is used to having Lucas alongside him .
He is forced to cover a greater amount of the pitch laterally ( where at Liverpool , Lucas would cover one side of the pitch ) and also plays more ambitious passes – he has one fewer central midfield colleague , and of course , the full - backs are rarely an attacking outlet .
Considered attacking style
Veron ’s role in the side is near enough that of a deep - lying regista , although he does look to move forward and support the attack when the ball is wide .
Against Canada , his replacement Pastore played much higher up the pitch , looking to drop back when out of possession , but generally looking for a straight , direct forward pass from Mascherano , rather than the shorter , simpler balls Veron would prefer to receive .
Pastore effectively plays one pass ahead of Veron – Veron will distribute the ball to the attacking players who in turn look to play the killer pass , whilst Pastore will look for the killer pass himself .
Angel di Maria plays on the left - hand side and provides a genuine goal threat from a wide area – against Canada he curled a beauty into the far post with the outside of his foot – whilst also covering his full - back well .
On the opposite side Gutierrez plays a less flashy , more energetic role ( Maxi actually did a good job of replacing him against Canada ) in a not dissimilar way to Park Ji-Sung at Manchester United , almost as if he is under strict instructions to make sure he has the highest ‘ distance run ’ figure of the 22 players .
Messi plays a central role , in behind Gonzalo Higuain – the two playing fairly fluid roles in terms of moving to the left and then the right in turn , and it ’s not unusual to see Higuain working the channels in a deep position , allowing Messi to take up a more orthodox striking position .
The team is essentially depending on Messi to provide a moment of magic , something he has rarely done at international level so far .
Conclusion
The surprise is basically that Maradona has not gone crazy with attacking players .
Carlos Tevez , Sergio Aguero and Diego Milito will be substitutes , and rather than Maradona playing a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and trying to cram all his flair players into the same side , he ’s actually constructed a defensive - minded team based around two banks of four , with only one player , Messi , given anything approaching a free role .
With many sides playing on the counter - attack , Maradona ’s tactic of keeping five defensive players in strict positions at all times might just make life difficult for opponents .
The centre - backs at full - backs might create a new challenge for opposing wingers .
Maradona will possess the most talented bench in the tournament with the aforementioned players should Argentina need to change things , and amongst all this is Lionel Messi , the best footballer of his generation .
Argentina should progress past the group stage – but predicting what will happen after that is impossible .
But again , it ’s a Latin American side doing something different defensively which is more than welcome , and whatever happens , with Maradona , it wo n’t be dull .

Aqua Teen Hunger Force Figures Review
| By
Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Meatwad , Master Shake , Frylock , Ignignokt and Err
2 Inch Scale
By : Palisades
2004
$ 40.00
Master Shake , Frylock , and Meatwad – solving mysteries was dropped in favor of intentionally incohesive storylines , improvised dialogue ( often laden with non sequiturs ) , and absurd visual gags .
Situations often involve the Aqua Teens being visited by strange monsters and extraterrestrial beings , most of which are of little power or consequence .
An initially structured plot is often abandoned as characters ’ actions take the story far afield .
Little continuity exists between episodes : regularly appearing characters frequently die in an episode , only to appear alive and well in the next .
Aqua Teen Hunger Force started as the precursor to Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and in a lot of ways set the standard and formula for what Adult Swim would eventually become .
It has went on to spawn a movie , video games and remains the longest running show on Adult Swim , with 7 seasons and over 100 episodes under it ’s belt .
It ’s also gut bustlingly hilarious , crude and absurdity at it ’s finest .
Like so many Adult Swim shows , it ’s targeted at the exact same demographic of people who collect action figures , yet sadly really does n’t have a lot of “ toy ” merchandise .
In 2005 , fledging but awesome toy company Palisades picked up the Aqua Teens just before they really hit their height in popularity .
Unfortunately before the line could ever really get going , Palisades went bust and the only was to get these core characters was at San Diego Comic Con that year .
Today I ’m looking at these figures in all their glory .
Packaging :
Palisades had an interesting idea with the Adult Swim brand in that they were going to release a whole line of toys based off of each property , but label it as one toyline .
The end result is a bunch of unfinished toy lines .
These figures were made to preview what “ could have been ” and are considerably smaller than the toys that eventually faded off into obscurity .
It came in a plain , but effective window box .
Poor Err can barely be seen inside the box .
If this set could have found a way to get Carl in , I ’d consider this the “ core ” guys .
Without Carl , it ’s almost complete .
There ’s definitely room in the box for Carl .
You ca n’t really see it in the box , but when you pull it out the backer card is pretty sweet .
It ’s plain yellow , but has the Aqua Teen logo nicely on the center .
It ’s a cool little thing , but the package overall is a bit bland .
A similar set released only as a three pack , briefly appeared in some Hot Topics .
It did not contain the Mooninites .
Sculpt :
Because of the Aqua Teens unique shapes , you ca n’t really expect these figures to be much more than PVCs .
Even on the show the characters do n’t exactly move a bunch .
So capturing the essence of each character in the design is key .
Thankfully Palisades , known for their Muppets toys , were up to the task .
Master
Shake is very similar to his larger release , with a great annoyed smirk on his face .
He ’s a milkshake container .
It ’s not exactly the most complex design , but it ’s well done here .
There is a special SDCC 2005 logo on the back of Shake .
He ’s the only one that bares this .
Interestingly there are also singe bagged Shakes that they gave out as freebies during one of the cons with this same marking .
I really imagine that Palisades could have had some fun with Meatwad variants .
Thankfully this is just regular Meatwad .
He ’s basically just a meatball .
His face is as adorable as it is in the cartoon .
Meatwad rules .
Frylock is the brains of the bunch and he ’s also the most complex design .
We ’ve never learned all of Frylock ’s secrets , but his design has always been a bit unique .
As expected , Palisades has perfectly captured all of his intricacies .
Back when this figure was released , I do n’t think we ’d seen much of the jewel on the back of Frylock , so it ’s great to see how accurate it is here .
Again , this is a perfect representation of the on screen character .
One the show , Frylock flies .
While they were able to flatten Meatwad ’s bottom half to make him stand up , there is nothing to make Frylock stand .
He does n’t have legs .
This means the only way to get him vertical is to set him on the ledge of something .
Also included in this set are the two pre-8 Bit villains , the Mooninites .
You may remember these two causing mass terror on the streets of Boston when some fans made signs of them that glowed prior to the release of the ATHF movie .
It ’s hilarious that these two are basically terrorists legit and that they ’re from the moon .
They come in a formation for their Quad Laser , of which there is no escape , but you can break them into two as well .
Sadly there ’s no way to get rid of their little guns .
That means these two are n’t quite as good as they could be .
Again , no doubt in my mind that Palisades could have done some great stuff with these two characters had the toy line continued .
Amazingly , yes they are flat as they are on the cartoon .
Meaning that these two are impossible to stand .
I love that they went the extra mile and made these toys accurate , even though they fall over and crap as a result .
They ’re pretty small , but if you collect any of the pocket sized heroes , these guys will go great .
The Kid Robot Chicken Brittle fits right in scale with them as well , but sadly the Carl figure does not .
Bummer about that .
Articulation :
There is n’t a single piece of articulation in the whole set .
That really does n’t mean much though .
You can still get them into a variety of setups where they look good .
I love these little guys as a result .
I think the bigger ones would have had some articulation and the larger Shake has a couple of points , but they ’re not on this set .
I have heard that Shake ’s straw can turn , but I did n’t have any luck with it .
Accessories :
Palisades gave the larger sets some great accessories .
Unfortunately none of these came with anything .
Not that anything was needed though .
It ’s a good simple , five figure set .
Value
I believe at the SDCC this set was like $ 20 .
It was a bit expensive at that price , but understandable .
Now these things can run upwards of $ 80 on the secondary market .
I ’m in awe that no one has made anymore Aqua Teen figures , aside from the aforementioned Kid Robot mini vinyls .
It seems like a license to print money .
They make ATHF hats , shirts , stickers , etc but why no other company has opted to make more figures is beyond me .
I really wish we could have seen all what Palisades would have done .
Score Recap

No true Aqua Teen fan should be without these guys .
Sadly the high prices definitely make them not worth it to most .
As toys they are n’t the best , but a lot more of that is because of the designs of the characters themselves , moreso than laziness on Palisades part .
As a con treat , these are fine little toys and I really wish the whole Adult Swim line could have continued under Palisades because I think as ATHF got huge , it might could have helped the Palisades company stay afloat .
Alas , it was n’t meant to be .
Thankfully we do have these guys and that ’s good enough for now .
Sony ’s just revealed an OLED screen that ’s so astonishingly flexible it can be rolled tightly around a tube the size of a pencil .
All of your sci - fi - inspired bendy screen next - gen computer dreams just came true .
The technology hinges on a new kind of organic thin - film transistor ( OTFT ) based on a new semiconducting material that has eight times the current modulation rate of existing OTFTs .
This makes the display powerful , but there ’s at least one more clever trick–instead of relying on driving electronics based on conventional solid chips in their familiar little black plastic packages , Sony ’s built all the display driver tech out of OTFTs themselves , and integrated them into the actual panel the display itself is made on .
This is crafted from a super - thin ( 20 micron - thick ) substrate , making it flexible enough to be repeatedly rolled around a tube of diameter of just 4 mm , as well as being stretched .
As you can see in the video below , the display is still in prototype mode , so it has failed pixels and stripes ( because no effort ’s been made to optimize the display manufacturing process or yield , as in a real production line ) .
But it still manages a 432 by 240 pixel screen at 121 pixels per inch at a full 16 million color range .
Why should you care about this ?
Because the display is not only flexible but very light , compared to the heavier glass or thick plastic substrates found on existing OLED or even LCD screens .
Since it ’s also able to produce
Sony ’s new screen by a roll - printing process , it could also be relatively cheap .
So as well as enabling roll - out , bendy , or foldable screens on novel devices that as yet exist only in sci-fi , it may end up replacing screens or even printed displays in places you may not expect .

Gideon Levy is a rare voice of courage in an Israeli media generally supine towards the political establishment .
Since 1988 , he has written the “ Twilight Zone ” column for the Israeli daily Haaretz , documenting unflinchingly the myriad cruelties inflicted on the Palestinian people under occupation .
In his new book Gaza , a collection of articles which has just been published in French , Levy utters phrases that , by his own admission , are considered “ insane ” by most of his compatriots .
The Electronic Intifada contributor David Cronin spoke with Gideon Levy about his background and journalism .
David Cronin :
You were born in Tel Aviv in the 1950s .
Were your parents survivors of the Holocaust ?
Gideon Levy :
They were not Holocaust survivors , they just left Europe in 1939 .
My father was from Germany , my mother Czech .
Both were really typical refugees because my father came on an illegal ship , which was stopped for half a year in Beirut by the British and only after half a year on the ocean could it make it to Palestine .
My mother came on a project with Save the Children .
She came without her parents directly to a kibbutz .
My father always said he never found his place in Israel .
He lived there for 60 years but his life was ruined .
He had a PhD in law but never practiced it in Israel .
He never really spoke proper Hebrew .
I think he was really traumatized all his life .
At the same time , he never wanted to go back [ to Europe ] even for a visit .
He came from Sudetenland , which became Czechoslovakia .
All the Germans were expelled .
DC : How did your parents ’ history affect you when you were growing up ?
GL : I was a typical first - generation immigrant .
When my mother used to talk to me in German , I was so ashamed that she spoke to me in a foreign language .
Her name was Thea ; I always said it was Lea .
Thea is a Greek name from mythology .
It is a beautiful name but as a child I always said Lea just to cover up the fact they were immigrants .
My father ’s family name was Loewy and for so many years I was called Loewy .
But then I changed it to Levy and now I regret it so much .
DC : Tell me about your military service in the Israeli army .
GL : I did my military service in the [ army ’s ] radio station .
I was always a good Tel Aviv boy ; I had mainstream views ; I was not brought up in a political home .
I was at the radio station for four years instead of three [ the standard length of military service ] but for the fourth year as a civilian .
It ’s a very popular radio station ; the army finances it but it is totally civilian .
I was totally blind to the occupation .
It was a word I did n’t dare to pronounce .
I was a typical product of the Israeli brainwash system , without any doubts or questions .
I had a lot of national pride ; we are the best .
I remember my first trip to the occupied territories [ the West Bank and Gaza Strip ] .
There were a lot of national emotions visiting Rachel ’s Tomb and the mosque in Hebron .
I did n’t see any Palestinians then ; I just remember the white sheets on the terraces .
I was even convinced that they were happy we had conquered them , that they were so grateful we released the Palestinians from the Jordanian regime .
DC : What was the turning point that caused you to criticize the occupation ?
GL : There was no turning point .
It was a gradual process .
It started when I started to travel to the occupied territories as a journalist for Haaretz .
It is not as if I decided one day , “ I have to cover the occupation . ”
Not at all .
I was attracted gradually like a butterfly to a fire or to a light .
My political views were shaped throughout the years ; it ’s not that there was one day that I changed .
It was really a gradual process in which I realized this is the biggest drama : Zionism , the occupation .
And at the same time I realized there was no one to tell it to the Israelis .
I always brought exclusive stories because almost nobody was there .
In the first [ Palestinian ] intifada , there was more interest in the Israeli media .
But between the first intifada and the second intifada , I really found myself almost alone in covering the Palestinian side .
DC : Have you completely rejected Zionism ?
GL : Zionism has many meanings .
For sure , the common concept of Zionism includes the occupation , includes the perception that Jews have more rights in Palestine than anyone else , that the Jewish people are the chosen people , that there ca n’t be equality between Jews and Arabs , Jews and Palestinians .
All those beliefs which are very basic in current Zionism , I ca n’t share them .
In this sense , I can define myself as an anti-Zionist .
On the other hand , the belief about the Jewish people having the right to live in Palestine side by side with the Palestinians , doing anything possible to compensate the Palestinians for the terrible tragedy that they went through in 1948 , this can also be called the Zionist belief .
In this case , I share those views .
DC : If somebody was to call you a moderate Zionist would you have any objections ?
GL : The moderate Zionists are like the Zionist left in Israel , which I ca n’t stand .
Meretz and Peace Now , who are not ready , for example , to open the “ 1948 file ” and to understand that until we solve this , nothing will be solved .
Those are the moderate Zionists .
In this case , I prefer the right - wingers .
DC : The right - wingers are more honest ?
GL : Exactly .
DC : As an Israeli Jew , have you encountered hostility from Palestinians during your work in the Occupied Palestinian Territories ?
GL : Never .
And this is unbelievable .
I ’ve been traveling there for 25 years now .
I ’ve been to [ the scene of ] most of the biggest tragedies one day after they happened .
There were people who lost five children , seven children in one case .
I was always there the morning after and I would have appreciated if they told me , “ Listen we do n’t want to talk to an Israeli , go away . ”
Or if they would tell me : “ You are as guilty as much as any other Israeli . ”
No , there was always an openness to tell the story .
There was this naive belief or hope that if they tell it to the Israelis through me , the Israelis will change , that one story in the Israeli media might also help them .
They do n’t know who I am .
The grassroots have never heard about me ; it ’s not like I have a name there .
The only time we were shot in our car was by Israeli soldiers .
That was in the summer 2003 .
We were traveling with a yellow - plate taxi , an Israeli taxi : bullet - proof , otherwise I would n’t be here now .
It was very clear it was an Israeli taxi .
We were following a curfew instruction .
An officer told us : “ You can go through this road . ”
And when we went onto this road , they shot us .
I do n’t think they knew who we were .
They were shooting us as they would shoot anyone else .
They were trigger - happy , as they always are .
It was like having a cigarette .
They did n’t shoot just one bullet .
The whole car was full of bullets .
DC : Have you been in Gaza recently ?
GL : I have been prevented from going there .
The last time I was there was in November 2006 .
As I mention in the foreword of my book , I was visiting the Indira Gandhi kindergarten in Gaza the day after a nurse [ Najwa Khalif ] , the teacher in the kindergarten , was killed in front of all her children [ by an Israeli missile ] .
When I came in , they were drawing dead bodies , with airplanes in the sky and a tank on the ground .
I just went to the funeral of the nurse .
It was called the Indira Gandhi kindergarten not because [ assassinated Indian prime minister ]
Indira Gandhi was involved but because the owner of this kindergarten was named Indira Gandhi as an appreciation of Indira Gandhi .
DC : You have often talked about how you enjoy complete freedom to write anything you wish .
But do you get the impression that life is getting more difficult for people with critical voices in Israel and that the government is actively trying to stifle dissent ?
GL : Me personally , writing for Haaretz , appearing on TV , practically I have never gained such freedom .
I ’m appearing every week on Israeli TV on a discussion program .
There were years in which I had to be more cautious , there were years in which the words “ crimes of war ” were illegal , even in Haaretz .
Today , those words are over and I ’m totally , totally free .
No pressure from government or army — nothing .
But for sure , in the last year there have been real cracks in the democratic system of Israel .
[ The authorities have been ] trying to stop demonstrators from getting to Bilin [ a West Bank village , scene of frequent protests against Israel ’s wall ] .
But there ’s also a process of delegitimizing all kinds of groups and [ nongovernmental organizations ] and really to silence many voices .
It ’s systematic — it ’s not here and there .
Things are becoming much harder .
They did it to “ Breaking the Silence ” [ a group of soldiers critical of the occupation ] in a very ugly but very effective way .
Breaking the Silence can hardly raise its voice any more .
And they did it also to many other organizations , including the International Solidarity Movement , which are described in Israel as enemies .
DC : Did you ever meet Rachel Corrie , the American peace activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer seven years ago ?
GL : I never met her , unfortunately .
I just watched the film about her last week .
Rachel , James Miller and Tom Hurndall were all killed within six or seven weeks , one after the other , in the same place in Gaza , more or less .
It was very clear this was a message .
DC : What do you think of her parents ’ decision to sue the State of Israel over her killing ?
GL : Wonderful .
I saw them both when they were in Israel .
They are really so noble .
They speak about the tragedy of the soldier who killed their daughter , that he is also a victim .
And they are so low - key .
I admire the way they are handling it and I hope they will win .
They deserve compensation , apologies , anything .
Their daughter was murdered .
I participated in a film about James Miller , a documentary by the BBC .
James Miller ’s story is even more heart - breaking .
There was a real murder .
They knew he was a journalist , he was a photographer , he had his vest saying “ Press . ”
It was very clear he was a journalist .
And they just shot him .
DC : How do you feel about Israel ’s so - called insult toward the US , when it announced the construction of new settlements in East Jerusalem during a visit to the Middle East by US Vice President Joe Biden ?
GL : I really think it is too early to judge .
Something is happening .
For sure , there is a change in the atmosphere .
For sure , [ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu is sweating .
And the question is : do the Americans have a clear program ?
One thing must be clear : Israel has never depended so much on the United States like it does today .
Until now [ Barack ]
Obama has made all the possible mistakes .
His first year was wasted .
But still we have to give them [ the Americans ] a chance because for sure there is a change in the tone .
But I ’m afraid their main goal now is to get rid of Netanyahu .
And if this is the case , it will not lead anywhere .
Anyone who will replace him will be more of the same , just nicer .
It will be again this masquerade of peace process , of photo opportunities , of niceties which do n’t lead anywhere .
From this point of view , I prefer a right - wing government .
At least , what you see is what you get .
DC : Spain , the current holder of the European Union ’s ( EU ) rotating presidency , appears keen to strengthen the EU ’s relationship with Israel .
What signal would deeper integration of Israel into the EU ’s political and economic programs send ?
GL : I think it would be shameful to reward Israel now .
To reward it for what ?
For building more settlements ?
But I think also that Europe will follow changes in Washington like it follows almost blindly anything the Americans do .
DC : There was a minor controversy recently about the fact that Ethan Bronner , The New York Times ’ correspondent in Jerusalem , has a son in the Israeli army .
Do you have any children in the army and do you think that Bronner was compromised by this matter ?
GL : My son is serving in the army .
My son does n’t serve in the territories but I have always disconnected myself from my sons .
They have their own lives and I have n’t tried to influence them .
About Ethan Bronner , it ’s really a very delicate question .
The fact there are so many Jewish reporters , Zionist reporters who report for their national media from the Middle East , for sure is a problem .
On the other hand , I know from my own experience , you can have a son serving in the army and be very critical yourself .
I would n’t make this a reason for not letting him cover the Middle East for The New York Times , even though I must tell you that I do n’t see the possibility where The New York Times ’ correspondent in Jerusalem is someone whose son is serving in the [ Palestinian resistance organization ] al - Aqsa Brigades , for example .
DC : What role can journalists play in trying to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict ?
GL : There is an enormous historic role that the Israeli media is playing .
The Israeli media , which is a free media , free of censorship , free of governmental pressure , has been dehumanizing the Palestinians , demonizing them .
Without the cooperation of the Israeli media , the occupation would not have lasted so long .
It is destructive in ways I can not even describe .
It ’s not Romania , it ’s not Soviet Russia .
It ’s a free democracy , the media could play any role but it has chosen to play this role .
The main thing is about the flow of information .
It is so one - sided , so much propaganda and lies and ignorance .
Mac usage has long been popular in higher education , and speaking from experience Mac use is really common around my school , with Apple hardware appearing just about everywhere .
Seemingly everyone has an iPod or iPhone , a Mac , there ’s a lot of MacBook ’s , even a few iPad ’s floating around … but even on a techy campus , I have seen nothing quite like this picture that was apparently taken at the Missouri School of Journalism .
Get a load of that !
Wow , that is quite a classroom .
Just a sea of Apple logos glowing back at the professor .
I ’m sure all the students are really paying attention to class , they ’re all taking notes and are n’t goofing off .
Of course , right ?
Thank you Sean for sending in the picture !
If you know of the original source link ( aside from the Missouri School of Journalism ) then share it with us in the comments !
Statistically this may not be too unusual , as some recent data shows that up to 70 % of college freshmen are using Macs which should be a good indicator of a healthy Apple interest by the nations youth .
It will be interesting to see how that usage changes over time … will the Mac continue to be popular in higher ed , or will something else take over ?
I ’m sure it largely depends on how Apple handles the Mac in the coming years , and how students and consumers respond .
Anyway , I thought this was an interesting find that was worth sharing .
Last month , I started a series of articles on creating simple applications with wxPython .
The first couple of articles were on an Image Viewer program .
While I wo n’t abandon that project , I thought it was time for us to delve into something new .
In this article we will start a journey into the wild and woolly world of playing MP3s .
We will create a very simple interface that we can use to play , pause and stop a song with .
We will also learn how to seek within a track and change the volume of the music .
In future articles , we will add a display with music information ( like title , artist , genre , etc ) , track lists , a random function , and more .
Let ’s get started !
Getting Ready to Spin the Music
There are many different layouts that we could have gone with , but for this example , we ’ll use the traditional one where we have a horizontal song track slider widget along the top with player controls underneath and a volume control on the right .
If you ’re familiar with the widgets of wxPython , then you might think that the ShapedButtons would be perfect for this application .
I thought so too until I found out that they depended on the Python Imaging Library ( PIL ) .
While that ’s not a big deal , for a simple example I thought it complicated matters for this article and ended up using some generic buttons instead .
When we enhance this program later , we may take the time to update the buttons to give them more pizazz .
For now , our application will look like this :
It ’s not the prettiest music player in the world , but we can fix that later .
The point is learning how to make an application with wxPython that works in a cross- platform manner .
When I run this application on my Windows XP machine , it appears to use ffdshow .
When I run it on Windows 7 , I think it ’s using Windows Media Player on the backend .
As I understand it , wx .
MediaCtrl will wrap GStreamer on Linux .
Anyway , let ’s take a look at the source :

You might notice that this is actually version # 2 of this application .
In the downloadable source at the bottom of this article , I include the original which uses Andrea Gavana ’s ShapedButton widgets for the player ’s controls .
I recommend that you get the SVN version of this widget from official wxPython repositories as there is a known bug in the version that is included with the default installation of wx .
It also depends on the bitmaps that are included with the wxPython Demo application , so you ’ll need to copy those to the appropriate location too .
Anyway , let ’s go over a few things in the code above .
First off , we set up a couple of “ global ” variables that hold the application ’s directory path so we can find our bitmaps folder .
Next , we create the application .
Since a lot of people store their music in their Documents folder , we use wx .
StandardPaths to find that location in a cross-platform way and set the currentFolder attribute to that location .
We will use this attribute to store the last opened folder when we browse for music to listen to .
We also set up a timer that is used to update the player ’s track slider when it ’s playing .
This is copied verbatim from the wxPython ’s MediaCtrl demo .
In the layoutControls method , we create the necessary widgets and add them to the appropriate sizers as needed .
We also do the widget event bindings here .
The rest of the code handles other layout duties or the events that are generated .
They are pretty self - explanatory as well .
Note that the onPrev and onNext methods do n’t do anything .
This is intended since we do n’t currently have a way to load more than one song at a time .
We will add that functionality in a future version of the program .
So , the basic steps to play a song with this application are as follows :
Go to File and Open Navigate to an MP3 file and open it Press the Play button underneath the playback slider to start listening to your music
That ’s all there is to it .
Now you have a fully functional music player .
Yes , it is limited , but it should give you an idea of how powerful wxPython is and how easy it would be to extend this example to fit your needs .

Today is World Oceans Day and a good time to reflect on and appreciate the environment we enjoy
It ’s World Oceans Day today and in view of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill a good one to appreciate how lucky we are to be able to enjoy the purity of the sea as we are sailing .
I was sent this diary about the subject by Jo Royle ( below ) , the skipper and project manager of the recyclable catamaran Plastiki , which is sailing in Western Samoa .
Thanks ,
Jo , for reminding us not to take the sea for granted .
‘ The sea is everything .
It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe .
Its breath is pure and healthy .
It is an immense desert , where man is never lonely , for he feels life stirring on all sides ’
‘ That is from Jules Verne ’s , Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea .
‘ I think most of us feel an emotional tie to the oceans .
Most of us breathe a sigh of relief or relaxation as soon as we set eyes upon the deep blue wilderness , the feeling of coming home .
‘ My childhood memories are filled with seaside scenes , from being bundled into a carry cot and on and off various little boats ; our first sailing experiences ; the first time I got tumbled by a wave to what felt like near death , only to stand up ankle - deep in water .
‘ I set off on the path of wanting to master the ocean , be the knowledgeable seaman ( girl ) , soon to realise that a life time of learning will not even scratch the surface .
‘ It continues to amaze me how little we know about the ocean , how little we know about how the ocean came to be , or the life stories of whales and dolphins .
It also scares me to realise how little we know about the damage we are unconsciously and consciously causing to the ocean .
I learn new things every day , for example the affects of the toxicity of one - use plastic in our ocean .
‘ The main lesson the ocean and life as a sailor has taught me is that we must be responsive the changing environment .
‘ The health of our oceans is directly linked to our health and the health of future generations .
The ocean regulates the planets temperatures by absorbing a vast majority of the CO2 we continue to pump into the atmosphere , whilst at the same time providing us with more than half of the air we breath .
‘ These facts alone make the ocean our umbilical cord to life .
We can then talk about the hundreds of millions of jobs that are associated with the ocean ; the fact that over 1 billion people , mainly very poor , relay on fish as their main source of protein ; or simply the enjoyment we gain from being by or on the sea .
‘ No matter where we live we are all connected to the ocean , yet sometimes in our hectic lives we can forget what is keeping us alive .
Not everyone has the opportunity to spend time by or on the sea to be continually reminded of this connection .
World Ocean
Day highlights a day to keep the ocean at the forefront of our mind and actions , with a view to ensuring the future health of the planet .
‘ This year ’s World Ocean Day will sadly be remembered for the heart breaking devastation being cause by the Gulf Oil spill ; it is certainly a time we need to be acting on reducing our oil consumption and re assessing drilling policies . ’

The animals that were stolen were trained and friendly , officials say
A Bengal tiger and two camels have gone missing after a truck and a trailer they were travelling in were stolen near Montreal , Canadian officials say .
They say the vehicles were snatched as the driver stopped for the night at a local motel .
Police believe it was an " opportunity crime " , with the thieves being unaware what the cargo was .
The animals , described as " delightful " , were being transported from Nova Scotia to a zoo in Bowmanville , Ontario .
" I do n't think the thieves had any clue about what was inside , " zoo director Michael Hackenberger told Reuters .
He said all three animals - Jonas the tiger and camels Todd and Sean - were trained and friendly .
But he added that the tiger , who weighed some 180 kg ( 400 lb ) " is still a tiger " .
The director also expressed concern that the animals could die of dehydration in the hot weather unless they had water soon .
DURHAM , N.C. – Just because your mother has turned 85 , you should n't assume you 'll have to take over her financial matters .
She may be just as good or better than you at making quick , sound , money - making decisions , according to researchers at Duke University .
" It 's not age , it 's cognition that makes the difference in decision - making , " said Scott Huettel , Ph.D. , Associate Professor of psychology and neuroscience and director of the Duke Center for Neuroeconomic Studies .
He recently led a laboratory study in which participants could gain or lose money based on their decisions .
" Once we accounted for cognitive abilities like memory and processing speed , age had nothing to do with predicting whether an individual would make the best economic decisions on the tasks we assigned , " Huettel said .
The study was published in the Psychology and Aging journal , published by the American Psychological Association .
Duke researchers assigned a variety of economic tasks that required different types of risky decisions , so that participants could gain or lose real money .
They also tested subjects ' cognitive abilities – including both how fast they could process new information and how well they could remember that information .
They worked with 54 older adults between 66 and 76 years of age and 58 younger adults between 18 and 35 years of age . .
The researchers used path analysis , a statistical method of finding cause - and - effect relationships , to determine whether age affected the economic decisions directly or whether it had indirect effects , such as age influencing memory , which in turn influenced decisions .
" The standard perspective is that age itself causes people to make more risky , lower - quality decisions – independent of the cognitive changes associated with age , " said Huettel , who is also with the Duke - UNC Brain Imaging and Analysis Center .
" But that is n't what we found . "
The path analyses showed that age - related effects were apparently linked to individual differences in processing speed and memory .
When those variables were included in the analysis , age was no longer a significant predictor of decision quality , Huettel said .
On a bell curve of performance , there was overlap between the younger and older groups .
Many of the older subjects , aged 66 to 76 , made similar decisions to many of the younger subjects ( aged 18 to 35 ) .
" The stereotype of all older adults becoming more risk - averse is simply wrong , " Huettel said .
" Some of the older subjects we studied were able to make better decisions than younger subjects who scored lower on tests of their cognitive abilities , " Huettel said .
" If I took 20 younger adults and 20 older adults , all of whom were above average on these measures , then on average , you could not tell them apart based on decisions .
On the whole , it is true , more older people process slowly and has poorer memory .
But there are also older people who do as well as younger people . "
Huettel said that the findings suggest strategies to assist people , such as allowing more time for decisions , or presenting data in certain ways to assist people in making decisions .
" Decision scaffolding is the concept that you can give people structure for decision - making that helps them , " Huettel said .
" We should try to identify ways in which to present information to older adults that gives them scaffolding to make the best choices .
If we can reduce the demand on memory or the need to process information very quickly that would be a great benefit to older adults and may push them toward making the same economically beneficial decisions as younger adults . "
In reality , younger adults more often work to obtain credit cards with lower interest rates and lower interest rates on mortgages , for example .
Huettel said that using surveys that track real - world behavior might help to identify who would benefit from getting information in one manner versus another .
" Some younger adults , too , may benefit from getting their information in a slow , methodical way , while others may not , " Huettel said .
" We may be able to predict that based on cognition . "
Self - recognition is important , too , so that if someone knows they process things well over time , they might ask for more time to make a decision rather than making an impulsive decision on the spot , he added .

Pirelli has submitted its bid to become Formula 1's sole supplier of tyres for 2011 to the FIA , AUTOSPORT has learned , with the Italian company adamant that a tyre war is not the right direction for the sport to head next season .
Sources have confirmed that , following discussions with the teams and F1 chiefs , Pirelli has now lodged its plan with the FIA as it awaits news on whether it will beat Michelin and Cooper Avon to the deal .
On the same day that Michelin said it was keen for a tyre war in F1 , Pirelli has reiterated that it would make sense on cost and safety grounds for there to be only a single tyre supplier for at least two more seasons .
Pirelli's racing manager Mario Isola told AUTOSPORT in the Barcelona paddock : " We prefer to be a sole supplier .
The time is very short and so we prefer to be in the same situation that they are now . "
AUTOSPORT understands that Pirelli would be willing to open up the prospect of a tyre war from 2013 , which would give its engineers and teams a two - year transition period to make the move to the much talked - about 18 - inch tyres .
It is believed that Michelin is already ready to consider delaying the introduction of 18 - inch tyres for several years so teams do not face huge development costs in adapting their cars to totally new rubber for next season , while Pirelli is equally open to a compromise solution .
" It is an option , " explained Isola .
" I know the teams would prefer to stay on 13 - inch tyres , at least in order to have a period to be able to develop the car to the 18 - inch tyre .
It is a big change and I can imagine they would have to work a lot on the mechanical aspects of the car .
" The 18 - inch tyre is much more interesting for us because it is very close to a road tyre , compared to the 13 - inch tyre which nobody uses at the moment .
The smallest cars have 14 or 15 - inches , so it is quite a different tyre from what we see usually .
" But it is also true that it will be a different tyre - you cannot imagine that there will be an F1 tyre that is close to a road tyre .
We will collect all the requirements from the teams in order to have a clear picture to start development , if we are successful and get a contract . "
Isola confirmed that Pirelli has spoken to F1 teams about what their requirements for 2011 were , and said he expected a ' hard ' fight to beat Michelin and Cooper Avon .
" We have had some contacts with everybody , to try to better understand the situation now - what they require and what they expect because there is a lot of chat about 18 - inches , or 13 - inches , and the system to supply the tyres to the teams , " he said .
" We have tried to have a clear picture of the situation in order to prepare an offer that can satisfy all the different parties in this world .
Then we will see .
" We know that there are some other tyre manufacturers that are interested in the same project , so I can imagine it will be a hard battle .
But it is always hard in motorsport , not just in F1 . "
Isola 's confirmation that Pirelli is willing to supply the whole field came after Michelin managing partner Didier Mariton told a shareholders meeting in Paris on Friday that his company wanted competition if it were to come back to F1 .
" We 're in talks with the ( International Automobile ) Federation and the other bodies that run Formula 1 and we told them that if several brands were allowed in the sport then Michelin ... would be ready to think about it , " Mariton was quoted as saying by Reuters .
This is an impressive thing , a man with a mission , and NO reservations about carrying it out .
Not sure if he knows WHAT that mission is , but he 's working that bastard .
AMERICAN FORUM
By Laurie Mazur
Forty years ago , 20 million Americans took to the streets to celebrate the first Earth Day .
Their agenda was wide - ranging : pollution , smog , endangered species .
But one issue — population growth — was seen as the mother of all environmental problems .
As Paul Ehrlich , author of The Population Bomb , famously remarked : “ Whatever your cause , it ’s a lost cause without population control . ”
Fast - forward to Earth Day 2010 .
Climate change and other looming environmental threats make the concerns of 1970 look downright tame .
Meanwhile , world population has grown from 3.7 billion in 1970 to 6.8 billion today — an increase of 84 percent .
Yet population growth , for the most part , has fallen off the environmental agenda .
Why ?
The reasons are complex , but here ’s the short version .
Concern about population growth launched a worldwide movement to promote family planning , and it worked : Fertility rates fell , population growth rates slowed and the “ population bomb ” was defused .
At the same time , while family planning has had huge benefits for human health and well - being , some programs trampled women ’s rights in pursuit of lower birth rates .
Those abuses , and a right - wing backlash against family planning , have rendered population issues untouchable in many quarters .
And that ’s too bad , because unsustainable population growth has n’t gone away , and we are in a much better position to deal with it now than we were 40 years ago .
We have a much more nuanced understanding of connections between population dynamics and environmental health .
And the abusive programs of the past have been replaced with a commitment to reproductive health and rights .
Forty years after the first Earth Day , it ’s time to put population back on the environmental agenda — and craft a 21st century population policy .
That policy must be grounded in understanding of the demographic landscape , which has changed dramatically in the past half century .
Today , the largest generation of young people ever is coming of age in developing countries , while the developed world ages and shrinks .
And while the rate of population growth has slowed in most parts of the world , our numbers still increase by 75 million to 80 million every year , the equivalent of adding another United States to the world every four years or so .
A certain amount of future growth is inevitable -- an echo of the great boom of the late 20th century .
But choices made by young people today will determine whether human numbers climb to anywhere between 8 billion and 11 billion by mid-century .
What does that mean for the global environment ?
In the past 40 years , we have learned a lot about the relationship between population dynamics and environmental quality .
We now know that population growth has a significant effect on the natural environment , but that effect is neither linear nor simple , instead shaped by a wide range of mediating factors -- including technology , consumption patterns , economic policies and political choices .
Nonetheless , evidence suggests that a world population of 8 billion would be better than 11 billion , for human beings and the natural systems that sustain us .
Of course , slowing population growth is not all we must do .
Facing climate change will require an unprecedented mobilization of resources and ingenuity .
The good news is , we know how to do this .
Since 1970 , we have learned a lot about how to deal with population growth — and about how not to .
The best way to slow growth is n't with top - down “ population control , ” but by making sure all people have the means and the power to make their own choices about childbearing .
That means , first of all , ensuring universal access to family planning and reproductive health services -- which remains elusive for 215 million women around the world .
It also means tackling poverty and gender inequality , which are strongly associated with high fertility .
In other words , everything we need to do to slow population growth is something we should be doing anyway — ensuring access to family planning , fighting poverty , educating girls and empowering women .
Each of these measures is important in its own right , as a matter of human rights and social justice .
Together they will slow population growth and help protect the environment .
At this critical moment of environmental awareness , it is again time to take up the cause of population growth .
That does n’t mean we should go back to alarmist rhetoric and draconian solutions , any more than we should go back to dial - up phones or computer punch cards .
Instead , let ’s go forward to a 21st century population policy that 's sustainable and just .

DANVERS , Mass .
—Police said a cleaning man was taken to a hospital after being sucked into a machine at a sausage - making company in Danvers .
The accident happened Thursday night as the man was cleaning the vacuum - type machine that is used to season the meat at DiLigui Sausage Co. Police said the man 's head and shoulders became stuck in the machine after it somehow activated while being cleaned .
Lt. Carole Germano told The Salem News that the man -- whose name was not released -- was freed from the machine and showed no obvious sign of trauma , but was taken to a hospital as a precaution .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating the mishap .

‘ Spice ’ is a herbal blend which was freely available in the UK until December 2009 after which it was classified as a Class B drug .
The Spice product range includes ‘ Gold ’ and ‘ Diamond ’ and a very limited number of reports have identified that these contain non-traditional cannabinoids .
We have determined for the first time the components of Spice ‘ Gold Spirit ’ using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy and also explored a potential screening approach using Solid Probe Mass Spectroscopy which requires no liquid–liquid extraction .
This methodology has the potential to facilitate the accelerated screening of illegal components in ‘ Spice ’ and other related herbal - type products .
After taking forwards with their first four picks of the NHL entry draft , the Detroit Red Wings selected goaltender Petr Mrazek of Ottawa ( OHL ) with their fifth - round selection ( 141st overall ) .
The 18 - year - old Mrazek ( 6 - foot , 162 ) , a native of Ostrava , Czech Republic , was ranked 25th among North American goalies by NHL Central Scouting .
He posted a 12 - 9 - 1 record , 3.00 goals - against average and .905 save percentage in 30 games with Ottawa last season .
The Red Wings aim to select a goalie in every draft .
Their need increased with Daniel Larsson returned to Sweden in May .
Detroit had only two goaltending prospects in its system -- 2008 first - round pick Thomas McCollum and Jordan Pearce .
In the sixth round ( 171st overall ) , the Red Wings selected center Brooks Macek ( 5 - foot - 11 , 180 ) from Tri-City ( WHL ) .
Macek , 18 , had 21 goals and 52 assists in 72 games last season .
Detroit took five forwards -- four of them centers -- in the first six rounds .
The Red Wings selected defenseman Benjamin Marshall ( 5 - foot - 9 , 160 ) from Mahtonedi ( Minn . )
High School with their final pick in the seventh round ( 201st overall ) .
Yahoo prevailed Friday over Colorado federal prosecutors in a legal battle testing whether the Constitution 's warrant requirements apply to Americans ' e-mail .
Saying the contested e-mail " would not be helpful to the government 's investigation , " ( .pdf ) the authorities withdrew demands for e-mail in a pending and sealed criminal case .
For the moment , the move ends litigation over the hotly contested issue of when a warrant under the Fourth Amendment is required for Yahoo and other e-mail providers to release consumer communications to the authorities .
The brouhaha concerned a 1986 law that already allows the government to obtain a suspect 's e-mail from an internet service provider or webmail provider without a probable - cause warrant , once it 's been stored for 180 days or more .
The government contended , and then backed off Friday , that it could get e-mail less than 180 - days old if that e-mail has been read by the owner , and that the Constitution ’s Fourth Amendment protections do n't apply .
Yahoo was backed ( .pdf ) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Google and the Center for Democracy & Technology in challenging the government 's position .
It defied a court order to turn over those e-mails to the feds in a Colorado criminal probe that is under seal .
Litigation over the topic ensued , and the government blinked in a legal standoff highlighting antiquated privacy laws .
Had the courts adopted the government 's position , ( .pdf ) the vast majority of Americans ' e-mail would be accessible to the government without probable cause , whenever law enforcement believes the messages would be relevant to a criminal investigation , even if the e-mail 's owner was not suspected of wrongdoing .
Still , the government 's move does not resolve the privacy issue , but merely instead delays it for a later day .
The legal jockeying began Dec. 3 , when a Colorado magistrate ordered Yahoo to hand over to authorities e-mail communications under six months old " received by the specified accounts that the owner or user of the account has already accessed , viewed or downloaded . "
Yahoo refused , claiming the 1986 Stored Communications
Act requires the government to show probable cause to obtain that e-mail .
( . pdf )
The government asserted a lesser , warrantless standard that the " communications sought are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation . "
The difference between those standards is the subject of fierce debate in the legal community .
But all sides agree that obtaining unopened e-mail less than 180 days old requires the authorities to make a probable - cause showing to a judge , and that after 180 days stored e-mail — read or unread — can be accessed without such a warrant .
The Stored Communications
Act was enacted at a time when e-mail generally was n’t stored on servers at all , but instead passed through them briefly on their way to the recipient ’s inbox .
In today ’s reality , e-mail can , and is , being stored on servers forever .
A consortium of businesses , including Google and Microsoft , recently asked Congress to update the law and require probable cause to obtain any e-mail .
Until Friday , the government ’s position in the Colorado case tried to push the outdated law even further .
Prosecutors were arguing that opened e-mail less than 180 days old is no longer in “ electronic storage ” as defined by the law — which allows the feds to obtain that e-mail without probable cause .
Yahoo spokeswoman Dana Lengkeek said in a telephone interview that " We 're pleased with the decision and we continue to be committed in protecting the privacy of users . "
Colorado prosecutors declined comment .

The changes will coincide with the introduction of the new iPhone
UK phone network O2 has scrapped unlimited data downloads for smartphone customers .
All new and upgrading customers will have their usage capped at between 500 Megabytes ( MB ) and one gigabyte ( GB ) depending on their monthly tariff .
Analysts said the move was " inevitable " as more and more consumers switch to data - intensive smartphones that can surf the web and show video .
Other networks are likely to follow O2 , they said .
" O2 had become the industry poster - child of the capacity crunch era , " said Thomas Wehmeier , principal analyst at Informa Telecoms and Media .
Many customers have complained about poor service , download speeds and network coverage .
" It is a victim of its own success - O2 has had so many people sign up for data intensive phones , like the iPhone , " Ben Wood of research firm CCS Insight told BBC News .
" Huge amounts of data are consumed by the minority of people . "
Video pressure
O2 has said that the changes will affect just 3 % of its 21 m customers , who will have to pay additional charges for their data use .
" That 3 % are using something like 36 % of the data capacity of O2's network , " said Mr Wood .
" If O2 get it right , everybody will get a better service . "
Having applied the brakes , O2 must now show that it can deliver a decent mobile surfing experience for those who stay loyal Rory Cellan - Jones , BBC 's technology correspondent Read Rory 's thoughts in full
Currently , he said , O2 was spending around £ 1 m a day to upgrade its network to cope with the " exponential demand " for data on smartphones .
However , he said , it could not carry on adding capacity if data usage was exploding for the same amount of revenue .
The new charges will be brought in on 24 June , to coincide with the launch of the iPhone 4 .
" They are using the iPhone as a mechanism to introduce the tariff change , " said Mr Wood .
The new handset has a higher resolution camera and is able to record high definition video , both of which will add pressure to O2's network .
' Dangerous game '
O2 currently has the largest installed base of iPhone users in the UK .
The network 's cheapest tariff will cost £ 25 per month for two years and will allow a user to download 500 MB per month .
After that , it will cost £ 5 for every additional 500 megabytes of data consumed .
O2 said that 500MB is two and a half times the average O2 customer 's current use and would allow someone to browse 5,000 standard web pages .
Mr Wehmeier agrees with the figures .
" There 's a lot of talk about the hunger for data of iPhone users , but our analysis shows that the majority of users will be comfortably served by 500 MB of data per month , " he said .
The most expensive tariff - at £ 60 per month - allows users to download 1GB .
Existing customers will be allowed to keep their unlimited data plans until they renew their contract .
O2's CEO Ronan Dunne sad the move laid " the foundation for a sustainable data experience for all customers " .
Mr Wood said that he thought that most network operators - who face similar challenges to O2 - would follow the change .
However , he said , others may use it as an opportunity to try to woo customers away from O2 .
" That 's a dangerous game to play , if that top 3 % of users go to another network , " he said .
O2's changes follow similar moves by the AT&T network in the US .
Two anti-spam systems developed by Microsoft for Hotmail designed to help ISPs track down offending users were abused by spammers , a lawsuit brought last week by the software giant alleges .
The spammers are accused of attacking Hotmail 's Junk Mail Reporting Program and Smart Network Data Services to try to prevent the mail service from classifying messages correctly .
The suit , Microsoft Corporation v. Boris Mizhen , et al. , claims that the defendants created millions of Hotmail accounts and used them to falsely label up to 200,000 spam messages a day as legitimate mail .
With this evidence of " legitimacy , " an associate of Mizhen then contacted Microsoft asking that the company stop treating them as spam .
Microsoft asserts that this deception allowed Mizhen and his affiliates to disseminate a " vast quantity " of spam to Hotmail users , and that this violates various federal laws including the CAN - SPAM act .
This is not the first time that Boris Mizhen has been sued by Microsoft .
He was sued in 2003 for spamming Hotmail users ; the case was settled , with Mizhen agreeing to pay the company $ 2 million and refrain from further spamming Hotmail users .
The iPhone 4 has been shrouded in controversy and drama for months .
First there was the the lost iPhone that showed up on Gizmodo back in April , which was subsequently followed by a police raid on Gizmodo writer Jason Chen ’s home .
Flash forward to June 15th when iPhone pre-orders began and both Apple and AT&T ’s servers were unable to keep up with the volume of orders rolling in .
Amidst the chaos , some users had their credit cards charged twice while others soon found out that their pre-orders had been cancelled altogether .
And now , of course , Apple is dealing with a serious problem with the potential to adversely affect its bottom line .
Over the past few days , iPhone 4 owners have been complaining of shoddy network performance when they hold their new device a certain way .
While Steve Jobs casually told one concerned owner via email that he was holding the device wrong , there ’s no getting around the fact that these reception issues are worrisome .
That said , AppleInsider readers keeping an eye on Apple ’s tech support forums reported on Friday that Apple is planning to issue an iOS 4.0.1 software update aimed at alleviating the connection issues associated with the iPhone 4 ’s new design , wherein the antenna system is integrated into the exterior of the device .
AI notes that the the entire thread regarding the seemingly widespread issue was eventually taken down .
The fix is expected to address a issue in iOS 4 related to radio frequency calibration of the baseband .
Readers who saw the original forum discussions say that the issue is believed to occur when switching frequencies ; because the lag is allegedly not calibrated correctly , it results in the device reporting “ no service ” rather than switching to the frequency with the best signal to noise ratio .
The article notes that iOS 4 changes the way the iPhone baseband decides which frequencies to use , which helps “ explain why iOS 4 has also caused similar problems for iPhone 3GS users . ”
The bug , which can hopefully be fixed with a crafty software update , has comically been dubbed the “ death grip ” by bloggers .
And giving even more hope that a software fix is on the way , iPhone 4 users on AT&T ’s 3G MicroCell network have been unable to replicate the issue , presumably because it ’s always the most powerful available signal , thus never forcing the device to switch frequencies .
Der EU - Rat hat zur Ergänzung bestehender nationaler Anti-Terror - Dateien die Einrichtung eines übergreifenden Informationssystems zur " Radikalisierung " potenzieller " Gefährder " gefordert .
Dies geht aus dem Entwurf ( PDF - Datei ) für einen Beschluss für den Einsatz eines " standardisierten , multidimensionalen und teilstrukturieren Instruments zum Sammeln von Daten und Informationen über Radikalisierungsprozesse in der EU " hervor , das die Regierungsvertreter der Mitgliedsstaaten Mitte April beschlossen haben .
Die britische Bürgerrechtsorganisation Statewatch , die den Plan jetzt bekannt gemacht hat , kritisiert das Vorhaben in einer Stellungnahme ( PDF - Datei ) .
Es solle ein System zur Risikoabschätzung von " Radikalisierungserregern " aufgebaut werden .
Nach den Kriterien zur Einschätzung des Gefährdungspotenzials , könnten " Millionen Menschen in der EU " in das Raster fallen und unter spezielle Beobachtung genommen werden .
Die EU hat bereits 2009 einen Aktions - und Umsetzungsplan verabschiedet , laut dem die Mitgliedstaaten " Mechanismen " schaffen sollen , um " systematisch die Hauptfaktoren in Radikalisierungsprozessen zu analysieren " .
Dabei sollen die verschiedenen Umfelder , die Extremismus erzeugen , identifiziert und genau untersucht werden .
Informationen vor allem über die Aktivitäten " extremistischer religiöser Führer " und andere Verbreiter von Hass und Terroraufrufen seien etwa über Europol auszutauschen .
Mit der neuen " Radikalisierungsdatei " will der Rat nun erreichen , dass die Mitgliedstaaten die " vielen Facetten " des vorgeschlagenen Instruments zur Datensammlung voll nutzen und den Informationsaustausch " optimieren " .
Europol " Listen " mit Personen erstellen können , die in Radikalisierungsprozesse oder die Verbreitung extremistischer Botschaften verwickelt sind .
Über das System soll Warnhinweise erzeugt werden , die konkrete Aktionen wie die besondere Überwachung oder die Festnahme Verdächtiger auslösen könnten .
Laut Statewatch reichen die nationalen Anti-Terror - Gesetze in der EU aber bereits aus , um strafrechtlich gegen Anstifter gewalttätiger Anschläge vorzugehen .
Die Bürgerrechtler verweisen auf ein bisher vom Rat geheim gehaltenes Hintergrund - Dokument ( PDF - Datei ) zum Aufbau des vorgeschlagenen Informationssystems .
Demnach sollen in der Datenbank nicht nur Angaben über islamistische " Gefährder " erfasst werden , sondern auch über " Radikalisierungsagenten " von Rechts - und Linksaußen , aus dem nationalistischen Umfeld und aus Kreisen von Globalisierungsgegnern .
Diese Definition sei so breit angelegt , dass selbst die Unterstützer von Freiheitskämpfern in anderen Ländern darunter fallen könnten .
Letztlich dürfte es möglich , mit dem Instrument gegen alle vorzugehen , die " gegen den Status quo sind " .
Die Bürgerrechtsvereinigung stößt sich weiter an einem Katalog von 70 Fragen , mit dem Sicherheitsbehörden den Radikalisierungsgrad von Personen einschätzen sollen .
Einige seien schlicht bizarr , andere zeigten , wie einfach man in das staatliche " Netz des Verdachts " geraten könne .
So würden etwa Verbindungen zu " anderen ideologischen Bewegungen " abgeklopft , " die Gewalt unterstützen " .
Auch seien Beziehungen zu " Schulkameraden , Nachbarn , Freunden , Verwandten oder Gefängnisgenossen " zu untersuchen .
Darüber hinaus werde auf die " wirtschaftliche Situation " , " auffällige psychologische Züge " , den " Grad der direkten persönlichen Unterstützung " etwa durch die Familie oder das allgemeine " soziale Umfeld " abgestellt .
Dazu komme laut Statewatch , dass mit dem Stockholmer Programm zur inneren Sicherheit eine weitere Datenbank für " gefährliche Unruhestifter " im Raum stehe .
Generell drohten " offene , legitime politische Diskussionen und Aktionen " so zu einem " weiteren Opfer des Kriegs gegen den Terror " zu werden .
Zu weit gefasst ist die Bedeutung von Risikoträgern nach Ansicht der Bürgerrechtler auch beim EU - Programm zur Errichtung nationaler Fußballinformationspunkte ( National Football Information Points ) .
Mittlerweile hätten elf Mitgliedsstaaten einschließlich Deutschlands sogenannte Hooligan - Dateien aufgebaut , wie aus einer Unterrichtung ( PDF - Datei ) der Ratspräsidentschaft von Mitte Mai hervorgehe .
Weitere neun haben dem Papier zufolge vergleichbare Datenbanken mit potenziell gefährlichen und gewaltbereiten Fußballfans , zu denen die nationalen Informationszentren Zugang hätten .
Laut Statewatch reiche in manchen Ländern aber schon ein Platzverweis aus , um in einer der Gewalttäter - Dateien zu landen .
In Folge könnten etwa Reisen zu Fußballspielen in anderen Ländern unterbunden werden .

( CNN ) --
The battered economy is devastating school districts nationwide .
Faced with shrinking budgets , many schools say they have no choice but to lay off teachers , cut arts and sports programs or consider other drastic measures to save money .
CNN 's Soledad O'Brien talked with the top school official in the nation , U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , about the ties between the economy and schools , the state of education and options for the classroom .
Soledad O'Brien :
You often say , " We have to educate our way to a better economy . "
What does that mean ?
Arne Duncan :
When we have a national high school dropout rate of almost 30 percent and we 're losing 1.2 million students to the street , how can we have a strong economy ?
Thirty years ago it was actually OK to drop out of high school .
You could still support your family and own your own home .
Today there are no good jobs for a high school dropout in the legal economy .
None .
There are almost no good jobs in the legal economy if you just have a high school diploma .
Four years at a university , two - year community colleges , trade school , vocational training -- some higher education has got to be the goal for every single student .
O'Brien :
How can you make change in schools when we 're talking about deep budget cuts because of the terrible economy ?
Duncan :
This is an educational emergency .
We can't go to four - day school weeks .
We need more time , not less , in school .
We want a very significant education jobs package to stave off this potential crisis we 're looking at for 2010 .
We 're working very hard with Congress to support an emergency jobs bill to save educators ' jobs .
O'Brien :
And if it does n't pass , what happens ?
Duncan : Children get hurt .
When you eliminate summer school -- that 's a particular challenge especially for at - risk students .
When you eliminate extracurriculars -- band , art , sports teams -- that 's a huge challenge , that 's the reason a lot of kids go to school .
We do n't want to take a step backward .
Teachers are our unsung heroes .
They 're doing extraordinary work .
We have to do everything we can to support them .
I just have so much respect for President Obama 's courage at a time when he basically level - funded domestic spending , [ but ] for education he 's asking for historic increases .
Why ?
Because this is an investment that -- if we fail to make it -- we do so at great peril .
O'Brien : Speaking generally , is education a mess ?
Duncan :
We have a diversity of outcomes .
Our best schools are some of the best in the world .
Schools in the middle are improving .
Then there are the underperforming schools -- they 're in every state .
That bottom 5 percent , where the dropout rates are 50 , 60 , 70 percent -- that 's where we have a moral obligation to step in with a huge sense of urgency and get dramatically better results .
Poverty is not destiny and anyone who tells you that is lying .
We know poor children can learn .
O'Brien :
You have said in the past you have to do something dramatic .
Close a school , is that dramatic ?
Duncan :
There are many different options .
That 's always going to be determined at the local level .
But incremental change is not the solution .
Where you have schools that , frankly for decades , have n't given those children the education of quality they need , the status quo is n't the answer .
We have to think about something that 's going to help students today , not 10 years from now .
Our students have one chance to get a good education .
O'Brien :
In Chicago you closed schools when you ran the district .
There was an upside and a downside .
Let 's talk about the upside first .
Duncan :
The upside : In Chicago , we turned around Sherman Elementary about four years ago .
There you have the same children , same poverty , same families , and unfortunately , the same violence in that community .
In three to four short years the number of students meeting or exceeding state test standards has more than doubled .
Why ?
We had an absolute passionate belief that these students can be very , very successful .
Is it hard work ?
Absolutely .
Does it take remarkable educators ?
Absolutely .
Does it take going way beyond the call of duty ?
Absolutely .
But it is also absolutely possible .
O'Brien : Describe for me what was done at Sherman .
Duncan :
We moved the adults out , the children stayed , and we came in with another phenomenal group of adults -- a new principal , teachers and staff .
Sherman parents were initially very worried .
I think that 's in part because parents in disadvantaged communities have been lied to by authorities several times before .
It 's hard for them to trust change .
These were parents who were very , very angry at me personally .
Now , when I walk in that community , those same parents will literally kiss me on the cheek .
They see that we did the right thing by their children .
It does n't matter -- rich , poor , black , white -- every parent in every community wants the best for their children .
When you simply keep your word , no one appreciates that more than a parent whose child has not had a chance to break through .
I 'll tell you another interesting story .
There used to be huge levels of violence in that school .
In that first year of turnaround , violence went down so much that unbeknownst to me , my security team audited the results .
They thought it could n't have gotten that much safer , but that 's exactly what happened .
The culture fundamentally changed .
O'Brien :
You got some flack when research came out that said the kids in a school closing were sent to an equally crappy school .
Duncan :
When you go from one low - performing school to a marginally better one , yes , you 're not going to have any big benefit , but where you can turn around that entire school -- bring in a new team of adults you can help every single one of those students in their neighborhood school , that 's instead what you ultimately want to do .
This is never about pointing fingers .
O'Brien :
But in a way it is about pointing fingers , because people say , " It 's the parents -- they 're not involved " or " It 's the teachers . "
My mom was a public school teacher for a million years and she used to say " We do n't get paid enough money to deal with the challenges that we have . "
Duncan :
In education every one does love to point fingers .
But we are seeing communities where folks are moving out of their silos .
Where that 's happening , students can do very , very well .
Chicago has a long way to go but there 's been real progress .
Sadly , Chicago 's not alone with its struggles .
There is n't one urban school district in the country -- Chicago , L.A. , New York , D.C. , Philly , Baltimore -- there 's not one urban system yet where the dropout rate is low enough and the graduation rate is high enough .
There has been a lot of progress including in Chicago , but no one is satisfied .
We have to get better faster .

“ GAZA Flotilla Drives Israel Into a Sea of Stupidity ” declared the Israeli daily Haaretz on Monday , as though announcing the discovery of some hitherto unknown body of water .
Citizens of other nations have long since resigned themselves , of course , to sailing those crowded waters , but for Israelis  and , indeed , for Jews everywhere  this felt like headline news .
Regardless of whether we chose in the end to condemn or to defend the botched raid on the Mavi Marmara , for Jews the first reaction was shock , confusion , as we tried to get our heads around what appeared to be an unprecedented display of blockheadedness .
Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic cast his startled regard back along the length of Jewish history looking for a parallel example of arrant stupidity and found , instead , what Jews around the world have long been accustomed to find in contemplating ourselves and that history : an inborn , half - legendary agility of intellect , amounting almost to a magical power .
“ There is a word in Yiddish , seichel , which means wisdom , but it also means more than that :
It connotes ingenuity , creativity , subtlety , nuance , ” Mr. Goldberg wrote .
“ Jews have always needed seichel to survive in this world ; a person in possession of a yiddishe kop , a ‘ Jewish head , ’ is someone who has seichel , someone who looks for a clever way out of problems , someone who understands that the most direct way  blunt force , for instance  often represents the least elegant solution , a person who can foresee consequences of his actions . ”
This is nonsense , of course  nonsense to which , I hasten to assure Mr. Goldberg , I have always avidly subscribed .
In the aggregate , Jews may or may not be smarter than other groups , but the evidence in favor of granting some kind of inherent or culturally determined supernatural abilities of seichel to the yiddishe kop certainly cannot be found in our history , which is littered as thickly with the individual and collective acts of blockheads as that of any other nation or people or tribe .
Today , oil industry experts and government entities are attempting to find a way to cap an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico that has become uncontrollable due to a blow out .
The blow out resulted in the destruction of the oil platform and the loss of 11 crew members .
On June 4 , 1979 oil industry experts and government entities were attempting to find a way to cap an offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico that had become uncontrollable due to a blow out .
Yes , the incident near the mouth of the Mississippi River in the Gulf is not totally unprecedented .
Red Adair practically invented and perfected the trade of capping wild wells .
Red was instrumental in capping the 1979 wild well .
Unfortunately , Red Adair is no longer with us and the previous incident does not provide much hope for a happy ending .
The Deepwater Horizon rig was a semi- submersible , state of the art drilling platform leased by British Petroleum .
The location was about 65 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River but it was drilling in depths of 1520 meters ( about 5000 feet ) of water in the Mississippi Canyon sector 252 .
It was meteorological station number 42916 and was about 150 miles SE of New Orleans .
Back in 1979 , it was a little different situation .
The IXTOC I was a semi- submersible rig located about 600 miles SSE of Brownsville Texas in the Bay of Campeche .
It was drilling at a depth of about 11,000 feet below the ocean floor in just a few hundred feet of water .
While the cause of the current Horizon blowout is unknown , the IXTOC blowout was the result of a loss of drilling mud in the casing .
The general idea of mud in the shaft is to equal pressure throughout and allow for monitoring of gas .
Without the mud , there was a buildup of gas pressure that blew out the well .
The oil ignited and the rig collapsed .
Now , there are supposed to be blow out preventers and several layers of “ fail safe ” back ups to prevent such an incident .
But , just like the Titanic was not supposed to be able to sink , anything that man builds can and does fail .
It does n’t happen often but it does happen .
A big difference between the current incident and the IXTOC I was the water depth .
There was a bunch of wreckage blocking the wellhead but divers and submersibles were able to work at the site .
In the case of the Horizon , divers are not able to go to such depths and the environment is extremely dark naturally .
With the presence of oil , visibility will be quite difficult .
Throw in the fact that there are probably quite chaotic currents in the Mississippi Canyon at those depths and submersibles are very difficult to operate .
At IXTOC , divers were eventually able to reach and activate the blowout preventer on the ocean floor but pressures built up by the well resulted in valves that began to rupture .
The blowout preventer was subsequently reopened to prevent it from being destroyed .
As an alternative , two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure and that allowed for the well to be capped .
Here ’s the bad news .
It took about 9 1/2 months to complete the work .
In the meantime , oil flowed at the rate of 10,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil a day .
Notice I said “ barrels . ”
That is what is the common unit of measure for oil .
The media uses that term when it comes to trading other economic activity .
But , in recent years when its a ecological matter , they go to gallons .
The argument as to why they do that is because , in journalism , you are to write conversationally .
Most people do n’t know how much a barrel of oil but everyone knows the volume of a gallon .
The only trouble with that argument is that they do n’t apply the “ coversational ” principal consistently .
I submit that since a barrel of oil is 42 US gallons , then it makes the numbers 42 times larger and therefore more headline grabbing than if they used barrels .
No one seems quite sure of how much oil is flowing from the Horizon blowout , but most media estimates seem to be between 3000 and 5000 barrels per day .
I just heard a newscaster say “ 200,000 gallons a day . ”
If that estimate is correct , then it ’s a long way from the IXTOC disaster which was the worst oil spill in history aside from the deliberate destruction of the oil wells in Kuwait .
So , while the numbers are large , even Forbes Magazine points out that the world has seen far worse .
However , I disagree somewhat with the point that the article makes .
It says that , in order for this to surpass the 3 million barrels of oil ( 126 million gallons ) of oil spewed out into the Gulf by IXTOC , the Horizon well would have to continue its current pace for 200 days .
I say , “ so what ? ”
Hey it took them over 9 months to cap that well .
This well is in a far more inhospitable an environment than the IXTOC I , which may hamper the capping efforts .
Its proximity to so many populated areas and economic concerns adds to the potential problems .
Then , when one considers the natural ocean currents takes the flow generally to the East and then Southeast , you consider that almost the entire US Gulf Coast is at risk .
If that is not enough , then it ’s not totally out of the question that the flow could get caught up in the circulation that feeds into the Gulf Stream which would take the flow through the Florida Straits and off the US East Coast toward England !
Will all of that happen ?
Probably not .
First off , they will most likely have to drill relief wells in order to slow the flow from the original well .
Given that the Horizon was drilling at some 18,000 feet deep , estimates are that it would take about 3 months for that to come about .
Then , there is also the consideration that this oil tends to glob together after a period of time .
We used to call them “ tar balls ” and they were a nuisance when we went to the beach in Galveston .
While the tar balls would no doubt be much larger and more numerous , it may not affect the marine life quite as much as feared .
Also , the ocean itself will probably break some of it up and a certain amount will evaporate .
Still , its potentially an enormous disaster .
A fly in the ointment of all of this is hurricane season .
I ’m not sure if anyone is really sure how a tropical cyclone would affect the oil .
Would it break it up ?
Would it spread it out ?
It ’s not clear .
What is certain is that the effects will continue for a long time and it will be interesting how long it takes the media to move on to another subject .
Marine life will be greatly adversely affected .
The economies of coastal communities will suffer and it will bring great economic hardship to all the people whose livelihood depends on the ocean .
Let us hope that this incident does not come close to rivaling the IXTOC I disaster .
It ’s bad enough as it is .
Weather Bottom Line : Look for temperatures to warm to the mid to perhaps upper by Wednesday .
A cold front will try to come though Wednesday night and will get close enough to raise the chances for rain and t’storms but it will retreat in response to another system behind it .
That system will be much stronger .
With a good amount of moisture to work with as well as higher temperatures , that front will have plenty to work with for the potential of strong to severe thunderstorms Friday afternoon and evening .
Following that look for temperatures for Mother ’s Day Weekend about 20 degrees cooler than they had been .
'' The Rudd Government is publicly claiming credit for the increased investment in mental health when almost all of this is a consequence of the work of the Howard government , '' he wrote in the letter , obtained by The Sunday Age .
Professor Mendoza wrote that he had regarded his appointment as chairman of the council ''as the most important public service responsibility of my life ' ' but he now realised that his efforts to improve mental health services and ' ' end the shameful neglect of … some of the most vulnerable of all Australians ' ' would be better used in other roles .
Professor Mendoza declined to discuss his resignation , but he told The Sunday Age that he was especially concerned about the lack of funding for the rapidly growing number of mentally ill young people , describing the money set aside for services for this group as ' ' appalling ' ' .
He said the mental health system was destroying families and the government was failing to deal with the crisis .
'' Families are left in appalling situations where there is nowhere to turn for help , '' Professor Mendoza said .
His resignation comes as figures leaked to The Sunday Age reveal the expansion of the Better Access program , which provides rebates under Medicare for services such as GP mental health plans and visits to psychologists .
Most experts on the government 's advisory council now believe the expensive program is sucking money from where it is desperately needed - services for mentally unwell young people - and shutting out men , the poor and rural Australians .
Reports to the advisory council reveal 2 million Australians , 75 per cent of them women - who are more likely than men to visit a doctor in any case - have used the program since it began in November 2006 .
By next year it is likely to have cost taxpayers $ 2 billion , sources say - almost four times the original budget estimate of $ 538 million .
But last year 's national healthcare agreement showed people from wealthier backgrounds were up to 30 per cent more likely to use the program , and a government review , released in March , found it was disadvantaging young people and those in rural areas , who were making higher co-payments .
'' It 's a mess , '' said Professor Mendoza , who called for the program to be overhauled into taxpayer - funded teams of psychologists and other professionals , such as mental health nurses and social workers .
Former state Labor MP and council member Neil Cole , an associate professor at Monash medical school , is concerned the program is ' 'a Rolls - Royce we do n't need ' ' and is so accessible it is treating not just the so - called '' worried well ' ' , but people who '' are not even worried ' ' .
The Medicare figures show that as of April 30 , the program had provided 12.8 million mental health services , including 1.9 million GP mental health plans , 2.6 million visits to clinical psychologists and 4.9 million visits to psychologists , social workers or occupational therapists .
A leaked report to the advisory council shows that of the patients accessing services , 77 per cent are depressed and 62 per cent suffer both depression and anxiety .
But council member Ian Hickie , executive director of the University of Sydney 's Brain and Mind Research Institute , said : '' We know a lot of people with severe problems are missing out simply because they live in the wrong place . ''
Even living in Melbourne is no guarantee that help will be available , as The Sunday Age 's account today of a mentally ill eight - year - old girl shows .
David Crosbie , another council member and chief executive of the Mental Health Council of Australia , said : '' If you have a child who 's starting to lose touch with reality , where do you take them ?
There 's really no options . ''
The only expert on the council prepared to unequivocally defend the Better Access program was the executive director of the Australian Psychological Society , Lyn Littlefield , whose members are earning up to thousands of dollars a week providing advice and counselling .
But a surge in the number of counsellors , therapists and psychologists offering the rebate and bulk - billing has raised concerns among several council members about the quality of the service being provided .
'' Someone can hang a shingle out the front of their place and provide these services under Medicare , but we have no idea of the standard of care , '' Professor Mendoza said .
Critics also point out the program has never been properly evaluated - although a comprehensive review has begun - so its achievements remain unclear .
The Howard government hoped the program would result in a decline of taxpayer - subsidised antidepressants , but since 2006 the number of prescriptions for these drugs has risen by 382,738 to more than 12 million last year .
One in five Australians suffers a mental health problem each year , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics , while three - quarters of all mental illness first occurs in people under 25 .
Professor Mendoza said the system ignored early intervention in young people despite evidence of the benefits - less homelessness , crime , social isolation , alcohol and drug abuse , better chances at relationships and retaining employment .
Mr Cole said : '' We have a ballooning of children and adolescents in need of mental health services .
This must be addressed now or we will have massive problems in the future . ''
Australian of the Year Professor Patrick McGorry , founding board member of the National Youth Mental Health Foundation , known as headspace , and executive director of Melbourne 's Orygen Youth Health , agreed .
He said while the $ 80 million allocated to headspace in the May budget was welcome , overall mental health funding fell short .
'' The system is absolutely on its knees , '' he said .
'' We have a famine - like situation and the mental health system is getting the scraps from the table . ''
Orygen , he said , was forced to turn away 1200 mentally ill young people each year , 300 of whom were at risk of suicide .
Shortly before the 2007 federal election , Ms Roxon told a national mental health conference that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had put mental health '' high on his personal agenda of issues ' ' .
But on the Sunrise program on Friday , Mr Rudd admitted he was '' fully prepared to concede ' ' that '' a whole lot more work ' ' needed to be done .
Loading Yesterday , Ms Roxon , through a spokesman , thanked Professor Mendoza for his service .
'' However , the minister rejects Mr Mendoza 's assertion that the government has no commitment to mental health , '' spokesman Mark Ward said .
He said the state - federal healthcare agreement in April would establish a foundation for further reforms to mental health .
Our old index had several layers , some of which were refreshed at a faster rate than others ; the main layer would update every couple of weeks .
To refresh a layer of the old index , we would analyze the entire web , which meant there was a significant delay between when we found a page and made it available to you .
With Caffeine , we analyze the web in small portions and update our search index on a continuous basis , globally .
As we find new pages , or new information on existing pages , we can add these straight to the index .
That means you can find fresher information than ever before — no matter when or where it was published .
Caffeine lets us index web pages on an enormous scale .
In fact , every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel .
If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second .
Caffeine takes up nearly 100 million gigabytes of storage in one database and adds new information at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gigabytes per day .
You would need 625,000 of the largest iPods to store that much information ; if these were stacked end - to - end they would go for more than 40 miles .
We 've built Caffeine with the future in mind .
Not only is it fresher , it 's a robust foundation that makes it possible for us to build an even faster and comprehensive search engine that scales with the growth of information online , and delivers even more relevant search results to you .
So stay tuned , and look for more improvements in the months to come .
A popular tourist beach in Louisiana remained closed due to oil contamination Saturday as BP officials denied botching the month - long clean - up and deliberately hiding the true extent of the spill .
As Grand Isle , Louisiana , closed its seven - mile beach to clean up an orange - liquidy slick washing ashore , the British energy giant once again postponed an operation aimed at permanently stopping the leak .

The “ top - kill ” operation to inject heavy drilling fluids into the ruptured well , a month after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig , and then seal it permanently with cement , will now not take place until Tuesday at the earliest instead of at the weekend .
Just how much oil is gushing daily from the rig ’s wreckage has been a contentious issue , with BP initially putting the figure at 5,000 barrels — or 210,000 gallons .
“ That was not just BP ’s estimate .
That was the estimate of the in - flight command , including NOAA and the Coast Guard .
That ’s the best estimate we have , ” BP ’s chief operating officer Doug Suttles told ABC television Friday .
But in further confusing comments , BP also radically slashed by more than half its figures for how much of the oil it is siphoning up daily from the ruptured well via a mile - long ( 1,600 meter ) insertion tube .
BP spokesman John Curry told AFP Friday that it now estimated some 92,400 gallons of oil had been diverted from the well in the 24 hours before midnight on Thursday .

That would mean BP is sucking up only 2,200 barrels daily from the pipe , not the 5,000 barrels it had estimated on Thursday .
Coast Guard commandant Thad Allen later told reporters that the flow was variable , fluctuating from a low rate of 2,000 barrels a day to a high of 5,000 barrels .
Live webcam pictures showed more oil continuing to spew into the Gulf from the ruptured well — as visitors flocked to BP ’s site to watch the video .

Even at the lowest estimates , more than six million gallons of crude have flowed into the water since the disaster .
And independent experts have warned the flow could be at least 10 times higher than the current estimates .
Grand Isle shut down its beach as volunteers armed with spades sought to scoop up the oil into plastic bags .

“ This is only the beginning .
It happened 30 days ago and it just came yesterday .
Yesterday , it was the very first , it was very little , and now it ’s all over , ” said angry resident , 69 - year - old Lana Downing .
Charter boat captain Larry Averitt said impatience was also growing further along the coast in Venice , Louisiana .
“ In the beginning , everybody was trying to be patient .
People are starting to get exasperated .
It ’s definitely affecting our ability to make a livelihood and pay our bills , ” he told AFP .
“ Nothing BP has tried so far has worked . ”

Suttles sought to quell the growing anger among the US administration , telling ABC television that BP had already spent 700 million dollars on the clean - up .
“ We ’ve mounted the largest response ever done in the world .
We put 20,000 people at this .
“ I understand the anger .
But I can tell you , I do n’t know of anything , absolutely anything we could be doing that we ’re not doing , ” he said .
But he also revised the timetable for when BP would attempt its latest bid to stop the leak , the “ top kill ” operation .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Our current forecast for when this operation will take place is sometime in the early part of next week .
The best estimate is Tuesday , ” Suttles told reporters .
He added the operation was very complex and was being carried out by robotic submarines positioning the equipment on the seabed a mile down .
BP PLC , owner of the damaged well , predicts it will take 70 to 90 days – perhaps into August – to stab through more than three miles ( five kilometers ) of seawater and earth and puncture the vertical pipe that is channeling a torrent of oil and gas to the surface of the Gulf near the Louisiana coast .
US officials have insisted that BP provide a wealth of technical information to the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) to help them fight the slick .

Democratic congressman Ed Markey voiced the frustrations of many , saying : “ We ’re beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP .
People do not trust the experts any longer .
BP has lost all credibility . ”
Meanwhile , senators from four oil - producing states Friday wrote to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar asking that the government exempt shallow - water drilling from a moratorium on new offshore oil drilling .

The Anarchist Group " FFFC - Ottawa , " has claimed responsibility for the early morning Royal Bank of Canada firebombing in Ottawa Tuesday and has vowed to take its protests to the upcoming G8 and G20 Summit protests in Ontario in June .
The group stated the attacks were made against corporate " Kanada " in defence of indigenous land rights and the environment .
A video of the event and a manifesto were subsequently posted on the Internet by an unknown source .
Referencing the recent Olympic Games in B.C. , the statement reads , " On June 25 - 27 2010 , the G8/ G20 ‘ leaders ' and bankers are meeting in Huntsville and Toronto to make decisions that will further their policies of exploitation of people and the environment and we will be there .
We pass the torch to all those who would resist the trampling of native rights , of the rights of us all , and resist the ongoing destruction of our planet .
We say : The Fire This Time . "
Security footage shows what police are also claiming to be a small group of anarchist fleeing the scene of the Royal Bank of Canada in the Glebe neighbourhood of Ottawa .
The identity of members of the FFFC who carried out the attacks are being sought by police .
The fire caused by the explosion is estimated to have caused $ 300,000 with no casualties reported .
On May 5 , 2010 during economic protests in Greece , three people -- including a pregnant woman -- were killed in a similar bank fire bombing but one that occurred during business hours .
Eight banks , offices and government buildings in total were targeted by anti-capitalist protesters using Molotov cocktails .
Here in Canada , the " FFFC - Ottawa " group claim it targeted the RBC due to its sponsorship of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games which in the FFFC statement says was , " held on stolen indigenous land . "
It also notes that the RBC is a major financier of the Alberta oil sands which the group considers , " one of the largest industrial projects in human history and perhaps the most destructive . "
The statement continues , " Royal Bank Canada is one of the planet 's greenest companies " according to one of its own brochures .
Coporate Kanada saw fit to include RBC as one of the top 50 in a competition dubbed Canada 's Greenest Employers , which purports to recognize organizations that have created " a culture of environmental awareness .
Yet RBC is now the major financier of Alberta 's tar sands , one of the largest industrial projects in human history and perhaps the most destructive .
The tar sands , now the cause of the second fastest rate of deforestation on the planet , are slated to expand several times its current size . "
A report by the Integrated Threat Assessment Centre early this year noted that between September 2007 and May 2009 , anarchist - identified groups have laid claim to four attacks on Vancouver RBC branches were large rocks was thrown through windows . "
In a statement released to the press on Wednesday , the RBC stated that it is working with the police to ensure that those responsible are caught .
" We are not going to comment on the group that has claimed responsibility or respond to the inflammatory statements of those who use violence to communicate their views , " said RBC spokesperson Gillian McArdle .
While it is far too soon to assume that the spiritus of Greece has come to Canada , news of the bombing was greeted with a range of reactions and overall nervousness .
Reaction has been slow from different social justice groups , which perhaps is more reflective of shock than condonement .
Several groups , including those who represent the interests of First Nations peoples , are in the process of discussing the firebombing with its membership before coming out with a public statement in reaction to the Ottawa bombing which was supposedly carried out in the name of Aboriginal rights .
S.K. Hussan , a spokesperson for the Toronto Community Mobilization Network -- which is facilitating the G20 protests here in Toronto , said of the bombing , " ' One burnt RBC branch pales in comparison to the death and devastation that the G20 policies create worldwide , and the Tar Sands create in Canada .
The Toronto Community Mobilization Network supports mass mobilizations , rallies , protests and creative actions that oppose the G20's colonial , anti-people , anti-environment agenda "
On rabble .ca's discussion board , babble , reactions were mixed ; some fear that the act , " will most certainly be exploited to justify full tilt boogie - man tactics against G8 / G20 protesters . "
One babbler noted :
" A firebombed bank , where the situation is being treated as suspicious by the authorities [ have responded ] with 16 firetrucks and 35 firefighters , along with the unlimited and dedicated attention of the police to determine the circumstances and track down the perps , all to address a crime against corporate property .
Meanwhile , Bay and Wall Street continue to rage with impunity , where millions of lives are at stake as a result of their attacks upon the worth and lives of human beings . "
Seeking information myself , I googled the name FFFC and asked around if anyone was aware of such a group , but turned up nothing .
And as the end of the manifesto statement references the slogan " The Fire This Time " , this slogan is simply too common to link to any one particular groups .
But do I really want to be doing the job of the police here by hunting down those who were responsible while also balancing a journalist 's natural impulse to seek the truth ?
David C. , a First Nations organizer , who I spoke to at noon and thus felt it was too close in timing to the actual bombing to give me his last name , was quick with his anger and skepticism .
" It could be the police for all we know , a case of an agent provocateur ... I do n't know what they were thinking , if they get caught , they are going to be charged under the new terrorism laws and they 'll never see the light of day again . "
The best scenario at this juncture is to offer the wisdom of caution lest the movement jumps from the state of healthy vigilance to a state of paranoia .
Human nature 's predictable responses will abound , from naive solidarity or outright public condemnation .
For now , the best solution is to wait until we receive the wisdom and guidance of the different First Nations groups involved in their own communities and the social justice communities , as it is their reaction that must set the tone .
For they are the primary stakeholder and could become the primary target of the police and RCMP in the predictable backlash against activism which will -- I assure you -- follow .
In addition to the previously
covered features
we ’ve already added , we took the opportunity to get to the bottom of it and add even more scripting facilities where possible along with minor but convenient UI enhancements .
In this blog entry , we will introduce some of the new features in the coming version of IDA Pro .
Output window
We received many requests from our clients to make the output window a text control so users select portions of text instead of a whole line .
The output window is now a rich text control instead of a listbox , allowing the users to :
Select or delete portions of text
Jump to any address from the output by Alt - clicking on it
The Alt - click will work not just for numerical addresses but also for identifiers which are location names in the database or even registers during debugging .
Unified script facilities in the UI
We have replaced the “ File / IDC file ” menu with “ File / Script file ” , allowing the user a unified way to run any supported script file .
IDA Pro will match the file ’s extension with a registered extlang ( or the built - in IDC engine or Python plugin ) and run the file with it .
Added “ Recent scripts ” window
We have dropped the “ Recent IDC Scripts ” toolbar and replaced it with a script list ( similar to IDAPython ’s Alt - 7 ) .
This dialog is common to the text and the graphical interfaces of IDA Pro , and will remember any script ( not just IDC ) .
It is accessible via the Windows menu or the Alt - F7 hotkey :
Recent scripts will be displayed in a chooser :
( Note that the history has both Python and IDC scripts )
The standard chooser hotkeys can be used : Ctrl - E to edit the script , Ins to browse for a new script , Del to remove it and Alt - T to search .
Added new ‘- t’ command line switch
This switch will start IDA Pro with a temporary database .
This is useful if you want to run scripts that do not neccesarily need a specific input file .
For example , a script can use the debugger to attach to a process , gather some information and detach .
In the future blog entries we will show how to use this in real life scenarios .
Improved the ‘ - S’ command line switch
The - S switch can now run not just IDC but any supported script file ( again , based on the script file extension ) .
It now supports passing arguments to the script :
idag -t - S " hello.idc arg1 arg2 \ " arg 3 \ " arg4 "
With hello.idc :
#include < idc.idc > static main ( ) { auto i ; for ( i=0 ;i< ARGV.count ;i++) Message ( " ARG [ %d ]=%s
" , i , ARGV [ i ] ) ; }
After IDA
Pro runs , such an output will be displayed :
ARG[0] =hello.idc ARG [ 1] =arg1 ARG [ 2] =arg2 ARG [ 3 ] =arg 3 ARG [ 4]=arg4
In case you ’re wondering , the same can be accomplished with IDAPython :
import idc for i in xrange ( 0 , len( idc.ARGV ) ) : print " ARG [ %d ] = %s " % ( i , idc.ARGV[i ] )
The ARGV array is stored in the idc module .
Auto - indent in the script input box
A small but often irritating pecularity of IDA ’s script boxes ( Shift - F2 for IDC and Alt - 8 for Python ) is that it they do n’t auto - indent .
This is particularly annoying for Python which requires proper indentation .
In the new version we have implemented auto - indent , so writing Python script snippets is not an excercise in frustration anymore .
We hope that these new features , while minor , will make your work more productive .
More than 20 years after the Exxon Valdez foundered off the coast of Alaska , sea otters still dig up oil in their hunt for clams in Prince William Sound .
Nearly 25 years after an oil storage tank ruptured near mangrove swamps and coral reefs of Bahia Las Minas in Panama , oil slicks still form in the water .
And some 40 years after the fuel - oil barge Florida ran aground off Cape Cod , the muck beneath the marsh grasses makes the area smell like a gas station .
Similar damage may be in store for the U.S. Gulf coast , given that millions of gallons of light sweet crude spewed from BP ’s broken well 1,500 meters down and approximately 65 kilometers off the Louisiana coast .
Its oil - drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 , and efforts to cap the flow — estimated to be 200,000 to a few million gallons a day during the weeks right after the accident — suffered setbacks and delays .
All the oil released , which could ultimately exceed the Valdez spill several times over , could compromise wildlife and local livelihoods for years .
The toxic compounds in oil vary , but the most worrisome are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , such as napthalenes , benzene , toluene and xylenes . *
All can sicken humans , animals and plants .
“ These hydrocarbons are particularly relevant if inhaled or ingested , ” says environmental toxicologist Ronald J. Kendall of Texas Tech University .
“ In the bodies of organisms such as mammals or birds , these aromatic hydrocarbons can be transformed into even more toxic products , which can affect DNA . ”
The mutations that might result could lead to reduced fertility , cancer and other problems .
Not all the PAHs become an environmental threat , though .
Thanks to evaporation , oil that reaches the surface loses at least 20 to 40 percent of the original hydrocarbons .
“ Evaporation is good ; it selectively removes a lot of compounds we ’d rather not have in the water , ” says marine chemist Christopher M. Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
The oil also emulsifies , forming mousse — a frothy mix of hydrocarbons and water — or clumps into so - called tar balls .
But to scientists ’ surprise , plumes of oil extending several kilometers were floating roughly 1,000 meters beneath the surface , where the toxic compounds are literally washing off the oil and contaminating the water .
Those components “ can be more pervasive in finding ways to infiltrate a salt marsh ” and impact wildlife , Reddy says .
And there ’s a lot of wildlife to impact : some 16,000 species of plants and animals live in the Gulf of Mexico , according to marine biologist Thomas Shirley of Texas A&M University .
Many of their habitats “ are at risk of being affected , but we do n’t have any direct way to know which ones or in what amount , ” remarked marine biologist Jane Lubchenco , director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , at a May 12 press conference on the spill .
In the area by the spill itself , “ anything that ’s in the upper water column is going to be exposed ” to oil chemicals , Shirley says .
That ’s bad news for the millions of zooplankton out there , and the contamination could ultimately end up having cascading effects up the food chain .
“ If you start removing pieces of this big food web out there , what ’s going to happen ? ”
Shirley asks .
“ We do n’t really know , but probably not good things . ”
In regard to long - term damage , researchers worry most about landfall .
“ Once the oil , because of high tides or high winds , gets into the coastal wetland , it gets trapped in the sediment , ” notes Héctor M. Guzmán of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama , who studied the effects of the 1986 spill off Panama .
“ Then for decades you continue to see oil coming back out . ”
Particularly critical are marshes , which are nurseries for wildlife ranging from fish to birds ; contamination there could damage embryos and affect a species for generations .
Whether the oil can be kept out of the wetlands comes down to one thing : the weather .
Rough seas would swamp the booms keeping oil off the coast .
“ A hurricane or even just a tropical depression could be catastrophic , ” Kendall emphasizes .
“ It will push oil into places that it ’s difficult to clean up . ”
Of course , everyone hopes that the oil can be removed or dissipated before that happens .
Certainly the warmer conditions of the Gulf of Mexico will help bacteria and other natural forces more quickly degrade the oil than in the spill at Prince William Sound .
And early on workers used hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersants to help break up the slick .
The dispersants themselves carry their own risks and toxicity , which have many environmentalists concerned about their potential impact .
Given the choices , noaa ’s Lubchenco probably summed it up best : “ When an oil spill occurs , there are no good outcomes . ”
* Clarification ( 11/19/10 ) : Although they were identified as polycyclic aromatic compounds , benzene , toluene and xylene are technically not polycyclic , but monocyclic .
They are generally grouped as PAHs , however , and are all aromatic compounds .
Mark Shuttleworth announced seconds ago that the Metacity window controls will remain on the left in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS ( Lucid Lynx ) , however the order will change to : close , minimize , maximize .
Thank you to everybody who has participated in this discussion .
The final decision on window controls for 10.04 LTS is as follows :
- the window controls will remain on the left , however
- the order will change to be ( from left ) close , minimize , maximise
The decision is based on the view that putting the close button in the corner will be most familiar to many users , even if the particular choice of corner is not .
For the avoidance of doubt , this is not a comment dependent on the date
:-)
Our intent is to encourage innovation , discussion , and design with the right of the window title bar .
We have some ideas , and others are already springing up in the community .
We welcome participation on the Ayatana list , where those can play out .
This will be a fruitful topic for the design track at UDS in Brussels in May .
This bug is now marked wontfix .
Please focus ongoing participation on the opportunities for innovation that this opens up .
The decision as to the window controls location and order itself is now final , and as they say in the old newspapers , no further correspondence will be entered
into .
Note : Like Mark states , this has nothing to do with 1st of April ( just to make things clear ! ) even though some might consider placing the window controls on the left a bad joke .
If you want to put the Metacity window controls on the right or change their order , do n't forget you can use Mwbuttons ( Metacity Window Buttons ) , a really easy to use GUI which comes with presets .
Also , now when using another theme ( except Dust - but that should be fixed soon ) , the buttons will automatically move to the right so basically the left - side buttons only apply for the new Light Themes ( Ambiance and Radiance ) !
Note : Like Mark states , this has nothing to do with 1st of April ( just to make things clear ! ) even though some might consider placing the window controls on the left a bad joke .
Here is his entire comment :
So Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will have the window controls placed identical to Mac OSX .
Well , I for one am still waiting for the Global Menu to be included by default like in the website mockups
using water and even ice in your bong is good , but not the best way if you are trying to save your weed rather adding hot water to your bong ...
Members of the media and onlookers take a close look at the aquarium , which for the time being , is empty , during media day at the Diamond Jo National River Center in Dubuque , Iowa .
A new exhibit at an aquarium in Iowa that had intended to showcase the beauty of the Gulf of Mexico will instead be void of life to underline the environmental impact of a massive oil spill .
Onboard navigation and mobile applications can tell drivers how to avoid traffic jams .
Trouble is , most of the drivers are already on the road , perhaps already in the jam .
But IBM is about to deploy a system that will predict traffic flow up to an hour before it occurs , giving travelers ample time to avoid trouble .
During pilot tests in Singapore , forecasts made across 500 urban locations accurately predicted traffic volume 85 to 93 percent of the time and vehicle speed 87 to 95 percent of the time .
Similar results were achieved in Finland and on the New Jersey Turnpike .
The key to success is predictive modeling — software that combines real - time data from road sensors and cameras , as well as GPS transponders in taxis , with historical traffic information , roadwork conditions and weather forecasts .
Each week the model recalibrates based on statistics from the most recent six weeks .
It broadcasts advisories to electronic road signs and car navigation displays .
The system also predicts when a congested road will return to normal flow .
IBM has signed contracts with two U.S. transportation authorities to deploy a full system , according to spokesperson Jenny Hunter .
The locations will be announced soon .
Singapore may commit as well and is also testing a variation that will predict bus arrival times for riders waiting at bus stops .
In each location , ongoing work will optimize the advisories .
If , for example , Highway 1 is clogged and too many drivers who receive messages flock to Highway 2 , it will become clogged ; engineers will customize the model so it can determine whether sending the messages to only 25 or 40 percent of drivers , say , would best balance the two roads .
And because a high percentage of drivers now carry cell phones , IBM is working with several telecom companies to be able to track the continually changing density of their phones along roadways , which could provide finer - grained modeling .
To protect privacy , the identity of individual phones would not be disclosed .
The company has also announced its intention to develop services that could tell individual subscribers ahead of time which of various routes would get them to their preselected destination fastest , given current conditions .
Voice recommendations would be sent to a person ’s vehicle navigator or cell phone .
Similar analytics are being applied to other applications .
“ The beauty of predictive modeling is that it translates across disciplines , ” says Robert Morris , IBM ’s vice president of service research in Armonk , N.Y .
For example , the company ’s laboratory in Haifa , Israel , is testing a program called EuResist that predicts the success of different drug cocktails for an HIV patient over time .
The software analyzes the person ’s HIV genotype and his or her current health characteristics against an evolving database of treatment outcomes for more than 33,000 patients and 98,000 therapies .
Similar applications might determine which type of breast or prostate cancer treatment could benefit a patient most .
IBM is also working with the Washington , D.C. , Water and Sewer Authority to predict in real time where problems are likely to arise — such as which sewer lines might flood during storms .
The goal is to adjust valves ahead of time , systemwide , to minimize overflows and to deploy maintenance crews to specific locations early .
In March , IBM opened a predictive analytics lab in Xi’an , China , to help business clients such as Xi’an City Commercial Bank anticipate customer trends before they occur .
Three - month - old Lila Catherine Bailey got into her slickers to help bail out the basement of the family 's Bedford home .
Angle dodges question about armed revolution
For the first time , Sharron Angle has permitted herself to be directly questioned about her suggestions -- first reported on this blog -- of impending armed revolution .
And she basically dodged .
From an interview with the Las Vegas Review Journal :
" In fact , Thomas Jefferson said it 's good for a country to have a revolution every 20 years , " Angle said in January in an interview with conservative talk show host Lars Larson .
" I hope that 's not where we 're going .
But , you know , if this Congress keeps going the way it is , people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies . "
Asked Thursday whether she was calling for an armed revolution or a political revolution at the ballot box , Angle paused and shook her head as if the question were ridiculous .
" I can't believe people are even asking that , " Angle said in the brief interview .
" I 'm very much a proponent of the Second Amendment and the Constitution .
But what we have to focus on here is a movement , a movement that 's about retiring Harry Reid " by voting him out of office . "
That 's not an answer .
Ms. Angle , what did you mean when you said that people are " looking towards those Second Amendment remedies " ?
Again :
This is n't about whether she was advocating the use of such " remedies " if the political process fails to reverse the country 's direction .
I 'm happy to believe she was n't .
The question is this :
Was she suggesting she believes this is a possibility in the current climate , however remote ?
If her original quote had been offered in isolation , it would perhaps be understandable to ignore it .
But there 's a larger context here .
She 's repeatedly expressed similar sentiments .
And she has a history of associating with groups that have similarly whacked out views .
It 's fair to press her on what she really believes .

Sony ’s Dash , designed for the bedroom or kitchen .
Sony ’s newly released “ personal Internet viewer , ” the Dash , is a sort of sleek alarm clock in overdrive .
Designed for use in the kitchen and bedroom , the Dash hooks into a home ’s Wi-Fi network to deliver news , weather , YouTube and other content through a thousand or so free apps — from Netflix , CNBC , Weather Channel , CBS Sports — from the Dash store .
The Dash itself costs $ 200 .
“ It ’s for folks who just wanted to sit down at the computer for five minutes , but with Dash , you do n’t need the computer , ” Andrew Sivori , director of Sony ’s personal audio group , said during a demonstration of the device earlier this week .
“ It ’s a new way to get information that customizable and important to you , ” Mr. Sivori said .
Dash has a seven - inch touchscreen , but is not portable ; it must plug into an AC outlet .
There are no batteries .
The built - in stereo speakers sounded better than it seemed they would , and there ’s also a headphone jack .
The USB port provides additional access to music , video , photo or whatever content might be stored on a USB flash drive .
There is some internal memory , but no ability to add memory or to slot in an SD or Memory Stick photo card .
There ’s also a touch keyboard for reporting your activities to Facebook .
Because of its handsome touch screen , the Dash is fairly instinctive to use , and is an efficient way to keep track of bits and pieces of information you seek out daily .
For all that , though , there is no way to search the Internet with Dash , which does limit its usefulness .
But , did we mention that it ’s an alarm clock ?
Sad news out of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab today :
Phoenix Mars Lander has ended operations after repeated attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful .
A new image transmitted by NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows signs of severe ice damage to the lander 's solar panels .
" The Phoenix spacecraft succeeded in its investigations and exceeded its planned lifetime , " said Fuk Li , manager of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Although its work is finished , analysis of information from Phoenix 's science activities will continue for some time to come . "
I ’m not a downhole expert , so I ’ll leave that side to Rockman and others with the necessary training and experience .
I have some relevant background , as I was in the offshore industry , primarily in the underwater service side for many years , so I am familiar with diving and ROV operations .
I have also been involved in designing and building an oil capture and recovery dome ( actually a pyramid ) in much shallower water .
I also was involved in the Exxon Valdez cleanup and environmental surveys , several years after that incident , among other things .
I have been reading the various reports from the media for the last few days and am distressed by the amount of misinformation that is being provided to the public .
In response , I have put together some rough calculations and have tried to develop analogies that are understandable to laymen regarding what has happened and what is / can be done .
The Leaks :
There is every indication that the Blowout Preventer ( BOP ) was activated and at least partially worked .
There is a good probability that the “ leak ” is inside the BOP .
As the oil leaks through the BOP , it then finds its way through the damaged riser and drill pipe , where it will exit from any open end or damaged area .
Therefore trying to repair the leaks in the riser does not decrease the flow , but it can reduce the number of places where oil must be captured -- which is why they capped the end of the leaking drill pipe .
If a company tried to stop all the leaks coming from the riser , it would probably be like trying to repair a rotten garden hose .
Every time the company stopped one leak , another one would appear .
The task is to try to reduce the leaks to one , or to a couple in the same area , so the containment dome can be put over them and the oil recovered while waiting for the relief wells to " kill " the well .
Every deepwater work class Remotely Operated Vehicle ( ROV ) carries sector scan sonar .
Sonar can pick up oil leaks that the naked eye cannot see .
The picture of oil bubbles painted on a sonar screen looks like fireworks going off .
There was an ROV survey of the BOP and riser within hours after the rig sank .
At that time , there was no indication of any oil leakage from the BOP , and everyone breathed an extremely large , and extremely premature , sigh of relief .
Estimates made about leakage are primarily done from aerial surveys and satellite photos
These are notoriously inaccurate , as is clearly stated in the USCG manual on reporting oil spills .
The gravity and thickness of the oil , temperature , weather , currents , time , weathering of the oil and other factors all have a major impact on the size of a slick from a given amount of oil .
For example , if you are on a lake in very still water and pour a gallon -- not a barrel , a gallon - - of gasoline over the side , in a matter of minutes you can have a slick covering a square mile .
If you want to try this , pick a cool day as on a warm day the gasoline will evaporate before the slick finishes forming .
Also , the Coast Guard would be most unhappy if it knew you were attempting this experiment .
If you do the same with heavy crude similar to what was involved in the Exxon Valdez spill , it will probably take a few hundred barrels to cover that same square mile .
Over a long enough time period , though , the type of oil involved in the Exxon Valdez spill will end up covering an area many times larger , and will take months to dissipate in the absence of heavy weather .
The sweet crude involved in this spill is somewhere in between .
It was sometime during the night after the sinking that oil leaks started appearing from buckles and holes in the riser .
This was stated to be about 1,000 barrels per day .
I would read that to mean the leak was between 250 and 3,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) .
And a 5,000 bpd leak is probably between 2,000 and 10,000 bpd .
Until there is some way to measure the flow -- like running it through a pipeline or into a tank -- it is impossible to have any accurate measurement of the leakage .
Factoid :
If you assume that there is over 5,000 psi of downhole pressure at the BOP -- and everything I have heard indicates it is probably substantially higher than that -- then a 1 / 4 inch diameter hole is large enough to “ leak ” 5,000 barrels a day .
That “ leak ” would probably cut off your arm if you passed it in front of it .
There is almost certainly sand in the oil .
As that sand passes the leaking portion of the BOP , it acts as an extremely high pressure sand blaster , eroding the area around the leak and enlarging the hole .
So there is a perfectly rational explanation why the leak would escalate from 1,000 bpd to 5,000 bpd to whatever it is now .
Nobody was lying about the volume or covering up .
The leak was , and is , getting worse .
How much is 1,000 bpd ?
It works out to 30 gallons per minute , about the output from 3 garden hoses running wide open , or about enough to fill a smallish backyard swimming pool in 24 hours .
Weather
I ’m not an oil spill expert , so I wo n’t address the clean up much except to mention the effect weather has on it .
For actually recovering the oil , calm weather is the best .
It only takes about 3 or 4 foot waves to greatly impede skimming operations and render inflatable booms ineffective .
Unfortunately , the first week of the spill had enough bad weather that recovery operations were slowed and actually stopped for a few days .
This week things have been much better , and a lot of oil , but certainly not all , has been recovered before it reached land .
The most effective spill cleanup is a violent storm .
Mother Nature is much more successful than man at taking care of herself .
In Alaska , we found areas prone to heavy storms were essentially clean after one winter , while protected bays and inlets still have oil deposits more than 20 years later .
A number of years ago , a small tanker with a full load of fuel broke up on the Scottish coast during a North Sea winter storm .
Heroic efforts by the British Coast Guard and the salvage tug crew saved most of the crew members , but the tanker was completely destroyed , and all the cargo spilled .
There was a great fear of massive environmental consequences .
But after the storm abated , there was almost no sign of the oil .
The power of the storm had effectively dispersed all the oil and cleaned the rock beaches and cliffs .
Obviously the answer is to recover the oil before it reaches land , but a large storm that pushed the oil out to sea and broke it up would be beneficial .
That is unlikely to happen at this time of year .
It is much more likely any storm would push the oil onshore and would not be violent enough to disperse it .
Remotely Operated Vehicles ( ROVs )
The ROV videos available on YouTube and other sites have been edited or cropped to remove some of the company information and data that is normally visible on the screen .
Also , the picture quality is severely degraded from what the operators ( BP and all the others ) are seeing .
But they do give a bit of insight as to what the pilots are seeing and the quality of visibility .
So far the ones I ’ve seen do not show much detail about the leaks , except for the end of a piece of drill pipe which has been capped .
Incidentally , BP will almost certainly be watching all the ROV video in real time and high definition in their war room in Houston , surrounded by people from the MMS and the USCG .
Twenty years ago a typical ROV spent about as much time on deck being repaired as it did in the water .
Today anything less than about 98 % to 99 % “ uptime ” is considered substandard .
I would be surprised if the ROVs come to the surface except to change tool packages , or if the vessel has to leave location .
At that depth , it takes about 3 hours to make a round trip from the work site to the deck and back down .
All the ROVs onsite are considered large work class ROVs .
They are at least 150 and often over 200 horsepower .
They have multiple thrusters that give them accurate positional control in three dimensions plus pitch and yaw .
They carry two strong manipulator arms , color sector scan sonar , several high definition color video cameras , and an incredible multiplexed data system .
They have jet pumps that can move vast quantities of mud , wire rope cutters , grinders and cutting systems .
Besides the ROVs , BP has access to numerous tool packages that can repair pipelines , clean platform members , etc .
All the deepwater BOP stacks and other equipment are specially designed to interface with ROVs as they operate WAY past the depth any diver can go .
There are some reasonably good short videos of ROVs at www.oceaneering.com.
Go the section on ROVs .
The “ Dome ”
Let 's talk about the dome a little .
It would appear from the photos that the dome is designed to be large enough to encase the BOP .
It has mud mats 16 feet off the bottom , so obviously the idea is to let it sink into the mud which will stabilize the dome and keep it in place .
Image from a recent New York Times article
The dome should act as a primary oil / water separator and minimize the amount of water going up the drill string .
But even better , if I understand the plan correctly , the leak will probably be above the oil / water interface ( water will not entirely fill the dome ) , which means if the dome system is working smoothly , the oil leaking from the riser will never come in contact with the water before it heads up the drill string .
The dome has to be open to the sea water near the bottom , so the pressure will equalize .
If the dome were to seal tightly to the seabed , any negative pressure created by the oil rising in the drill string would suck the surrounding mud sea bed right up into the drill string ( this is the principal behind suction anchors for drill rigs ) , and possibly collapse the containment vessel .
I assume the way they will control the system will to be to monitor the level of the oil / water interface inside the dome and throttle the flow at top of the drill string to keep the oil / water interface at a set level .
It is to be connected to the Discoverer Enterprise with a 6 - 7/8 ” drill string .
Based on some rough estimates I made , if a person assumes the specific gravity of the oil is 0.89 , the specific gravity of sea water is 1.026 , the depth is 5,000 feet ( actually this is of little importance in calculating the maximum flow ) , and a freeboard of 33 feet to reach the drill ship deck piping , it should be possible to get about 24,000 bpd on the ship using the natural buoyancy of the oil alone .
Most of my numbers , especially the specific gravity of the oil , are conservative , so the maximum throughput could be greater , maybe much greater .
If the drill string is filled with oil , the static pressure is entirely dependent on the specific gravity of the oil and the actual water depth .
Roughly , if the specific gravity is 0.80 , then the pressure at the water surface would be about 500 psi ; if the specific gravity of the oil is 0.90 , the pressure would be just under 300 psi .
In real life any entrained gas will make a major difference .
If the drill string was entirely filled with gas , the static pressure at the surface would be over 2,200 psi .
And as soon as you start mixed flow , you get into undefined territory unless you know the exact percentage of gas mixed in the oil .
Entrained gas in the leaking oil will greatly change the flow dynamics , as the gas will expand approximately 150 times going up the drill string and act as a giant airlift .
The problem then wo n’t be getting the oil up the drill string ; it will be throttling back the flow onboard the drillship .
Luckily , a deepwater drillship will have the proper equipment to handle this .
The expanding gas also has a substantial cooling effect , enough to freeze the water entrained in the stream .
So the design of the drill string has been modified to include a warm water jacket and a methanol ( antifreeze ) injection system .
They have a potentially dangerous situation separating the oil , gas and water , but since the Discoverer Enterprise has processing equipment on board they should be able to handle that safely .
The Enterprise also has dual draw works and drill floor , so they are equipped to handle a second drill string to another dome if needed .
The Politics
This is obviously a disaster .
It is quite possible that a human error or series of errors , coupled with possible equipment failure , are to blame .
Does BP have culpability because of trying to move too fast ?
At over $ 500 a minute , they certainly have the incentive to move fast .
We do n’t know - yet .
Is Transocean to blame for some sort of negligence in not properly monitoring the mud return or some other aspect of cementing process ?
We do n’t know - yet .
Was Halliburton ’s cement job faulty ?
We do n’t know - yet .
Did Cameron International ’s BOP fail due to manufacturing or design fault ?
We do n’t know - yet .
Is a combination of one or more of the above ?
Quite possibly , but we do n’t know - yet .
There are unsubstantiated reports that the kick registered over 30,000 psi .
If the BOP stack saw that kind of pressure , it could be a important factor , both in determining what happened and how to prevent it from happening again .
For those who are appalled that BP had no contingency plans in case of a spill , perhaps you think the skimmer vessels , the miles and miles of inflatable boom , and the couple hundred trained oil spill control personnel that you see on TV just materialized out of thin air .
In fact , they have been on standby for a couple decades .
They train , work on small spills , and prepare for disaster .
As Rockman says : think of them as a fire department , paid for by the oil companies , under requirements of the US government .
For those who are appalled by the lack of government response , consider that the US Coast Guard was underway in minutes after the blow out , and their spill response personnel ( as well as the teams and equipment from the oil industry ) were already onsite , standing by , before the rig sank .
For a week after the initial incident , from the blowout April 20 until April 28 , things were n't going well .
The BOP was still leaking , and the weather was slowing recovery operations , but it is fair to say that the incident was reasonably " under control " .
There was no need for Obama to get directly involved , mobilize the Dept of Defense , etc .
On April 29 , everything started falling apart - - a true worst case scenario .
That morning , it was obvious the leakage from the BOP had increased dramatically .
Even worse , the weather changed and strong offshore winds start moving the oil directly toward some of the most sensitive barrier islands in Louisiana .
Not only did the wind change direction , but by evening , it also increased to the point it effectively shut down all skimming and recovery operations and most boom deployments .
The media , which had had only superficial coverage up to this point , got heavily involved and disseminated a great deal of technical information that was just plain incorrect .
There is a certainly an expectation that someone may be to blame for the uncontrolled blow out with its loss of life , and potential for extreme environmental and economic damage .
But , it is my opinion , with some understanding of the complexities and technical and operational challenges involved , that both the oil industry and the government operational people have responded to the incident quickly and professionally .
I wish I could say the same for the media , the politicians and the bloggers .
The only operation after the blow out that I might question was the decision to keep pumping water into the rig .
I wonder whether it might have been better to let it float , assuming it did n’t sink due to a hole in a pontoon , and let the oil burn .
But with the rig 's engines and thrusters dead , the only thing holding it in position was the riser , so the potential for it to further damage the BOP probably played into that decision .
It is always easy to " Monday morning quarterback , " especially if a person does n’t understand the technical or operational problems .
Fortunately , some of the best and most experienced people in the world are working this problem .
BP has stated they will pay for the cleanup and environmental damage ( as required by law ) , and will pay any legitimate claims for economic damage .
This is a reasonable requirement .
During the Exxon Valdez disaster , we saw numerous outlandish claims from “ fishermen ” who could n’t tell you the difference between the bow and the stern and “ landowners ” and “ tourist industry people ” who had never been to Alaska until after the spill .
There is a lot of press about a $ 75 million cap on BP ’s liability .
This has been taken out of context , as it does not apply to the cleanup or environmental damage -- there BP ’s liability is unlimited .
The $ 75 million is in reference to economic damage , and BP has stated they will not hide behind that limit .
Time will tell , but for now I am taking them at their word .
I ’m sure this will require some effort on the part of people filing claims .
For instance , if you are a charter boat owner or fisherman , I expect BP will require you to submit business records proving you are really in that business , and substantiate the amount of business you had before and after the event .
It is fair and reasonable for BP to protect themselves from scams , just as it is fair and reasonable that those who have been economically damaged by this event be given realistic compensation .
I have a much greater problem understanding why the 200 + lawyers currently meeting to decide how to split up the pie should be entitled to the hundreds of millions of dollars in fees they will eventually receive .
We are lucky that this happened to one of the very few companies in the world that has the financial resources to pay the billions of dollars this will cost .
This spill is in some ways similar to the Exxon Valdez spill , where Exxon , despite their overwhelming arrogance , did pay all the costs of the cleanup , even while they fought paying many of the economic damage claims I considered valid and tried to avoid all of the punitive damages .
If either spill had happened to a foreign tanker firm or an independent oil company , the taxpayers would have ended up paying for the entire cleanup bill .
The people economically affected would have been out of luck , and the companies involved would have already declared bankruptcy .

German prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the German Bishops ' Conference , Robert Zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
Prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while Zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern Germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
The archdiocese of Freiburg has released a statement denying that Zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
Aiding and abetting
Prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ARD and the Suedkurier newspaper .
The Freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
In 1987 Zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of Freiburg .
He is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
The diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that Zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
Part of a wider scandal
Sexual abuse scandals have rocked the Church in Germany since January , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at Catholic schools .
As head of the bishops ' conference , Zollitsch has been at the forefront of the Catholic Church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
He has often stated that the Church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
In his Easter messages to his Freiburg parishoners , he said the Catholic Church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides . "

A five - year investigation by the Democratic Voice of Burma has revealed evidence suggesting the military regime in Myanmar ( or Burma ) is developing a nuclear weapon .
After the defection of Major Sai Thein Win from Myanmar , hundreds of photographs and testimony were disclosed , showing high - level involvement from the Burmese military with the aid of North Korea .
The below videos via Al Jazeera go in further depth to the expanding nuclear program :
Part 1
Part 3 :
Part 4 :
As reported by the Washington Times , Myanmar trying for nuke :
Myanmar ’s military rulers are attempting to build a nuclear weapon , according to a report based on information provided by a former major in Myanmar ’s army .
But analysts say the program is primitive and poorly planned .
The report , commissioned by the dissident group Democratic Voice of Burma , says while success may be beyond Myanmar ’s reach , “ the intent is clear . ”
It says its analysis leads to “ only one conclusion : this technology is only for nuclear weapons and not civilian use or nuclear power . ”
The Burmese Junta is following the North Korean model of maintaining it ’s grip on power via high levels of military investment .
In preparation of the oncoming election , vast , interconnected tunnels are being built in case of civilian unrest .
Indeed , weapons inspectors and Burmese experts that the development of nuclear weapons may be as much for use against internal dissidents as external threats .

Since I ’ve spent a few posts refuting Kai Gilb ’s issues with Scrum , I thought that I would take a stab at articulating the real problem with Scrum .
Most of what Kai has complained about Scrum to date does n't look like a problem with Scrum to me at all .
The lightweight nature of Scrum makes it broadly applicable , but since it is new to many organizations , experience and true understanding is lacking .
The implementation of the deceptively simple framework of Scrum can trip you up .
As Scrum adoption increases , we ’ll hear more about Scrum failures .
It will fail to improve the delivery of software projects , costing organizations significant time and effort to adopt a new approach only to end up ( at best ) where they were before they started using Scrum .
Today , many of the problems that organizations experience with Scrum are that they have a ScrumBut problem .
The “ We ’re doing Scrum , but … ”
As Jurgen Appelo noted in a recent blog post , Some Day Kanban Will Fail 75 % of the Time , that there are those who state that “ at least 75 percent of Scrum implementations fail . ”
Jurgen makes the excellent point thatI call this a basic blocking and tackling problem .
Despite the fact that Scrum is a lightweight framework that is not complex , teams and organizations skimp on implementing the basic mechanics .
The Scrum community is doing a great job of highlighting the ScrumBut problem , and I feel that organizations will get the message that they should implement the entire Scrum framework if they expect success with Scrum .
The next big issue will be that a great many organizations wo n’t realize any significant gains from the experience .
Sure , the workers will enjoy their jobs more because they have more control over their workday , but there will be one BIG question lurking , and it is the same one we ask ourselves at my company ; “ Are we producing better software , faster ? ”
And while having a happier workforce is a victory , can you – and should you – ask for more ?
Yes .
Because this is where real , meaningful change takes place .
It is also where the true value of Scrum is realized .
Scrum is not just another process to create software .
The standard activities of requirements management , software design , software construction , and testing should NOT be handled as sequential activities .
Shared knowledge , shared understanding , and constant , high - bandwidth communication should improve productivity and align the development team with the business .
For example , there should not be a situation where the team reviews a User Story and then the developers go off to design and build something while QA writes a detailed test plan and waits for development to provide that feature in a build , with no customer ( or proxy ) involvement .
That is a operating sequentially , using Scrum as a “ mini- waterfall ” process .
Instead , teams should review the User Story together with the product owner , who represents the business ( unless an actual customer is involved as a part of a customer team ) .
Furthermore , this should be a vertical , testable slice of functionality delivered , and not a horizontal , “ data access layer ” ( or some other tier ) .
There should becommunication , shared design , pair programming , and talking about issues or questions that arise .
In the end , there is a certain flow and rhythm that is established with truly collaborative teams that is virtually impossible for a sequential process to beat .
This is more difficult to achieve than it appears , but theexists .
For many organizations , this autonomous , collaborative approach is also a very different work model , and the correct , successful adoption of Scrum is hampered because there is little available in terms ofmanuals to guide implementations .
If you were to ask me – based on what I know and have researched to date – for a good , single source of information that talks about Scrum from someone highly experienced with the common pitfalls and challenges , I would pick Mike Cohn ’s book Succeeding with Agile : Software Development Using Scrum I recently read this book and I really appreciated the depth of Mike ’s experience , and I found the information that he presented both uncannily accurate and very useful .
I feel that it is one of the bestmanuals available today , going well beyond the basic blocking and tackling of Scrum .
A second book on Agile development that focuses greater attention on the technical practices along with giving you another great perspective of Agile development is The Art of Agile Development by Shane Warden and James Shore .
The wealth of information contained in these two books is extraordinary , and well worth your time to read if you are heading down the Agile / Scrum path .
The Supreme Court on Monday handed down rulings on three separate cases that focused on continuing to hold sex offenders in prison after their sentence , whether life in prison without parole is appropriate for juveniles and how much power the federal courts have to intervene when child custody battles cross borders and countries .
Sentencing juveniles to life in prison without parole ' cruel and unusual '
Sentencing some juvenile criminals to life in prison without parole is " cruel and unusual " punishment , especially when their crime is not murder , the Supreme Court ruled Monday .
The justices by a 6 - 3 vote found such a sentence for a 16 - year - old armed robber from Florida was unconstitutional .
The court concluded life without parole is not justified for those offenders who may lack full " culpability " for their actions , because of their ages .
" A state need not guarantee the offender eventual release , but if it imposes a sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term , " write Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority .
The appeal came from Terrance Graham , who was 16 and 17 when he took part in a series of violent home - invasion robberies while on parole for another felony .
The high court in 2005 said juvenile murderers cannot be executed , and Kennedy applied the same standards in this case , saying a " national consensus " had developed against life without parole sentences for those under 18 at the time of their crimes .

States rethink ' adult time for adult crime '
Judge : Boy , 12 , will be tried as adult in double homicide
Court says sex offenders can be held indefinitely
The Supreme Court ruled Monday the federal government has the power to indefinitely keep some sex offenders behind bars after they have served their sentences , if officials determine those inmates may prove " sexually dangerous " in the future .
" The federal government , as custodian of its prisoners , has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby ( and other ) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose , " Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the 7 - 2 majority .
At issue was the constitutionality of federal " civil commitment " for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement or who are considered too mentally incompetent to stand trial .
The main plaintiff in the case , Graydon Comstock , was certified as dangerous just six days before his 37 - month federal prison term for processing child pornography was to end .
He and the others filing suit remain confined at Butner Federal Correctional Complex near Raleigh , North Carolina .
Three other inmates who filed suit served prison terms of three to eight years for offenses ranging from child pornography to sexual abuse of a minor .
Another was charged with child sex abuse , but was declared mentally incompetent to face trial .
All were set to be released nearly three years ago , but government appeals have blocked their freedom .

High court rules for father in international child custody case
The Supreme Court has ruled for a British father seeking to regain custody of his son , who was taken by his mother from Chile to Texas , a dispute testing the power of federal courts to intervene when fights over children cross borders .
The justices , by a 6 - 3 vote , said Timothy Abbott , who is fighting to gain custody and the return of his son , has a right of custody to force the boy 's return , after courts in Chile said the father had rights as a non-custodial parent .
At issue is the scope of an international treaty , and whether one country 's court order preventing a child from being taken overseas by a parent represents " rights of custody " enforceable in the United States .

GM Under Fire for ' Misleading ' Bailout Ad GM claims TARP repayment in ad ; Republicans say boast borders on fraud .
April 30 , 2010  --
Angry congressional Republicans escalated their attack on General Motors ' claim to have repaid U.S. taxpayers for the car maker 's bailout , calling it a " lie to the American people . "
At issue is whether GM is correct in trumpeting what it says in a national ad and an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal that it has repaid -- with interest and ahead of schedule -- the $ 4.7 billion in bailout funds that it owed to the government .
The money for the loan repayment came from other bailout funds housed in an escrow account belonging to GM .
To critics , that smacks of deception .
GM has built " a slick marketing campaign " that constitutes " a lie to the American people , " Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , and Rep. Jim Jordan , R - Ohio , wrote in a letter Thursday to GM CEO Ed Whitacre .
The letter notes a recent commercial in which Whitacre boasts that it has repaid its " government loan in full , with interest , five years ahead of the original schedule . "
It 's part of an " attempt to disguise what is merely the exchange of one pool of taxpayer money for another pool of taxpayer money as ' real progress , ' " the letter said .
Issa and Jordan also faulted the U.S. Treasury Department , which heralded GM 's repayment last week .
" We are concerned that GM , under your leadership , has come dangerously close to committing fraud , and that you might have colluded with the United States Treasury to deceive the American public , " their letter said .
The government 's remaining stake in GM consists of $ 2.1 billion in preferred stock and a 60.8 percent stake in the automaker , according to the Treasury Department .
Under questioning from Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , who called the ad " very misleading , " Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner conceded at a Senate hearing on Thursday that some in his department are also concerned about the GM commercial .
But Treasury has maintained that GM 's loan repayment is " good news " despite the fact that the money used to repay the loan stemmed from the government .
A GM spokesman gave a similar response to the Issa and Jordan letter today .
" It 's hard to understand how giving money back to the government could be considered a bad thing , " said GM spokesman Greg Martin .
" The circumstances that allowed us to repay this money is because our business performance is much stronger and we 're showing greater progress than anybody expected , " he said .
' An Elaborate TARP Money Shuffle ? '
Criticism of the repayment and the ad stems at least in part from a report to Congress last week by Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the TARP .
" GM has made several payments on its outstanding loan to Treasury and expects to pay it in full by June 30 , 2010 .
The source of funds for these quarterly payments will be other TARP funds currently held in an escrow account , " Barofsky said .
" It looks like GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another , " Sen .
Chuck Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , said after Barofsky 's report .
" The taxpayers are still on the hook . "
Grassley , the first lawmaker to voice concern about GM 's loan repayment , said the repayment was " nothing more than an elaborate TARP money shuffle . "
This week , Treasury 's TARP chief , Herb Allison , sent a letter to Grassley defending the repayment .
Allison wrote that the funds in the escrow account in question stemmed from another loan from Treasury and the Canadian government .
But the money , he said , was initially intended for " extraordinary expenses " and it was agreed to in advance that anything left over would be go back to both governments .
" It has long been public knowledge that GM would use these specific funds to repay the Treasury and Canadian loans , if it did not otherwise need them for expenses , " he said in the letter dated April 27 .
" In making its April 20 loan repayment , GM determined that it did not need to retain the escrowed funds for expenses .
The fact that GM made that determination and repaid the remaining $ 4.7 billion to the U.S. government now is good news for the company , our investment , and the American people , " Allison said .
General Motors said Thursday that stands by Allison 's letter .
GM spokesman Martin called the loan repayment a " good first step . "
" Nobody is declaring victory .
We have a lot of work to do , we realize that but the progress has been pretty steady , " he said .
GM : America Will Recoup Investment
Martin said that the commercial ended its run on Tuesday .
There are no plans to broadcast it again , he said .
The intent of the commercial , he added on Friday , " was to let people know that we are grateful for the second chance and we 're making the most of it .
We 're going to build and sell the best cars and trucks that we know how to and , if we keep our focus on that , America is going to recoup ( its ) investment and that was the message we wanted to convey . "

If you did n’t see the trailer for J.J. Abrams Super 8 before Iron Man 2 this weekend , I can only assume you did n’t see Iron Man 2 this weekend which must also mean that you are recently deceased .
My condolences to your family .
Anyway , the trailer for Super 8 leaked online about 4 seconds after the first midnight IM2 showing but has sense been scrubbed from the YourTubes .
As of this exact moment you can still find it HERE ( and elsewhere I am sure ) .
Not much to report at this point other than , “ looks neat , show me more ” .
Regarding my “ theory ” above , 1979 is 4 years before the events of E.T.
The Extraterrestrial so the timeline is perfect .

The potential of Oil Reporter , a new mobile application from Crisis Commons , goes far beyond its intended application to monitor the fallout of the Deepwater Horizon disaster on the Gulf Coast .
In a blog post written four years ago ( Content without wires ) , I hinted at the potential for meaningful peacebuilding through similar applications , running on smartphones that are now increasingly the norm ,
For peace , this means that grassroots communities will ( finally ) have the means through which their voices can be promoted , at little or no cost ( certainly less than the combined cost of PC ownership and PC based wired internet access ) through mobile telephony frameworks or WiMax & PDA combinations to a larger audience .
In reality , this means that technologies already in development for news and journalism using mobile video can be used for human rights monitoring , bringing to light local government corruption , capture government officials who take bribes , help in alternative dispute resolution with regards to post - conflict land issues by giving mediators a better idea of the contested territory through video & photos , helping humanitarian aid work and strengthening community participation in peacebuilding frameworks .
However , as I ’ve noted earlier ,
… the mere introduction of technology will make our lives better is erroneous – 3G is not going to make our lives better .
We need to figure out the ways through which 3G can and must feed into democracy that ’s founded upon effective communication between peoples – and that ’s not something telecoms companies operating under profit imperatives can always successfully envision .
Oil Reporter by Crisis Commons , running on Android as well as the iPhone , is open - source , polished and powerful .
Although there are very few reports featured on the site produced by the mobile application , it ’s the commendable thought that has gone into the design of this application that is worthy of emulation .
There ’s a visualisation component through Google Maps , a data aggregation component , an API , a mobile client for incident tracking and the Oil Reporter application itself – for me , the fundamentals of a citizen journalism newsroom .
Opening up the environmental and livelihood costs , over the long - term , to public scrutiny and debate , Oil Reporter ’s website notes ,
Oil Reporter ’s Adopt - A- Beach initiative will provide the opportunity for virtual volunteers to review high resolutions imagery of the Gulf Coast and to map data elements such as perimeters of oil presence and injured wildlife in remote areas where physical assessment access is limited .
This also provides an opportunity for Oil Reporter photographs and video to be joined with high resolution imagery to provide greater understanding and provide an ability to share data from these sources back to the public .
It is that greater understanding that applications such as this can provide in other contexts , such as terrains of violence and theatres of conflict .
The robust contestation of issues and processes informed by multiple perspectives captured through mobile devices is a new paradigm for accountability and journalism that contests propaganda , mainstream media bias , marketing spin .
Even in Sri Lanka , though a basic camera phone , the callous insensitivity of government stood exposed and condemned post - war .
Beyond this , I am interested in how applications like Oil Reporter can be adapted and leveraged to provide citizens with the power to bear witness and a voice to capture the world as they see it .
All of the resulting content will ( and must ) be contested .
But let ’s not forget or underplay that much of it will never be featured in mainstream media .
And that to me , looking to the future , is the true potential of Oil Reporter .

Federal authorities say they have cracked open a cybercrime gang that allegedly duped hundreds ofÃ‚Â thousands of consumers into paying more than $ 100 million for worthless antivirus protection , priced from $ 30 to $ 70 .
A Chicago grand jury returned this indictment against Bjorn Daniel Sundin , 31 , a U.S. citizen believed to be living in the Ukraine ; Shaileshkumar P. Jain , 40 , a Swedish citizen believed to be living in Sweden ; and James Reno , 26 , of Amelia , Ohio .
The three are alleged to have help operate an online company , called Innovative Marketing , registered in Belize , that sold worthless programs with names like “ Antivirus 2008 ” and “ DriveCleaner ” and “ ErrorSafe . ”
“ The indictment provides a detailed account into the practices used by these online fraudsters , ” says Chet Wisniewski , analyst at antivirus firm Sophos .
“ It sends an important message that US authorities in cooperation with foreign governments will not allow scams to go unpunished . ”
Sundin , Jain and others allegedly created at least seven fictitious advertising agencies that placed ads worth $ 85,000 with legit website publishers ; the ads were never paid for .
Consumers who clicked on the ads were redirected to websites controlled by Innovative Marketing that ran fake scans and steered victims into buying worthless cleanups and innoculations .
According to the indictment , Sudin , Jain and others set up a complex , efficient payment misdirection scheme that kept them one step ahead .
They established multiple merchant accounts set up to complete credit card transactions from their victims .
Over time , the merchant accounts became unusable due to repeated requests for refunds or asÃ‚Â chargebacks from Visa and MasterCard stacked up .
When that happened , they simply moved to a fresh group of merchant accounts .
The payment sites had names like Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ billingbit.com , Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“bucksbill.com , Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“ software-payment.com , Ã¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ bestpaymentsolution.net.Ã¢â‚¬Â
Here ’s a description of how the ill - gained profits flowed through the Caribbean onto Eastern Europe and Scandanavia :
It was further part of the scheme that defendants BJORN DANIEL SUNDIN , SHAILESHKUMAR P. JAIN , JAMES RENO , and others caused credit card processors in the United States and elsewhere , including Credit Card Processor A located in Ft. Lauderdale , Florida , to process payments received from victim internet users made on the multiple payment websites .
Credit Card Processor
A deposited funds received from victim internet usersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ credit card payments into bank accounts controlled by defendants SUNDIN , JAIN , and others throughout the world , including a bank account held in name of Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Versata SoftwareÃ¢â‚ ¬Â at the First Caribbean Bank in the British Virgin Islands .
It was further part of the scheme that defendants BJORN DANIEL SUNDIN , SHAILESHKUMAR P. JAIN , and others caused funds deposited by credit card processors to be transferred from the original receiving accounts to additional bank accounts controlled by defendants SUNDIN , JAIN , and others held throughout the world , including multiple accounts held at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken located in Sweden , Aizkraukles Banka located in Latvia , and Swedbank located in Ukraine .
It was further part of the scheme that defendants BJORN DANIEL SUNDIN , SHAILESHKUMAR P. JAIN , and others caused to be transferred , from bank accounts under defendantsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ control in Sweden to accounts under defendantsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ control in Latvia , approximately $ 7,400,000 and Ã¢â€ š Â ¬7,800,000 through approximately 42 separate electronic transmissions , including the following :
An electronic transfer on or about March 22 , 2007 , of approximately $ 400,000 from an account in Sweden to an IM bank account in Latvia ; and Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦An electronic transfer on or about April 2 , 2007 , of approximately $ 400,000 from an account in Sweden to an IM bank account in Latvia .
Reno , whoÃ‚Â is expected to turn himself into authorities in Chicago , Ã‚Â allegedly ran Byte Hosting Internet , a call center that took calls from consumers inquiring about billing and technical help .
Along with spam pitching fake drugs , online promotions for worthless antivirus software , or scareware , are two of the cyberunderground ’s most lucrative cottage industries .
“ This is just one of many scareware scams , and we absolutely believe that this business will continue to grow , ” says Kevin Stevens , a researcher at SecureWorks .
Sundin and Jain were each charged with 24 counts of wire fraud , and Reno with 12 counts of wire fraud ; all three were charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and computer fraud .
The indictment also seeks forfeiture of approximately $ 100 million held in a bank account in Kiev .
The charges were announced by Patrick J. Fitzgerald , United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , and Robert D. Grant , Special Agent - in - Charge of the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which conducted the global investigation .
The Justice DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Office of International Affairs and the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section assisted in the investigation .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ These defendants allegedly preyed on innocent computer users , exploiting their fraudulently induced fears for personal gain .
We will continue our efforts to identify and aggressively investigate similar schemes with the assistance of our law enforcement partners both at home and internationally , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Mr. Grant said .

Police have launched an investigation and are notifying next - of - kin , believed to be from the north west of England .
The incident happened just south of the road bridge which crosses the river Dulas , close to the Centre for Alternative Technology .
The man was staying at Llwyngwern Farm Camping and Caravan site with his two daughters .
Camp site owner Ralph Beaumont told BBC Wales it was an " awful tragedy "
Mr Beaumont said the man drowned after he went into the river to help his daughter who had got into difficulty after she had herself gone in after the family 's pet dog .
He said the man was sitting outside his tent on the bank when the tragedy happened .
The man " rushed down and dived in after her " and " obviously got into difficulty in the water " , Mr Beaumont added .
Other people staying on the site made every effort to resuscitate the man , he said .
Mr Beaumont said the girl and the dog were " both fine " and that the family had come to the camp leaving their mother at home for a quiet weekend on her own .
Eyewitnesses , who did not want to be named , said the man had lost consiousness when he was eventually dragged ashore .

President Obama will be handed the power to shut down the Internet for at least four months without Congressional oversight if the Senate votes for the infamous Internet ‘ kill switch ’ bill , which was approved by a key Senate committee yesterday and now moves to the floor .
The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act , which is being pushed hard by Senator Joe Lieberman , would hand absolute power to the federal government to close down networks , and block incoming Internet traffic from certain countries under a declared national emergency .
Despite the Center for Democracy and Technology and 23 other privacy and technology organizations sending letters to Lieberman and other backers of the bill expressing concerns that the legislation could be used to stifle free speech , the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed in the bill in advance of a vote on the Senate floor .
In response to widespread criticism of the bill , language was added that would force the government to seek congressional approval to extend emergency measures beyond 120 days .
Still , this would hand Obama the authority to shut down the Internet on a whim without Congressional oversight or approval for a period of no less than four months .
The Senators pushing the bill rejected the claim that the bill was a ‘ kill switch ’ for the Internet , not by denying that Obama would be given the authority to shut down the Internet as part of this legislation , but by arguing that he already had the power to do so .

They argued “ That the President already had authority under the Communications Act to “ cause the closing of any facility or station for wire communication ” when there is a “ state or threat of war ” , reports Sydney Morning Herald .
Fears that the legislation is aimed at bringing the Internet under the regulatory power of the U.S. government in an offensive against free speech were heightened further on Sunday , when Lieberman revealed that the plan was to mimic China ’s policies of policing the web with censorship and coercion .
“ Right now China , the government , can disconnect parts of its Internet in case of war and we need to have that here too , ” Lieberman told CNN ’s Candy Crowley .
While media and public attention is overwhelmingly focused on the BP oil spill , the establishment is quietly preparing the framework that will allow Obama , or indeed any President who follows him , to bring down a technological iron curtain that will give the government a foot in the door on seizing complete control over the Internet .
As we have illustrated , fears surrounding cybersecurity have been hyped to mask the real agenda behind the bill , which is to strangle the runaway growth of alternative and independent media outlets which are exposing government atrocities , cover-ups and cronyism like never before .
Indeed , China uses similar rhetoric about the need to maintain “ security ” and combating cyber warfare by regulating the web , when in reality their entire program is focused around silencing anyone who criticizes the state .
The real agenda behind government control of the Internet has always been to strangle and suffocate independent media outlets who are now competing with and even displacing establishment press organs , with websites like the Drudge Report now attracting more traffic than many large newspapers combined .
As part of this war against independent media , the FTC recently proposing a “ Drudge Tax ” that would force independent media organizations to pay fees that would be used to fund mainstream newspapers .

Tobacco companies are not philanthropic institutions .
As long ago as 1967 the late Senator Robert Kennedy said , " the cigarette industry is peddling a deadly weapon .
It is dealing in people 's lives for financial gain " .
The Australian tobacco industry is dominated by three big companies ( or in modern political parlance , three " great big " companies ) , British American Tobacco , Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco - all overseas - owned , with decisions made not in Sydney or Melbourne but in London and New York .
These are tough and ruthless multinational corporations , promoting and selling a product that kills one in two of its regular users .
They have known for sixty years that their product is lethal .
During this time almost one million Australians have died because they smoked - while the tobacco companies have denied and downplayed the evidence , doing their utmost to oppose and delay any action that might be effective in reducing smoking .
Around the world their products cause five million deaths a year - a figure which will only increase as their drive into developing countries bears lethal fruit .
The new Chief Executive of Imperial Tobacco , Alison Cooper , was recently reported in the UK media as still refusing to accept that smoking causes cancer .
Small wonder that only last week a survey of the reputations of the UK 's largest 150 companies had Imperial Tobacco at 147 and British American Tobacco at a rock bottom 150 .
There is massive evidence from once - confidential industry documents now available following litigation in the US that for decades tobacco companies have acted more cynically than even tobacco campaigners might have thought - summarised by a quote from an industry executive - " We do n't smoke this shit , we just sell it .
We reserve the right to smoke for the young , the poor , the black and the stupid . "
And as if all this were not enough , the industry has been found guilty of racketeering in the US .
Tobacco companies have only one aim , in London , New York or Canberra .
In line with their responsibility to their shareholders , they spend money with the sole purpose of benefiting their interests .
So why would anybody want to take money from this pariah industry ?
The Australian Electoral Commission website reports that in recent years both the Philip Morris company and British American Tobacco have been generous donors to the Liberal Party and the National Party .
During the year 2008/ 9 Philip Morris contributed $ 158,000 to the Liberal and National parties around Australia .
No doubt in addition to direct contributions there is also much indirect funding from groups supporting and representing tobacco companies , but this is much harder to pin down .
The only reason for these contributions is to further the interests of tobacco companies .
The website of the British American Tobacco company is quite explicit about political donations : " Such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues affecting the company or Group ... "
A review of tobacco industry political donations in the US , published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , concluded that , " tobacco industry monetary contributions are closely related to the way a legislator votes on tobacco issues " , and " The more campaign contributions received by a Congress member , the more likely he / she votes pro-tobacco on tobacco - related bills " .
Political donations are not simply about an intention to buy direct support : they are also about much less tangible benefits gained through indirect support , influence , contacts , access and credibility .
The Greens and Democrats took the lead in refusing tobacco industry funding , followed by the ALP .
The other major parties understand the dangers of smoking ; they know exactly why tobacco companies want to give them money ; it is hard to imagine that they would knowingly take money from drug dealers - and yet they seem content to accept contributions from an industry whose products cause more than 80 per cent of Australia 's drug deaths .
Surely there is something awry with the moral radar of anyone who accepts this kind of blood money .
The argument we sometimes hear that this is a " legitimate industry " is old and tired .
If cigarettes were a new product they would not be allowed on the market .
Our parliaments have decreed that the product is so harmful that it should not be sold to children and adolescents , should not be advertised , and that its sales should be subject to ever - increasing controls .
This is no ordinary product , no ordinary industry .
The Australian government now leads the world in action to reduce smoking , complementing strong action in most jurisdictions ( other than the Northern Territory , whose lack of interest in tobacco remains a mystery ) .
It is time for all political parties to refuse tobacco funding , or for legislation that forbids such contributions from companies that still seek to oppose the work and recommendations of governments and health authorities , and whose products cause 15,000 Australian deaths each year when used precisely as intended .
Then we can be assured that all parties are making policy on this vital public health issue free of the taint of association with tobacco companies , and free of any suspicion that their policies might be influenced by these disreputable , lethal donors .

( CNN ) -- Chalk another record to the United Arab Emirates ' collection .
The Capital Gate building in the desert kingdom's capital , Abu Dhabi , has been certified by Guinness World Records as the " World 's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower . "
How far does it lean ?
Nearly five times farther than the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy .
The 35 - story Abu Dhabi building has an 18 - degree slope , compared with four degrees for the freestanding bell tower .
But unlike the tower in Pisa , the Capital Gate building has been deliberately engineered to slant .
The floor plates are stacked vertically up to the 12th floor , after which they are staggered over each other by between 300 mm to 1,400 mm -- giving the tower its lean , the owners said .
" It is a signature building which speaks to the foresight of the emirate , " said Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon al Nahyan , the chairman of the building 's owner , Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company .
The mixed - use building will be ready for occupancy at the end of the year .
It is featured in a new National Geographic documentary , called " Megastructures . "
In January , Dubai -- one of seven emirates that make up the UAE -- unveiled the world 's tallest skyscraper : the $ 1.5 billion , 160 - story Burj Khalifa , which has a height of more than 800 meters ( 2,625 ft ) .
I recently came across expect ( the expect package in Debian
and Ubuntu ) : a powerful utility that can script interactive operations .
Tip of the Trade : The Expect package found in Debian and Ubuntu is a powerful utility that can script interactive operations .
If you ’re not familiar with TCL syntax , you can get autoexpect from Wi-Fizzle.com .
This spawns a shell , and then records everything you do in that shell .
Hit Ctrl -C
when you ’re done , and then either run the generated expect script as - is , or edit it to tidy it up a bit .
In particular , autoexpect records keystrokes one by one , whereas you can put them all in at once .
It records the full prompt , where the $ at the end may suffice .
Here ’s an example of a script generated with autoexpect then tidied - up .
It logs into a server ( with single - sign - on in place , so no password needed ) and runs rm - rf ~/tmp /* :
set timeout - 1 spawn $ env( SHELL ) match_max 100000 expect " $ " send -- " ssh serverr " expect " server * $ " send -- " rm - rf ~ / tmp / *r " expect " server * $ " send -- " logoutr " expect eof
The expect lines tell the program what to wait for before its next input , and the send lines tell it what to send .
Note that you need r at the end of a send line , and can use wildcards .
If you ’re using expect with ssh , a neater option is the spawn command .
This example uses spawn , and makes the script ( save as tmpclear and make executable ) take a server name as an argument :
#!/usr /bin/expect if {[ llength $ argv ] !=
1} { puts " usage : tmpclear remotehost " exit } set timeout - 1 match_max 100000 spawn ssh $ argv expect " $argv * $ " send -- " rm - rf ~ / tmp / *r " expect " $argv * $ " send -- " logoutr " expect eof
Expect is n’t suitable for all situations , but it can be very handy for cronjobs and other regular tasks .
If you need it to send a password , be aware of the security issues — options include reading it from a private file , or using ( restricted ) passphraseless SSH keys .

The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan measures its economic development and growth not with the conventional measure of GDP , but with the holistic , multidimensional measure of Gross National Happiness ( GNH ) , which is measured according based on economic self - reliance , environmental preservation , cultural promotion and good governance .
The governmentâ€™s goal is to balance economic progress with the spiritual and emotional well - being of the people .
Bhutan is known for shunning conventional development and going its own way .
The first foreign tourists didnâ€™t come to the country until 1974 , and the government allows only 9,000 to enter per year , each of whom pay fees of $ 200 per day .
Television and the Internet arrived only in 1999 .
Most recently , the Government of Bhutan made it illegal to sell tobacco or smoke in public , becoming the first officially non-smoking nation .
Whatever happened to Ireland ?
Morgan Kelly
The Celtic Tiger faces severe challenges .
This column argues that the Irish government ’s commitment to absorb the losses of its banking system may well lead to a Greek - style debt ratio by 2012 .
It is a test - in - waiting for the EU , but one that could be solved by a debt for equity swap to cover the losses of Irish banks .
From basket case to superstar and back again – or almost .
One has to wonder :
How did all this happen ?
How did an economy where employment doubled and real GNP quadrupled during the “ Celtic Tiger ” era from 1990 to 2007 , come to have GNP contract by 17 % by late - 2009 ( with further falls forecast for 2010 ) , the deepest and swiftest contraction suffered by a western economy since the Great Depression ?
The adjustments faced by the nation are monumental ( see Cotter 2009 and Honohan and Lane 2009 ) .
Two booms
The key to understanding what happened to Ireland is to realise that while GNP grew from 5 % to 15 % every year from 1991 to 2006 , this Celtic Tiger growth stemmed from two very different booms .
First , the 1990s saw rising employment associated with increased competitiveness and a quadrupling of real exports .
As Ireland converged to average levels of western European income around 2000 it might have been expected that growth would fall to normal European levels .
Instead growth continued at high rates until 2007 despite falling competitiveness , driven by a second boom in construction .
I analyse this second boom , the Irish bubble , in a recent CEPR Discussion Paper ( Kelly 2010 ) .
Credit bubble
Ireland went from getting about 5 % of its national income from house building in the 1990s – the usual level for a developed economy – to 15 % at the peak of the boom in 2006 –2007 , with another 6 % coming from other construction .
In effect , the Irish decided that competitiveness no longer mattered , and that the road to riches lay in selling houses to each other .
However , driving the construction boom was another boom , in bank lending .
As Figure 1 shows , back in 1997 when Ireland ’s economy really was among the world ’s best performing , Irish banks lent sparingly by international standards .
Lending to the non-financial private sector was only 60 % of GNP , compared with 80 % in Britain and most Eurozone economies .
The international credit boom saw these economies experience a rapid rise in bank lending , with loans increasing to 100 % of GDP on average by 2008 .
These rises were dwarfed , however , by Ireland , where bank lending grew to 200 % of national income by 2008 .
Irish banks were lending 40 % more in real terms to property developers alone in 2008 than they had been lending to everyone in Ireland in 2000 , and 75 % more to house buyers .
Figure 1 .
Bank lending to households and non-financial firms as a percentage of GDP ( GNP for Ireland ) , 1997 and 2008 .
This tripling of credit relative to GNP distorted the Irish economy profoundly .
Its most visible impact was on house prices .
In 1995 the average first - time buyer took out a mortgage equal to three years ’ average industrial earnings , and the average house cost 4 years ’ earnings .
By the bubble peak in late 2006 , the average first - time buyer mortgage had risen to 8 times average earnings , and the average new house now cost 10 times average earnings , with the average Dublin second - hand house costing 17 times average earnings ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) .
As the price of new houses rose faster than the cost of building them , investment in housing rose .
By 2007 , Ireland was building half as many houses as Britain , which has 14 times its population .
The flow of new mortgages peaked in the third quarter of 2006 , and then fell rapidly .
By the middle of 2007 the Irish construction industry was in clear trouble , with unsold units beginning to accumulate .
More than one - sixth of housing units are now estimated to be vacant .
Figure 2 . Irish house prices relative to average industrial earnings , 1980 – 2009
Figure 3 . Irish new house prices and first time buyer mortgages relative to average industrial earnings , 1990 – 2009
Banking collapse
This property slowdown was bad news for an Irish banking system which had lent , usually without collateral , an amount equal to two - thirds of GNP to property developers to finance building projects and make speculative land purchases .
Share prices of Irish banks fell steadily from March 2007 , with the crisis coming to a head in late September 2008 with a run in wholesale markets on the joint - second largest Irish bank , Anglo Irish .
After aggressive denials that the banking system faced any difficulties , the Irish government has been forced to improvise a series of increasingly desperate and expensive responses .
As well as guaranteeing the deposits and most bonds of Irish banks , the Irish government has currently spent , or committed itself to spend , around € 40 billion on a National Asset Management Agency to buy non-performing development loans from banks , and to invest around € 30 billion in Irish banks .
Despite this large injection ( equivalent to half of GNP ) , Irish banks remain moribund .
While the Irish government bailout deals with bank losses on loans to property developers , it does nothing about their two other problems : a heavy reliance on wholesale funding ; and the prospect of further large losses on mortgages and business loans .
Half of Irish bank funding comes from international wholesale markets .
Without continued government guarantees of their borrowing and , more problematically , continued access to ECB emergency funding , the operations of the Irish banks do not appear viable .
Borrowing in bond markets at 6 % to fund mortgages yielding 3 % is not a sustainable activity , and Irish banks face no choice but to shrink their balance sheets .
Should Irish bank lending return to normal international levels , our results indicate that property prices will return to an equilibrium two thirds below peak levels , with larger falls possible in the medium term as the flow of new lending is curtailed sharply .
The third problem facing Irish banks is their mortgages .
With house prices down by around 40 % , renewed emigration , and unemployment tripled to above 13 % , Irish banks face substantial mortgage defaults .
For comparison , in Florida and Arizona , whose investor fuelled housing bubbles closely resembled the Irish one , 25 % of mortgages are non-performing .
On top of the continued disintegration of its banking system , Ireland faces two other problems : unemployment and government deficits .
Private sector employment has fallen by 16 % , while the number of males aged 20 - 24 in work has halved .
The collapse in Irish competitiveness ( wages have risen over 40 % relative to its main trading partners since 2000 ) which cannot be solved by a devaluation , will frustrate efforts to reverse this decline .
Debt crisis
Fifteen fat years allowed the Irish government to cut income taxes , increase spending and still run a budget surplus .
Between 2007 and 2009 however , tax revenue fell by 20 % , while expenditure rose by 9 % , moving the state from a balanced budget to a deficit of 12 % of GDP .
In contrast to its inept handling of the banking crisis , the Irish government has moved decisively to reduce expenditure and increase tax rates , and appears on target to reduce its deficit to 3 % of GDP by 2012 .
Ireland ’s government debt is still moderate .
At the end of 2009 gross debt was 65 % of GDP and , after subtracting the state pension reserve and pre-funded borrowing , net debt was 40 % of GDP .
Assuming that deficit targets are not missed too badly , gross debt should still be under 85 % of GDP by the end of 2012 .
Conclusions
This debt would probably be manageable , had the Irish government not casually committed itself to absorb all the gambling losses of its banking system .
If we assume – optimistically , I believe – that Irish banks eventually lose one third of what they lent to property developers , and one tenth of business loans and mortgages , the net cost to the Irish taxpayer will be nearly one third of GDP .
Adding these bank losses to its national debt will leave Ireland in 2012 with a debt - GDP ratio of 115 % .
But if we look at the ratio in terms of GNP , which gives a more realistic picture of the Ireland ’s discretionary tax base , this is a debt - GNP ratio of 140 % – above the ratio that is currently sinking Greece .
Even if bank losses are only half as large as we expect , Ireland is still facing a debt - GNP ratio of 125 % .
Ireland is like a patient bleeding from two gunshot wounds .
The Irish government has moved quickly to stanch the smaller , fiscal hole , while insisting that the litres of blood pouring unchecked through the banking hole are “ manageable ” .
Capital markets may not continue to agree for long , triggering a borrowing crisis which will start , most probably , with a run on Irish banks in inter - bank markets .
Ireland may therefore present an early test of the EU bailout fund .
However , in contrast to Greece , Ireland ’s woes stem almost entirely from its banking system , and could be swiftly and permanently cured by a resolution which shares the losses of Irish banks with the holders of their € 115 billion of bonds through a partial debt for equity swap .

HÉCTOR Vergara will make history Friday at the 2010 FIFA World Cup of soccer in South Africa .
The 43 - year - old from Winnipeg will tie the record for most World Cup games as a referee / assistant referee at 13 when he takes the field Friday in the match between Portugal and Brazil at Durban Stadium .
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARCHIVES Winnipeg ’s Hector Vergara is thrilled to be reffing at his third World Cup .
Vergara already holds the record for most World Cup games as an assistant referee with 12 .
" No matter what I achieve in the World Cup , it will be fantastic for me because I never imagined in my wildest dreams having the opportunity to experience one World Cup , never mind three , " said Vergara , who also worked at the 2002 and 2006 World Cup tournaments .
He was able to speak with the Free Press in a special email interview which took place during FIFA 's Open Day for media in Pretoria , South Africa earlier this week .
Vergara , also the executive director of the Manitoba Soccer Association in Winnipeg , worked one earlier 2010 World Cup game -- the June 14 Group F opening match between defending World Cup champion Italy and Paraguay .
The second round begins Saturday leading up to the final on July 11 .
If Vergara can work two more matches , he could tie the record of 15 for the most games as a referee / assistant referee / fourth official .
However , Vergara does n't know if he will receive another assignment , since it is based on performance evaluation .
" We do n't know when we arrive how many games we will get , we have to earn every appointment and do n't know how many more we will get , " said Vergara , who is part of an all CONCACAF ( Confederation of North , Central American and Caribbean Association Football ) crew including referee Benito Archundia of Mexico and linesman Marvin Cesar Torrentera .
Vergara said he is honored to hold any FIFA officiating record but he is keeping it in perspective .
" Records are meant to be broken and I am sure someone will eventually surpass whatever records I set .
As such , I am not putting a lot of emphasis on the records but more attention to trying to do the best that I can do to give great performances no matter how many games I get , " Vergara said .
" What means more to me is making my family , friends and the people of Manitoba proud .
They are the ones that have been there for me from Day One and I want to do well for all of them . "
Vergara has a successful history at past World Cups .
In 2002 in South Korea and Japan , Vergara worked six matches .
He worked five matches at the 2006 World Cup in Germany , including the semifinal between Italy and Germany .
In South Africa , Vergara is the only Canadian among an officiating crew of 84 .
He 's the only Canadian expected to see the field during the tournament .
Portugal 's third goalie ( Daniel Fernandez ) is from Vancouver but likely wo n't play .
It will be the final World Cup for Vergara , who turns 44 in December , as FIFA has a mandatory retirement age of 45 for officials .
The World Cup is held every four years .

He said his experience so far in South Africa , which began when he arrived in early June , has been " fantastic . "
" We are all making history by refereeing in the first ever World Cup in the African continent .
The people here have been great with us , very supportive , friendly , encouraging us to do well and making us feel at home , " Vergara said .
" We are working very hard every day but we are also trying to enjoy the experience .
For some of us , it is our last opportunity to be on the field of play with the best in the world and we are enjoying every minute no matter how difficult the games may be . "
Living in a safe house in an undisclosed location outside Johannesburg , Vergara and the other officials are doing daily physical training to maintain their fitness .
An article on Vergara at www.macleans.ca said linesmen like Vergara run more than 15 kilometres in one game and change direction an average of every five to six seconds .
All officials selected had to pass a gruelling fitness test .
Vergara was available for the email interview during the second Open Day arranged by FIFA for media to speak with officials .
It was a 30 - minute window and , outside of that , the media is not permitted to have contact with officials .
Urs Honauer , FIFA Media Officer for Refereeing Matters , told the Free Press that over 200 media participated in the first Open Day on June 6 .

( CNN ) -- Matthew and his wife were excited about the birth of their daughter in January 2008 , and the proud father took a month off of work to spend time with his spouse and child .
About six weeks after the baby 's birth , Matthew , 35 , who asked not to have his real name used , found himself wanting to sleep all the time .
He stopped finding joy in his hobbies and got to the point that he did n't want to go out to dinner with his wife anymore .
Having spent six years in the Army , he had always prided himself on mental toughness .
But with a newborn , he found himself daydreaming about running away and contemplating suicide .
" People in history would think they were possessed by a demon -- that 's kind of what it felt like , " the California - based father said .
" I did n't have control over it . "
Despite a year of therapy , Matthew never knew what to call these intense feelings until he started hearing women 's stories of postpartum depression .
In fact , postpartum depression in new fathers is a real phenomenon , and is more common than previously thought , according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
About 10 percent of men have prenatal and postpartum depression , the study found ; previous research had estimated 5 percent , said lead author James Paulson of the department of pediatrics at Eastern Virginia Medical School .
" It 's not screened for and caught enough in women , and I would say in practice it's [ depression in new fathers ] virtually unknown , " Paulson said .
" Most clinicians and most moms and dads are n't aware that there 's an increased risk of depression for fathers . "
Read three new moms ' stories of depression , recovery
Depression in fathers has potential negative implications for the family , and for the child 's development and behavioral and emotional health , he said .
Paulson 's study also found that fathers ' depression tended to have an association with mothers ' depression -- so when moms were more depressed , so were dads .
But more research is needed to determine how the two are related , as one parent 's moods have not been proven to cause the other's .
Researchers did an analysis of 43 studies on documented depression in fathers between the first trimester and the first year after childbirth between January 1980 and October 2009 .
This yielded data on more than 28,000 participants .
Studies found that as many as about 25 percent of new dads had depression in the three to six months after childbirth .
Although his analysis did not examine causes , Paulson said he speculates that leaves of absence from work usually expire around three months , and parents need to renegotiate how to care for the infant .
Sleep schedules also may shuffle during this time , he said .
Rates of fathers ' depression were higher in the United States , at around 14 percent , than abroad , about 8 percent , the study found .
Data from countries analyzed in this study were primarily from developed countries , Paulson said .
The reasons for the national differences are not known , but Paulson theorizes that the U.S. has comparatively stricter family - leave policies in the workplace than in some European countries .
Also , he said , " In the U.S. , there 's a known problem with men seeking help for depression and a documented stigma with mental health . "
The new analysis does have limitations , however .
Because it drew from a large pool of studies that had different methodologies , and different ways of reporting and measuring depression , the authors cannot say what the prevalence of depression is in any specific time frame .
Also , the larger analysis may include biases inherent in the studies it put together .
Despite these drawbacks , the findings do clearly point to a need for greater depression screening efforts for expecting fathers , the study authors wrote .
The connection between parents ' depression suggests that depression in one parent should prompt clinical attention to the other , the authors wrote .
" Likewise , prevention and intervention efforts for depression in parents might be focused on the couple and family rather than the individual , " the study said .
The study did not compare depression rates across men of various age groups but did not have any teen fathers , Paulson said .
" Baby blues " in either parent is a normal feeling for a few weeks , but postpartum depression lasts longer and brings more severe symptoms .
Sadness , anxiety and feelings of worthlessness are some of the signs of postpartum depression in men .
Some observations have noted that men experience it more in the form of anger , irritability and withdrawal than in sadness , which women often report .
But there 's not enough research to conclude that these differences usually exist between depressed mothers and fathers , Paulson said .
The first step in addressing the problem is to get both spouses and physicians to recognize that new and expecting fathers are at increased risk for depression , and to help them get appropriate treatment , Paulson said .
This may include psychotherapy and medication .
" Actually getting fathers to the point where they 're talking to a doctor about it is the most difficult challenge , " he said .
" Once fathers are in the appointment , I think they have a much better chance of getting effective help for depression . "
Matthew ended therapy after a year because of financial reasons , but he already had begun to recover at that point .
He also exercised five days a week , volunteered at his church and forced himself to make social plans .
He said his negative feelings do come back now and then , and he 's terrified of depression returning if he and his wife were to have another child .
But one valuable skill he credits to therapy is the confidence he 's gained in being a father .
" That helped immensely -- just thinking that yes , I do have the skills , spending more time with my daughter alone , realizing that I can do this without falling apart , without ruining her life , " he said .

This is an extended version of the News Scan story " Expert Education , " from the June 2010 Scientific American .
DEATH VALLEY , CALIF .
— The dozen students and scientists spread over an area called Furnace Creek looked like cyborgs in floppy hats scrabbling over the boulders .
Before hammering chips off rocks , they inspected them with magnifying lenses held up next to eyeglasses sporting miniature cameras and infrared lights .
A seasoned geologist could tease out a history of earthshaking clashes here from evidence in the terrain — a break in a steep grey slope , for instance , suggested a fault at work fracturing the landscape .
The aim now of the cameras was to see how researchers ' eyes darted across this scene , to figure out how experienced minds unconsciously scan the world for clues that point the way to discoveries .
On this expedition out in Death Valley — where driest , hottest and lowest places on the continent are found — the scientists are investigating how geologists view landscapes , but such research could very well delve into how detectives analyze crime scenes or soldiers look for camouflaged targets or distinguish between friend and foe when storming rooms .
Researchers then perhaps could train neophytes with virtual reality displays that simulate environments of interest .
" We know a lot about how to educate people on facts , but we know almost nothing about how to educate people on acquiring perceptual skills other than lots of repetition , which can be very time - consuming and expensive , " says cognitive scientist Robert Jacobs at the University of Rochester .
" It would be great to develop more effective training procedures . "
The key here is a wearable eye - tracking device that can monitor what people look at in a natural environment .
It consists of two lightweight video cameras mounted on eyeglass frames — one pointed at what a person is seeing , the other pointed at the person 's right eye , tracking its movements with the help of a little infrared LED that shines an invisible beam onto the eye .
Two camcorders in a slim backpack record video from the cameras , data that eye - tracking programs then process later .
" Most other eye - tracking devices do eye - tracking simultaneously , but then people are carrying around computers and it's much more cumbersome , " says imaging scientist Jeff Pelz at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
" Ours is an incredibly stripped - down design . "
The novice and seasoned geologists from the University of Rochester have gone out with the eye - trackers about four times a day over their two - week field trip across California , which took them from San Francisco by the San Andreas Fault through the snowy Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park here to the harshest area of the U.S. " Death Valley is a great place , where one can really see active geology first - hand — forces that are shaping the crust of the earth , " says geophysicist John Tarduno of the University of Rochester .
" Most people think of Death Valley as this big hole because it 's below sea level , and that 's true at the heart of it , but right adjacent is an 11,000 - foot mountain . "
Nature does n't like such elevation differences right next to one another ; erosion tends to even things out .
" The fact we have a valley today hints at active processes to maintain that difference , " Tarduno explains .
" It 's conclusions like these that we hope to see students reach by themselves . "
As with almost all field trips , unexpected troubles arose , such as the sandstorm that engulfed Death Valley on the first day , sending the group to a campground at the snowline of Mt. Whitney , the highest point in the contiguous 48 states .
The desert is trouble in other ways — the glint of the sun off the eye can confuse the eye - tracking software , which is why those wearing eye - trackers all had to don ungainly wide - brimmed sun hats that have been the objects of much ridicule .
Even so , the software loses track of gaze in maybe 10 to 15 percent of the video frames the cameras record , a problem future algorithms will hopefully fix , says Jason Babcock , president of Positive Science , who built the eye - trackers .
Aside from the eye - trackers , the researchers also used a robot - operated camera to take hundreds of high - resolution photos of the areas , which can later get stitched together for panoramic images displayed on giant wrap - around screens , as well as a video system consisting of six cameras , whose feeds are woven together to create a seamless hemispheric movie .
" The hope is we verify that student geologists in the field and those surrounded by these virtual environments view formations the same way so we can use simulations to train novices on dozens of virtual field trips , cutting down on the costs of travel and equipment to make better use of actual trips , " says imaging scientist Mitchell Rosen at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
" My greatest hope is that a geologist can sit down in a virtual field trip and make observations he or she did n't or could n't make out in the field , by putting scenes next to each other , or zooming in , or performing other kinds of analyses not available out there . "
Those flashes of discovery are what the researchers are seeking to record now .
At the Long Valley Caldera , Tarduno quizzed students about the lava flows they saw and the curve of surrounding landmasses until they realized they were standing in a dormant supervolcano roughly 20 miles long and 11 miles wide now covered in snow .
" I was really excited at that instant , " student Shannon Moss recalls .
" I saw this circle we were in and it just came to me . "
An otherwise fleeting moment now captured by the eye - trackers .
Kane & Lynch Bring Childhood Games Back
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 28th of May 2010 - 03:24 PM ]
Well to bring back a bit of that nostalgia , you can play that game again in a more violent way .
At least when Kane and Lynch 2 lands on August 27th .
The below video details yet another of the multiplayer modes for Kane and Lynch 2 , which is aptly titled Cops and Robbers .
All the same goals from childhood except that you will get smack talked by kids who should be outside playing the physical game instead of on XBox Live and the PSN .
On a side note from that , I am wondering why all of the multiplayer modes require you to gather only $ 4 million in four minutes .
Everyone so far .
Am I missing a bigger picture ?
Or is this just the limitations IO Interactive had to work with ?
Either way enjoy the audibly NSFW video below .
It 's awesome enough that Rooster Teeth would rig up a Ford with a third - person camera , to attempt to drive like one does in a video game .
What really makes this video shine are the Yakuza extras karate - kicking the test subjects .

This is an aspect of video games that was long overdue for the Mythbusters treatment , so , kudos to the geniuses who made it happen .
After mounting the camera on a Z - bar hitched to the truck 's bumper , they then blacked out the windows so that the driver was forced to use the third - person perspective .
God are they driving slow .
And still hitting the traffic cones and inflatable pedestrians .
Why does it still boggle my mind that driving a video - game car like a real world car is just as disorienting and deadly as driving a real - world car like a video - game car ?
What this needs now is Grant Imahara to hook up the steering wheel to an Xbox 360 controller , so that the guy driving can drive with third - person controls and a third - person view in the first person .
And I just hurt my brain .

A cop who shot an Iraqi war vet nine times at point blank range last weekend for making a pass at his female companion has been charged with murder .
The problem is , no one can find him .
Authorities in Baltimore issued an arrest warrant Friday evening charging Baltimore police officer Gahiji A. Tshamba with first degree murder in connection with the death of former marine Tyrone Brown .
ADVERTISEMENT
But efforts to locate the 15 - year veteran have been unsuccessful , leading investigators to consider the possibility Tshamba may have absconded rather than face murder charges and possible jail time .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We have been to several places where he is known to live and he was not there , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â a Baltimore police officer speaking on condition of anonymity told Raw Story Saturday morning .
Police have not officially classified Tshamba as a fugitive .
The charges come after a week of intense pressure for prosecutors to quickly indict Tshamba for the slaying of Brown .
Tshamba and BrownÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s paths crossed nearly a week ago in an alley behind a bar in BaltimoreÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Mt Vernon neighborhood .
ADVERTISEMENT
The two exchanged words after Brown allegedly made unwanted advances towards a girlfriend with Tshamba .
Police said an altercation ensued .
The Baltimore Sun reported that witnesses told police Tshamba yelled at Brown to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ do it again , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â allegedly referring to BrownÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s advances .
Then Tshamba fired off the fatal fusillade of bullets striking Brown nine times in the chest , head , and groin .
After the shooting officer Tshamba refused to take a breathalyzer test .
Ã‚Â Witnesses told police the officer was at a local bar holding a drink shortly before the shooting occurred .
ADVERTISEMENT
An autopsy conducted earlier this week found so - called Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ stipplingÃ¢â‚ ¬Â on BrownÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s head , gun powder burns that indicate a victim was shot at point blank range .
The autopsy corroborates witness accounts that Tshamba was standing over Brown when he fired off 13 shots .
Witnesses said Brown had his hands over his head when the shooting occurred .
ADVERTISEMENT
Last weekendÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s shooting was not the first time Tshamba had fired his weapon off - duty amid allegations that he had been drinking .
The Sun noted in 2005 that Tshamba shot a man in the foot who had been yelling racial slurs at the officer after he had struck TshambaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s car .
A blood alcohol test showed Tshamba had a .12 alcohol level , over the .08 legal limit of intoxication in Maryland for operating the motor vehicle .
In spite of this , internal affairs investigators determined the shooting was justified .
Tshamba received an 8 day suspension .

A funeral for Brown is scheduled for Wednesday in Baltimore .
Senators protest against a public they say has become too bloated to efficiently populate the country .
WASHINGTON — At a time when widespread polling data suggests that a majority of the U.S. populace no longer trusts the federal government , a Pew Research Center report has found that the vast majority of the federal government does n't trust the U.S. populace all that much either .

According to the poll — which surveyed members of the judicial , legislative , and executive branches — 9 out of 10 government officials reported feeling " disillusioned " by the populace and claimed to have " completely lost confidence " in the citizenry 's ability to act in the nation 's best interests .
" All the vitriol and partisan bickering in Congress has caused most Americans to form negative opinions of the U.S. government , " Pew researcher Amy Ratner said .
" However , over the same time period , the government has likewise grown wary of U.S. citizens , largely due to their utter lack of foresight , laziness , and overall incompetence . "

Added Ratner , " And the fact that American Idol is still the No. 1 show on television does n't exactly make our government burst with confidence . "
Out of 100 U.S. senators polled , 84 said they do n't trust the U.S. populace to do what is right , and 79 said Americans are not qualified to do their jobs .
Ninety - one percent of all government officials polled said they find citizens to be every bit as irresponsible , greedy , irrational , and selfishly motivated as government officials are .

Moreover , according to nearly 100 percent of respondents , Wal - Mart .
" It makes complete sense for Americans to lose faith in a government that has allowed lobbyists and special interests to take over Washington , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) told reporters .
" That being said , you could see why Washington might likewise lose faith in a populace that apparently still suspects that its president is a secret Muslim who was not born in the United States . "

Citing the billions of dollars wasted annually on flavored water and boneless buffalo wings , the number of drunk - driving deaths each year , and the lack of citizen accountability for the rise of Kim Kardashian , government officials registered extremely low opinions of the American people overall .
" This is the same American populace that failed to prevent us from deregulating the banks that almost caused a complete economic meltdown last year , " Sen.
Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) said .
" Year after year , they elect terrible officials who make terrible decisions on their behalf .
The fact that I , Jim Bunning , am a two - term U.S. senator really shows you just how far Americans have gone off the rails . "

" I would n't trust anyone who voted me into office , " he added .
Government skepticism is not confined to legislators , though .
A cross-sampling of the U.S. Supreme Court found that only 1 in 9 justices believe the general populace to be ethical .
Their confidence that the American people can resist consuming the newest Burger King sandwich just because it 's there or at least keep it to one a week has also fallen to a 10 - year low .

" They can't even fill out their census forms , for crying out loud , " Gov. Butch Otter of Idaho said .
" It 's only 10 questions long .
We 're not talking about taking the SATs here .
Jesus Christ , do n't get me started on the SATs . "
One typical respondent , President Barack Obama , said he found it hard to trust the judgment of U.S. citizens after recent events , including their decision to elect a president who promised health care reform and then come out against health care reform .

" How can I have hope for a nation that regularly protests tax cuts that directly benefit them ? "
Obama said .
" Look , I 'm not always perfect at my job , either , but I think I could make a halfway coherent comment on a YouTube video if I had to .
Is n't that basically all they do ?
Added Obama , " At this point , the only positive thing I can say about the American people is that I 'm pretty sure they 've never rigged an election in their favor . "

The ' worst drink in America ' : 2,000 - calorie milkshake has as much saturated fat as 25 rashers of bacon
The Cold Stone PB&C packs a whopping 2,010 calories and has been dubbed the worst drink in the U.S .
A 2,000 - calorie milkshake that contains as much fat as 25 rashers of bacon has been named as the worst drink in America .
Just one serving equals the recommended daily calorie intake for women and falls just short of the total for men .
Made with chocolate ice cream , milk and peanut butter , the shake packs a whopping 131 grams of fat – 68g of which is saturated – and 153g of sugar .
Called the Cold Stone PB & C , the drink left Jamie Oliver speechless .
The TV chef , who recently waged war on obesity in a U. S. version of his Food Revolution show , spotted a magazine article about the gut - busting beverage and tweeted : ‘ There are no words . ’
It beat McDonald ’s Triple Thick Chocolate Milkshake – at 1,160 calories , the equivalent of 13 McDonald ’s apple pies – to top the list of the Men ’s Health magazine ’s 20 Worst Drinks in America .
‘ Health experts recommend capping your saturated fat intake at about 20g per day , yet this beverage packs more than three times that into a cup , ’ the magazine said .
Other fattening drinks on the list include the worst smoothie , at number two , which boasts 1,498 calories with 44g of fat and 214g of sugar .
The Starbucks White Hot Chocolate with whipped cream , with 520 calories , 16g of fat and 75g of sugar makes it on to the list as the worst hot chocolate .
Josh Fein , who runs the Marina Del Rey ice cream eatery , says the health conscious locals are not that keen on the PB&C shake
But this information did n’t bother tourists in Marina Del Rey , California , as they sampled a supersized – Gotta Have
It – size of the PB & C ice cream milkshake .
Christopher Fields , from Hammond , Indiana , said : ‘ It ’s delicious .
I would definitely have it again . ’
When told the milkshake was nearly the equivalent of the recommended daily calorie intake for men , the chubby 45 - year - old said : ‘ I do n’t care . ’
Emily Japy , 20 , from Paris did n't turn up her nose at the fatty drink
Patting his stomach , he declared : ‘ I ’d probably have it once a week . ’
Anna Simard from Vancouver was a bit more sceptical .
The 40 - year - old , who was holidaying with husband Dennis and their two children Ava , eight , and Declan , 10 , said : ‘ It ’s great .
' The kids would love it .
But I would n’t have it that much because of the calorie intake .
' I do n’t mind the kids having it , though , because they do n’t have to worry as much about their calories . ’
Husband Dennis , also 40 , liked it but said : ‘ I ’d maybe have it if it had some rum in it . ’
Ava was n’t that excited but Declan said : ‘ I love chocolate and peanut butter .
This is great . ’
Emily Japy , a 20 - year - old from Paris , said : ‘ I ’d definitely have it again .
I ’m here for two months and I ’d probably have it two or three times a month . ’
Josh Fein , who runs the ice cream shop at the beach resort near Los Angeles , says health - conscious locals are not keen on the shake .
He said : ‘ We probably only sell about eight to ten of those a week and mostly to tourists . ’
In Britain , a large McDonald ’s strawberry milkshake contains 582 calories and Caffe Nero ’s Strawberry Frappe provides 475 calories per serving .
MONTREAL - Peter Milliken ’s landmark ruling is not the kind of decision that a governing party hovering at 30 per cent in voting intentions should want to take into a snap election , especially on the heels of losing a significant chunk of support for closing down Parliament for most of the winter .
For the decision issued Tuesday by the veteran speaker of the House of Commons largely reads like a condemnation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s take - no - prisoners approach to the minority Parliament .
On the crucial aspects of the case that has been pitting the other parties against the government over the release of the documents pertaining to the Afghan detainee file , Milliken ruled in favour of Parliament and its current opposition majority .
He found little merit to the argument that ministers and their officials should the sole arbiters of what national security allows the government to share with Parliament .
He found no merit at all to the notion that the Bloc Québécois , by the virtue of its sovereignist creed , should not be trusted in the Afghan detainee loop .
And he pointed out that for 140 years , such battles of wills had routinely been resolved without triggering a constitutional crisis .
Milliken ’s decision ca n’t be appealed – at least on the conventional parliamentary front .
The government could always try to buy time by asking the Supreme Court to rule on the proper balance between the powers of the executive and those of Parliament .
But in the past , Canada ’s top court has been wary of meddling in the internal affairs of Parliament and the current prime minister has spent his career taking shots at judges for usurping the rights of elected officials .
It would be ironic to have Harper now turn to the courts to protect his government from the will of an elected majority .
He could also try to stare the opposition down , by declaring the issue a matter of confidence and daring the opposition parties to defeat his government over it .
The Liberals in particular have blinked in the past .
But if they did in this case , the House could be forced to look for a new referee .
Milliken could hardly continue in his current role if a majority of MPs failed to endorse a ruling of yesterday ’s magnitude
And even a Conservative election victory would not necessarily make this ruling go away - not unless Harper secured a majority .
But while there are those among Conservative strategists who believe he might prevail by wrapping himself in the flag for the duration of the campaign , polls indicate that would be a big gamble .
In a short statement yesterday , justice minister Rob Nicholson left all options open , including that of coming to terms with the opposition .
A start could be to have former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci – who has been hired by the department of justice to vet the documents – report to Parliament rather than to the government , and / or to have legal representatives of the relevant parliamentary committee assist him in his task .
Another would be to allow some or all of the members of the committee that has been investigating the Afghan detainee issue to examine the documents behind closed doors .

But , if this government is true to form , the first order of Conservative business is going to be giving the Liberals a call .
They are the weakest link in the opposition chain , by virtue of the party ’s greater fear of a spring election .
Dividing the opposition to conquer served Harper well in the last parliamentary crisis and it could do so again in his latest predicament .

With a genre so old that its roots date back to Pong in the 70’s I thought we ’d reached the pinnacle of paddle - and - ball , brick - breaking games when Ricochet Infinity was released in 2007 .
Shatter showed me how wrong I was .
[ youtube ]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWrFZMTlR7o[/youtube]
With strange geometric shapes twisting and bending in the background and electronic beats blasting out of your speakers , Shatter hits your senses full force .
The style of this game won me over before the first level had even loaded .
It ’s a style that has both positive and negative aspects ; though the visuals are amazing , you may find yourself getting eyestrain after playing for more than an hour at a time .
The soundtrack is really fun , but limited to one track per eight - level world , so you might find a particular song getting tedious after the first few levels .
With the breakneck pace of the game , however , these really are minor issues .
Beyond its style , there are a few elements that make Shatter stand out from others in the genre :
The playfield
Not satisfied with sticking to the typical paddle at the bottom design , Sidhe ups the ante with levels that include brick bashing from the left side of the field and , most interestingly , some frustratingly fun spherical levels .
The bricks are n’t content to stay still either : they explode , break off and fly around , and blast off like missiles when struck .
Most also break into energy shards when struck , which you want to collect to power your special moves , which I ’ll discuss later .
All of this results in a whole lot of things flying at you at once .
Each world ends with a boss fight , often interesting puzzles in their own right .
The paddle
The standout ability here is the capability to attract and repel objects from you .
It may sound simple but makes for some unique gameplay .
You can remove floating bricks from play by sucking them towards you , then quickly moving out of the way to let them pass off screen .
But be careful : if struck by them you ’ll be knocked off the board for a moment .
You can also force the ball to bend and twist its path , even forcing it to stay down the far end of the field and ricochet back and forth amongst the bricks .
This ability is so powerful that very few others are needed .
You can use the energy shards you ’ve collected in two ways : the one you ’ll use most often is a storm of bullets that quickly rips through everything in their path , the second is a shield that protects you from stray blocks .
Overall , Shatter plays as a quick and easy game .
Intentionally so .
This is more about assaulting your senses than challenging your gameplaying skills .
The storymode may seem short because of this , but there ’s a lot of casual replay value here , with game modes such as Endless , Time Attack , and Boss Rush .
A $ 10 price tag Shatter on Steam is right on target and I ’m hoping we see level packs in the future to prolong the fun .

Earlier today , convicted killer Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by a Utah firing squad ; the first execution of its kind in the United States in 14 years .
Shortly before that , Attorney General Mark Shurtleff announced it with a couple of tweets .
One of them read : " I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner 's execution .
May
God grant him the mercy he denied his victims . "
Earlier , he tweeted : " A solemn day .
Barring a stay by Sup Ct , & with my final nod , Utah will use most extreme power & execute a killer .
Mourn his victims .
Justice . "
Were these tweets really necessary ?
For the most part , the 140 - character messages about death , devoid of any emotion , did not sit well with many Twitter users .
A Twitter user named diptychal tweeted : " @MarkShurtleff 's tweet will probably go down in history as the dumbest most disgusting use of Twitter ever . "
Another user , named drhonk , simply tweeted : " What a way to announce someone 's execution ... twitter .. geez . "
The incident raises an interesting question .
Is Twitter really appropriate in every occasion , even one as serious as an execution ?
What do you think , should Mark Shurtleff have tweeted about it ?

The RIAA has asked the federal judge overseeing the LimeWire case to slap a permanent injunction on LimeWire until it can clean up its copyright troubles to the labels ' satisfaction .
" It is patently obvious that the rampant illegal conduct that Lime Wire intentionally induced , and for which it has been adjudged liable , will continue uninterrupted day after day unless and until the Court issues an injunction to rein in this massive infringing operation , " says the recording industry 's request .
LimeWire was found liable for massive copyright infringement a few weeks back .
Judge Kimba
Wood 's ruling cited internal LimeWire documents showing a knowledge of all the infringement taking place through LimeWire 's software — and little done to stop it .
" In the weeks since this Court ’s Order , what has Lime Wire done to try to halt or limit the infringement it has induced ? " ask the RIAA lawyers .
" The answer , from all appearances , is nothing . "
The RIAA now proposes that the judge shut down the service and forbid LimeWire from distributing its software or running advertising .
For the service to reopen , LimeWire would have to show that it has addressed the infringement issues and implemented a robust content filtering system to prevent successful searches for material that infringes copyright .
Another federal judge recently ordered P2P search engine isoHunt to implement a similar content filter based on " warez words " like " jaybob " and on movie titles .
LimeWire would apparently need something similar for music .
Such a move would probably make the service useless to most of LimeWire 's existing users , who are legion .
In 2008 , LimeWire boasted that 4 million unique users logged on via the official client .
The RIAA says that , over the past couple of years , the LimeWire client has been downloaded over 200 million times from download.com .
What about monetary damages ?
They will come later .
If past cases are any indication , LimeWire could well be forced out of business by the damage award ( unless it can overturn the liability ruling on appeal ) .
Update : LimeWire 's response has arrived .
“ We feel a permanent injunction is not the best course of action .
It could hold back the creation of new digital music technologies that LimeWire is in the process of developing and does not benefit the industry as a whole ...
“ Moreover , we continue to remain focused on our future product , which will give users boundless music portability and compatibility .
We can confirm that in our ongoing dialogues with numerous industry executives , this service has been very well received . ”
Things I Remember About Detroit Five Years of Abandoned Factories , Talking Cats , and Cars on Fire
Sterling Voss
The " Safety Zone "
First day of college .
A tour of campus , then a tour of the three - block radius separating us from the wilds of inner-city Detroit .
Instructor tells students NOT to leave three - block " safety zone " — and if we DO , always " look people in the eye . "
Do n't look like a " victim . "
Walk tall and confident , and if someone demands money or a wallet , just give it to 'em .
My Plymouth Horizon
I had no idea every other city was n't like this one .
I had never seen a city before .
I loved it — tall buildings , libraries , black people , freedom .
On April 1 , Mom calls to check in on me .
My dorm roommate has a new Macintosh II , and we play gunshot sound effects as I tell her that my car has been stolen .
It works too well .
Then : " April Fool's !! ! "
Mom does n't laugh .
Next morning , my Plymouth Horizon is still where I left it , but every tire except one is flat and the passenger - side window is busted .
The replacement window costs $ 200 .
Weirdly , nothing is stolen .
Farmer Crack
I get lost driving in Southwest Detroit , trying to find food .
Factories , abandoned houses , dirt roads .
Finally see a Farmer Jack , and while exiting the freeway , a big - ass hooptie — a great big green Lincoln Continental — hits the back of my Horizon so hard I fly into a 180 - degree spin and lose my back bumper .
I get out and ask the guy if I can get his insurance number .
He pulls a 9 mm from his crotch and asks me why I hit him .
I say sorry , get back in my car , and wait for him to drive away .
Then I get out and throw my bumper in the trunk .
When I finally pull into Farmer Jack , it 's closed .
A guy with a shopping cart rolls up and asks me if I " want some rocks . "
I say no .
Farmer Jack — the biggest grocery - store chain in downtown Detroit in the 1990s — from that day forward becomes Farmer Crack .
Crackers
Being a ' billy from Up North , growing up as a little kid on a farm in Northern Michigan , I 'd never seen a prostitute .
One sunny summer day , while riding my ten-speed through the Cass Corridor trying to find something called " falafel " , I ride past a bunch of hookers .
" Whatchoo doin ' cracka - biiiiiiiiiitch ? " asks a funny and awesome curvy lady wearing nothing but a silk camisole and high heels , laughing .
Getting catcalled , getting things thrown at you by the Cass Avenue hookers , becomes an official sport that summer .
We keep a tally sheet on the fridge .
Being called " bitch " gets 5 points .
" Cracker " gets you 10 .
Dead Bodies
I 'm going to school for graphic art — " commercial " art .
When a group of way cooler FINE ART students asks me to participate in a gallery show , I 'm honored .
The show has the loose theme of " time . "
We 're each given only the motor of a clock and asked to build the rest .
There is an abandoned two - story house over on Willis Street that I 've always wanted to go in .
The doors and windows are long gone , and grass and flowers are growing on the windowsills .
My boyfriend and I go in to scavenge for clock materials .
Being inside a house that 's still partially furnished and still has an old framed painting hanging over the fireplace is beyond creepy .
Even in broad daylight , you can't shake the feeling that someone is watching you .
I go straight for a downstairs bedroom and find an old box spring .
I pull at it and get a hunk of rotted wood covered in a perfect mess of rusty springs .
My clock is gonna rock .
Boyfriend wants to go upstairs .
" No , " I say .
" Let 's just go — I got what I need . "
He calls me a wuss .
We go home .
The next day on the local news , we see the house with the windowsill flowers .
They found a long - dead body in the upstairs bedroom .
A woman .
They think she was a prostitute .
We do n't ride our bikes down Cass so much after that .
" Kill Whitey "
Ca n't get any homework done in the dorm .
Mom comes with a truck full of apartment stuff , and I tell her to follow me to my new place .
I drive her all over the worst neighborhoods I know , then pull into the driveway of a boarded - up three - story house covered with graffiti .
" Kill Whitey " is spray - painted on the front of it .
I get out of the car just to see the terror on her face .
Then : " Just kidding ! "
She yells back : " You BITCH ! "
A Talking Cat
Move into a gorgeous brick brownstone called Phillips Manor — hardwood floors , fireplace , four bedrooms .
My two roommates and I pay $ 110 apiece .
The three of us are sitting and watching the huge Star Trek–looking TV I scored for $ 15 at the thrift store .
All the remote controls are sitting in plain view on the coffee table .
We 're watching VH1 .
The channel changes itself to The New Dance Show — the local , low - budget version of Soul Train .
This is the first of many times that the TV switches itself to another station .
The radio randomly switches itself , too .
And always to a black TV show or song .
Seems to be a friendly ghost .
Most definitely an African - American ghost .
The only other thing living in that house , aside from the three of us , is my roommate 's spooky black Persian cat .
Always hiding somewhere .
Can never pet it .
Once , we can't find it for almost a week .
My roommate leaves to make a " Lost Cat " flyer at Kinko's , thinking it somehow got outside .
Boyfriend is sitting in the living room , and I 'm at one end of the long hallway near the bathroom .
The cat comes stumbling out of one of the bedrooms and just sits in the middle of the hallway , not moving , staring intently at me .
I say , all sweet , " Kiiiii - teee , there you are ! "
The cat just stares .
Then its mouth opens slightly and a very deep man 's voice says , " Hello . "
With that , the cat walks back into the bedroom .
Boyfriend says , " Who just said ' Hello ' ? "
Not making this up .
I scream and lock myself in the bathroom .
For hours .
Interstate 75
Detroit 's freeways were built for TRAFFIC .
Except there are no people left , just embankments , grass , cement .
Pretty easy to turn around , because every exit has an overpass .
I 'm driving 89 miles an hour , late for class .
Teacher says if I 'm late again — expelled .
WHAM !
My hood flies up and hits the windshield .
I 'm going so fast and can't see anything .
Then the wind catches and it slams back down , but now the latch is broken , so it flies up again .
HOLY FUCK .
It slams down again and I start pulling to the right .
WHAM !
Hits the windshield again .
Oh my fucking God , why is this happening ?
The next time it flies up , it does n't hit the windshield — it just flies right off the car .
I watch it in the rearview mirror go end over end , airborne .
I pull off at an exit , thinking my hood just caused a HUGE accident .
Maybe killed someone ?
I travel south , then back north , looking for carnage .
NOTHING .
I go farther and do the loop again .
And again .
Nothing .
Where the hell is the hood to my car ?
Somebody steal it ?
That fast ?
Never ever find it , and drive around the D with my engine exposed for over a week .
The Packard Plant
Some kids at school ask if we wanna go to a party .
Sure !
Okay , they tell us to go to Zoots Coffee to get directions .
We go to Zoots .
Barista looks us up and down , then tells us to go to Alvin 's and ask the bartender for the directions .
Weird , but all right .
After Alvin's , we get sent to Cass Cafe , and someone at Cass Cafe says to go to Showtime Clothing , then finally someone there tells us the party is at the long - closed Packard Plant — a huge auto factory built in 1903 , now a maze of 40 - plus abandoned buildings on 35 acres .
We go .
Holy shitballs , it 's scary at night .
A couple kids are outside directing people .
We follow a tunnel made of black garbage bags that empties out into this gigantic open room .
There are crazy lights everywhere , some guy named Plastikman is DJing , and over a thousand people are dancing , partying , screwing each other in the dark corners .
Some guy asks me if I want some " E. " I say , " What 's that ? "
He says , " Oh , child , is this your first rave ? "
Drug Dealers
One day , my friend calls .
She lives in the same apartment building , but on the fifth floor .
" Come quick !
Come up here ! "
We go to the window and look down at the street .
There 's a view of the Majestic Cafe parking lot , Detroit Medical Center , more brick apartments , and Woodward Avenue , the main drag .
Three men in brightly colored ski masks are pouring gasoline all over our landlord Judith 's Buick Riviera .
One of the men throws a book of matches on it , and then they walk away .
We clap and laugh and LAUGH as Judith 's boyfriend tries to put the fire out with buckets then a garden hose .
We did n't like Judith very much .
Apparently , the drug dealers down the street did n't like her either .
Especially after she called the cops on them .
Another time at that window , we watch a drunk guy with a cinder block smash out the windshields of five cars in a row .
The cops actually show up that time .
Cops
One night , I get kinda shitty on OE .
We thought it'd be fun to drink Olde English 800 malt liquor from the " party store , " just like everyone else did in the D .
All fun until I have to drive home .
I mean , walking was ALWAYS out of the question , unless you wanted to maybe die , and cabs were rarely around .
It 'd be good to take all the side streets , I think to myself , kinda creep my way home .
" Creeping " was all I 'd done anyway since I lost my driver 's license .
If you lose your license , and you 're a 22 - year - old girl living in downtown Detroit , you have no choice but to keep driving .
I 'd been driving very carefully for almost a year , with no trouble .
When the cops pull me over , my neck immediately breaks out in hives .
This is it — I 'm going to jail , oh sweet Mary mother of God , I 'm going to jail .
Two football - player - sized black policemen come up to my car .
Instead of asking for my license , they ask if I know I 'm driving the wrong way down a one - way street .
I try to explain .
Oh fuck .
My speech is slurry .
" What 's that ? " policeman one says , pointing to the red gas can in the back of my car .
" I ran outta gas two days ago , " I say .
" Do n't you know it 's Devil 's Night ? " says policeman two .
( Devil 's Night , the night before Halloween , is the Detroit phenomenon where residents set fire to empty buildings .
One year , over 800 houses burned to the ground in less than 72 hours . )
" You know , you can go to jail for even having that in your possession . "
" I was n't gonna burn anything , I swear to God , please believe me , " I say .
" Okay , okay , " one says , " but I gotta take that can . "
" What are you doing down here anyway , blondie ?
This is a bad neighborhood , " says the other .
" Where are you trying to go ? " " Home .
I live on Willis Street . "
" Okay , then , follow us .
We 'll give you an escort .
You really should n't be here . "
Yellow Dogs
Walking home from the Detroit Institute of Arts — my first museum , with so many real Van Gogh paintings that I get overwhelmed and physically nauseated — I see the infamous , majestic " yellow dogs " running down the street .
Unlike Mexico , which has a sunshine -y warm climate and loads of feral dogs , Detroit 's wild dogs are so furry and dirty they almost look like they have dreads , or like smallish grizzly bears — maybe once domesticated , maybe once someone 's pet , now alien creatures worthy of scientific study .
You can tell the lead dog — he is always leading the pack —used to be a yellow Lab .
The rest are a mix of breeds , but for some reason , everyone calls them " the yellow dogs . "
They are always silently running somewhere — never barking .
The rumor is that you have good luck for a week if they cross your path .
The Nub Man
I 'm working at the college and at the Majestic Cafe on Woodward Avenue .
I lied my way into a waitress job there :
When they asked if they could call my former employer , I gave them my mom's number and told her to answer the phone for a few days as " Torsch 's Bar and Grill . "
She did .
And it worked .
The Nub Man is a homeless , toothless , one - armed vet who spare - changes in front of the Majestic .
I see him almost every day .
He used to scare me a little , but I try to give him change or bills when I can .
One night , after a super - long , hard shift , someone steals my apron with all my money in it .
I 'm livid .
So tired and angry .
I start to walk home .
The Nub comes running after me .
" No , you know what ? " I say .
" I DON'T HAVE ANY FUCKING MONEY !
Someone stole it , and now I can't fucking eat !
I do n't have any food ! "
Then I start crying .
" Oh it 's okay , " he says , and hands me five bucks .
" You 're gonna eat .
Just take it . "
I pay him $ 10 back the next day , and after that , the Nub and I are friends .
One sunny day , we even play Frisbee in the parking lot .
Last time I ever see him :
He comes running up to me for his typical high five — he'd hold up what was left of his arm and say , " Give the nub some love ! " — then says , " Girl , whatchoo think ? ! "
I say , " ' Bout what ? "
" What 's different ? " he says with a huge , cheesy grin .
" You got teeth ! " " Ah , haaaa !
I did !
They tried to give me an arm , too , but I did n't want no fake arm . "
Henry Ford Hospital
One day , I 'm in so much pain I can't walk .
Feels like a knife in my girly parts .
I 'm crawling on our dirty hardwood floors in Hamtramck , the little Polish hood north of downtown .
Since I live with a sculptor , there 's clay dust on everything .
The Midol my boyfriend brings me does n't work , so he throws me in his Ford Festiva — the tiniest car in the world — and takes me to Henry Ford .
" What 's wrong with you , girl ? " the ER nurse asks .
I 'm pouring sweat .
I 'm dying .
I feel like I 'm going to start hallucinating .
They roll me into the maternity ward .
A group of gigantic and gorgeous super - pregnant black women surround me .
I 'm in the fetal position , weeping .
Only white person for miles .
( My stepdad would have died before coming in here .
" I do n't even like driving past Detroit , " he used to say .
In the five years I lived there , he never visited once . )
One of the women pets my head .
I can't stop crying .
" This is a blood gas , " a nurse says , plunging a needle into an artery in my wrist .
It basically feels like she 's cutting my hand off .
Next thing , someone 's saying , " It did n't work , gotta do it again . "
And then I 'm alone in the room .
And then , suddenly , all the pain just stops .
Instant gone .
I can hear them coming back for my second blood gas .
No more " blood gases . "
No way .
SORRY .
I find my street clothes , carefully pull the IV line out of the vein in my other arm , and walk out of the hospital .
According to the $ 2,000 bill I get later , I passed a kidney stone .
Insane Clown Posse
One night , my friend calls .
" Come up here ! "
" Is someone torching Judith 's new car ? ! "
" No , just come up , CLOWNS ! "
We go to the window and look down .
" I think they 're called ' Juggalos ' — some band called ICP is playing at the Magic Stick across the street . "
We start throwing paper airplanes at them .
Then various other crap , including some potatoes we have on the kitchen counter .
This angers the clowns .
They start yelling at the building .
Then throwing bottles of Faygo at the building , except they do n't know which apartment the potatoes are coming from .
Judith goes outside to see what 's going on .
We clap and laugh and laugh some more .
Trash
The best part of living in Detroit is the ruins .
The whole place is one giant urban - ruins park .
Though it 's sad and broken and abandoned , there is art everywhere .
It 's beautiful .
From the graffiti and street art to all the overgrown empty places , where nature is slowly but surely reclaiming its place .
When school ends , it 's time to leave and find a job .
The last summer we 're living there , we break into 50 - plus buildings .
Not to destroy things , but to pay our respects to all those grand old dinosaurs .
We spend so many nights sitting on top of the old train station , Michigan Central Station .
We climb 18 stories — it takes almost 45 minutes — with food and beer and blankets on our backs , and then just sit on the roof and watch the sunset over our pretty city .
I think I miss that place the most , out of everything .
I spend my last day thinking I should go over to the train station one last time to say good - bye to her .
Gonna miss this Detroit .
I 've been robbed , mugged on the light rail ( thanks , People Mover , I mean People Mugger , I mean MUGGER MOVER ) , and almost carjacked once , but I 'm still really gonna miss it .
I step outside my apartment and take a huge breath .
Suddenly , a big gust of wind picks up a plastic Farmer Crack grocery bag filled with nasty trash — some old Kleenex , some cigarette butts .
The bag hits me in the face .
Nope .
No train station today .
Gotta go .
Macs are their own little universe of hardware , design , and software .
It 's an incomplete universe , like any other , but a nerd can dream .
These are 10 applications we wish made the jump from Windows to Mac to make it a better place .
Advertisement
Note :
In almost all of these cases , we 're not saying that " This exact application should be ported to Mac OS X . "
In some cases , that would be ludicrous .
What we are suggesting is that there 's a need for a particular kind of application , and that this application , on Windows , fills exactly that need .
Also , for most purposes , we stuck with free applications .
For a counterpoint , check out these 10 Mac apps that should be on Windows .

10 . Office Viewers
Microsoft does , of course , have an Office product for Macs , but it 's far from a priority for the firm .
Even with a new 2011 version on the way , many Mac users choose not to shell out for a full - fledged Office pack , and others still do n't need the iWork suite .
Then along comes a finely formatted document from an Office user , and neither the Mac 's built - in TextEdit nor any other freeware does quite the same job of opening it as it was meant to be seen .
( You could go with OpenOffice.org , if you do n't mind waiting a few minutes to view the document . )
Go ahead and browbeat the sender for forcing their proprietary standards on you .
In the meantime , do n't you wish you had a simple view / print tool that offered great compatibility with Office docs ?
Microsoft somewhat makes amends with its free Office Web Apps ' compatibility powers , but it would be nice if they offered a desktop view - only tool .

9. TeraCopy
Advertisement
Macs usually do a better job of copying files between locations , and do n't fail or die as regularly , so recommending TeraCopy is n't about stability .
It 's about adding advanced features to file transfers for the non-Terminal - expert user , so that transfers can be paused and resumed safely , run " Test " differential comparisons on two folders , and otherwise geek out about file management .
8. Fences
Advertisement
Mac has its Spaces system for managing multiple desktops , and the applications that should stick to each space .
Windows has freeware to offer multiple desktops , too , and each file system and explorer has its pros and cons .
One area in which Windows wins is Fences , a free app from the Stardock team that keeps your files , icons , and other desktop material locked into user - defined areas .
They 're like force fields for your messy desktop , and , truth be told , Mac users are just like Windows users in some regards — it 's easy to let things fall to the Desktop , and it 's nice when the Desktop can take care of itself .
Fences on Mac would be a great thing .
7. Rainmeter
Advertisement
Macs have a decent on - screen display creator , GeekTool , but it does n't have the same kind of enthusiastic community , easy - to - use beginner tool , or quite the same adjustment powers of Rainmeter .
It 's a key component of our featured desktops , and the variety of desktop setups shows its power .
Even if Rainmeter were n't around , the native themes of Windows 7 offer a good deal more flexibility than the Mac offers .
It seems fair to ask for users to have control of colors and shading , while leaving control of the window dynamics to the designers .

6. A Different Kind of CCleaner
Advertisement
Experienced and clever Mac users know where everything goes — what the Library folder is for , where the preferences are stored , and what happens when you delete the wrong thing from a user 's Home folder .
New Mac users and switchers do n't know , and occasionally have to hope they can phrase their questions correctly to Google to find the answer .
CCleaner does a specific job on Windows systems , cleaning out caches , temporary files , junk cookies , and more deeply hidden cruft .
It would be pretty great if someone wrote a tool for Macs that cleaned house , yes , but also suggested other optimizations that the user could then approve or ignore .
5. Ninite
Advertisement
We 're being a bit particular here , we know , but hopefully in every Mac user 's interest .
When we made the Lifehacker Pack 2010 for Windows , the all - in - one installer Ninite made it easy to point to a single page where new computer owners , re-installers , or those looking to spruce up their computer could grab all or some of our recommendations , and then install them while walking away to grab a cold beverage .
For the Lifehacker Pack for Mac , there 's really no such tool around .
Macs do , of course , install applications differently , with the user usually being required to drop the entire application package dropped into a folder that they sometimes need administrative access to .
That makes sense for what Apple 's trying to do — make computers easy .
They ( or clever outside developers ) could make it just as easy for power users to quickly install the stuff they need , though , with a Ninite - like tool .

As with photo editing , it would be great to have a free plain text editor that was as versatile as Notepad ++.
Notepad ++ is flexible , extensible , and very friendly to coders of HTML , PHP , Ruby , Python , or any other language .
Actually , no matter what you 're writing with or about , Notepad + + is up for the job , or there 's probably a plug - in to make it so .
Most important to what we 're rooting for , Notepad + + is free , and open - source — that would be a lovely thing to see on a Mac.
Smultron used to cover this territory well , but it 's no longer under active development , and TextWrangler does n't have the breadth of features we 'd like .
Update : A reader points us toward Fraise , which is Smultron reborn , and may be exactly what we were looking for .
3. Microsoft Security Essentials
Advertisement
It 's still true , generally , that given the overall popularity of Windows , and the Mac 's Unix - type core and design , virus makers are less inclined to target the OS , and applications less able to let malware in .
That does n't mean that , as Macs grow in popular acceptance , aided in part by iPhones , they could n't possibly be the target of exploits ( even Apple takes precautions ) , or just lesser crapware .
So while 68 percent of Lifehacker readers do n't run an antivirus app on their Mac , there 's still a place for a light , agile , and quiet malware protector — in the Windows world , this is Microsoft Security Essentials .

2. AutoHotkey
Advertisement
AutoHotKey is a scripting language that can be molded to basically do anything , anything inside Windows .
A good number of Lifehacker 's own coding projects , including Texter and Belvedere , are built on it , and the How - To Geek 's own site is a veritable treasure trove of AHK - based fixes for Windows annoyances and shortcomings .
Macs have AppleScript .
It is not close to the same thing , or as far - reaching in its powers .
It might be the longest shot of all our wishes , because Apple may never allow a third - party app such deep access to the system functions .
But it would be pretty nice .

Paint.NET is n't a full - fledged Photoshop or attempted equivalent , like the GIMP .
It 's more than an image viewer or very light editor , like Paint .
It 's just about what the non-expert needs to crop , size , balance , and otherwise tweak their photos and graphics .
As Gina discovered , there is n't a straight - up solution to finding the middle ground on a Mac , or at least a free middle path solution .
So while it used to be a fair assumption that every Mac owner had Photoshop — heck , at one point , it seemed like the only reason one would have a Mac — it would be nice to grab a good enough solution .
Pinta seems to be aiming for that exact target , though , so give it your support .
We 've heard rumors that the strengths and weaknesses of Windows and Mac software is a hotly contested thing .
This is just our own list , drawn from editors ' experiences on Windows and Mac machines .
What 's the killer Windows app or feature we 're missing , that desperately needs developed for Mac ?

Much has been written on the big ticket changes in HTML5 , like forms , semantics , and media , but information on the less splashy changes is sparse .
While global attributes are n't the most sexy change of HTML5 , they are the change that you will be using over and over and over as you migrate to the new specification .
Introduction : What is a Global Attribute ?
While the term attribute relating to HTML might be a bit fuzzy to you , you certainly use them with almost every element that you write .
HTML attributes give elements meaning .
They also give context .
They are both the adjective and verb for an element , if you think of the element as the noun .
For instance :
Does n't really have much meaning .
It 's a division of the page , and that 's it .
When we add an attribute though , it does have meaning :
We now have a division that is " Foo " with a class of " Bar " , which has a color of red , a title of " FooBar to the Rescue " , is displayed right to left , is to be read in US English , and when you press the tab button or " F " , it 's the first element to have focus .
It 's basic , I know .
The attributes are all those things that give elements meaning .
The difference in HTML 5 from previous versions of the specification is there are attributes that can be used on any HTML element .
These are now global attributes .
Beyond the ones illustrated in the example above , there are some new ones that are global as well which will expand the possibilities beyond just boring peanut butter .
" HTML attributes give elements meaning .
They also give context .
They are both the adjective and verb for an element , if you think of the element as the noun . "
Common Attributes : Which Ones Are Now Global ?
This is a relatively minor change in HTML 5 .
The attributes id , class , style , title , dir , lang , accesskey and tabindex are now valid attributes to have on any HTML element .
You want to give a meta tag an id , that 's valid now .
It 's even valid to give that same meta element a direction , language , class or any global attribute for that matter .
While they might not have meaning at first blush , it 's perfectly valid to define them in any tag that you feel necessary .
The above example is perfectly valid in HTML5 .
That said , where there is no reason to use an attribute , and it looks silly , perhaps the best course of action is to not use that global attribute .
A tabindex on a head element might not be the best use of time and energy .
The important part to understand is not the odd case of putting a global attribute in something that does n't quite make sense , but rather the fact that they are available in any element .
Each of these was common attributes in the past , and while their use were restricted somewhat in the past , you probably already thought of them as global .
I actually had to look up id , because I could n't think of an element that you could n't use it ( base , head , html , meta , script , style , title ) .
The old common attributes are just half of the new global attributes though .
Edit Inline : The Contenteditable and Spellcheck Attributes
The first of the new attributes to look at are contenteditable and spellcheck .
They are not mutually exclusive and you can use one without the other , but for the purposes of illustration , it makes sense to look at them at the same time .
Both of these attributes do what their names imply ; they allow an element to be editable ( contenteditable ) or allows / disallows spellcheck on content .
Let 's start with contenteditable :
Let 's look at number handling first :
In this snippet , we have one paragraph which is not editable , and one that is .
When you click on the non-editable paragraph , it works as you would expect by highlighting a word , etc :
However , when you click in the editable portion a whole new world opens :
The paragraph now becomes editable simply by adding the contenteditable attribute .
It gets even cooler when we start using the contenteditable with multiple elements .
Let 's look at a larger snippet and see what happens .
We start with something that looks like this :
When we focus the article element though , we have the entire span editable :
Furthermore , we can style the box ( for lack of better term ) using the CSS3 pseudo class of : focus
and it will look something like this :
Final notes about contenteditable : there are three basic conditions that it takes : true , false , inherit .
You can nest contenteditable conditions with nested tags .
For instance , if we do something like :
We would be able to edit the paragraphs in the article , but not the header group .
Since this is a global attribute , you could theoretically add contenteditable to your body element , and then pick and chose the elements which are not editable in the document .
The spellcheck attribute goes along with the contenteditable , but it also can be used where your user might interact with your document , for instance , with forms .
The spellcheck attribute is assumed on , unless you say otherwise :
As you can see , when we have the spellcheck set to false , we do not get an indication of a misspelled word , but with it set to true , we do .
It 's a very simple , but helpful functionality .
From my tests , browser implementation is a bit raw , but it does work now .
Adding Behavior : The Hidden Attribute
Another new global attribute is hidden .
It basically does the same job as " display : hidden " does with CSS , but within an element .
The advantage to this , it gives a semantical meaning to the element that it is not relevant at this moment in time .
Therefore , screen readers , etc. , would not mention the element in the hidden state when it would with a style of " display : hidden , " since that is dealing with its presentation .
It is a boolean attribute , therefore , false is the assumed state and you only need to add the attribute name to the element that you wish to hide .
Dragging Elements : The Draggable Attribute
HTML5 implements a new " Drag and Drop " API .
While the specifics of the API are a bit out of the scope of this tutorial , the attribute to allow something to be dragged is not .
Any element that has draggable set to true , can be dragged :
Without any JavaScript , you can see the difference in browsers that support draggable .
When set to false , if you mousedown over the element it will begin to highlight the text ; however , when set to true it does not .
In Chrome you get the drag icon , whereas in Firefox you just do n't get the highlight of the element .
Either way , the browsers are trying to do something with these elements .
Saving Space With Menus :
The contextmenu Attribute
The contextmenu attribute allows you to display a menu without taking up valuable UI space for the menu .
It is a menu which fires on events , such as mouseup or keyup providing a bubble menu which provides options and actions based on those selections .
In this example , there are a few more things going on with contextmenu that are new .
For instance , a menu must be defined , so that the contextmenu knows where to point .
In the example above , we are saying , when there is a mouse event ( depending on browser implementation ) , go out and find the menu " foo " in the DOM , and display its commands .
The syntax is relatively simple after that .
We have a menu label which will display the attribute text , and we have an onclick event which will do whatever we have defined .
The Catch - All : The data-* Attribute
When you add ambiguity to a specification , it tends to be misused , when there are better options available .
I have saved the most controversial global attribute for last .
I have mixed feelings with this new one .
On one hand , I am looking forward to the ability to connect my logic layer with my behavior layer without going through too many hoops , or using attributes and elements outside of their design specs .
On the other hand , I know that when you add ambiguity to a specification , it tends to be overused and misused when there are better options available .
What this attribute is , is a catch - all .
Basically , the specification is stating that we can not ever think of all of the use - cases for attributes , therefore we will leave you to your own to make them up .
The logic in me feels a specification should give us a set of rules to play with , and leave it at that , but the innovator in me loves having the power to define new attributes .
I just know from experience when there is a chance to do something not quite right , but easier , that path generally bites you in the behind .
All that said , let 's keep it positive and look at a couple of possible cases .
I think this attribute will be a wonderful addition for microformats , and might be the thing that puts them in the forefront of development .
I can also see some uses where on the backend , I want to provide some bread crumbs to my behaivor layer in JavaScript to close some gaps .
Another idea where you might use this attribute is to provide a location for where you are when you post an article .
That might look something like this :
I can now take those data-* attributes and do something via JavaScript or another API , such as post a map , from attributes from my application layer .
It ends up opening a ton of possibilities , but do n't forget the immortal words of Ben Parker : " With great power , comes great responsibility . "
Conclusion
Like most things in HTML5 at the moment , the browser support for these changes are spotty at best .
Some new attributes are supported .
some are incorrectly implemented , some have no support at all at the moment !
That said , they all appear to degrade nicely without much hoopla involved , so there is n't a compelling case to not begin experimenting and implementing .
The specification changes are slowing , so more than likely , what you see is what you will get ... at some point .

An 8 - year - old New Jersey boy , recalling an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants , saved his 5 - year - old neighbor this weekend by jumping into a lake and bringing the drowning boy to shore , the Daily Record reports .
Andrew Gentile , 5 , of Washington Township , says he can't remember much about the ordeal , except this : " I was drowning . "
Andrew 's mother , Shirley Gentile , tells the newspaper that she had thought the water was shallow at the edge of the lake , but it was in fact 6 - feet - deep there .
At first , she tried to save him , but panicked herself in the deep water .
That 's when 8 - year - old Reese showed up .
" I just saw and then I just knew how to react , I jumped in , " says Reese , who swam the short distance and grabbed Andrew , mimicking what he 'd learned on TV .
" The hardest part was when we both went under , getting us back up to the surface , " Reese tells the Record .
His elementary school has already held a Reese Ronceray Day and the local mayor is calling him a hero , but Shirley has a different description , the paper says .
She calls him " an angel . "

EUREKA project E! 3371 Gene Transfer Agents has made great advances in the development of novel non-viral carriers able to introduce genetic material into the target cells .
These new agents , derivatives of cationic amphiphilic 1,4 - dihydropyridine ( 1,4 - DHP ) , avoid the problems of the recipient 's immune system reacting against a viral carrier .
The project partners have developed methods to produce them in large amounts , which solves another of the problems with viral delivery .
But the greatest advantage is that the new compounds are significantly more effective at delivering DNA into cell nuclei than other standard synthetic carriers ; increasing the chance of the DNA successfully controlling the defective genes , and the disease .
Gene therapy involves the insertion of DNA into human cells within the body to treat disease .
The technique is still in its early days , and has been demonstrated successfully only in the last decade .
Most investigation has been into the possibilities for treating hereditary diseases related to a genetic defect , and the technique also has potential uses in treating the early stages of cancer , and in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases .
Gene therapy faces many difficulties as a practical method ; not the least of which is that DNA is a large and complicated structure which needs to be delivered and attached to the correct section of the recipient 's set of DNA .
A number of methods are in use or under investigation for introducing DNA into cells ( a process known as transfection ) -- using viruses , chemical agents or physical injection .
Viruses or chemical carriers
With viral carriers , the DNA to be introduced is injected into the virus , which carries it into the cell by way of a vesicle formed around the virus particle by the cell wall .
Once inside the cell , the vesicle breaks down and the virus injects the DNA into the cell 's nucleus .
The viral route does , however , have major disadvantages .
The immune system of the person receiving treatment often interferes with viral activity ; and viruses can have unpredictable mutagenic side - effects .
Also large - scale production of viral vectors is problematic .

A wide range of chemical agents are already known to be able to form a complex of 1,4 - DHP with DNA and deliver it into the recipient 's cells .
These agents are much easier to produce on a large scale than viruses and do not usually cause an immune response .
However they are not so effective at introducing the DNA as the viral carriers .
Seeking the best of both worlds
The challenge facing the partners in the EUREKA project was to combine the effectiveness of the viral vectors with the production advantages and lack of immune response shown by chemical agents .
Scientists at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis and the University of Kuopio in Finland had discovered new groups of possible DNA transfer agents : 1,4 - DHP derivatives .
These compounds were found to be more effective in gene transfer than two widely - used standard gene delivery agents ( known as DOTAP and PEI 25 ) and the discovery was covered by a patent .
This finding offered the exciting prospect of better efficiency from a non-viral carrier .
Professor Arto Urtti of Helsinki University ( formerly from Kuopio ) explains : " When these compounds are in solution and DNA is added , they bind together .
The large , loose DNA molecule collapses and tiny particles of about 10 - 50nm in diameter are formed , composed of both DNA and carrier .
When you present this to the cells , the nanoparticles bind to the cell surface , which folds inwards to form a vesicle within the cell .
The particles then escape from the vesicle , releasing the DNA .
Researchers at Helsinki University found that out of all the compounds tested , the most effective were those which succeeded in transferring DNA into the nucleus .
The mechanism by which the DNA enters the nucleus is not yet clearly understood , but it is known that gene transfer is more effective in cells which are actively dividing , e.g. cancer cells .
Dr Aiva Plotniece , Dr Arkadijs Sobolevs and their colleagues at the Latvian Institute then set out to synthesise dozens of different DHP derivative compounds .
Dr Plotniece comments :
" The great advantage of these compounds is the biologically active 1,4 - DHP fragment , which with proper substitution , can show certain biological and physico - chemical properties .
During the project we have designed different 1,4 - DHPs , which allowed us to establish structure - activity relationships . "
The third project partner , the independent Latvian chemical producer Bapeks , contributed its experience of larger - scale synthesis and advised the Latvian Institute researchers on how best to scale up the synthesis methodology .
The compounds were then distributed to a number of other research colleagues in Latvia , Finland and Lithuania for further study .
At present , project partners feel that the main uses will be in laboratory experiments , and much further research is needed before they can be used for gene transfer in the human body .
Partners in the EUREKA project believe that although more research is needed , the project has been very successful .
" It was the first big , important project for us " says Dr Sobolevs .
" We have significantly widened the potential uses of self - assembling 1,4 - dihydropyridine derivatives into nanomedicine , gene delivery and even into drug delivery systems . "
The project team found that EUREKA support helped greatly in preparing , managing and reporting the project .
It was also through EUREKA that the other partners were introduced to Bapeks .

David Cameron has said he will fly the flag of St George over No 10 during the football World Cup in South Africa .
The prime minister told MPs that the move would not cost anything and he hoped it would help unite the nation behind the England team .
He said he hoped that no matter what part of the UK MPs represented , they would be shouting " come on England " .
Mr Cameron wished the team and manager well ahead of their first match , which is against the US on Saturday .
Meanwhile , Local Government Minister Grant Shapps has written to all council chiefs in England telling them to take a " common - sense approach " over any potential health and safety fears caused by people flying the flag of St George during the tournament .
As the residence of the prime minister of the United Kingdom , the union jack is normally flown above No 10 .
Rallying call
But at his second weekly session of prime minister 's questions , Mr Cameron was asked by Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi whether he would hoist the English flag instead during the tournament , for which none of the other home nations qualified .
" There was some question that this was going to have a cost impact but I have managed to cut through that and I can say , at no additional cost to the taxpayer , the flag of St George will fly above Downing Street during the World Cup , " the prime minister replied .
" For the purposes of this , I am looking at all the benches here and I am sure that everyone in this House , no matter what part of the United Kingdom they come from , will be cheering ' Come on England ' . "
The World Cup is an important opportunity for councils to do their bit in helping reclaim the English flag as a proud symbol of our nation 's identity Grant Shapps , Local Government Minister
Mr Cameron did not say whether the flag would remain aloft for the entire competition or whether it would come down should England be eliminated before the final on Sunday 11 July .
The prime minister 's official spokesman later confirmed that the England flag would fly over Downing Street from this Saturday morning , ahead of the Trooping of Colour ceremony , and would also fly over the Department of Culture , Media and Sport .
He said it would be up to individual secretaries of state to decide whether they also wanted to do this at their departments but if they did , they would need a separate flag pole as they had to continue flying the union jack too .
' Community cohesion '
In his letter to local authority leaders and chief executives , Mr Shapps said the World Cup was a " great opportunity to foster community cohesion " .
He said he understood a risk - based approach to health and safety was important , but urged local authorities to work " to avoid accusations of being over - zealous or spoilsports " .
He added : " Some extremist groups have in the past tried to lay claim to the Cross of St George .
" The World Cup is an important opportunity for councils to do their bit in helping reclaim the English flag as a proud symbol of our nation 's identity and encourage local communities of all backgrounds to pull together in support of our national team . "
Once in a blue moon , the political stars align in such a way as to give the federal NDP a bit of an edge over their Liberal rivals .
It is not a frequent occurrence .
The last time it happened was in the lead - up to the 1988 free trade election , more than two decades ago .
For a period of months , then - NDP leader Ed Broadbent looked like a prime - minister - in - waiting .
Twenty - two years later , Jack Layton is on the way to matching Broadbent ’s feat .
His popularity far surpasses that of the NDP .
He also towers over Liberal rival Michael Ignatieff in the public opinion polls .
According to a just released Angus Reid poll , an Ignatieff - led Liberal - NDP coalition would lose the next election to the Conservatives while a Layton - led one could secure a majority .
Those are highly hypothetical numbers .
But they do reflect a trend .
And they suggest that Ignatieff ’s strategists are wrong to believe that a coalition with the NDP would trigger an exodus of Liberal supporters to the Conservatives but that they are right to suspect that he lacks the moral authority to take the lead of such a maneuver .
If the past is any indication , all of this is excellent news ... for Stephen Harper and the Conservatives .
In the late eighties , Broadbent ’s surging popularity gave the NDP ’s pipe dream of entering the major leagues at the expense of the Liberals a big shot of momentum .
The two parties spent the 1988 campaign competing for the anti-free trade vote .
Their divisions facilitated the second Mulroney majority and helped usher in a fundamental change in Canada ’s interaction with the United States .
But while the NDP came out of the 1988 vote with more seats than it had ever had , its score still left the party well short of second place .
With Broadbent gone in retirement five years later , those gains were wiped out .
In 1993 the NDP did not even win back the dozen seats required to be officially recognized in the House of Commons .
It took more than a decade for the party to recover .
Now , it seems that all is in place for a Liberal - NDP rematch along the 1988 battle lines .
On the heels of a stinging defeat in the last election , the Liberals are on the defensive from coast to coast to coast and going nowhere fast in Quebec and in most of Western Canada ,
Like then - Liberal leader John Turner , Ignatieff is increasingly seen as a weak leader .
To all intents and purposes , his party is stalled in voting intentions .
But then so is the NDP .
Despite the uncertain Liberal performance , the party can’t break through a 20 percent glass ceiling nationally .
In Quebec , a stand - alone NDP scores just below Harper ’s unpopular Conservatives .
In Ontario , it runs a distant third .
NDP strategists have apparently concluded that it is time to move in for the kill against a weakened Liberal party .
Last weekend , Layton dared Ignatieff to try to force the government to split the budget bill before it is allowed to pass and Harper ’s minority regime is allowed to survive .
To position the NDP as the only effective national opposition vehicle to the Conservatives , Layton is drawing new , deeper lines in the Liberal / NDP sand .

As in 1988 , the next federal campaign and the potential advent of a Conservative majority could be a watershed for the country .
On this , the NDP and the Liberals are in agreement .
But as in the days of the free trade debate it does seem it is all they will agree on between now and the next campaign .
Broadbent ’s 1988 campaign was both his finest and his most counter - productive hour .
A remake is now in the works .

The defending NBA champions beat the third - seeded Suns at their own uptempo game when necessary , fluidly running the court to set up baskets for Bryant in his sixth straight 30 - point game .
Bryant then rested for most of the fourth quarter in the 11th 40 - point game of his playoff career .
" They played great , one of the best games I 've seen them play in the playoffs this season , " Suns coach Alvin Gentry said .
" Kobe kind of controlled the whole game .
I thought we could have withstood the game that he had ... but when he 's making his jumper like that , there 's not a whole lot you can do about it . "
Game 2 is Wednesday night at Staples Center .
Amare Stoudemire scored 23 points and Steve Nash had 13 points and 13 assists for the Suns , who had n't lost since April 24 .
Robin Lopez started at center and scored 14 points in his playoff debut , but Phoenix could n't keep up with the champs ' height and 58 - percent shooting in the Suns ' first conference finals appearance since 2006 .
Los Angeles committed just nine turnovers in Game 1 -- its third straight single - digit turnover game -- while outrebounding the smaller Suns 42 - 34 .
" They 're probably going to continue to be taller than us as the series goes on , so we 've got to ... make everything as tough as possible , " said Nash , whose injured eye did n't bother him .
" We played hard , but we did n't make enough shots , and we had a few too many breakdowns . "
Both teams swept their second - round series to earn their third postseason date in five years , but the Lakers did n't allow a week off to affect their remarkable execution .
They scored easily and often , even with center Andrew Bynum managing just four points while playing shakily on his own sore knee .
After a 62 - point first half for the Lakers , Bryant alternated jumpers and strong drives while Los Angeles pulled away , making a 13 - 2 run in the third quarter .
His 13 - for - 23 shooting performance included three 3 - pointers and 11 free throws with just one miss .
" Kobe carried a lot of the offense tonight , no doubt , " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said .
" I will say he was going to shoulder the game .
He was going to take it on .
He 's been very optimistic through the whole week .
He felt like he had the amount of rest and shooting he had to have .
He was attentive and involved [ in practice ] . "
The Suns sent Bryant , Odom and the Lakers home for the summer in 2006 and 2007 , and Los Angeles ' veterans acknowledged a measure of revenge in their minds -- as long as they 're healthy enough to do it .
Jackson revealed before the game that Bryant 's right knee was drained " a while ago , " moving it to the top of the injury list for last season 's NBA finals MVP .
But Bryant showed no ill effects , and he even bounced back up after hitting his head on Richardson 's knee during a drive in the first quarter .
" He 's the best scorer in the league , " said Odom , who set a career playoff high for rebounds in his most assertive game of the current postseason .
" Drives , fadeaways with his back to the basket , inside - outside , with his left hand .
Time off is exactly what he needed . "
Game notes
Bryant last scored 40 points in the postseason during the opener of last year 's NBA finals against Orlando .
... Lakers G Sasha Vujacic appeared in his first game of the postseason after missing the first two rounds with a sprained ankle .
... Bryant and Grant Hill got technical fouls for arguing with officials 57 seconds apart in the third quarter .

See kids ?
The things you say online when you 're a teenager can come back to haunt you .
And if you do it on Facebook , well , you 're really f*****.
Couple that with various other statements the now - slightly - older billionaire - on - paper has made that privacy is something he and his generation do n't give a damn about , and it's no mystery how they got into this mess .
Yesterday , after weeks of getting hammered in the media and called on the carpet by legislators , Facebook finally circled the wagons and called an all - hands meeting to discuss its privacy problem .
I 'm sure they held hands , sang Kumbaya , and wondered why everyone else hates freedom so much .
If Wikipedia can be believed , today is Zuckerberg 's 26th birthday .
So in addition to a faux " birthday cake " ( $ 1 at the Facebook virtual gift shop ) I 'm offering Zucky some advice as a gift .
1 . Pull your head out and deal with this
When the backlash about Google Buzz began ( from the media , primarily ) , the Googleheads responded instantly .
They did backflips apologizing and rolled out changes within 48 hours .
And more changes after that .
And still more after that .
They got the message loud and clear they 'd screwed up .
Facebook ?
Not so much .
It 's still not clear Facebook gets it .
In both cases , these large advertising - driven companies made the self - serving assumption their users would rather share their data with the world by default .
Remember that old management cliche about how it 's better to ask forgiveness than permission ?
That does n't apply here .
With user privacy , it 's always better to ask permission and , if you hear nothing back , assume you do n't have it .
That will , of course , slash your participation rates -- too bad .
You want my information , you need to make it worth my while , which brings me to point number two .
2 . Tell me what 's in it for me
I get why buttering my information across the InterWebs benefits Facebook .
I do n't understand what I 'm supposed to get out of it .
What 's the benefit to me exactly ?
Now I can log onto Pandora and it knows what music I like ?
Pandora already knows what music I like .
So now I can go on Yelp and see what my friends recommend ?
I can already do that on Yelp ( or I could , if I ever used Yelp , which I do n't ) .
If there is some tangible reason why I 'd want to opt in ( yes , not out ) to this data sharing , Facebook needs to make it a lot more compelling .
Have n't seen it yet .

This year , I wrote a series about public sexual assaults in the District , and how victims respond to them .
I separated typical victim responses into four categories : freezing , talking back , fighting back , and reporting to police .
As of Saturday evening , Miss District of Columbia 2009 Jennifer Corey officially falls in to the exacting physical pain category : According to the Washington Examiner , the District beauty queen winner was slapped in the butt by a group of “ spoiled rich preppy kids who think that they are better than you because their dad makes a lot of money . ”
They were out in Georgetown , if you can imagine .
After the third assault , “ I just had so much rage against him . . . that I slammed him up against the wall , ” Corey said .
“ [ T ] here is no reason for a girl to have to worry about being slapped . . . or touched when we go out . ”

Image caption WikiLeaks has established a reputation for publishing sensitive materials Hacker reports ' Wikileaks source ' US intelligence analyst arrested
Whistle - blowing website Wikileaks has said that the detention of an alleged confidential source by the US military does not compromise its work .
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told BBC
News that other potential whistle - blowers should not be put off from sending material to the site .
The US has detained US military analyst Bradley Manning on suspicion of leaking classified material to the site .
Mr Assange would not confirm whether Mr Manning was a source .
" We endeavour to protect our sources , " he told BBC News .
" We do not know if Mr Manning is a source , but we understand there are allegations that are being taken seriously so we are naturally inclined to try to defend [ him ] . "
The US army in Iraq has said that Specialist ( Spc ) Manning was in Kuwait and had been " placed in pre-trial confinement for allegedly releasing classified information " .
One video reportedly posted to the site by Mr Manning shows a US Apache helicopter killing up to 12 people - including two Reuters journalists - during an attack in Baghdad in 2007 .
Two children were also seriously injured in the assault on the group , which contained some armed men .
' Sacred oath '
Mr Manning 's identity was reportedly revealed to the US authorities by a former high - profile hacker , Adrian Lamo , whom Mr Manning had contacted via e-mail and instant messenger .
During the course of their conversations , Mr Lamo told BBC News , Mr Manning boasted about handing over military videos and 260,000 classified US embassy messages to Wikileaks .
" At the moment he gave me the information , it was basically a suicide pact , " Mr Lamo said .
He handed his name to US authorities because of concerns over US national security and because he did not want to be found to have been " obstructing justice " in the course of any investigation .
" I did n't want any more FBI agents knocking at the door , " he said .
Mr Lamo has previously been convicted for hacking into the New York Times , Yahoo and Microsoft .
He now works as a journalist and security analyst .
But Mr Assange questioned Mr Lamo 's motives and credibility .
" He has broken the most sacred oath of journalism , which is confidentiality of sources . "
Mr Assange also said that some of his account did not ring true .
" We do not recognise a number of the claims made by Adrian Lamo as to what Mr Manning allegedly related to him - they cannot be factually correct . "
In particular , Mr Assange said that Wikileaks has no knowledge of the 260,000 confidential messages that Mr Lamo said Mr Manning claimed to have uploaded to the site .
However , as Wikileaks never divulges its sources , confirming the existence of the documents could implicate Mr Manning .
Assuming that the allegations against Mr Manning are true , we have taken steps to arrange for his protection and legal defence Julian Assange , Wikileaks
In response , Mr Lamo said he understood why Mr Assange would not concede to handling sensitive government data .
" I would n't admit to having them either , " he said .
He also said that he was not approached by Mr Manning as a journalist .
" I was a private citizen in a private capacity - there was no source , journalist relationship , " he told BBC News .
" I did tell him that I worked as a journalist .
I would have been happy to write about him myself , but we just decided that it would be too unethical . "
The story of Mr Manning 's arrest was first reported on wired.com by Mr Lamo 's long - term associate Kevin Poulsen , also a former hacker and now a journalist .
' National threat '
Wikileaks has established a reputation for publishing leaked material since its first appearance on the web in 2006 .
In November 2009 , it published what it said were 573,000 intercepted pager messages sent during the 9/11 attacks in the United States .
Image caption
The messages were said to have been sent on 11 September 2001 Profile : Who are Wikileaks ?
Website publishes ' 9/11 messages '
Previously it had posted a list of names and addresses of people said to belong to the British National Party ( BNP ) and a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta , a document that detailed restrictions placed on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
Earlier this year , the website published a 2008 Pentagon report that said the site was considered a " threat to the US army " .
The document says that " the possibility that current employees or moles within [ the Department of Defence ] or elsewhere in the US government are providing sensitive or classified information to Wikileaks.org cannot be ruled out " .
It goes on to say that the " identification , exposure , termination of employment , criminal prosecution , legal action against current or former insiders , leakers , or whistleblowers could potentially … deter others considering similar actions from using [ Wikileaks ] " .
The US government later confirmed to the BBC that the documents were genuine .
' Protect sources '
When the Pentagon document was leaked , the site stated that none of its sources had ever knowingly been exposed .
Now , Mr Assange said that Mr Manning 's case should not put people off from contributing to the site .
" We have deliberately structured our operation to protect our sources under threat of criminal law , " he said .
The site does not collect information about its sources and uses numerous web servers scattered around the world to host content .
Mr Assange said these were deliberately located in jurisdictions - such as Sweden - that could prosecute Wikileaks if it revealed a source .
It is currently advising the Icelandic government on efforts to increase legal protections for whistle - blowers in the country .
" We make it clear to [ sources ] that we will protect them . "
He said this would apply to Mr Manning .
" Assuming that the allegations against [ him ] are true , we have taken steps to arrange for his protection and legal defence . "
WASHINGTON -- Prodded by national anger at Wall Street , the Senate on Thursday passed the most far - reaching restraints on big banks since the Great Depression .
In its broad sweep , the massive bill would touch Wall Street CEOs and first - time homebuyers , high - flying traders and small town lenders .
The 59 -39 vote represents an important achievement for President Barack Obama , and comes just two months after his health care overhaul became law .
The bill must now be reconciled with a House version that passed in December .
A key House negotiator predicted the legislation would reach Obama 's desk before the Fourth of July .
The legislation aims to prevent a recurrence of the near - meltdown of big Wall Street investment banks and the resulting costly bailouts .
It calls for new ways to watch for risks in the financial system and makes it easier to liquidate large failing financial firms .
It also writes new rules for complex securities blamed for helping precipitate the 2008 economic crisis , and it creates a new consumer protection agency .
It would impose new restraints on the largest , most interconnected banks and demand proof that borrowers could pay for the simplest of mortgages .
" Our goal is not to punish the banks but to protect the larger economy and the American people from the kind of upheavals that we 've seen in the past few years , " Obama said earlier Thursday after the Senate cleared a key 60 - vote hurdle blocking final action .
The financial industry , Obama said , had tried to stop the new regulations " with hordes of lobbyists and millions of dollars in ads . "
Only two Democrats , Sens. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , voted against the bill .
Feingold said it did not go far enough to rein in Wall Street and end a culture of " too big to fail . "
Four Republicans -- Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa , Scott Brown of Massachusetts , and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine -- broke ranks with their party to support it .
Twice the Senate had to beat back efforts by Republicans to delay the bill before achieving final passage .
" The decisions we 've made will have an impact on the lives of Americans for decades to come , " said Sen.
Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , who voted against the legislation .
" Judgment will not be rendered by self - congratulatory press releases , but , rather , by the marketplace .
And the marketplace does not give credit for good intentions . "
While Republicans succeeded in amending the bill , they still objected to its sweep , claiming it represented an expansion of government power that would have unintended consequences .
Democrats argued it was a potent response to the financial abuses , regulatory weaknesses and consumer misjudgments that plunged the nation deep into recession .
" To Wall Street , it says :
No longer can you recklessly gamble away other people 's money , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
" It says the days of too big to fail are behind us .
It says to those who game the system :
The game is over . "
As House and Senate negotiators meet to work out differences in the bills , the common ground between the two bills will likely tilt toward making the bill tougher on banks rather than weaker .
If anything , the political environment has grown more populist since the House passed its bill in December .
Unemployment still hovers around 10 percent , big banks have declared significant if not record profits , and Goldman Sachs is fighting off accusations of fraud from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The end game was not without drama .
Cantwell changed her vote to help move the bill along only to vote against it on final passage .
Republicans , meanwhile , abandoned a highly lobbied measure that would have excluded auto dealers from rules devised by a new consumer financial protection bureau .
The GOP move was tactical , designed to deny Democrats a vote on a measure that would have placed explicit restrictions on the ability of commercial banks to engage in high - risk , profit - making trades and impose conflict of interest rules on how investment banks market products to their clients .
Republicans will now seek a nonbinding vote on Monday to instruct House and Senate negotiators to exclude auto dealers from consumer regulations in the final bill .
The House version already carves the dealers out of consumer agency oversight .
The bill 's passage represented a triumph for Sen.
Chris Dodd , the Connecticut Democrat who is retiring rather than face possible defeat in a re-election bid .
For months , Dodd , the Banking Committee chairman , tried to forge a bipartisan agreement with Republicans .
Wary Obama officials and Democrats urged him not to give too much .
In the end , the talks failed .
Consumer advocates , who had pressed the Senate for even more regulations , nevertheless cheered the Senate vote and hailed the bill as a tougher companion to the House version .
For all its breadth , the bill stopped short of taking on the nation 's giant mortgage companies , the government - affiliated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Democrats feared that incorporating massive housing policy into the bill would have sunk it .
The two companies lowered their standards for borrowers during the housing boom and now those high - risk loans are defaulting at a record pace , prompting a $ 145 billion government rescue .
" Perhaps what is most disappointing about the lack of attention to Fannie and Freddie is the fact that there is no end in sight , " Shelby said .
" Losses continue to mount and taxpayer exposure is unlimited . "
The Federal Reserve , once the object of scorn for failing to see the housing bubble , emerged fairly unscathed .
It retained supervision over bank holding companies and state - chartered banks and would also oversee any large interconnected nonbank financial firm deemed a potential risk to the financial system .
That addition , also in the House bill , aimed to prevent a company such as insurance conglomerate AIG from escaping tough regulation .
In a response to a public outcry over bank bonuses and multimillion - dollar compensation packages , the legislation also gives shareholders the right to cast nonbinding votes on executive pay packages .
The Fed would set standards on excessive compensation that would be deemed an unsafe and unsound practice for the bank .
Martin Wolf :
Why it is right for central banks to keep printing : Confronted with huge fiscal deficits , many have concluded that they should hurry fiscal tightening on as fast as possible , in the hope that it will prove expansionary .
What are the chances that they will be right ?
Small , I believe .... [ A ] las , many “ sound ” people prefer orthodox recessions to unorthodox recoveries .
Why might a sharp structural fiscal tightening promote recovery ?... [ S ] maller prospective deficits may improve confidence among consumers and investors , thereby raising consumption and lowering risk - premia in interest rates ....
Is it persuasive ?
In a word : no .
The authors group together data for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development between 1970 and 2007 .
But the impact of fiscal tightening is going to depend on circumstances .
A reduction in the fiscal deficit must be offset by shifts in the private and foreign balances .
If fiscal contraction is to be expansionary , net exports must increase and private spending must rise , or private savings [ must ] fall .
Thus , experience of fiscal contraction is going to be very different when it occurs in a few small countries ... when the financial sector is in good health ... when the private sector is unindebted ... when interest rates are high ... when external demand is buoyant ... and when real exchange rates depreciate sharply ....
Yet another approach is to find a situation that is indeed quite like today’s .
The closest parallel is the 1930s ... [ when ] fiscal stimulus was effective when tried ....
In current circumstances , the belief that a concerted fiscal tightening across the developed world would prove expansionary is , to put it mildly , optimistic .
At this stage , I will inevitably be asked : what is the alternative ?....
[ T ]he deleveraging cycle is generating huge private sector financial surpluses ....
[ T ] hese surpluses must now to be invested in government liabilities .
This helps explain why yields on the bonds of safer governments remain so low ....
[ I ] f governments need to run deficits , to support demand at a time of private sector weakness , they can always borrow from central banks .
Yes , this is “ printing money ” .
It is also an insanely radical policy recommended by no less insane a radical than Milton Friedman , back in 1948 ....
[ O ] ne does not have to decide whether fiscal policy or monetary policy is doing the heavy lifting : they are two sides of one coin .
The argument for aggressive monetary expansion remains strong ... since the growth of broad money and nominal GDP is weak .
So Friedman ’s policy of “ quantitative easing ” , as it is called , still makes good sense .
Am I recommending the economics of Robert Mugabe ?
No .
As in everything else , it is the context that matters .
At present , we have “ too little money chasing too many goods ” .
In this environment , monetary policy must be aggressive ....
The conventional wisdom is that a strong and co-ordinated structural fiscal contraction , focused on spending , will promote the growth of a thousand private blooms .
I hope this will prove true .
But I doubt it ...
That fiscal contraction is expansionary when it is part of a package including substantial real exchange rate depreciation and substantail interest rate reductions by the central banks is something I have believed ever since I first started thinking about these issues .
I was printing up color graphs to support that argument back in December 1992 so that Summers , Reich , Blinder , and Altman could make that argument to President - Elect Clinton .
But the world 's exchange rate cannot depreciate against itself right now .
North Atlantic ce ntral banks ( Britain 's aside ) have no room to reduce the interest rates they control .
The only argument left is that fiscal contraction will shrink risk premia and boost private - sector confidence -- but no fiscal contraction now will solve the long - term financing problems of the North Atlantic social insurance states .
If the alternative to stimulative fiscal policy accompanied by Friedmanite quantitative easing now were a policy that moved the North Atlantic governments into Auerbach - Kotlikoff intergenerational balance , I would say that they might have an argument .
But it is n't .
A Keynesian economist would say that demand is way low -- and that the government needs to boost it .
A monetarist economist would say that spending is way low -- and so the government can either boost velocity by boosting the opportunity cost of holding money ( which is most easily done by printing more government bonds -- running bigger deficits ) or boost the money stock by printing money .
A market - oriented economist would say that U.S. Treasury ( and German government , and Japanese government bonds ) right now are extraordinarily valuable assets -- and thus that the way to maximize economic value is to print more of them , i.e. run bigger government deficits .
The only response I hear is that the market lacks confidence .
But the market does n't lack confidence in the government .
THe market lacks confidence in the private sector -- it lacks confidence that unemployment will be low and capacity utilization high enough for private businesses to make the operating profits needed to service their debt , and that the financial system is well - enough capitalized that those operating profits will flow through to newly - issued financial instruments rather than being diverted to cover unrecognized but very real past losses .
I could understand : " we need to shrink risk premia by having the government guarantee new bond issues . "
I cannot understand : " we need to shrink risk premia by raising taxes and cutting spending for the fiscal year that starts in July . "
I could understand losing the argument if consumer price inflation was rising , if expectations of inflation in the Treasury - TIPS spreads were rising , if real interest rates on long U.S.
Treasury bonds were rising , if there were any signs at all that we were moving from the green zone to the yellow zone as far as the U.S.
Treasury bond 's status as safe asset in the world economy were concerned .
But we are not doing that .
As Alan Greenspan just wrote :
An urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers .
If so , it is none too soon .
Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading .
Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months — to $ 8.6 trillion from $ 5.5 trillion — inflation and long - term interest rates , the typical symptoms of fiscal excess , have remained remarkably subdued .
This is regrettable ...
That the U.S. -- in spite of the Reagan deficits , in spite of the Bush 41 deficits , in spite of the Bush 43 deficits -- still has room to borrow to deal with national emergencies likes wars and depressions is not regrettable .
It is gratifying .
The hope is that this is all just Dingbut Kabuki : that the U.S. government will continue the ARRA rather than letting it die off and expire , and will find some way to compensate for the next round of state and local fiscal contraction , and that the Europeans will talk a lot but do nothing to send their economies deeper into recession .
But I fear that it is not .
Somehow we seem to have lost the argument -- within the ECB , within the French and the European governments , within the British Liberal Party , within the Bank of England , within the Federal Reserve , with U.S. Senator number 60 , and even within the White House .
And I do not understand how , or why we have lost the argument .

Did you know that the ice cream sandwich was invented in the early 1900s , as a sanitary solution for serving ice cream on hot summer days ?
Well , times have changed since then — society and freezers have both evolved , and instead of sandwiching our ice cream between cookie wafers , we now have the ability to serve it between layers of another modern marvel , the Pop - Tart .
I had high hopes when I discovered this treasure of an idea on the official Pop - Tart site — and happily , these sweet treats lived up to every single one .
They managed to meld nostalgia and delicious , rich flavor all in one sweet summery treat .
I composed mine in two flavors : Strawberry frosted Pop - Tarts with strawberry ice cream , and S'mores Pop - Tarts sandwiched with decadent Rocky Road ice cream .
But let 's be honest , the flavor variations are virtually endless .

Government Workers Tasked With Gulf Oil Industry Oversight Accepted Gifts
Some of these same staffers were tasked with inspections of offshore drilling platforms located in the Gulf of Mexico , states the report on ethical lapses at the MMS between 2000 and 2008 written by Acting Inspector General Mary Kendall .
Interior Dept. Acting Inspector General Mary Kendall ( Photo courtesy DOI )
Several of the people mentioned in the Inspector General 's report have resigned , been terminated , or referred for prosecution .
Those mentioned in the Inspector General 's report for questionable behavior who are still with MMS will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a personnel review , said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar .
" The Inspector General report describes reprehensible activities of employees of MMS between 2000 and 2008 , " said Secretary Salazar .
" This deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry . "
" That is why during the first 10 days of becoming Secretary of the Interior I directed a strong ethics reform agenda to clean house of these ethical lapses at MMS , " Salazar said .
" I appreciate and fully support the Inspector General 's strong work to root out the bad apples in MMS and we will follow through on her recommendations , including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination , discipline , and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution , " he said .
" In addition , " Salazar said , " I have asked the Inspector General to expand her investigation to determine whether any of this reprehensible behavior persisted after the new ethics rules I implemented in 2009 . "

Salazar has also asked the Inspector General to investigate whether there was a failure of MMS personnel to adequately enforce standards or inspect the Deepwater Horizon offshore facility and look into whether there are deficiencies in MMS policies or practices that need to be addressed to ensure that operations on the Outer Continental Shelf are conducted in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner .
Meanwhile , the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , which represents government workers in natural resource agencies questions whether anyone in a responsible capacity even read BP 's official response plan for oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico .
The plan is " studded with patently inaccurate and inapplicable information but was nonetheless approved by the federal government , " PEER said today , suggesting that no regulator ever read it .
The " BP Regional Oil Spill Response Plan - Gulf of Mexico " dated June 30 , 2009 covers all of the company 's operations in the Gulf , not just the ill - fated Deepwater Horizon , which exploded and caught fire April 20 and sank two days later , leaving the well it had been drilling open and gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico .

The plan lists " Sea Lions , Seals , Sea Otters " and " Walruses " and " Otter , Beaver " and " Mink " as " Sensitive Biological Resources " in the Gulf of Mexico .
While none of these animals live in the gulf , they do live in the Arctic , so PEER suggests that this portion of the BP plan was " cribbed from previous Arctic exploratory planning . "
In fact , according to Louisiana 's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries 600 animal species are at risk from the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill - 445 species of fish , 45 mammals , 32 reptiles and amphibians , and 134 bird species .
BP 's oil spill response plan gives a website for a Japanese home shopping site as the link to one of its " primary equipment providers for BP in the Gulf of Mexico Region rapid deployment of spill response resources on a 24 hour , seven days a week basis . "
The BP plan directs its media spokespeople not to make " promises that property , ecology , or anything else will be restored to normal . "
The plan does not contain information about tracking sub - surface oil plumes from deepwater blowouts .
It lacks any oceanographic or meteorological information , despite the relevance of this data to spill response .
" This response plan is not worth the paper it is written on , " said PEER Board Member Rick Steiner , a former University of Alaska marine professor and conservationist who tracked the Exxon Valdez spill .
In 2009 , Steiner lost a $ 10,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for being an outspoken critic of the oil industry 's activities in the Bristol Bay region .
Steiner filed a grievance and , in October , lost .
He then resigned from the university .

Steiner observes that the BP plan is almost 600 pages largely consisting of lists , phone numbers and blank forms .
" Incredibly , this voluminous document never once discusses how to stop a deep water blowout even though BP has significant deep water operations in the Gulf , " he said .
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke Monday declared a " fishery disaster " in the Gulf of Mexico as oil continues to leak from the wellhead .
Political anger is rising over consequences of the oil spill .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal calls the response effort " disjointed " and says Deepwater Horizon oil is damaging his state while he pleads for the resources to fight it .
" Yesterday , we went out on a boat to Cat Island in Plaquemines Parish and we saw islands covered in oil where our brown pelicans nest .
Many of the birds we could see were oiled , some to the point where they could not fly , " governor Jindal said .
" The brown pelican , of course , is our Louisiana state bird - and it was just recently removed from the Endangered Species List .
The oil on those islands yesterday may kill off much of the island in addition to damaging the bird population . "
" Just a few days ago , we took a boat out to Pass a L'Outre and saw thick black and brown colored oil covering much of the perimeter of the marsh out there .
Again , wildlife experts tell us this marsh may die in five to seven days after the oil hits it . "
" It is clear that the resources needed to protect our coast are not here , " Governor Jindal said .
" Boom , skimmers , vacuums , and jack up barges are all in short supply .
Every day oil sits and waits for clean up more of our marsh dies . "
As I mentioned to Tom and other friends , there are two basic styles for Okonomiyaki : Hiroshima - style and Osaka - style .
Here is a basic recipe for the Hiroshima - style Okonomiyaki :
( Note that I have written this recipe step by step .
Copy it for better reference as I skipped the usual Ingredients introduction )
First make a batter .
In Hiroshima , they mix flour with grated taro tuber mixed with bonito or seaweed stock .
If you cannot find the latter , just mix an equal amount of flour and lukewarm water and add a little salt .
Heat a hot plate well .
Pour some oil ( in Hiroshima they use leek - scented oil ) .
Make a pancake as shown on picTure .
Add shredded cabbage and beansprouts / moyashi .
You can use any herb / leaf vegetable instead of beansprouts but cabbage is a must .
Quantity is up to you .
The more vegetables you add , the more skill you need for flipping over later .
Sprinkle with some ground black pepper .
In Hiroshima , adding “ tororokonbu / type of dried seaweed is popular .
If you ca n’t find it just skip !
Add pork / bacon rahers .
Keep in mind that their length should be less than the the diameter of the pancake .
With a large metal spatula ( or two small ones as in Japan ) , flip over the whole onto the hot plate .
No hesitation here !
Close your eyes if necessary ( LOL ) but do it as fast and smoothly as possible !
Tuck anything that comes out back under the pancake .
On another part of the hot plate drop some noodles .
Keep in mind that some noodles have to be lightly boiled beforehand .
Preferably use ready - bolied noodles .
You can use yakisoba - style noodles .
This is one step where you may use an ingredient of your choice according to avaibility !
Fry the noodles for a while .
Form a disc with them about the same size as the pancake .
Place the pancake , cabbage , moyashi and bacon on top of the noodles .
This is not as difficult as it sounds as the bacon will give a solid base to slide the spatula under .
If the Japanese can do it , you can do it !
( LOL )
Havimg tucked everything under the pancake again , press on top for a while ( press hard ) with the spatula to help cook all ingredients .
Besides the okonomiyaki , break an egg , spread it into a circle and fry according to taste ( break the yolk ! ) .
Do n’t overcook the egg !
Slide the okonomiyaki on top of the egg .
The noodles should have a solid crispy surface by now , making the operation easy .
Immediately after , flip the whole over so as to have the pancake at the bottom and the egg on top .
Turn the heat down to lo or slide the okonomiyaki onto a cooler part of the plate .
Place plenty of finely chopped leeks on top of it all .
Prepare the okonomiyaki sauce .
You might obtain it ready - made at specialized stores .
As for myself , I prefer to concoct it myself : Worcester sauce + bulldog sauce + hot mustard + ketchup and pepper .
Make it beforehand as you might need to experiment !
Pour sauce on top .
add mayonnaise , dry seaweed powder , tempura crumbs , whatever you fancy !
Enjoy with plenty of beer !
Osaka - style okonomiyaki coming soon !

Here ’s a great video from Tom Wujec about the Marshmallow Challenge ; a team exercise to build a simple structure from pieces of dried spaghetti and a marshmallow .
When he tried this game out on many different groups , he found some of the worst performers were Business School graduates and some of the best were Kindergarten children .
Why ?
Because the Business School grads were trained to look for the one right plan to follow and then implement it ( which often failed at the last moment when the structure collapsed ) .
Children , in comparison , just play ; they try things out and experiment and work iteratively to find the solution .
Tom ’s conclusion is that “ Design truly is a contact sport .
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing . ”
When you ’re designing your irresistible offer at the heart of your business , who would you rather model ?
The business grads or the kids ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Allen Stanford , the Texas financier charged with running a $ 7 billion Ponzi scheme , asked the federal judge overseeing his case to release him pending the start of his criminal trial , saying that his detention violated his constitutional rights .

Stanford has also fired one of his lawyers , setting up a potential showdown with U.S. District Judge David Hittner , who said last month he would not allow a fifth change to the defense team .
In a filing on Tuesday with the federal court in Houston , lawyers for Stanford said their client had been “ subjected to substantial and undeniable punishment , ” including nearly a year of incarceration and both physical and psychological damage .
This and the prospect of more than a year of further custody until and during his trial , which is scheduled to start in January 2011 , violates his constitutional rights to due process , effective assistance of counsel , a speedy trial , and an absence of excessive bail , the lawyers said .
“ When Mr. Stanford surrendered to authorities , he was a healthy 59 - year - old man , ” Stanford ’s Houston - based lawyer , Robert Bennett , wrote in a brief on which Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz consulted .
“ Mr. Stanford ’s pretrial incarceration has reduced him to a wreck of a man : he has suffered potentially life - impairing illnesses ; he has been so savagely beaten that he has lost all feeling in the right side of his face and has lost near - field vision in his right eye , ” Bennett said .
Saying their client had neither the motive to flee nor the means , having been declared “ indigent ” by court , Stanford ’s lawyers urged that he be placed under house arrest at the home of his fiancee ’s sister , with an ankle bracelet and other travel restrictions .
The office of U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno in Houston did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
A federal appeals court has twice rejected Stanford ’s attempts to be freed from jail pending trial , and Hittner has called Stanford a flight risk .
Stanford has been held in a Texas jail since his June 2009 arrest .
In a 21 - count indictment , prosecutors accused him of selling fraudulent certificates of deposit issued by his bank in Antigua .
IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES
Separately , one of Stanford ’s lawyers , Michael Essmyer , has asked the court for permission to withdraw from the case .
Essmyer , the managing partner at Essmyer , Tritico & Rainey LLP , cited Stanford ’s decision to fire him on May 14 , and “ irreconcilable differences ” with Bennett over litigation strategy and other matters .
“ The nature of the irreconcilable differences is also the fact that Mr. Bennett acts independently without lead counsel ’s knowledge or consent , and often in a manner that , in lead counsel ’s opinion , is detrimental to the best interests of the client , ” Essmyer wrote .
He said he and his law firm “ do not want to be held responsible for the actions of Mr. Bennett . ”
Essmyer declined to make additional comments .
Bennett did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
At a hearing on April 6 , Hittner raised his voice several times as Stanford refused to directly answer questions about his legal representation .
The judge nonetheless agreed to let Stanford to replace his latest two lead lawyers .
“ You ’ve had 10 attorneys attempt to enter this case on your behalf , ” Hittner said .
“ I will not entertain any further substitutions . ”
A case manager for Hittner said the judge would consider Essmyer ’s request at a hearing to be scheduled .
The case is U.S. v. Stanford , U.S. District Court , Southern District of Texas , No 09 - cr-00342 .
Much of reproductive rights activism is squarely centred on the right to have access to birth control and abortion .
But while this remains an important factor in securing women 's rights , the right to become a mother is a paramount issue to millions of women across the globe .
The pro-life movement continues to suggest that women are " killing babies " but ignores the millions of women who have been prevented from ever carrying a child : the right to motherhood is the other side of the reproductive coin , which does not receive enough attention .
Times
Online recently featured an article discussing forced sterilisation in China to enforce the one - child rule .
The article states that in Puning , a county in Guangdong province , the government is imprisoning relatives of people who have broken the one - child policy in an attempt to force them to submit to sterilisations ; the goal is to complete 9,559 sterilisations .
Similarly , a human rights group has recently alleged that Uzbekistan 's government had instructed health workers to surgically sterilise women as part of a campaign to reduce its birth rate .
But while the east is often singled out for its breaches on human rights ( and by doing so reifying a false east / west divide ) , forced sterilisation continues to be a real and present danger in the Americas .
The Movimiento Amplio de Mujeres Linea Fundacional has worked to raise awareness regarding the forced sterilisation that occurred in family planning centres in Latin America between 1995 and 2000 .
The Latin American and Caribbean Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Women found that health officials in Peru used threats , promises and bribes to convince campesinas to submit to these operations .
The BBC reports that 215,227 " sterilising operations on women " occurred in Peru alone .
Unsurprisingly , the women targeted were poor , indigenous , rural and Quechua - speaking .
This happened a scant 10 years ago .
In the US , coercion and persuasion are also often used when sterilisation occurs .
Women incarcerated after having been convicted of drug use during pregnancy or child abuse were , in several states , given the option to take Norplant to avoid or reduce the length of incarceration .
Norplant has also been suggested as a " cure for poverty " , and thus legislators saw it as an opportunity to reduce their welfare rolls by coercing poor women to take this medication for substantial periods .
In 2008 , an Illinois appellate court denied an attempt to have a mentally disabled woman sterilised against her will .
The fact that we are still debating the right of neurologically atypical women to reproduce is reflective of a culture determined to practice social Darwinism .
This echoes the 1927 Buck v Bell decision that saw the US supreme court uphold a ruling that made it legal to sterilise those who were considered socially unfit – among the undesirables were numerous disabled women .
In his decision , Justice Holmes stated :
It is better … if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime , or let them starve for their imbecility , society can prevent those … manifestly unfit from continuing their kind …
Three generations of imbeciles is enough .
A systemic devaluation of disability still exists , which allows the continual questioning of not only reproductive rights , but also the humanity of differently abled people .
Because some of the conditions are deemed to be inheritable , sterilisation has historically been considered a viable social option – and though not enforced , many states still have coercive sterilisation laws on the books .
The eugenicist approach to the disabled can be evidenced by the 186 deaths at " state facilities for the retarded over 18 months " in Austin , Texas .
The violation of reproductive rights in China is heinous and should definitely be a case for concern and civil disobedience .
However , we should not allow this to obscure the forced sterilisation that continues to be an issue in the west .
The ability to become a mother is a priority to millions of women , disabled or not , rich or poor .
A more inclusive approach to reproductive rights is a necessity , because women often have different experiences dealing with reproduction based on their race , ability or class .
A reproductive movement that does not actively seek to engage with the idea of promoting a woman 's right to motherhood is not necessarily seeking equal reproductive justice .
The Bloody Sunday killings were unjustified and unjustifiable , the Prime Minister has said .
Thirteen marchers were shot dead on 30 January 1972 in Londonderry when British paratroopers opened fire on crowds at a civil rights demonstration .
THE BLOODY SUNDAY
INQUIRY YEARS TO COMPLETE : 12
**INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING ** WITNESS STATEMENTS 2,500
ORAL STATEMENTS : 922 VOLUMES OF EVIDENCE : 160

VIDEOTAPES : 110

Fifteen others were wounded .
The Saville Report is heavily critical of the Army and found that soldiers fired the first shot .
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was " deeply sorry " .
He said that the findings of the Saville Report were " shocking " .
A huge cheer erupted in Guildhall Square in Derry as Mr Cameron delivered the findings which unequivocally blamed the Army for one of the most controversial days in Northern Ireland 's history .
BBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman said the decision whether or not to prosecute the soldiers would not be straightforward .
There needed to be sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction - not an easy test after 38 years .
" If any defendent believes that the passage of time makes a fair trial impossible , they could argue the prosecution was an abuse of process , " our correspondent said .
" Any prosecutions would also need to be judged to be in the public interest . "
Speaking in the House of Commons , Mr Cameron said what happened on Bloody Sunday was wrong .
Army fired first shot
The Prime Minister said :
No warning had been given to any civilians before the soldiers opened fire
None of the soldiers fired in response to attacks by petrol bombers or stone throwers
Some of those killed or injured were clearly fleeing or going to help those injured or dying
None of the casualties was posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting
Many of the soldiers lied about their actions
The events of Bloody Sunday were not premeditated
Northern Ireland 's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness , Sinn Fein , was present at the time of the violence and " probably armed with a sub- machine gun " but did not engage in " any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire "
Mr McGuinness denied having a sub- machine gun .
When asked about the Saville finding that it was probable that he had the weapon , he replied : " No " .
He said the report had cleared everybody in the city .
The head of the Army , General Sir David Richards , said he fully supported Mr Cameron 's apology .
" The report leaves me in no doubt that serious mistakes and failings by officers and soldiers on that terrible day led to the deaths of 13 civilians who did nothing that could have justified their shooting , " he said .
General Sir Mike Jackson , who served in the Parachute Regiment on Bloody Sunday said : " The Prime Minister made a fulsome apology and I join him in so doing . "
But he said the Army 's service in the 20 years after Bloody Sunday should be recognised .
Analysis
No one present in Londonderry 's Guildhall Square could deny that for all its time and expense the Saville Tribunal provided a moment of jubilation and vindication for the families of those killed and wounded on Bloody Sunday .
It was nothing short of extraordinary to witness thousands of nationalists roaring on David Cameron as he expressed his sorrow for what he described as the unjustifiable killings .
But whilst the report may be cathartic for Derry , the possibility of future prosecutions could further polarise relations between nationalists and unionists , who claim the concentration on Bloody Sunday represents a selective approach to the past .
So far as Westminster is concerned , Tony Blair 's decision to appoint Lord Saville has been vindicated in as much as the inquiry served to bind republicans into what remained , 12 years ago , a fragile peace process .
That said , David Cameron did not just provide an unequivocal apology today - he also sounded equally unequivocal in his pledge that there will never be such an open - ended and costly inquiry again .
Reaction to Bloody Sunday report Report leaves stain on the army
" Northern Ireland is a very different place from what it was 40 years ago , not least because of this sacrifice and I ask that Lord Saville 's report is seen in that context . "
Stephen Pollard , a solicitor representing the soldiers said Lord Saville did not have the justification for his findings and accused him of " cherry - picking the evidence " .
" There is just as much evidence for the opposite conclusion , " he said .
Following the report , the decision to prosecute any individual soldier rests with Northern Ireland 's Public Prosecution Service ( PPS ) .
In a statement , the PPS said their director and Chief Constable Matt Baggott would consider the report to determine the nature and extent of any police investigations .
Referring to the agreement that witnesses to the inquiry could not incriminate themselves , the statement continued : " The undertaking given by the Attorney General in 1999 to witnesses who provided evidence to the inquiry will also require to be considered .
" It is not practical , at this stage , to say when such decisions will be taken other than to indicate that the matter will be considered as expeditiously as possible . "
The report was commissioned in 1998 by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair under the auspices of former High Court judge , Lord Saville of Newdigate .
The Saville Inquiry took witness statements from hundreds of people and has become the longest - running and most expensive in British history .
It closed in 2004 with the report initially due for publication the following year .
It cost £ 195 m and took 12 years to complete .
Thousands of people gathered outside the Guildhall to watch Prime Minister David Cameron deliver the report to Parliament on a huge screen in what was an emotional day for the city .
Earlier , crowds retraced the steps of the original marchers from the Bloody Sunday memorial in the city 's Bogside close to the spot where many of the victims died .
According to BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport , while it may not have been the bloodiest day in the history of the Troubles , " the significance of that day in shaping the course of the conflict cannot be overstated " .

The crowd in Guildhall Square cheered
" The actions of the Parachute Regiment in shooting dead 13 unarmed civil rights protesters immeasurably strengthened Irish republicans ' arguments within their own community and provided the Provisional IRA with a flood of fresh recruits for its long war , " he said .
Our correspondent also said Bloody Sunday set in train the suspension of the Northern Ireland government in March 1972 , which led to the decades of direct rule from London .
The full process of restoring devolution was only completed in 2010 .
An inquiry chaired by Lord Widgery was held in the immediate aftermath of the killings but it failed to satisfy families of the victims .
Clarification 9 April 2019 : This article was amended to remove a reference to the death of John Johnston .
This reflects the Bloody Sunday Inquiry 's finding about Mr Johnston 's death several months after he was wounded in Derry on 30 January 1972 .
The inquiry report states that his death was " not the result of any of the wounds he sustained on Bloody Sunday " .

There are countless videos and blog posts telling you how you can take your full size SIM card and cut it down to fit in your iPad , but frankly , that ’s idiotic .
I mean really , who ’s going to cut up the SIM card they ’re using in their $ 85 + a month iPhone to put in their iPad when they could just pay $ 30 a month for unlimited date on the iPad .
Yes , you might be cutting up a T - Mobile SIM , but let ’s face it …
Do you really want to be using EDGE on an iPad ?
Anyhow , that ’s not what this post is about .
I ’m going to show you how to do the exact opposite of that , how to take your Micro SIM and use it in your iPhone for cheap data only service .
It ’s easier than you might think .
Update : Some sites are incorrectly reporting that you need a jailbroken iPhone for this to work , you do not .
Update 2 : You also watch this quick video walkthrough .
Step 1 : Remove both your iPad ’s Micro SIM card and your iPhone ’s regular sized SIM card .
Step 2 : Find an expired debit card , gift card , or a calling card that you do n’t need anymore and place your iPhone ’s SIM card flush with the top edge and trace an outline of it .
Or if you have a spare SIM card you can just skip to Step 4 .
Step 3 : Take a pair of scissors and cut out your SIM template .
It should look something like this when you ’re done :
Step 4 : Place your Micro SIM card on top of your template and line up the contact points with your iPhone ’s SIM .
Then trace around it .
Step 5 : Using an razor blade , cut out the middle of your template to make room for the Micro SIM .
Step 6 : Next place a small piece of scotch tape on the backside of the template to keep the Micro SIM from failing out .
Step 7 : Place the Micro SIM into your shiny new adapter and then place it into the iPhone ’s SIM tray and insert it into the iPhone .
You might think this is where you get to enjoy your sweet 3G for $ 29.99 a month , but sadly there are a few extra steps needed on the software side of things .
If you pull up Safari you ’ll get the error message “ Could not activate cellular data network ” .
But we can fix that !
Step 8 : Make sure your iPhone is connected to a WiFi network , then visit http://unlockit.co.nz and tap Continue .
Step 9 : Tap Custom APN , then enter Broadband in the APN field .
Step 10 : Leaving the remaining fields blank , tap Create Profile , then tap Install , followed by Install Now on the popup .
Step 11 : Tap Done , disable your WiFi and bask in the glory of $ 30 a month unlimited 3G .
Step 12 ( optional ) : Call up AT&T and cancel your iPhone plan !!
I ’m actually thinking about canceling my crappy AT&T service , since I use it mostly for data anyway and also have a Verizon phone I carry with me for making actual phone calls .
Note :
If you decide to stick with your AT&T calling plan for your iPhone and were just trying this project because you ’re a nerd , just remember that in order to go back to using your iPhone ’s SIM you will need to go to Settings ->
General , scroll down and tap Profile : APN Carrier Settings , then tap the red Remove button .

A talent search by Oprah Winfrey has taken a confusing turn , thanks to online voting .
Ms. Winfrey ’s forthcoming cable channel , OWN , has been holding online and in - person casting calls for “ Your OWN Show : Oprah ’s Search for the Next TV Star , ” a reality show that will have its premiere next year .
Last week the search was tainted by allegations from fans of the top two online candidates , Zach Anner and Phyllis Wick - Turner , that the other side had stuffed the online ballot box .
Some even suggested that Ms. Winfrey was behind it .
The allegations , picked up by the news media , prompted a channel spokesperson to say in a statement that no “ contestant has been favored in this competition , ” but that an investigation would be undertaken and that all votes would be verified twice .
The five most popular online contestants will go before a casting director , but only one is guaranteed a spot on the reality show , though OWN could choose to add more than one .
A total of 10 in - person and online contestants will vie for a spot ; eventually the show ’s winner will be hired by OWN .
By Sunday , Mr. Anner had accumulated two million more votes than Ms. Wick - Turner .
It 's a hackneyed image , I admit , but I 'm beginning to feel like the boy who noticed that the monarch was suffering from a serious wardrobe malfunction .
In this case , however , the story 's not working out like the original : it seldom does .
Exposed , the emperor continues to strut about naked while everyone keeps oohing and aahing over his fine vestments .
He confidently asserts that the boy is wrong and he is in fact fully clothed .
Desperate to believe that this is true , the crowd agrees .
The more you point out the obvious truth , the more defensive and aggressive he becomes .
A couple of weeks ago , I wrote a column for the Guardian exploring the contrast between Matt Ridley 's assertions in his new book The Rational Optimist and his own experience .
In the book , Ridley attacks the " parasitic bureaucracy " , which stifles free enterprise and excoriates governments for , among other sins , bailing out big corporations .
If only the market is left to its own devices , he insists , and not stymied by regulations , the outcome will be wonderful for everybody .
What Ridley glosses over is that before he wrote this book he had an opportunity to put his theories into practice .
As chairman of Northern Rock , he was responsible , according to parliament 's Treasury select committee , for a " high - risk , reckless business strategy " .
Northern Rock was able to pursue this strategy as a result of a " substantial failure of regulation " by the state .
The wonderful outcome of this experiment was the first run on a British bank since 1878 , and a £ 27bn government bail - out .
But it 's not just Ridley who does n't mention the inconvenient disjunction between theory and practice : hardly anyone does .
His book has now been reviewed dozens of times , and almost all the reviewers have either been unaware of his demonstration of what happens when his philosophy is applied or too polite to mention it .
The reason , as far as I can see , is that Ridley is telling people – especially rich , powerful people – what they want to hear .
He tells them that they need n't worry about social or environmental issues , because these will sort themselves out if the market is liberated from government control .
He tells them that they are right to assert that government should get off their backs and stop interfering with its pettifogging rules and regulations : they should be left alone to make as much money as they like , however they like .
He tells them that poorly regulated greed of the kind that he oversaw at Northern Rock is , in fact , a great moral quest , which makes the world a better place .
I expect the executives of BP have each ordered several copies .
Just imagine what the response would have been if someone who tells the rich and powerful what they do n't want to hear had caused the first run on a British bank in 130 years and had to go crawling to the people he had spent years attacking for a £ 27bn bailout .
Imagine that this person , having learned nothing from the experience , then published a book insisting that the strategy he applied with such catastrophic consequences should be rolled out universally .
Crucifixion would n't have been good enough for him .
Reviewers and leader writers would pile in , heaping execrations on his head .
But because Ridley preaches the business gospel , he 's being celebrated throughout the rightwing press , as well as in parts of the liberal media ( sometimes I wonder whether we 're too liberal for our own good ) .
When someone explains an inconvenient truth about politics that the business elite reviles , it is immediately taken up and echoed in hundreds of blogs and articles .
When , as I have found many times before , you explain an inconvenient truth about neoliberal or anti-environmental ideas , it is met with silence .
The media simply looks the other way .
There is a massive rightwing echo chamber .
Nothing comparable exists on the left .
I also pointed out that Ridley had made a series of shocking errors and distortions in his book .
I showed how he had misrepresented economic history , made claims that bore no relation to the references he gave , and reeled off facts about the environment which were just plain wrong .
Again , none of this has been picked up by Ridley 's reviewers .
Ridley himself has claimed that his shocking mistakes are n't mistakes at all , then proceeds to compound them with a series of spurious justifications .
Here are a few examples :
1 . I pointed out that his claim that " Enron - funded climate alarmism " is not supported by the source he gives .
Now , Ridley cites another URL to prove that even though he did n't know it at the time he was right all along , because it shows that Enron did in fact fund climate alarmism .
Only one problem : it does n't .
So that 's two false sources for one false claim .
Good going Matt .
2. Ridley hilariously maintained that " no significant error has come to light " in Bjørn Lomborg 's book The Sceptical Environmentalist .
I pointed out that it contains so many significant errors that an entire book – The Lomborg Deception by Howard Friel – was required to document them .
Now , without having read Friel 's book , Ridley accepts that it is all nonsense on the word of … Bjørn Lomborg !
Quite right too : what more objective reviewer of a book about Bjørn Lomborg 's errors could there be than , er , Bjørn Lomborg ?
Ridley then has the blazing chutzpah to state that " Monbiot should be embarrassed to be relying on a source of this quality " .
No , he does n't mean Lomborg 's rebuttal , he means Friel 's book .
3 . In his book , Ridley asserts that " 11 of 13 populations " of polar bears are " growing or steady " .
I pointed out that there are in fact 19 populations of polar bears , and cited the most comprehensive and widely - respected research , collated by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group , which suggests that of those whose fluctuations have been measured , one is increasing , three are stable and eight are declining .
Forgetting that he made a definitive statement about the bears ' status in his book , Ridley now says that " nobody really knows the truth and lots of different claims are out there . "
Yes , but some are more credible than others .
Ridley chose to ignore the most credible studies , while relying instead on : " ( a ) a source that does n't mention polar bears , ( b ) an oil–industry funded source , and ( c ) a non–peer reviewed lecture at an undisclosed location in an undisclosed month and year " .
The quote is from Howard Friel , who has been drawn into this debate by Ridley 's gross mischaracterisation of his book , and has done some digging of his own .
So , given that Ridley has bothered to reply on this point , you 'd imagine that he would come up with some powerful data to rebut the comprehensive study I cited .
You 'd be wrong .
Instead he relies on an interview on CBC News with a local Canadian politician , who asserts that his impression , after talking to people who want to hunt polar bears or the animals which polar bears prey on , is that the Canadian Arctic population ( not the total population you understand ) is n't declining .
No numbers , no analysis , no cited sources , no scientific study at all .
Yes , dear reader , this really is Ridley 's withering retort .
And he calls himself a scientist .
4 . I accused Ridley of blatant cherry - picking in the following passage in The Rational Optimist : " Well alight , says the pessimist , but at what cost ?
The environment is surely deteriorating .
In somewhere like Beijing , maybe .
But in many other places , no .
In Europe and America rivers , lakes , seas and the air are getting cleaner all the time .
The Thames has less sewage and more fish .
Lake Erie 's water snakes , on the brink of extinction in the 1960s , are now abundant .
Bald eagles have boomed .
Pasadena has few smogs .
Swedish birds ' eggs have 75 % fewer pollutants in them than in the 1960s . "
I pointed out – as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment shows – that of 65 global indicators of human impacts on biodiversity , only one – the extent of temperate forests – is improving .
Eighteen are stable , in all the other cases the impacts are increasing .
Ridley retorts that readers of the passage I 've just cited " can judge if I am doing anything other than claiming that " in many places ' environmental trends are positive . "
You certainly can .
Take a look at these two sentences again : " The environment is surely deteriorating .
In somewhere like Beijing , maybe . "
Here Ridley makes an obvious attempt to suggest that environmental deterioration is confined to places like Beijing .
Comparing these sentences to those that follow , any reader who did n't know better would assume that improvement is more common than deterioration .
If Ridley really believes that this passage is n't designed to suggest that the general trend is positive , his intellectual dishonesty runs deeper than I had imagined .
And if he can't see that his selective treatment of the subject is blatant cherry - picking , it says more than he would care to about his standards of objectivity .
The other two refutations he attempts are just as wrong , but I would need several hundred more words in each case to explain why , and I wo n't try your patience any further .
At the end of this farrago of nonsense , Ridley asserts that " Monbiot is entitled to his opinions but he has found precisely zero ' excruciating errors ' in my book . "
I 'm sure he found himself very persuasive .
But if no one else is prepared to call him out on this , he will continue to get away with both the disavowal of his own record and the denial of his glaring mistakes .
And he will continue to deceive the growing band of people who are treating his book as the self - justification they have always sought .
Paradoxically , many of them are the same people who , devoted to free market principles , have been denouncing both the evil bankers who trashed the economy and the governments who bailed them out .
If they knew a little more about Dr Ridley 's interesting attempt to put his theories into practice , they might be less ready to believe his misleading assertions .
UPDATE : Senate voted down Ron Paul - approved
Fed audit 37 - 62 ; passed bill does not audit monetary policy
UPDATE 2 : Paul calls bill better than nothing , suggests Fed is ‘ satisfied ’ by outcome : ‘ they think theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re getting off the hook ’
The Senate on Tuesday approved a proposal to examine the Federal Reserve ’s role in the Wall Street bailouts of 2008 - 2009 as part of a broad financial regulation reform bill .
ADVERTISEMENT
The proposal from independent Senator Bernie Sanders would order congressional investigators to conduct a single audit of the U.S. central bank ’s use of its emergency lending authority since December 2007 .
It would require the Fed by December 1 to disclose which banks received its help .
It passed by a vote of 96 to 0 .
“ Though the measure was always popular , it faced extraordinary opposition from the White House , Wall Street and the Fed itself , ” Talking Points Memo ’s Eric Lach noted Tuesday .
“ Late last week , in a move that defused the opposition , and may have saved Wall Street reform legislation , Sanders agreed to limit the scope of the audit to emergency lending only , exempting other Fed activities .
“ That preserved the broad intent of the plan , which was always aimed at bringing the Fed ’s shadowy activities during the financial crisis into the daylight , ” Lach added .
“ Under the terms of the proposal , the Fed will also be required to make public which companies received upwards of $ 2 trillion in aide from the Fed , and under what terms . ”
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Let ’s be clear , Ã¢â‚¬Â Sanders said in a statement after the vote .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When trillions of dollars of taxpayer money are being lent out to the largest financial institutions in this country , the American people have a right to know who received that money and what they did with it .
We also need to know what possible conflicts of interest exist involving the heads of large financial institutions who sat in the room helping to make those decisions .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The Fed can no longer operate in virtual secrecy , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sanders added .

The Senate was next expected to consider a more stringent measure , opposed by the Fed , that would subject the central bank to ongoing congressional audits .

The Indian capital faces possible ‘‘ imminent ’’ militant attacks , the United States , Australia and Britain have warned , stepping up their risk advisories to travellers to New Delhi .
New Zealand also warned of an ‘‘ extreme risk ’’ of terrorism in India as the nation battles to reassure visitors it can safely host the Commonwealth Games in October in New Delhi , which has been targeted before by militants .
‘‘ There are increased indications that terrorists are planning imminent attacks in New Delhi , ’’ the US embassy said in a statement on its website on Saturday , urging tourists to avoid half - a- dozen of the city ’s popular shopping areas .
Police in New Delhi were taking ‘‘ appropriate measures ’’ in response to the warnings , said police spokesman Rajan Bhagat as a source said police had been put on alert .
‘‘ Security is adequate , ’’ Ravindra Singh , spokesman for India ’s Ministry of Home Affairs , said .
Opened 25 years ago at a time when homosexuality was illegal , Dublin 's best known gay bar , the George , is now a city landmark .
To celebrate its silver jubilee , Róisín Ingletakes a historical walking tour of ' gay Dublin ' .
The bar , which celebrates its 25th birthday next month , was established by Co Kerry businessman Cyril O’Brien who ran one of the city ’s first and most commercially successful gay saunas , The Gym , on Dame Lane .
Interviewed in 1997 in Gay Community News ( GCN ) when the George was taken over by Capital Bars , O’Brien said he used to drink in the bar and was constantly hassling the previous owner to do the place up .
One night the owner suggested that O’Brien “ buy the bloody place ” and renovate it himself .
So , on the lookout for a new business , he did .
It opened as the Loft disco bar on the first floor in 1984 – Senator David Norris famously described the decor , with its trompe l’oeil of musclemen playing pool , as being like “ a hairdresser ’s brain ” – and the venue expanded downstairs , becoming the George in May 1985 , almost a decade before the decriminalisation of homosexuality .
It ’s a sunny afternoon midweek , but the oldest and most famous gay bar in Dublin is busy with punters reading the paper or chatting .
Outside , Tonie Walsh , gay historian and founder of GCN , has arrived to take The Irish Timeson a brief walking tour of gay Dublin .
The tour proper will form part of the birthday celebrations next month , along with a slew of other rainbow - tinged events .
The last tour he conducted with David Norris , featuring a cameo by Nell McCafferty , attracted more than 200 people .
He begins the tour in the lane beside the George , pointing to the site of the Gym , O’Brien ’s sauna .
He reminisces about the Loft , where the mirrors were different depths , creating a freaky funfair effect .
In May 1985 the venue moved into the small room on the ground floor of the building that became the George .
That bar is fondly known as “ Jurassic ” , as in park , a reference to the older crowd who drink there .
If it were n’t for the semi- naked pictures of men hanging on the walls , it could be a traditional watering hole anywhere in the city .
In later years O’Brien expanded next door on to the site of Ali Baba ’s Egyptian Cafe , creating a nightclub where the main entertainment – events such as Strictly Come Pole Dancing or drag queen Shirley Temple Bar ’s bingo cabaret – now takes place .
When asked whether he had a problem getting planning permission because it was a gay bar , O’Brien said : “ You do n’t look for gay planning permission , you look for planning permission . ”
Though gay himself , O’Brien ’s venture was never a philanthropic gesture but a business proposition – and a commercially sound one as it turned out .
Apart from the George , the city ’s only other exclusively gay bar at that time was the Viking on Dame Street .
According to Tonie Walsh , management in the pubs around town were “ happy enough to take the pink punt , but never , ever , publicly acknowledged their gay clientele ” .
It was a time when being gay or looking gay was enough to get you kicked out of a pub .
This happened to Walsh .
“ I was around 21 and having a drink in an indie club on Dame Street called Fives , ” he says .
“ Myself and my first boyfriend were nonchalantly holding hands when we were asked to leave .
At that time you could n’t go rapping on the door of any equality agency . ”
An article in a gay newsletter describing a pub crawl conducted by some gay and lesbian students in 1981 notes that they were refused in five out of eight bars simply for being gay .
We cross Dame Street into Temple Bar , walking to the site of the former Hirschfeld Centre , which , as a social , political and cultural hub for the gay community , helped create a climate in which the pubs that came later , such as the George , could thrive .
Opened in 1979 and spread across three floors , there was a large dance club known as Flikkers , the Dutch word for faggot .
The centre was also home to the Dublin Gay Switchboard , a cafe and campaigning offices .
“ It was very cloak and dagger , ” Walsh says of the Hirschfeld Centre ’s nocturnal activities .
“ This was pre-decriminalisation and there was a huge level of antipathy on the part of police and State agencies , so much so that the club was a bit of a law unto itself .
“ I remember on its first anniversary it held an all - night disco until eight in the morning .
This predated the rave culture and the commodification of nightclubs .
The police were n’t au fait with the fact that people were getting down to Gloria Gaynor until eight o’clock in the morning and having coffee and croissants as a coda . ”
The centre was burnt down in 1987 in , says Walsh , “ mysterious ” circumstances .
Our tour also takes in the former sites of Sides nightclub , Bartley Dunnes and Pygmalion , all gay bars that blossomed in mid to late 1980s Dublin .
Walsh is fascinating on local gay history , and his talk takes in the early gay liberation movement , the horrific spate of anti-gay violence of the early 1980s and the George ’s place in improving the lot of gay Ireland .
“ It was really important to have a safe space to gather .
The George provided that when few other places did , ” he says .
When , in the late 1980s , Declan Buckley , aka drag queen Shirley Temple Bar , first began , as he puts it , “ coming to terms with being a big homo ” the social landscape of gay Dublin was as grey as David Norris ’s beard .
“ Gay bars then were places of secret knocks and darkened windows , ” he says , sitting in the nightclub side of the venue where every Sunday for the past 13 years he has presided , in pigtails , over the madly popular bingo cabaret event .
Buckley was invited to be a resident bingo caller on Sunday afternoons after winning the Alternative Miss Ireland competition .
“ Back then it was just me and a couple of bingo book sellers , it ’s now a cabaret show with a cast of thousands , ” he says .
The show quickly became a cultural phenomenon , anointed in the mainstream media as an original and entertaining afternoon out , and attended by fun-seekers of all sexual persuasions , including , in their droves , heterosexuals .
“ I think it was timing , ” says Buckley .
“ It began in the Celtic Tiger years when there was a general spirit of ‘ yay ! ’
As it became more popular , people from outside gay circles wanted to come in , and that dragged a lot of people through the doors of the George who would never have been inside a gay bar before . ”
These included Buckley ’s parents and the straight siblings and friends of regular George punters .
“ That ’s probably what I am most proud of , seeing people like that in the front row , ” he says .
“ Before , there was maybe a fear on both sides .
On the straight side , it was ‘ I do n’t want to go in there ’ , fellas thinking ‘ I am totally going to get cruised ’ because , of course , all straight men think they are so hot and irresistible to gay men .
And then , on the gay side , there was a fear of being open and maybe being recognised by straight people they knew . ”
He talks about the image of gay bars perpetuated by some straight people , of Village People - style characters in leather trousers and moustaches parading around shirtless .
“ People who ’ve come to the bingo and the George see that it ’s just regular people in a regular bar who are just having a better time than other regular people , ” he says .
“ That ’s been really important in terms of the self - esteem and self - confidence of the community . ”
Last year the George went into receivership .
A new management structure is now in place , and until a buyer is found it ’s business as usual , the business of the George including plenty of “ fantabulous fun ” and “ brand new electronic bingo balls ” , according to a press release .
Over the years , hipper , edgier gay bars have opened – the Dragon , also on South Great George ’s Street , the Front Lounge on Parliament Street and PantiBar on Capel Street – but the George has remained a beacon for the community , a reliable , if mischievous , elder sister .
As one long - term customer , who did n’t want to be named , said : “ If you are a teenager trying to come to terms with yourself and living an isolated life , you know the George is there and you know that one day you will walk through its doors and inside there will be hundreds of people just like you . ”
“ There is nothing like the George , ” says Buckley .
“ It ’s open to everybody and anybody .
Whether you are the meek , insecure , geeky teenage guy or the formerly married or the ex-priest , you will find some night of the week , or some time of the day , or some place in the venue , where you are going to enjoy yourself – and I am not sure other venues can offer that . ”
You could put this down to silver jubilee hyperbole but there ’s no denying that at a sprightly 25 The George is still the queen of Irish gay bars .
Three cheers for that .
MY GEORGE

“ The George is at the cornerstone of the Irish gay experience .
For most gay and lesbian people it is the first bar we ever walk into , which is a major moment in our journey towards self - acceptance , a moment we remember for the rest of our lives because it showed us there was a big , exciting gay world that we could be part of . ”
ALAN AMSBY
Aka drag queen Mr Pussy
“ Back in 1985 the opening of the George was very exciting for Dublin .
The gay scene was very small and underground with only a few bars in town . . .
I have had many great nights there with my celebrity friends , including Bono , Danny La Rue , Paul O’Grady , Lionel Blair and Sinéad O’Connor .
Gavin Friday got the inspiration for his song , Mr Pussy , from hanging out at the George . ”

“ The George has been invaluable for many Irish LGBT people .
Opened before decriminalisation , it was a safe space for people , and serves somewhat the same role today .
The George is a place where you can go out with your mates and have a ball or , if you ’re new , it ’s a place where you ’re guaranteed to get chatting to people – it ’s such a friendly environment . ”
( CNN ) -- Florida prosecutors on Thursday revealed a list of reasons they 're seeking the death penalty against Casey Anthony , who is charged with killing her daughter , Caylee .
Under Florida , law , prosecutors need to raise only one of 15 possible aggravating factors to support their decision to seek the death penalty .
Assistant State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton cited five circumstances , according to a document obtained by CNN affiliate WESH and other Orlando , Florida , media outlets .
In death penalty cases , jurors are asked to weigh aggravating circumstances that make a crime especially heinous against mitigating factors that favor mercy , such as a lack of prior offenses .
Among the legal reasons cited : Caylee 's death occurred during aggravated child abuse , was especially " heinous , atrocious , or cruel , " and was committed in a " cold , calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification , " according to the document .
Caylee was also under 12 years old , and Anthony " stood in a position of familial or custodial authority over her , " the document states .
Karen Levey , the court public information officer , could not confirm that Judge Belvin Perry Jr. received a copy of the notice .
As of Thursday evening , defense attorney Jose Baez said he had not been served with the notice .
In a hearing this week , Perry ordered the State Attorney 's Office to disclose the aggravating factors they intend to cite in a penalty phase if Anthony is convicted of premeditated murder .
Anthony , 24 , is accused of killing 2 - year - old Caylee , who disappeared in June 2008 .
Her body was found that December in a vacant lot near her grandparents ' home in Orlando .
Defense lawyers have said that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty to bankrupt the defense and prevent Anthony from having the attorney of her choice .
The defense said that prosecutors had originally said they would not seek death in the case but reversed that position in March 2009 when they learned that Anthony had $ 205,000 for her defense .
The bulk of the money came from ABC News for the licensing of photos and videos , Baez testified during a previous hearing .
Anthony 's trial is scheduled to begin May 9 , 2011 .
Gordon Brown is cutting it fine .
The government 's proposal for the alternative vote system of electing the Commons , subject to a referendum to be held by the autumn of 2011 , is so late in this parliament that no one will put serious money on its chances of getting through .
We have fewer than 90 days to the general election widely presumed to be held on 6 May , and only two - thirds of those days are available to pass legislation .
Yet the proposal is literally historic .
Throughout the 19th century to early in the 20th , political reforms came thick and fast : the end of rotten boroughs , the gradual extension of the franchise , votes for all men , votes for older women and finally equal votes for men and women .
And then we stopped .
There has been less change in our electoral system for the Commons in the last 80 years than in any previous comparable period .
The alternative vote ( AV ) is a small step in the right direction , but is the most minimal change a Labour government could devise .
AV will end " tactical " voting , whereby people vote for their second preference party to block the party they dislike most .
It will allow everyone to vote for who they want , secure in the knowledge that if their preferred candidate has no chance and is eliminated in the count , their second and third preferences will be used for someone else .
The process of elimination and counting goes on until someone has at last half of the votes in the constituency .
AV is therefore better because voters have more choice , and can honestly support who they want .
Supporters of small parties know that their vote will no longer be wasted .
It may have a role in helping to revitalise politics as a result .
But it is very similar to first - past - the - post in two key respects .
Because it is based on single constituencies – a virtue for its proponents , who say they prize the constituency link – the parties continue to select one candidate each , and the voters only have one choice for each party .
That means that in the majority of parliamentary seats , the important decision about who should be the MP will continue to be taken in party caucuses rather than at the public ballot box .
Although most MPs will have to reach beyond their tribal base to get the second preferences of other parties – an important discipline on unpleasant characters and behaviour – the choice for the voter remains very limited .
Compare AV in this respect with the Liberal Democrats ' preferred option , the single transferable vote ( STV ) , which is the system used in the Republic of Ireland , Scottish local government and in most Northern Irish elections .
Each multi-member constituency has three to five members of parliament , so that each party has the incentive to put up two or more candidates .
The voter therefore has the choice not only of party , but also of person .
Such a system is clearly the most liberal : it gives the maximum opportunity to the voter to express their preferences , and reserves the minimum power to the party machines .
It is perfectly adapted for the world of the MPs ' expenses scandal .
Unlike AV , voters can stick with their party and vote for a " clean " MP or for an MP who shares their particular enthusiasms .
With AV and first - past - the - post , voters have to change party to punish an individual MP .
In the Republic of Ireland , a third of all MPs who lose their seats in the Dail lose them to members of their own party , not partisan opponents .
The system provides more discipline for MPs , and keeps them on their toes .
MPs elected under STV have to provide a sterling service to their constituents , or they will find someone from their own party proving more attractive .
The voter wrests power from the party .
Under AV , as under first - past - the - post , there would continue to be safe seats where the MP will effectively have a job for life .
A third of all the constituencies in the country have not changed party since the second world war , and in those areas the MPs know that they can do pretty much anything without retribution .
Research has shown that the worst expenses abuses occurred in safe seats where MPs face no threat of sacking by the electorate .
Conservative opposition to electoral reform gives the lie to David Cameron 's pretence that he wants real change , and Labour 's half - hearted commitment to the alternative vote is just a deathbed conversion from a party facing a historic defeat at the ballot box .
Not only does AV fail to give voters the power they should have , but it also fails to remedy the unfairness of the present system .
Labour won 55 % of the seats in the Commons with just 35 % of the vote , and barely more than a fifth of the entire electorate .
Yet AV can be even more disproportional when there are big swings from one side to the other such as in 1997 or 1979 : under AV both Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher would have had bigger majorities .
The electoral system would continue to be like an ill - fitting corset attempting to squeeze all the diverse strands of opinion in our society into an inappropriate and deeply uncomfortable shape .
Instead , we need a parliament that properly represents our country in all its argumentative glory .
Only when the Commons becomes an honest reflection of our people – not a fairground distorting mirror – will we be able to resolve the tensions and conflicts in our society .
That is why the Liberal Democrats will move its proposal for the single transferable vote tomorrow .
Every voter , whether in an Essex marginal or a Welsh safe seat , should have a vote that counts , and every radical should want a political system that is fair .
As our forebears knew , and we seem to have forgotten , you cannot build a fair society on an unfair political system .
It is time for a new Reform Act .
A YOUNG boy with a shell - like growth on his back has had life - changing surgery after he was dubbed " turtle boy " by cruel bullies .
Eight - year - old Maimaiti Hali had the growth removed by surgeons in a miracle two - hour operation , The Sun reports .
Doctors at the Urumqi Military General Hospital in China 's Xinjiang province said they had used skin grafts from the boy 's scalp and legs to replace the removed growth .
Dad Maimaiti Musai said : " We were told surgery was n't possible when he was very young so we waited .
But the growth got bigger and harder and became like a turtle shell .
" People bullied him and we were determined to end it .
He is such a good and brave boy and he never complained .
We are so glad that he is now on the mend . "
Chief surgeon
Ye Xiangpo said : " The skin we removed was as thick as a bull 's hide .
" We used scalp hair on the graft because it grows back very quickly .
We expect him to make a full recovery . "
Mainmait , from Heping , northern China , said : " It was a bit painful , but I wo n't worry about other kids laughing at me any more .
" I am looking forward to going out in the sun without my shirt on and to going swimming with my friends . "

Two separate instances of post - fight misconduct have occurred in the U.S. ’s No. 1 and 2 promotions in the last month , though they have chosen to handle the fighters involved in them in contrasting ways .
UFC President Dana
White immediately dismissed welterweight contender Paul Daley from the promotion Saturday night after the Brit threw and landed a punch on Josh Koscheck well after the bell had sounded on their three - round UFC 113 contest at the Bell Centre in Montreal .
“ He ’s done , ” White stated in no uncertain terms on Saturday at the post - fight news conference .
“ I do n’t give a s--t if he ’s the best 170 - pounder in the world .
He ’ll never come back here again .
” A month earlier , Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker watched three of his promotion ’s titleholders become entangled in a chaotic in - cage brawl sparked by Jason " Mayhem " Miller ’s interruption of a live CBS post interview with middleweight champion Jake Shields .
Coker has n’t released Shields , Gilbert Melendez , or Nick Diaz – who all physically reacted to Miller in the heat of the moment – choosing instead to not re-assign any of them to their next bouts until the Tennessee Athletic Commission completes its disciplinary process with them .
Coker commented on the UFC ’s decision to banish Daley on Monday ’s “ Savage Dog Show ” on the Sherdog Radio Network .
“ I ’m not the UFC and they run their business the way they run it and I have no idea what thought process went into it , ” Coker told the show , “ but I ’m sure it was influenced by what happened ( at Strikeforce “ Nashville ” ) a couple of weeks before .
” Coker said he had n’t had the opportunity to watch Daley ’s career - detrimental punch yet , but knows the 27 - year - old British striker will pay for the cheap shot handily .
“ I ’m not sure really when cooler heads prevail , maybe ( the UFC will ) be able to work something out with Paul , but I ’m sure Paul will be on some heavy type of suspension from the commission up in Canada and I do n’t imagine Paul being able to fight anytime soon , ” said Coker .
Coker , who did n’t acquire Daley ’s contract from Pro Elite in early 2009 , was n’t particularly motivated on Monday in pursuing a new relationship with Daley now that he ’s a free agent , at least not presently .
“ I ’m sure we ’ll get a call , but let ’s what happens , ” said Coker .
“ Who knows ?
He could be on suspension for four to six months .
He ’s not going to be able to fight .
I do n’t think that type of reaction or behavior from a fighter will be accepted .
It ’s just unacceptable .
” Another fighter who might be left at the wayside following Saturday ’s event is Kevin " Kimbo Slice " Ferguson .
Though a ratings juggernaut for every network that has carried his fights ,
White said the promotion plans to drop the 36 - year - old former Internet streetfighting sensation following his sobering second - round defeat at the hands of “ Ultimate Fighter ” castmate Matt Mitrione .
Sherdog.com has not been able to immediately reach Slice ’s management to confirm or refute his release form the UFC .
Still , with the prospect of Slice possibly back on the market , a proposed matchup between the Bahamian - born fighter and Strikeforce ’s golden goose , NFL legend Herschel Walker , is quickly gaining steam .
“ You ’re like the sixth person who ’s contacted me saying , ‘ Hey , you have to put together Herschel Walker vs. Kimbo Slice , ’ ” Coker shared .
“ The thing is with Kimbo is he was successful with the ratings , but when we purchased ( the contracts ) from Pro Elite , the deal at that time ( for Kimbo ) , we felt was too rich for long - term viability …
We have n’t revisited it internally yet , so as of right now I think we ’re going to stick with our course , which is putting on the best fighters in the world in the best matchups .
” However , Coker added that Strikeforce would continue to both seek out and keep talent that enriches the company ’s long - term strategy .
“ The fighters that are important to develop our reach and growth , and are important to Showtime and CBS , we ’re going to keep those fighters , ” said Coker .
“ We ’ve proven that we can stay in the game at the highest level with these athletes because believe me , Fedor ( Emelianenko ) is not a cheap fighter . ”
Prime Minister Stephen Harper says he opposes any new abortion law for Canada and will vote against any of his backbenchers ' attempts to bring in such legislation .
When asked Friday about Conservative MP Rod Bruinooge 's abortion bill , Harper said he normally does n't comment on private member 's legislation , but said he does not want a debate in Parliament over the issue .
" My position is quite clear : I will oppose any attempt to create a new abortion law , " he told reporters in Niagara Falls .
Harper 's Conservative government has faced intense criticism at home and abroad for its decision to refuse funding for abortions in its G8 child and maternal health - care initiative for developing countries .
The prime minister and his cabinet have repeatedly insisted the decision does n't translate into re-opening the abortion debate .
But when asked Friday whether he would designate a vote on any private member 's bill on abortion as whipped , meaning MPs in his caucus must vote the party line or face consequences , Harper did not answer and moved on to another question .
In April , Bruinooge , who heads the self - declared " pro-life caucus " of MPs in the House of Commons , introduced a private member 's bill designed to protect vulnerable women from " abortion abuse . "
The bill would penalize anyone who " coerces " a woman into ending her pregnancy against her will .
* What : Geothermal heat pump systems
* Company : Engineered Services Cooperative
* How it 's green :
The pumps utilize the earth 's temperature to provide heating and cooling for buildings .
Because water is utilized as the heat transfer medium instead of air , it is more efficient and reduces carbon emissions .
* How long :
For the last five years
* Why do it this way ?
" The company is supposed to be a part of the solution , not the problem , " Aaron Parsons , geothermal project manager for Engineered Services , said .
* Plans for expanding in the future ?
Hoping to expand into solar thermal panels in addition to geothermal and photovoltaic ( traditional solar panels )
* Any suggestions for others considering green initiatives ?
Keep in mind rising energy and fuel costs and find ways to reduce energy use .
Mr. Parsons also suggests looking for ways to keep energy in through insulation and other materials .
The federal government has energy tax credits that can help offset costs .
" Payback on geothermal systems can be as little as three to five years on new construction and five to seven years on existing structures , " he said .
* Is this an essential part of the business and why ?
" I 've always been part of the environmental movement .
When it came time to start a business , in my opinion it had to be something sustainable and forward thinking in terms of our effect of the environment , " Mr. Parsons said .

The New York Times ’s front page story this week on the New York Police Department and its allegedly racist stop - and - frisk practices follows a well - worn template : give specific racial breakdowns for every aspect of police behavior , but refer to racial crime rates only in the most attenuated of terms .
Disclosing crime rates — the proper benchmark against which police behavior must be measured — would demolish a cornerstone of the Times ’s worldview : that the New York Police Department , like police departments across America , oppresses the city ’s black population with unjustified racial tactics .
This week ’s story , written by Al Baker , began with what the Times thinks is a shocking disparity : “ Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped by the police in New York City in 2009 , but , once stopped , were no more likely to be arrested . ”
( The fact that blacks , Hispanics , and whites are arrested at the same rate after a stop undercuts , rather than supports , the thesis of racially biased policing , but more on that later . )
The Times ’s story includes a graphic breakdown of police stops by race : blacks made up 55 percent of all stops in 2009 , though they ’re only 23 percent of the city ’s population ; whites accounted for 10 percent of all stops , though they ’re 35 percent of the city ’s population ;
Hispanics made up 32 percent of all stops , though 28 percent of the population , and Asians , 3 percent of all stops and 12 percent of the population .
The article details a host of other police actions by specific racial numbers , including arrests , frisks , and use of force .
But when the Times gets around to mentioning crime rates , more than halfway into the piece , it does so only because the NYPD raises them in its defense , not because the Times deems them independently worthy of note in a story on police stops .
And it mentions them only as a form of reported speech , in the most generalized of terms : “ Mr. Browne , the department spokesman , . . . said the stops mirrored crime — that while a large percentage of the stops involved blacks , an even larger percentage of violent crimes involved suspects described as black by their victims . ”
This formula , which carefully brackets a non-specific statement about crime rates as what the police department says , as opposed to simply what the facts are , is by now standard Times practice :
February 11 , 2010 : “ Police officials have said that while a large percentage of the street stops involve blacks , an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims . ”
May 13 , 2009 : “ On Tuesday , Mr. Browne said that the stops ‘ comport by race proportionally with descriptions provided by crime victims . ’” February 11 , 2009 : “ The police have said that while a large percentage of the stops involve black people , an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims . ”
May 6 , 2008 : “ The police have said that while a large percentage of the street stops involve black people , an even larger percentage of crimes involve suspects described as black by their victims . ”
Only in 2007 did the Times disclose some actual black crime rates in discussing stop - and - frisk activity — though as usual , only as an aspect of the NYPD ’s defense of itself , and only by attributing those crime rates to what the police “ say , ” as if they were a matter of opinion , unlike the stop - and - frisk rates , which the paper reports as a fact so indisputable that it does not need a source .
That 2007 slip has never been allowed to reappear , however ; the disclosure of crime rates has been purged from all subsequent Times stories on the NYPD ’s stop activities .
The actual numbers convey the shocking magnitude of the city ’s crime disparities with a vividness that a mere generalized statement about a “ larger percentage of crimes than stops ” cannot , which is why the numbers are almost always left out .
The actual crime rates reveal that blacks are being significantly understopped , compared with their representation in the city ’s criminal population , another reason for omitting them from the paper ’s reporting .
Here are the crime data that the Times does n’t want its readers to know : blacks committed 66 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009 ( though they were only 55 percent of all stops and only 23 percent of the city ’s population ) .
Blacks committed 80 percent of all shootings in the first half of 2009 .
Together , blacks and Hispanics committed 98 percent of all shootings .
Blacks committed nearly 70 percent of all robberies .
Whites , by contrast , committed 5 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009 , though they are 35 percent of the city ’s population ( and were 10 percent of all stops ) .
They committed 1.8 percent of all shootings and less than 5 percent of all robberies .
The face of violent crime in New York , in other words , like in every other large American city , is almost exclusively black and brown .
Any given violent crime is 13 times more likely to be committed by a black than by a white perpetrator — a fact that would have been useful to include in the Times ’s lead , which stated that “ Blacks and Latinos were nine times as likely as whites to be stopped . ”
These crime data are not some artifact that the police devise out of their skewed racial mindset .
They are what the victims of those crimes — the vast majority of whom are minority themselves — report to the police .
You cannot properly analyze police behavior without analyzing crime .
Crime is what drives NYPD tactics ; it is the basis of everything the department does .
And crime , as reported by victims and witnesses , sends police overwhelmingly to minority neighborhoods , because that ’s where the vast majority of crime occurs — by minority criminals against minority victims .
The Times ’s analysis , by contrast , which follows in lock step with the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights , assumes that policing should mirror census data .
The only numerical benchmark that the Times provides for the NYPD ’s stop data is the city ’s population ratios .
According to this analysis , since whites are 35 percent of the city ’s population , they should be 35 percent of police stops , even though they commit only 5 percent of all violent crimes .
But using census data as a benchmark for policing is as nonsensical as it would be to use census data for fire department activity .
If a particular census tract has a disproportionate number of fires , and another census tract has none , no one expects the FDNY to send out fire trucks to non-existent fires in the fire - free census tract just for the sake of equal representation .
The proactive policing revolution that began under NYPD Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1994 declared that the police would actually lower crime — an unheard - of idea in the annals of policing .
To accomplish that feat , the department began rigorously scrutinizing crime data on a daily basis and deploying officers to crime hot spots .
Once there , officers were expected to be on the look - out for suspicious behavior .
If there had been a string of robberies at ATMs in East Flatbush , for example , and an officer saw two guys apparently casing an ATM user from across the street , who then walked quickly away when they spotted the uniform , the officer was expected to stop and question the two men .
If thieves had been preying on senior citizens in Harlem , someone walking closely behind a retiree in the 28th precinct and looking furtively over his shoulder would likely be stopped by an officer deployed there in response to the crime spike .
Those stops may not have resulted in an arrest , if no evidence of a crime were found , but they may have disrupted a crime in the making .
This data - driven , proactive style of policing , which came to be known as Compstat , led to the largest crime drop in recent memory .
The biggest returns were in New York ’s minority neighborhoods , because that ’s where crime was and still is the highest .
Blacks and Hispanics have made up 79 percent of the 78 percent decline in homicide victims since 1990 .
Over 10,000 black and Hispanic males are alive today who would have been dead had homicide rates remained at early 1990s levels .
The Times ’s article is filled with the usual NYPD critics .
There ’s Donna Lieberman and Christopher Dunn from the New York Civil Liberties Union , Darius Charney from the Center for Constitutional Rights ( which is suing the department over its stop policies ) , Jeffrey Fagan from Columbia University law school , and “ researchers ” from the Center on Race , Crime and Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice .
These critics ’ understanding of policing and crime is quixotic , to put it kindly .
At a panel on stop and frisks at the New York City Bar Association this March ( in which I participated ) , Fagan proposed the Chicago Police Department , which does not use proactive stops , as a model of policing that the NYPD should emulate .
Fagan did not mention that New York City ’s homicide rate is two - fifths that of Chicago , and that juveniles in the Windy City under the age of 17 are killed at four times the rate of those in New York , an epidemic of youth killings so severe as to prompt an emergency visit from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder last October .
The director of John Jay ’s Center on Race , Crime and Justice maintains that because the absolute number of homicides committed nationally by blacks , on the one hand , and whites and Hispanics , on the other , is roughly the same ( though blacks commit more ) , there is no black crime problem .
The Times , however , did not consult any minority supporters of Compstat policing to get their perspective on whether the police are bearing down too hard in high - crime neighborhoods .
A good place to start would have been a police - community meeting in East New York , Bedford - Stuyvesant , or other any high - crime area .
Here is what the reporter would have heard from community members :
“ We want more officers , we want more arrests , we want the dealers off the corner . ”
The police cannot respond to these heartfelt requests for public safety without generating disproportionate stop data that can be used against them in a racial profiling law suit .
If a grandmother in a public housing project calls the police about the young drug dealers in her lobby , a properly responsive officer is going to question the youths hanging out there .
The officer is not “ profiling ” the youths ; he is responding to a citizen request for action .
But the NYCLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights will tally all those stops against the police as evidence of “ racial profiling . ”
The police are n’t getting calls from Riverdale residents about the young gang members congregating on the corner or in their lobby .
If they were , the police would respond the same way that they do in Harlem : by finding legal grounds to stop the gang members and let them know that they ’re being watched .
( For the record , the paper cited me as the other voice besides the NYPD spokesman supporting the department ’s stop tactics . )
Contrary to the Times ’s assumption , the fact that an identical proportion of stops of whites and blacks — 10 percent — results in an arrest or summons strongly suggests that the police use the identical quantum of reasonable suspicion in stopping whites and blacks .
The police stop a greater absolute number of blacks because the overwhelming majority of crime , suspicious behavior , and calls to respond to crime occurs in black neighborhoods .
Given the vast disproportion in the city ’s crime rates , you can either have policing that goes after crime and saves minority lives , or you can have policing that mirrors the city ’s census data .
You can not have both .
If the NYPD responds to the incessant pressure from the Times and the city ’s anti-cop activists to conform its policing activity to population rates , the law - abiding residents of high - crime neighborhoods will be hurt the most .
The Times ’s radically incomplete front - page story , like so many that preceded it , only makes the NYPD ’s job more difficult .
It fuels the animosity against the police that makes witnesses less likely to cooperate with officers and suspects more likely to resist arrest .
It is crime , not race , that leads to more stops in minority neighborhoods .
The crime disparities in the city are deeply troubling , and thus have been regarded as taboo .
But until those crime rates are acknowledged , reporting on police activity through an incomplete racial lens will continue to defame the NYPD and mislead the public about its work .
The International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has served seven former officers in the Bosnian Serb army sentences of up to life in prison in connection with the July 1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica .

REUTERS - Seven former Bosnian Serb military leaders were convicted and sentenced to up to life in prison on Thursday for war crimes related to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of thousands of Muslim men in the former Yugoslavia .
Vujadin Popovic , and Ljubisa Beara , two former Serbian army chiefs of security , were found guilty of genocide , extermination , murder and persecution and received life terms , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) said in a statement .
" Popovic knew that the intent was not just to kill those who had fallen into the hands of the Bosnian Serb Forces , but to kill as many as possible with the aim of destroying the group , " the ICTY 's Trial Chamber II said .
Drago Nikolic , another former security chief , was found guilty of crimes including murder and persecution and sentenced to 35 years , while the four other officials received sentences between 19 and 5 years for related crimes .
The judgement on Thursday concerns the largest trial to date held before the tribunal .
The Chamber said it had identified at least 5,336 people who were killed after the fall of UN enclave Srebrenica in July 1995 , but said the total could be almost 8,000 .
The convictions were also for crimes related to the 1995 fall of U.N. enclave Zepa .
The Chamber said the forcible removal of Bosnian Muslims from the Zepa and Srebrenica enclaves was a " joint criminal enterprise . "
The Srebrenica massacre is part of indictments against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic , whose trial is still ongoing , and Bosnian Serb army leader Ratko Mladic , who is still sought for genocide at the enclave .
Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Mladic killed thousands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys after the U.N. - protected " safe area " zone fell into their hands near the end of Bosnia 's 1992 - 95 war .
Most were killed while trying to escape through the woods , or arrested and then taken to places of execution before burial in mass graves .

USA star Landon Donovan believes England striker Wayne Rooney is ' worn out ' ahead of World Cup 2010
American thinks long season will blunt Roo in South Africa ...
The American believes that a long season has taken its toll on Rooney 's body , and that the Red Devils striker will be jaded and tired by the time the tournament rolls around .
The 24 - year - old has played 49 games for United this season , often in a lone striking role , and has struggled with ankle and knee injuries .
And Donovan feels that no one can be at their sharpest after a season such as that .
" Rooney is a top player .
In my opinion , he is one of the best players in the world right now , " Donovan told Yahoo !
Sports .
" But the other part of it is that he has played a lot of games and he is tired .
He is probably worn out .
" Injuries are a part of that .
Things happen when players are tired .
When they just keep adding games to the schedule , it makes it difficult .
" Any time you come into a World Cup , because of the timing of it , big players who play a lot of games in Europe are coming right at the end of their season , so it is always an interesting dynamic how to balance that . "
Donovan played ten games on loan at Everton this season , and his first - hand experience of English football culture means he expects the pressure to be heaped upon the shoulders of Rooney and the rest of Fabio Capello 's squad by the time the tournament begins .
That kind of pressure can only work to the United States ' advantage when they face the English in the group stage , according to Donovan .
" Of course , there is more pressure on the English players , " he added .
" If we do n't do well in the World Cup , people care for a little bit .
But if England does n't do well in the World Cup , it is absolutely devastating to their country , their families , to their people .
" That is something they [ England ] live with .
I do n't know if they look at it that way , but that is how I look at it . "

In late March 2009 , tremors were recorded in the surrounding region , resulting in a magnitude - 4.0 earthquake on March 30 .
The following day , the seven seismologists were in L'Aquila attending a meeting of the Major Risks Committee , a group that advises Italy 's Civil Protection Agency on natural hazards risks .
At a press conference following the quake , committee member Bernardo di Bernardinis told reporters , " the scientific community tells us there is no danger , because there is an ongoing discharge of energy .
The situation looks favorable . "
But on April 6 , a magnitude - 6.3 quake struck , killing more than 300 people and leaving about 65,000 homeless .
Abu Dhabi :
An Emirati and former banker has created a secret code language he says is unbreakable .
Mohammad Gaith Bin Mahah Al Mazroui is challenging skilled coders , hackers and cryptographers to break the encryption of his cipher .
Al Mazroui said there might be only one known cipher to date that had proven to be unbreakable , .
This was called the one - time pad , where every letter was transposed to another letter located a random distance away .
But Al Mazroui said his cipher , which he called Abu Dhabi Code , was based on a group of symbols he said he designed himself .
" Encryption takes a written document and scrambles it , making it an unreadable document , " he said .
" This is called ciphertext and requires a ciphertext decoder to uncode it and return it back to a readable format . "
Encrypting , he said , might replace , for example , every letter ( a ) with ( z ) and replace the letter ( e ) with ( x ) every time it saw it .
So if you were to look at the document it would be difficult to read but a reader could quickly recognise the pattern and replace the letters correctly .
In his cipher , Al Mazroui said every letter was replaced by a symbol that he designed , which he said did not belong to any language in the world .
" I worked for a year - and - a - half till I could reach this international code serving English , Arabic and any other language , " Al Mazroui said .
" I made the symbols up , designed them myself making sure they do n't belong to any language in the world .
It 's a totally a new secret language , " he said .
Al Mazroui said anyone could create their own cipher , and the key length determined the strength of a cipher .
Al Mazroui said many ciphers were a " 64 bit " which was considered somewhat strong , but not excessively .
The cipher which the internet used was a 128 bit , which was deemed very strong by industry standards , he said .
Although it seemed even the strongest encryption could be broken by hackers using coder skills and software , Al Mazroui vowed his Abu Dhabi Code was unbreakable and could be the safest on offer for a host of different applications .
" Experienced coders can use cryptanalysis known as brute force .
This is a technique that attempts to decrypt a document by running through all the possible keys .
But it would be almost impossible to decrypt any document encrypted using the Abu Dhabi cipher , " Al Mazroui said .
Mysteries : Some famous unsolved codes
Kryptos : A sculpture at the CIA Headquarters in Langley , Virginia has baffled some for two decades .
The sculpture contains four encrypted messages , of which only three have been solved .
Kryptos was created and encoded by Washington DC sculptor Jim Sanborn with a system designed by the Chairman of the CIA 's Cryptographic Centre .
The Zodiac Killer :
This serial killer terrorised the bay area of San Francisco in the mid 1960s .
He killed seven people ( although he claimed to have killed 37 ) , and taunted police by sending a series of coded letters to newspapers .
Most of the codes were broken but one remains a mystery .
The killer has never been caught .
Shugborough :
An art history mystery in the form of a sequence of random letters at the bottom of a monument at Shugborough Hall in England .
The inscription ( O U O S V A V V ) is underneath a reversed replica of a painting called the Shepherds of Arcadia by Nicholas Poussin .
The Beale ciphers : The Beale ciphers date back to an 1885 pamphlet which contained the location of buried treasure in the US state of Virginia .
The story goes that a Thomas Jefferson Beale gave a box with three encrypted messages in it to an innkeeper in 1820 .
Attempts have been made to decode the ciphers over the years and it is now believed that the pamphlet may have been a hoax .

BP ’s effort to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico suffered another setback yesterday when a discharge of liquid and gases forced the company to remove the containment cap that for three weeks had been able to capture much of the oil gushing from its damaged well .
Admiral Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard , at a briefing in Washington , said a remote - controlled submersible operating a mile beneath the surface had most likely bumped a vent and compromised the system .
Live video from the sea floor showed oil and gas coursing from the well unrestricted .
By evening , the cap appeared to be back on , nestled in place on the eighth try after about 90 minutes of effort .
Live video showed remote - controlled submersibles frequently moving hoses out of the way so that the cap could be lowered over the spewing oil .
John Curry , a BP spokesman , said funneling of oil and gas through a pipe to the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise would begin shortly after the cap was properly positioned and would return to full capacity “ as conditions permit . ’’
Another system , connected to a drill rig , the Q4000 , continued to operate throughout the day , siphoning oil through a separate pipe near the seabed .
This was yet another complication in BP ’s two - month struggle to contain the tens of thousands of barrels of oil spewing into the gulf .
On Tuesday , BP said it had been able to capture 16,665 barrels of oil through its containment cap , two - thirds of the total recovery operation .
But at 8:45 a.m. local time yesterday , workers noticed liquids escaping from a valve connected to the Discoverer Enterprise .
A technician with knowledge of the situation said that gas had apparently flowed up the part of the pipe containing warm water used to prevent the formation of icelike hydrates .
Out of concern that more gas might come up , creating the potential for an explosion , the Discoverer Enterprise was moved about 50 feet away , taking the cap with it , said the technician , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the work .
Also yesterday , Allen said that two people working with the overall response efforts had died .
One was the operator of a vessel assisting the cleanup in Gulf Shores , Ala. , who was found dead on his docked boat .
The other person died in a swimming pool accident .
Neither death appeared to be directly related to specific duties in the effort , Allen said .
Stan Vinson , the coroner in Baldwin County , Ala. , said the man found dead on his boat was William A. Kruse , 55 , of Foley , Ala .
He was a charter boat captain hired by BP .
As oil gushed fiercely from a mile under the surface yesterday , some beleaguered fishermen in the gulf received a reprieve .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association said it opened 8,000 square miles of previously closed fishing area in the gulf because it had not observed oil in the area .
One area , south of Mississippi , had been closed only since Monday .
Two - thirds of the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico are still open for fishing , and the oceanic agency said the closed area now represented 78,597 square miles .
Still , Florida residents directly experienced the effects of the oil :
Tar balls and oil mousse with the consistency of sludge washed up on the shore of Pensacola Beach and caused several areas for swimming to be closed , said a spokeswoman for the Incident Command in Mobile , Ala .
In Washington , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said yesterday that he was preparing new evidence to support a six - month moratorium on deep - water oil and gas drilling in the gulf and was prepared to vigorously challenge a federal judge ’s ruling Tuesday that the drilling ban was unjustified .
Appearing before a Senate committee , Salazar said the “ pause ’ ’ in the drilling of 33 deep - water wells in the gulf was essential until the causes of the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil leak were fully understood .

If the U.S. Copyright Group ( USCG ) is to be believed , tens of thousands of BitTorrent users are at risk of receiving a settlement letter in the mail if they have shared films without authorization .
The group behind the ' Hurt Locker ' case says it is tracking hundreds of other films for various movie companies .
In March the U.S. Copyright Group imported the mass litigation “ pay up or else ” scheme to the United States .
The initial targets were relatively unknown indie films , but this changed when the makers of the Oscar - winning Hurt Locker joined the lucrative scheme .
Before the actions of the USCG were closely followed by the mainstream media , the lawyers involved had set up an informative website for potential clients where they explained how they could turn piracy into profit .
In several videos the group ’s frontman Thomas Dunlap explained how easy it is to squeeze money out of BitTorrent users .
One fact that they revealed was that the copyright holders have to give up 70 % of the revenue from settlements to the USCG , but their videos contained more insights into the dealings of the group .
For unknown reasons the videos were all taken out of public sight , but they missed one .
As mentioned briefly in an earlier report , Thomas Dunlap claims that they are already following 300 films , and that was before the news about Hurt locker became public .
If each of these films actually results in a lawsuit to reveal the identities of alleged downloaders the number of targeted BitTorrent users will explode .
With ‘ just ’ 500 tracked file - sharers per film there are already 150,000 potential targets at risk of receiving a settlement letter .
It ’s unlikely that the individuals will be taken to court of course , but if they are revealed they will receive a ‘ speculative invoice ’ in the form of a $ 1,500 to $ 2,500 settlement offer .
It does n’t take a lot of imagination to view this scheme as an abuse of the legal system .
Although the group has managed to get a court verdict in their favor for some titles , Judge Collyer of the District of Columbia has asked the USCG to detail why the lawsuits she reviews target hundreds or thousands of defendants and not just one .
It ’s worth nothing though , that even without going through the courts this settlement scheme can still be executed successfully .
The USCG can always go the way of shady outfits such as Nexicon and send the settlement offers directly to the ISPs , asking them to forward them to their users .
Several ISPs have already cooperated with this more direct scheme which successfully bypasses the courts .
With millions of dollars at stake we have no doubt that the USCG will do all it can to rake in as much money as possible , the courts are just a formality to make the scheme look more legitimate and to encourage a higher rate of settlement .

On June 1 , 2010 , thousands gathered at the Israeli embassy to protest Israel 's attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla — and vowed to step up resistance to Israel 's brutal apartheid regime and its U.S. backers .
On June 5 , Chicagoans staged an emergency vigil this evening outside the Israeli consulate to demand safe and free passage of the MV Rachel Corrie in its effort to break the Israeli blockade .
The ship was boarded by Israeli troops and rerouted to the Port of Ashdod .
More Chicago actions related to the Middle East are in the works .
Chicagoans Against Apartheid in Palestine are organizing a Midwest Regional Action , to focus in particular on the use of Illinois - made Caterpillar brand bulldozers for destroying civilian homes in the occupied territories .
Having trouble finding happiness ?
Well , thinking about the happiness of others is the key to finding it ourselves , an expert says .
The founder of the Happiness Institute , Dr Tim Sharp , says overall Australia is a pretty happy nation , although other countries are still doing better .
" When most people think about happiness they think of the question : ' How are you feeling right now ? ' " he said .
" That 's a part of happiness but it 's also much more than that .
What large - scale surveys measure is life satisfaction , or quality of life .
" In addition to the simple questions , they also measure things like access to public transport , public education , public health - those sorts of macro-societal issues .
" If we look at the countries who are doing really well ... in the top five or 10 are the Scandinavian countries .
The reason we think that is , is because they have very strong social support mechanisms .
" They tax really highly but you get a lot back for that : lots of annual leave ; parental leave ; very good access and equal access to health ; education etc .
The other thing we know about those social democracies is that there 's a small gap between the rich and the poor . "
Dr Sharp says most of us are not aware that our happiness relies greatly on others - and vice versa .
He said if people were more aware of that , they might start thinking of others more .
" Most people by nature are selfish and that 's kind of a natural thing , " he said .
" A lot the major philosophies and schools of religion do make some good points , and if you strip away a lot of the language , at the heart of most of them they do say some similar things , and one of them is ' love your neighbour ' .
" One of the hot topics at the moment in positive psychology is connectedness , which means our happiness is dependent on not just what we do , but the people around us and even the people around them .
" So [ that means ] the networks in which we exist - and that 's our work colleagues and family - but beyond that and beyond that again .
" The communities and neighbourhoods in which we live , they all affect our health and well - being , but most people are n't aware of the sometimes quite powerful effects their friends and friends of friends have . "
Dr Sharp says a sort of " wellness movement " seems to be taking place , where people are changing the way they think about their overall well - being .
He says that means the popularity of things such as gym memberships , yoga , tai chi and alternative medicines are skyrocketing .
Mindfuless
But to achieve happiness on a more personal level , he says , learning the art of mindfulness can be key .
" Mindfulness is about being fully aware and if we are going to be happy , successful and productive in every way , [ we need to be aware of ] what we 're thinking , doing , how we 're acting and reacting , " he said .
" We can't do the right things if we 're not already aware of what we 're doing .
" What that then leads to is developing hope and optimism , positive relationships , finding meaning and purpose in what we do .
" Happiness is n't just about those momentary positive emotions , it 's also about believing we 're doing something meaningful in life .
Something that 's important ; above and beyond today 's to - do list .
" Really happy people think a bit beyond that .
They have a life purpose and direction and they 're much clearer about who they are and what they want to do .
" It 's not as though they do n't have problems , but they think about those problems in a more constructive way and are more focused on solutions .
" They have more and better quality relationships and are more appreciative and grateful for what they have . "
Dr Sharp says the good news is that the ingredients for happiness are like skills , so can be learned .
But discipline is the key - and that 's what separates the happiest people from everyone else .
" If people practice things on a regular basis they can be happy .
It 's just like if you go to the gym on a regular basis you 're going to get fitter , " he said .
" The other thing to remember is , no - one is happy every minute of every day , and that 's a really important point .
" It 's fundamentally important that we recognise it 's perfectly normal to experience negative emotions on occasions .
" There 'd be something wrong with you if you did n't get frustrated from time to time ; if you did n't experience some anxiety , stress , sadness or anger .
These are normal human emotions ... and that 's OK . "
Here 's something that should motivate all liberals and Democrats to make sure the Republicans do n't take back Congress in November .

Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry & Big Oil if they won control of Congress ?
Yup , u guessed it – JOE BARTON
That 's right .
Joe Barton would become the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .

Summary :
Ahead of Memorial Day , the President asks all Americans to join him in remembering and honoring our men and women in uniform who have died in service to the country .
Some readers have asked me to provide a simplified explanation of how the modern monetary economy works which is devoid of all the jargon that economists hide within .
As part of another earlier blog , I did present a simple fiscal game which provides all the essential insights you require to understand how a modern monetary economy actually operates .
Like all models it is stylisation .
But there is nothing that I could add by way of complexity that would change the fundamental conclusions and understandings .
So to make the model easier to find for reference purposes later on I an presenting it again as a stand - alone blog .
Read on !
A simple fiscal game !
Here is an example to help you think about all of this economic jargon .
The concepts are simple and the numbers are small which makes it easy to understand and relate to ( thanks to Warren Mosler for the original idea for this heuristic ) .
Imagine the economy is my household which is comprised of me ( the parent ) and you ( the kid ) !
As the parent I assume the role of “ government ” and you thus comprise the non-government ( private ) sector .
As the government I decree that I will offer 100 of my personal calling cards per week , if you agree to tend the garden on a weekly basis .
These are the cards I exchange at meetings with various professional associates outside of the household .
They are normal size rectangles of cardboard .
You say , naturally : “ Why would I want your worthless personal calling cards ? ”
I reply ( reflecting my knowledge of how modern monetary systems like the household work ) : “ because to stay living in the house I expect 100 personal calling cards a week to be paid in taxes ” .
You say : “ when do I start work ! ”
Immediately , by imposing tax obligations in the currency of issue ( the personal calling cards ) I have created a demand for the currency and this allows me to transfer private resources ( your work in the garden ) to the public sector ( the nice garden ) .
However , also note that I have to spend the 100 cards each week before you can pay the tax of 100 cards – which clearly means that the taxation can never be considered a source of revenue which “ finances ” or allows me to spend the cards in the first place .
The cards come from no - where and I have the monopoly rights to spend them .
I am never financially constrained in my own personal calling cards ( the currency ) .
So this sort of currency is what we call a fiat currency – being made legal by legislative fiat .
It has no intrinsic worth and its value is tax driven .
Just like the Australian dollar !
Note that I probably would never “ print ” any cards .
I would run some spreadsheet on the house computer and just keep “ bank entries ” to record all the outflows ( spending ) and inflows ( taxation ) .
All the transactions would just be numbers entered into relevant columns .
If I slipped up and added a 0 to my spending one week , I would n’t have to “ print ” 900 new cards .
You would be better off by 900 cards because it would show up as a deposit in your account .
But nothing else would be required .
Same as in the Australian economy .
Now under these conditions , the household ‘ budget ’ would be balanced each week : I spend 100 cards and you pay 100 cards .
You are unable to accumulate any cards ( that is , save ) because you can only get access to the volume of cards that I make available via spending .
Same as in the Australian economy .
What if I wanted to teach you to save as preparation for managing your own affairs when you became an adult ?
Well the only way you can save is if I , for example , decided to employ you more each week and offered , say , 120 cards per week as wages ( government spending ) yet continued to tax you only 100 cards .
The same effect could have been if I reduced the tax rate and held spending constant or a combination of increasing spending and reducing taxes .
Whatever , and lets stick to the spending of 120 and the tax of 100 , the fiscal position now goes into deficit of 20 cards per week .
You now can save 20 cards per week because my spending ( the government spending ) has provided the “ finance ” to permit you to do that .
As the weeks go by you could accumulate more and more savings ( numbers in the spreadsheet would increase ) and you would soon see that the non-government saving over time is the exact record of the cumulative deficits being run by me ( the government ) .
Same as in the Australian economy .
Now , you might want to make more money ( cards ) on your savings .
The only way that can happen is if I offer you a government bond ( a bit of paper saying that if you deposit your savings with me each week I will pay them back at some future time plus some interest all in personal calling cards ) .
So the offer of a new financial asset – the household debt instrument ( the bit of paper ) gives you a chance to compound your saving and maybe take a holiday – not work some weeks but still pay taxes !
So the debt issuance in the household establishes a non-zero rate of interest in the household and increases your wealth .
I did n’t have to issue the bond to keep running the deficits .
The bond just replaced non-interest bearing savings ( reserves in our “ banking ” system ) with an interest - earning asset ( the bond ) .
Same as in the Australian economy .
Now lets say I am reading some neo-liberal literature on the Internet which warns me against running fiscal deficits .
As a result I get the feeling we have to get back into fiscal surplus to be a responsible government .
So I tax 100 cards but cut my spending on garden work to , say 90 cards per week .
Can you predict what will happen now ?
Well in that particular week there are not enough cards “ spent ” to generate the funds necessary for you to pay the tax .
There are 10 cards short .
The household ( government ) fiscal position is in surplus for that week to the tune of 10 cards .
But this shortage of cards liquidity in the private sector ( that is , you ! ) means that you will :
( a) Demand more work to earn the shortfall – noting that the household has now reduced employment levels ( in hours ) and there is some underemployment creeping in .
If I made the example more complicated with 2 or 3 kids in the house I could have easily cut spending by not paying anything to one or more of the kids thus creating unemployment .
( b) Try to sell some of your possessions to get some cards .
In this simple case , you will offer your bonds ( the bits of paper ) for sale to get the funds .
So the surplus starts to eat away at your wealth portfolio .
I would be boasting like a neo-liberal would that I was running down the government debt – “ getting the debt monkey off the government ’s back ” – which may help me sleep better – but you would just be feeling less well off ( and maybe developing insomnia ! ) .
( c) Start to run down any savings that are not being stored in bonds .
Either way you run down your wealth holdings .
But in aggregate , the fiscal surplus is squeezing your card liquidity and forcing you to run down wealth .
Same as in the Australian economy .
If I kept running fiscal surpluses , you would eventually run out of assets and your labour would be severely underutilised .
You might be able to persuade me to start lending you the money ( I might set up a privatised bank in the household ) and this would keep you afloat ( paying the taxes ) as long as you were prepared to accept increasing private debt levels .
But this is not a sustainable option .
Same as in the Australian economy .
The English Expert
As an American teaching English at a foreign university , I was usually treated as an English expert .
But although I grew up speaking English , my knowledge of English grammar is shallow .
When students would ask me why a phrase is grammatically correct , I often just said , “ Because . ”
In the classroom I used to play a game called Stump the Expert .
Students would ask me a question about English grammar .
If I could answer the question successfully , I received a point .
But if I could n’t , students received one .
Here were the kinds of questions which students would throw at me :
Which is correct ?
“ There is a man at the door . ”
Or “ A man is at the door . ”
Is it better to say “ last a month ” or “ last for a month ” ?
What ’s the difference between saying “ I am finished ” and “ I have finished ” ?
Should I say , “ I could eat a horse ” or “ I could have eaten a horse ? ”
Which is better to say ?
“ there is nothing to do ” or “ there is nothing to be done . ”
What are the English words that Kurt Cobain sings in “ Pennyroyal Tea ” ?
Do I “ pull a door handle ” or “ pull on a door handle ? ”
Every time we played this game , my students won .
Always .
I felt lucky if I answered one or two questions correctly .
Nowadays I could probably search the Internet for an answer , but way back in the 20th century , people had to think on their feet .
Tough times indeed .
At University of Vlore teachers were happy to have me as an English language resource even though it must have infuriated them that the intricacies of English grammar came so effortlessly to a native speaker like me .
During Enver Hoxha ’s communist regime , Albanian teachers had limited access to English material .
Many learned English from visiting Chinese teachers who visited Albania in the 1970s .
Any interest in Western cultures was viewed with suspicion .
One teacher in Vlore was punished by authorities for trying to have a conversation in English with a foreigner .
Many people had been imprisoned arbitrarily , including the man who would later become my supervisor at Vlore University .
This man ’s name was Abdyli Vasjari .
Adbyli was a short 60 year old man who had spent all his life trying to perfect his understanding of English .
Now he was head of the university ’s new English department .
When I first met him , he was excited to meet an American for the first time .
He spoke slowly and self - consciously , constantly interrupting himself to ask , “ Is that the correct way to say it ? ” Despite being physically infirm by diabetes , he was eager to catch up for lost years .
“ As you see , ” he said , pointing to the two or three books on his bookshelf , “ the problem is that we do not have enough books .
We need more dictionaries , more learning material .
Have you heard of the American Heritage Dictionary ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said , “ It is a great dictionary .
I used to have it at home . ”
“ Look at my dictionary , ” he said , pointing to a well - worn copy of a slim British dictionary .
It looked more than 50 years old , and I could see that he had underlined many words and jotted notes in the margins .
“ This is what I had in prison .
It was forbidden , but I used to read my dictionary and my English books to pass the time .
Is that correct ?
Pass the time ?
Or is it simply ‘ pass time ? ’ ”
“ Pass the time . ” I said .
“ Robert , ” he said with a laugh , “ It will be so good to have you here . ”
I told him that a friend of mine probably could send the American Heritage Dictionary to me .
But because of the international postal system , it could take 2 or 3 months to arrive .
“ Three months is nothing , ” he said .
“ Great pleasures always require a long wait . ”
“ By the way , ” I said , “ where is the bathroom ? ”
“ The what ? ”
“ The bathroom .
The restroom . ”
“ Oh , you mean the w.c . ”
Now I was confused .
“ No , I have to use the restroom . ”
“ Yes , yes , yes , the w.c .
The water closet . ”
“ Oh , That ’s right .
In America , we say “ bathroom . ”
“ Interesting , ” he said with perfect seriousness .
“ Very interesting .
You open this door , and walk to the right , and it is …..1 , 2 , 3 doors .
The third door is the … bathroom , you say ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ And you will go there to pass water , right ? ”
“ Uhhh , we would not say that . ”
Abdyli opened his old dictionary and ruffled through the pages .
“ Aha , ” he exclaimed , pointing to a passage .
“ Pass water — to urinate .
Spend a penny . ”
“ Actually in the US we have an idiom , ‘ To take a leak . ’ ”
“ Take a leak ? ” he says , disbelievingly .
“ So now you will take a leak . ”
“ That ’s right , ” I said .
“ Usually only men will say it . ”
“ Excellent , ” Abdyli said .
“ Very interesting . ”
Abydi was working on a doctorate in linguistics .
I did not know a single thing about linguistics .
I guessed that Abdyli was behind on the subject too , but as it turns out , Albanians had a very good grasp about certain areas of linguistics ( such as morphology , lexicology and linguistic typology ) while having almost no exposure to the more common specializations ( like sociolinguistics or semiotics ) .
I still remember the subject of his dissertation , “ A comparison of medical terminologies of the English , Russian and Albanian languages . ”
I remember wondering how anyone could write a dissertation on THAT .
It struck me as boring .
But Abdyli found the subject thrilling and seemed to delight in perusing medical textbooks and dictionaries and writing down his ideas .
Once , Abdyli opened my classroom door and interrupted me during one of my lectures .
He held his hand out , pointing to the 4th finger .
“ What is this ? ” he asked .
“ Do Americans refer to this as the ‘ ring finger ? ’ ”
“ Yes ” I said .
“ Thank you , ” he said , closing the door .
Adyli had a slow gait and often you had to be patient to walk with him .
He drank a lot of Turkish coffee and liked talking about the communist regime and Bill Clinton ( who was very popular in this country ) .
This was before the sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky , so everyone regarded Bill Clinton with admiration .
Albania had a leader named Sali Berisha .
He was an economist who desired good relations with the United States .
I had even heard Berisha speak English on TV .
I once mentioned to Abdyli that I thought Berisha ’s English was fairly good .
Abdyli scowled .
“ Sali Berisha does n’t know English at all . ” he said .
“ If there were a competition between me and Mr. Berisha on English grammar , I could show him where the crabs go in the winter … ”
“ Crabs …go in the winter ?
Is that some kind of Albanian idiom ? ”
“ No , ” he said , “ I just made that phrase up . ”
I tried to respect Abdyli ’s learning , especially because I knew that Abyli did n’t have opportunities available to most people in his field .
He talked often about visiting America , but recognized that his diabetes would make it hard for him to travel .
“ Sometimes , ” he said , “ I wish that Americans could experience for a short time what communism was like .
Then they would appreciate their freedoms .
But soon freedom will be a common thing for Albanians . ”
A few months into the school year , a big box arrived for me at the university .
It was from a friend back home .
I opened it in Abdyli ’s presence .
The box contained a few magazines , a letter , some cassettes and a gigantic dictionary .
It had a big red cover and must have weighed at least 10 pounds .
It was not an American Heritage dictionary , but my friend had bought something comparable , presumably because he had found it at a better price .
Abdyli immediately took it and started flipping through the pages .
“ Very nice , ” he said , “ very beautiful .
This is a great day for the university . ”
A secretary from an adjacent room came in and looked in amazement at the dictionary , which was bigger than any book she had seen .
Abdyli spoke to her in Albanian , pointing out some of the book ’s features , the tables and the etymologies .
Then , looking at the cover , Adbyli , noticed the dictionary ’s name .
“ It is a very nice gift , ” Abdyli said .
“ But unfortunately , it is not the American Heritage Dictionary .
And that is what I need . ”
After teaching at the university for one year , I encountered many odd things .
Tyrannical secretaries , broken copy machines .
Power outages .
Students paying no attention to my class so they could watch a school of dolphins from the window ( the university was situated along the coast ) .
But nothing had prepared me for the byzantine rituals surrounding the university entrance exams .
The university had a formula for determining which students were admitted .
It combined a student ’s past grades with the result of an entrance exam .
These scores were later posted by the university ’s main doors for students or parents to see .
Several times Adbyli mentioned that my help would be needed for the entrance exam .
I would be happy to help , I told him .
In the USA I used to work for an educational testing foundation .
But as the day for the entrance exam approached , Abdyli was still vague about what I was supposed to do .
Every time I asked , he gave vague answers .
Finally on the day before the exams , he admitted that the entrance exam had already been written and I would be needed only to grade it .
On Saturday morning , I arrived at 8:30 AM ( thirty minutes before the exam ) .
Jittery students who wanted to take the English entrance exam stood outside the building .
I walked past them and into the English department office , where three Albanian teachers were waiting .
Everyone was in formal dress , ready for the big day .
I was curious to see what an Albanian entrance exam would be like , so I asked Abdyli to see the test .
“ That is not allowed . ” he said .
“ That ’s right , ” another teacher said .
“ No one can see the test until the time is finished . ”
I must have smirked , because the teacher immediately added , “ We understand that the American system of administering tests is probably different from our way . ”
“ Perhaps later we can improve this method , ” Adbyli added .
We sat in the room , listening to students being escorted into classrooms .
At about 9:00 AM , Abdyli said solemnly , “ The exam will begin any moment now . ”
“ What is happening now ? ”
“ The educational officials are now in the rector ’s office to approve the exam .
After the approval , the secretaries will distribute exams to all the rooms . ”
We had sat in the room quietly for 20 minutes doing nothing .
Finally I excused myself , walked to the rector ’s office and peeked through the window to see what was happening .
I could see some formal ceremony , with four or five individuals opening the box of exams while another recited a statement in Albanian .
The vice - rector , noticing that I had opened the door to watch , held his hand out to prevent me from watching any further .
I just wanted to observe , I told him in Albanian .
But the vice - rector repeated that I had to leave ; it was forbidden for me to watch any part of this process .
I returned to the English department office where the other English teachers were drinking coffee and reading the newspaper .
“ So when will we see the exams ? ” I asked .
“ It is forbidden , ” Abdyli said .
“ We must stay here during the whole time .
We will see the exams only when it is time to grade them . ”
“ So I have to stay here ? ”
“ Yes , and at 2:30 , we will start grading , ” another teacher said .
“ I ’m going home , ” I said , irritated that I had woken up early for no reason .
And so I walked home , read a magazine , took a nap and ate lunch .
At about 2:00 I walked to the university .
When I arrived , the security guard tried to tell me something ; he had been searching for me .
I understood his words , but not his meaning .
He said the students had been asking questions about the test , and that he had been sent by Abdyli to find me .
At the department office , I found the same three teachers .
They had been sitting wearily all morning and were eager to get the tests graded .
Five minutes later , we were led into a room with the finished exams stacked on a table , ready to be graded .
After all this waiting , I was eager to see the exam .
Our job was first to write an answer key and then to grade the exam from it .
I had not expected the exam to be perfect ; I knew that an English exam in a foreign country would probably have mistakes .
But nothing prepared me for what I saw .
The three page exam was a mess .
A reading passage contained multiple grammatical errors and even included a statement that sounded almost racist .
( It seemed like a passage from a 19th century British novel about colonialism ) .
The questions about the reading passage were vague , and one of the questions was even missing a few words .
On the next section you had to match verbs on left column with the appropriate preposition on the right column .
But the person who wrote the test must have forgotten one or two answers , so the items could n’t be properly matched .
The third section covered verb agreement .
The sentences themselves had minor grammatical problems , but that was not important .
Part of the difficulty was that the test had been handwritten , and one or two words were not legible .
Finally there was an essay question .
I ca n’t remember what the essay question was ( except that it was strange and artificial ) .
But at least it was written in plain English .
Despite the fact that the university officials had taken elaborate measures to guard the exam from potential cheaters , it had never occurred to anyone to check the exam beforehand for accuracy .
The exam had been secretly written by an English teacher in another city and shipped to the University of Vlore unseen by anyone .
I spoke up immediately .
I had no idea what answers to give for this test .
The test had so many mistakes that perhaps the test as a whole was defective .
It would be impossible to judge a student ’s competence on the basis of this test .
A new test would need to be given .
The other teachers were stunned at my words .
Abdyli warned me that redoing the entrance exam was impossible .
So I started to go over each question with the teachers to point out why the answers ( and the questions themselves ) were n’t right .
For example , one question in the reading comprehension section asked for information which was n’t even included in the reading .
Perhaps the test creator had accidentally omitted a paragraph .
Amazingly , after I started criticizing , the other English teachers started noticing errors — missing words , missing articles , ambiguities in the wording .
Once we started criticizing , we could not stop ; every time another teacher noticed other defect in the test , we started laughing hysterically .
The situation was absurd ; that in fact was why so many students had been bothering test monitors and why the security guard had been sent to find me .
Later , the rector ( an economist named Sezai ) came to check on our progress .
Abdyli began to explain the problems with the test .
Sezai interrupted him and said , “ just grade the test and do n’t worry about the errors . ”
All the teachers began talking at once .
I did not speak Albanian very well , but I was fluent enough to explain that in my opinion the test had too many defects to be accurate .
After listening , Sezai suggested a compromise : throw out the defective questions and only grade the questions which were fair .
Besides , the exam was not the sole factor in determining admission , so a few mistakes on the test were not worth worrying about .
Everyone in the room began talking and arguing .
Finally Sezai called for silence and harangued the other teachers with a long speech .
My Albanian was n’t good enough to follow what was being said .
But I guessed that Sezai was scolding them for causing a mess ; he admitted we might have valid concerns , but there was nothing they could do at this point .
The English teachers were there for one reason only : to grade the test .
Sezai started talking about principles and obligations and that it was their duty to do a fair a job as they could , that students and parents depended on it .
So there was no reason to bicker about minor problems on the test .
The rector paused and let the words sink in .
But Adyli spoke up .
I could usually understand Abydli ’s Albanian , but on this occasion he spoke quickly and with flowery language .
Even if I could n’t understand him , I knew he was saying it with passion and precision and wit .
Abdyli did n’t care one bit — not one bit ! — about politics or economics or ideology , but one thing he felt genuine passion about was grammar .
And if you asked him to compromise on that , he would rather choose death .
So here is the speech I imagine Abdyli saying in reply :
My dear Sezai .
I understand that as rector you need us to complete our task in a timely fashion .
Nobody here more than I wants to go home and spend the rest of the day with family .
But the English expert , our guest from America , has already identified numerous defects in this exam .
The other Albanians and I have found many more .
We found more than 20 mistakes .
We are not here to point fingers or criticize the process which led to this exam .
Instead , we want to ask whether this exam could accurately assess English language competence .
You and I are of the same generation .
You remember how we were deceived on behalf of an ideology .
You remember all the talk about Western imperialism and oppression by the bourgeoisie .
Now our duty is to avoid repeating those same mistakes and lying to our young people .
But if this exam serves as the determining factor for admission , we are essentially saying that concern for truth is not important .
If we choose the easy solution , why should students trust anything that we say ?
Foreign language instruction depends on helping students to understand the rules of grammar and how they influence meaning .
Perhaps it is of no consequence to you if a student uses the English definite article “ the ” or indefinite article “ a . ”
But saying “ Communism is an ideology ” instead of “ Communism is the ideology ” is the difference between freedom and tyranny .
It is time - consuming and embarrassing for a university to admit that the entrance exam was defective .
But if we say nothing , students will start with doubt in their minds .
They will wonder if our generation really has any wisdom to give them .
As the British poet Alexander Pope said , “ To err is human ; to forgive is divine . ”
Now is our opportunity to show parents and students of this city that we are human , and that as humans , we make mistakes and learn from them .
The rector had been smoking his cigarette during Abyli ’s long speech .
He listened with patience and mild irritation .
When the speech was finished , Sezai laughed and said , “ Abdyli , your speech has a lot of pretty words , and maybe on another day I would be in a better mood to appreciate it .
But this is not a solution , and you know that .
We are not here to make speeches but to grade exams .
You are making a very simple task sound complicated .
Decide which questions are not defective and grade them .
That ’s all .
Are we in agreement here ? ”
“ Yes , ” Abydli said with a bit of irritation .
All of us were tired , so the English teachers agreed to return Sunday to start the grading .
On Sunday I showed up at the university to do that , but after 30 minutes , I became frustrated and started arguing again .
But by this time , Abydli was sick of arguing and just wanted to finish .
We agreed that it would be easier for the Albanian teachers to grade the exams without my help .
On Monday , I would travel to Tirana .
Before I did , I stopped by the university .
I found Adbyli drinking Turkish coffee outside the university .
I asked him how the grading went .
“ It is done .
Let us speak no more about it . ”
“ Agreed . ”
“ Robert , I need your help for another urgent matter . ”
“ Ok , ” I said .
“ Your American president has decided to visit the city of Vlore .
He will be here tomorrow . ”
“ Here ? Tomorrow ?
That ’s impossible . ”
“ The mayor told me personally that President George Bush will be here tomorrow to visit Vlore . ”
“ Peace Corps never told me anything like that .
Believe me , if an American president were visiting , I would know . ”
Abdyli waved in the air .
“ Maybe .
Maybe not .
But the mayor has asked me to help him write and translate a short speech for President Bush when he arrives .
Also he asked me to be present during the ceremony , in case he needed me to interpret . ”
I was speechless .
“ You must have heard wrong , ” I said .
“ There ’s no way that Bush is visiting Albania , much less our small city .
And even by some miracle he came , I seriously doubt that he would be listening to speeches from mayors at every single town he visits . ”
“ You may be right , ” Abdyli said .
“ But this is my assignment .
It is good for the mayor — and vital for the city — that we leave a good impression on your president .
Our relationship with your country is strong ; it must be stronger .
Here is the translation I have made so far . ”
Your greatness : Your nation is great and undeniable ; this city , to which I direct as mayor , has a long and great history , starting with the ancient Illyrians .
( “ Illyrians ?
Do you say Illyrians ? ” he asked .
“ It ’s an exotic word but ok in this case ” ) .
We welcome the spirit of your democracy , the kindness of your peoples , the stubbornness of your economic ambitions ( Say “ determination , ” I said ) .
You are a young country , but you can teach us many things : how you control your businesses and how to elect leaders with democratic process .
This ancient city of Vlore has always been a place for travelers to relax and laugh and sleep and see dreams of society .
We hope that your sojourn in Vlore will be enjoyable and that you will see the beauty of our people and our ancient great land ( “ Great ancient land , ” I added . )
“ Our struggle against communism was not easy , but we are grateful that you allied with our people during the time when we needed your support .
“ Should I give a greeting to Barbara Bush ? ”
” Like what ? ”
We wish that you and your Mrs. Barbara Bush will bring to Texas sentimental memories about the beautiful beaches you have seen in Vlore .
“ That ’s a little too much , ” I said .
“ Ok then , ” Abydli said , pausing to study the pattern of coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup .
Abdyli had once said that some people used these patterns to predict the future .
“ The mayor wants me to insert something about Uji i Ftohte and Llogara .
How does this sound ?
Ms. Bush , we hope that you will have the possibility to visit our Cold Water and Llogara tourist destinations and see how our businessmen are improving the possibilities for future generations .
“ That sounds fine , ” I said , trying to take the task seriously .
As it turns out , President George Bush Sr. did visit Vlore .
I heard about it later from a Peace Corps staff member in the capitol .
Apparently when George Bush was president , he had accepted an invitation from Berisha to visit the presidential villa in Vlore after Bush left office .
Bush traveled with Colin Powell to the villa directly from a US naval base in Italy .
He stayed at the villa — a few kilometers away from Vlore ’s city center — for a day and returned to Italy the next day .
Bush never had time to meet the mayor from Vlore .
I was away from Vlore the whole time .
I have no idea what George Bush did at the villa .
One Albanian student who was walking down the coastal road that morning ran into the U.S. President unexpectedly .
Mr. Bush was in jogging shorts , and flanked by a half dozen Secret Service ( also in jogging shorts ) and a slow - moving military jeep .
The student had just gone outside to buy bread and suddenly found himself face - to - face with a sweaty but friendly - looking man who was once the most powerful person on the planet .
The sweaty jogger smiled and said “ hi ” as he passed by .
Seconds later , the whole caravan had passed .
As quickly as Bush had arrived in Vlore , he had left for good .
There is a sad ending to this story .
Little did we know it at the time , but the country of Albania was about to be caught up in political upheaval .
Fraudulent elections , national strikes and hundreds of thousands of people being cheated out of their money by pyramid schemes .
Ironically , the crisis was escalated by the government ’s heavy - handed attempt to arrest student protesters at University of Vlore .
I waited in the capitol city Tirana for almost a month in the vain hope the situation would stabilize .
It did not .
Every few days I telephoned Abdyli ( who was one of the lucky few in the city with a telephone ) .
Classes had been canceled .
Abdyli lived a good distance from the university anyway , so there was no reason to go there — especially because he walked slowly due to his medical condition .
The streets were not safe .
An armory had been raided , the police had left town , and all kinds of thugs were around .
I ’m guessing the professor stayed home .
I have no idea what he did to pass the time .
Probably he watched TV , took care of his family , worked on his doctoral research .
He seemed disconsolate whenever I called him from America .
“ It ’s very bad , Robert , ” he said .
“ Let us not speak of it . ”
One reason for my calls ( among other things ) was to ask the professor ’s help in retrieving my things from my Vlore apartment .
But Abdyli seemed disconnected from the anarchy outside of his flat .
He did n’t want to talk about the political situation .
His physical condition had been deteriorating ; months later when university classes had resumed , he had trouble just showing up for class .
I did not call him often ( at the time phone calls were expensive even for Americans ) .
Once , when I called , his son answered the phone .
“ Abdyli eshte i vdekur . ”
The longer I was away from Albania , the easier it was to forget the language .
But I definitely recognized the word “ vdekur . ”
It meant “ dead . ”
I could n’t believe it , so I telephoned a student who lived nearby Abdyli and asked her if it were true .
“ It ’s not true , ” she said .
“ If he had died , I surely would have heard about it . ” I asked her to check anyway .
An hour later I called my student again .
“ I ’m afraid it is the truth .
He had been sick for a while . ”
So Abdyli had died .
I could n’t believe it .
I was both sad and angry .
He had spent half his life delving into linguistics and English grammar and culture .
It was a pursuit that had brought him to prison and brought poverty to him and his family .
A teacher ’s life in Albania was not easy .
The salary was not good , and it required giving private lessons ( and navigating through the tricky ethics of having to help the same students you were supposed to be grading ) .
And yet during the year and a half I knew Abdyli , he was giddy as a schoolboy both about teaching and the freedoms of academic life .
Perhaps his students found linguistics dull , but Abdyli was energized by the opportunity to pursue the subject without ideological control .
For various reasons Abdyli never had the opportunity to obtain a doctorate , but the Ministry of Education was now requiring all university teachers to have one .
Abdyli in his 60s suddenly found himself needing to write a dissertation .
Despite his complaints , Abdyli knew that he finally found his calling : pondering grammatical structures , perusing obscure texts , transcribing handwritten notes to the computer ( with a secretary ’s assistance ) .
A grant allowed him to attend six weeks of linguistics seminars at a university in Italy .
That brief excursion had rejuvenated him ; it had also shaken him .
“ I now see how much remains to be learned , ” he told me .
“ I ’m afraid that for someone my age , there will not be enough time .
A good part of my life has been wasted . ”
These words might sound pessimistic and even bitter , but there was a kind of awe in his voice when he said it .
He knew that his students would now have educational opportunities he had never thought possible .
He recognized that his specific life had limits ; he even accepted them ; at the same time he was thrilled to be inundated by new books and foreign visitors ; keeping up with it all was an intellectual challenge worth savoring .
Unfortunately during that last year he had also seen things unwind both in his country and his personal life .
He had lived to see his country overcome the legacy of a political dictatorship ( even though the giant concrete letters H - O - X - H - A on a distant hill were still visible to people of Vlore ) .
He had witnessed firsthand how quickly even the most brutal dictatorships could be toppled .
He had also witnessed how the people ’s elation at having overthrown a dictator so easily could unleash a destructive force — leading to the senseless destruction of public buildings and parks in his own city .
And finally in 1997 , he saw how easily social structures crumbled and how legitimate protests still generated violence reactions .
As much as he wanted his country to embrace democracy , in his declining years he saw that nothing was guaranteed .
A decade later , it was clear that the political upheavals of 1997 were just a blip on the road to political stability .
Albania has moved on .
I wish Abdyli could have realized this ; maybe he did .
The English expert had — for a few years anyway — seen the benefits of intellectual freedoms and paid the price for it .
Students of later generations may take such freedoms for granted , but the English expert — the man who spent desolate days in prison with a dictionary and a tattered Somerset Maugham novel — found in this freedom a kind of solace .

Since we were foolishly underestimating the role of publications and spent no time for that ( perhaps , we would not have been successful in trying to send papers to journals or conferences -- we were students first and even later had no higher academic degrees like PhDs ) , the community did not hear / read about our work .
Those who heard about reacted in different ways : Students in other faculties of TUB tried to imitate our ES .
Most professors took our ideas for nonsense , except for two : a biologist and Prof.
Gast .
Hans -Joachim Bremermann at Berkeley ;
Lawrence .J. Fogel at San Diego ;
Leonard A. Rastrigin at Riga ( USSR ) ;
J. Matyas in Czechoslovakia ;
J. Born ( Evolutionsstrategien zur numerischen Lösung von Adaptationsaufgaben , 1978 ) at Berlin , in the Eastern side of Berlin Wall ;
G. Rappl ( Konvergenzraten von Random Search Verfahren zur global Optimierung , 1984 ) at Munich .
I have decided to start a series of posts on the History of Evolutionary Computation ( HEC ) .
Therefore , I shall focus my attention to the three main branches of Evolutionary Computation ( EC ) : Evolution Strategies ( ES , from the German word ) ; Evolutionary Programming ( EP ) ; and Genetic Algorithms ( GA ) .
The inner core of this ( somehow ) difficult " endeavour " would be writing and reporting what the creators of those methods did to bring into life a new myriad of nature inspired algorithms which have setting up a whole new area of research , their insights and experiments that helped them to write their stories and , also , the history of a new field .
This post does not intend to claim one method is better ( or even the best ) than any other ( a thunderous voice speaks : ) , but just a humble try to understand what were the main ideas behind something new and that represented at its time an example of innovation , what could help contemporary researchers , engineers , achievers , innovators , and so on to build their own innovations .
I think that the difficulties and necessities those pioneers faced and , more important , overcame are full of interesting lessons we may learn from and use them as a source of inspiration , or a manner to simply admire their works .
This first post deals with the pioneer work of three German students that performed early experiments on what would later develop into a new evolutionary algorithm : Evolution Strategies .
Their first experiments happened during the Summer of 1964 at the Technische Universität Berlin ( TUB , Technical University of Berlin ) .
Below , the images of Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel .
Ingo Rechenberg ( ) : Hans - Paul Schwefel ( ) : The third student was Peter Bienert ( it is a pity there is no picture of him on the Internet ) , responsible for an early evolvable hardware experiment : FORO 1 ( ) , the research robot .
When Ingo Rechenberg ( born 1934 ) and Hans - Paul Schwefel ( born 1940 ) were students at TUB , both of them had the opportunity to attend some lectures on the then growing field of cybernetics .
Even though those lectures were not on a regular basis , they could listen to researchers such as Dr. Karl Steinbuch ( 1917 - 2005 ) , a visionary who predicted the modern world of multimedia and an early designer of neural networks :
The learnmatrix Professor Karl Steinbuch : Another professor influenced them : Heinrich Hertel ( 1901 - 1982 ) , a professor of aircraft construction and an instigating mentor who advised his pupils to look into nature as a source of inspiration for aerodynamics shapes and related subjects , and never missed a chance of comparing biological forms ( dolphins , birds , fishes , and etc. ) to the archetypical aerodynamical forms .
It would be worthful noting that Schwefel almost became Eugen Sänger 's ( 1905 - 1964 ) assistant , but Sänger died right before Schwefel accomplishing his diploma thesis .
In such an environment , Rechenberg and Schwefel saw a close connection between cybernetics and any search strategy .
Professor Heinrich Hertel : Professor Eugen Sänger and his wife , Irene Brendt The , a project by Sänger and Irene Brendt .
This project was one of the designs considered for the Amerika - Bomber mission Another historical figure along that time that was ainfluence for any engineer was , with no doubt , the German rocket engineer Wernher von Braun Norbert Wiener can be considered as an early pioneer of cybernetics , the field that gave birth to a whole new generation of scientific investigations :
His seminal book on the same subject :
That was the spirit of the time ( or the ) in which the evolution strategies ( ES ) came to this world .
It seems that was a fruitful age for new ideas ... The first meeting of Rechenberg and Schwefel at TUB was not in 1964 , as some evolutionary computation insiders think , but in November 1963 .
Schwefel was a coworker newbie student at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) and Rechenberg was a seasoned student at the same institute .
Both were studying aerospace technology engineering and their respective duties had nothing to do with cybernetics , bionics , or optimization methods .
Rechenberg , being a more experient member of HFI , could use the wind tunnel during the afternoons -- when the main research assistants had already left .
They started investigating wall shear stress measurements , a subject Rechenberg had been doing for some time .
Later , they decided to work on their own subject : , specially for improving ( or optimizing ) forms of slender bodies ( wings , airfoils , airplane bodies , etc. ) under air flow .
Schwefel main work during this time was ( and for which he was paid for ) organizing exercises for other students , particularly on measurement techniques in fluid dynamics .
Below there are Ingo Rechenberg ( background ) and Hans - Paul Schwefel ( foreground ) at TUB 's wind tunnel : Despite at that time there were well established methods ( mainly gradient - based ones , Gauss - Seidel and etc. ) to deal with problems holding continuous variables , Rechenberg and Schwefel had found out that the traditional approach of changing one variable at a time and the discrete gradient method did not work in experimental optimization , what was the first focus of their research toward evolution strategies ( ES ) .
This impracticality of using those methods is due to the nature of the optimization that takes place in that kind of experiment : Instead of optimizing the parameters of a problem through a computer , the investigator must optimize the real object itself -- without computers !
Experimental optimization means that you have a real physical , mechanical , electrical , optical , chemical , etc. object or some model , like physical , of the real object -- and absolutely no computer -- and you want to alter some of its properties ( size , charge , temperature , pressure , etc. ) in order to achieve an improved performance according to some criterion ( criteria ) .
Before the end of the 1960s Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel did not think of using this procedure ( an early form of evolution strategy , but without computers ) as a numerical method .
Computers were not yet available in larger numbers , and if so , their power was rather weak .
Let alone noisy measurements and multimodality .
However , unlike traditional approaches of that time , changingvariables at the same time in some random fashion ( smaller changes more frequently than larger ones ) could work a little better .
This was the seed of what would later be a new evolutionary algorithm .
At this point almost everything had already been set up for applying their new method .
But another idea came from a somehow strange source ...
A science fiction story by a not so well known writer : Insel der Krebse ( The Island of the Crabs ) , by Anatolij Dnjeprow .
That story has to do with artificial and synthetic evolution ocurring in an island and made by synthetic organisms whichthemselves to .
Rechenberg states that this story ( also ) was his inspiration for using a " population " ( it was just a ( 1 + 1 ) - ES , that is , one parent generating one offspring and both , later , struggling for survival to become the parent in the next generation / iteration ) instead of just one point of search , as it was / is the agenda of traditional methods at the time .
The front cover of Even thoughliterarily covered some of the fundamental ideas ( trial and error , mutation and struggling for life ) of what would later be evolution strategies ( ES ) , there were some methods at the time that had some , even though loosely , similarities with ES , such as George E. P. Box EVOP and the gradient method itself .
But trial and error experimentation with further selection of the best variatons ( mutations ) composed the core of what would be the ( 1 + 1 ) - ES ( also known asor ) .
First there is just one parent ( μ = 1 ) generating , through random mutation , an offspring ( λ = 1 ) .
Then , both of them struggles for survival and the best is taken as the parent of the next generation .
The basic skunk of evolution strategies was born with discrete binomially distributed mutations centered at the ancestor 's position , and just one parent and one descendant per generation .
Since there is only one parent the use of a recombination operator makes no sense .
The absence of a recombination / crossover operator was due to the lack of , at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) , several objects ( airfoils , kinked plates , nozzles , etc. ) and several wind tunnels that could operate at same time .
The reader should remember that the first evolution strategies experimentsperformed in computers .
They were all about experimental optimization , using real world objects and optimizing directly into their features ( charge , weight , drag , thrust and so on ) .
Despite not using a recombination operator during early experimental optimization , some few years ( 1971 ) later , Rechenberg , in his PhD. dissertation , had demonstrated the advantage of such an evolutionary operator , although investigating the effects of crossover on a ( μ + 1 ) - ES ( extinction of the worst ) on a study concerning numerical optimization -- it was along this time he developed a simple self - adaptation mechanism to cope with numerical optimization ( the so called ) .
Moreover , doing some theory was much easier for mutation only .
Therefore , this was done first .
It is a common misconception in genetic algorithm community that evolution strategies emphasize mutation and neglect recombination , what is not true .
Now , having all the ingredients gathered , it was the crucial moment to test the concept of their new method .
Thewas done at TUB on June 12th , 1964 : Six plane planks linked by five adjustable hinges .
It is an aerodynamics problem and its optimum solution is trivial :
All the plane planks must align horizontally ( but the optimal configuration may change depending on the air flux direction ) .
Before doing the experiment , Schwefel used a mechanical calculator with the sum of squares function on integers using binomial mutations to demonstrated the ( 1 + 1 ) - ES would work , at least in principle .
The principal objective of that experimental optimization was minimizing the kinked plates ' drag .
The , an example of experimental optimization : There are 51 ( or 345 025 251 ) possible combinations for the five adjustable hinges .
The first series of tries on thewas made with random start conditions , later other initial conditions were taken into account , even turning out to be easier , requiring less mutations to reach a satisfactory solution , although the optimum solution was known and trivial .
The idea behind using a problem holding a known solution was twofold :
A ) Be able to prove convergence ;B)
Demonstrate that the experimental method devised by Rechenberg and Schwefel did not take too much iterations to reach the optimum ( or a satisfactory solution ) .
Some critics at the time predicted that such a method would need years or even millions of years to find a reasonable solution .
Today it is not uncommon finding out people who claim on the grounds of pure random search when it comes to natural evolution .
The problem set up for the ( experimental ) optimization was finding the best reachable solution for the kinked plates ' aerodynamic configuration , optimizing , along the way , some variables , mainly the drag .
That experiment can be considered as a sort offor an experimental optimization task .is a well known fitness function applied to retrieve the initial feedbacks from a new evolutionary algorithm and / or optimization method .
That function is just a bit counting problem in which the algorithm must find the a binary string that has the maximum number of bits one .
Therefor , if a binary string has length 5 ( 5 bits ) : =
BThen , the best ( optimum ) solution in thatproblem is the string in which all tge bits Bare 1:= 1 1 1 1 1 The core procedure to find the best solution is simply summing up each bit in the string .
Anoptimized by an evolution strategy : Rechenberg and Schwefel selected a simple problem ( the kinked plates experimental optimization ) because they could verify the initial behavior of their method during the optimization search and , thus , they could get the first impressions of their method .
For solving theproblem , they used an early form of a simple ( 1 + 1 ) - ES with binomially distribution random changes in the current best kinked plates ' shape .
In a ( 1 + 1 ) - ES there is just one parent ( μ = 1 ) generating a single offspring ( λ = 1 ) through random mutation .
The whole optimization was made without any computer aid and completely performed by hand .
In the 1960s West Germany , computers were not available as they are today , let alone during that time computational power was weak .
Not to mention the fact that Rechenberg and Schwefel did not think at all of using their method as a numerical optimization search technique until around 1970 .
The migration of the early evolution strategy from the experimental optimization realm to the numerical venue was Schwefel 's " " idea when he began looking for a competitive derivative - free numerical optimization method .
The mutation operator applied was some kind of children 's playing chips with a plus sign on one side and a minus sign on the opposite side .
In the simplest case with two chips the result could be : 1 ) ++ with probability 1 / 4 for changing a variable in positive direction , or ; 2 ) -- also with probability 1 / 4 for changing a variable in negative direction , or ; 3 ) +- ( or -+ ) with probability 1 /2 for no change .
With more chips one could of course produce broader binomial probability distributions .
A Galton box was used too , but only for demonstration purposes ( see the image below ) .
A Galton box and the The amount of iteration ( or generations ) the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES needed was not 200 , but different amountd in two successive tries .
The best solution found was not flat at all , because drag measurements were not exact enough to distinguish between what would be flat and nearly flat .
The experimental optimization 's iterations for the Schwefel 's diploma thesis , finished in March 1965 , revealed the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES can get stuck in such a discrete environments and , henceforth , they decided to concentrate on continuous Gaussian mutations .
For his diploma thesis , Schwefel simulated an evolution strategy on a ZUSE Z23 computer , a creation of the German computer pioneer Konrad Zuse .
In the same year , another student , called H. J. Lichtfuß ( , 1965 ) , got good results optimizing bended pipes through evolution strategy made as an experimental optimization procedure .
Z23 computer data sheet :
The Z23 computer was applied on a wide range of areas , from contructional engineering to ballistics and electronics design .
It was available with compilers for the German formula code and for ALGOL 60 .
The Z23 console : Konrad Zuse : Schwefel programmed the first cotinuous and computer implemented evolution strategy in the Z23 , writing the code in an assembly - like programming language named .
This language was designed for solving mathematical problems and in an easier manner than writing the code in pure machine language .
He took 1000 random numbers from a book and stored them as an array .
His continuous and computer implemented ( 1 + 1 ) - ES program was put on a punched tape .
The objective ( or fitness ) function used was a simple two dimensional parabolic ridge with positive integer numbers for the two variables .
He started his simulation on an evening and got the results the next morning .
When Schwefel got his results he got astonished about the patterns of failure the method revealed depending on the angle of inclination of that ridge and the pattern of the mutations ( e.g. in the Moore neighborhood only ) that method , the ( 1+1 ) - ES with binomially distributed mutations , could be stuck in solutions that even were not local optima .
He found a theoretical explanation for that , finally , within his diploma thesis in 1965 .
Since he could easily see that the univariate ( or Gauss - Seidel or one - variable - at - a - time or coordinate ) strategy would have even more problems on the ridge and that problem would be too easy for a ( continuous ) gradient strategy , he did not test them explicitly .
Although the somehow good results Ingo Rechenberg and Hans - Paul Schwefel achieved using the simple ( 1 + 1 ) - ES , the German academic establishment at that time did not welcome their evolution strategy method in a good way .
The establishment was , indeed , skeptical .
Maybe , this reaction could be an expression of the 1960s optimization methods ' .
Even there were optimization researchers claiming they did not need another search method except the gradient one ( steepest ascent / descent ) .
One of the main researchers at TUB 's Hermann Föttinger - Institute for Hydrodynamics ( HFI ) went to the point of saying that .
After this , Rechenberg and Schwefel had to come back to work in fluid dynamics or they would have to leave HFI and they decided to leave .
After getting away from HFI , Ingo Rechenberg started to investigate the theoretical aspects of the ( 1+ 1 ) - ES and Hans - Paul Schwefel got a job because he had married with his girlfriend , Ms. Antje Schulte - Sasse ( now Ms. Antje Schwefel and the person behind the biennial report Blaues Heft ) and got children some time after marrying .
Then , Schwefel went to an industrial research facility at AEG ( Allgemeine Elektrizitäts - Gesellschaft ) and also maintened an academic connection with the Institute of Nuclear Technology of the Technical University of Berlin .
At the AEG research laboratory , Klockgether and Schwefel made an interesting evolution strategy application :
The optimization of a two - phase flashing nozzle .
That was , again , made as an experimental optimization .
Klockgether and Schwefel needed about 200 generations ( or iterations ) to find a sub-optimal solution for such a problem and it was made 45 improvements on the nozzle initial configuration .
This was made , again , without computers , It was one of the early uses of gene deletion and duplication as evolutionary operators .
The two - phase flashing nozzle set up :
Even today , it is not possible to calculate what happens within such a nozzle : thermodynamically far away from equilibrium , drag between slow water droplets and fast steam , three - dimensional turbulent boundary layer with liquid sub-layer , supersonic behind nozzle throat , and etc .
As someone could ask himself , that design principle behind that nozzle was never applied to real rocket propulsion , because , to do this , someone would need to do the experiments once more for bigger rockets .
At the time , there were some arguments against that nozzle design , being the principal one the non-optimal shape achieved and the strange design method employed .
The first part of this argument seems strange because there was no a priori optimal solution known for the nozzle problem and there is no way of stating a speficic shape is the optimum .
Below , the intial and final nozzle designs :
The two - phase flashing nozzle video : Despite achieving good results employing the new - born evolution strategy method , Rechenberg and Schwefel needed research grants to continue their investigations , but could not get finnancial support because both of them lacked a PhD. degree at the time .
Even though , they made a request for finnancial support , but it was denied .
Later , they tried to convince their professors , Professor Helmcke ( a biologist ) and Professor Gast , to undersign a research proposal on evolution strategies and employ them as research assistants .
But , there were some negative recommendations coming from peer reviewers that analysed the proposal and there was someone who disliked the term " evolution strategy " , what made the " wanna be " research assistants guessing it was made by some creationist .
It was a pity the research proposal was denied , because Rechenberg and Schwefel were thinking of new features for their method : Bigger populations ; theoretical analysis ; new mutation operators ; real - valued variables ; new computer implementations ; and the contruction of an automaton ( FORO 1 , by Peter Bienert ) operating under the rules of their method .
Those features were only investigated some years later along the 1970s and expanded throughout the next 20 years .
But it all makes sense when viewed under the light of how important publications were and are .
Without them , it is almost impossible of obtaining research grants .
The only " publication " they got was a brief article in the popular magazineBelow , Ingo Rechenberg and thearticle :
On the role of publications , Schwefel states : Ingo Rechenberg , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Peter Bienert would come back to work together , in the early 1970s , at the Institute of Measurement and Control Engineering .
Schwefel 's PhD. dissertation was not finished before 1974 , but in the next year he got his PhD. , while Rechenberg got his professorship at , ironically , Technical University of Berlin .
It seems that Peter Bienert stayed at Rechenberg 's new born group at TUB : .
Schwefel 's dissertation results demonstrated that the simple two membered ( 1 + 1 ) - ES behaved very similar to other local search methods , and he realized only multimemberd evolution strategy ( an evolution strategy that has a population bigger than one or two ) could do a satisfactory optimization job with some possitive probability .
Along the 1970s , Rechenberg began to more thoroughly study the theoretical aspects of evolution strategies .
For this task , he used quite simple objective ( or fitness ) functions , such as the sphere model and the corridor .
From these investigations , was born one of the early mechanisms to self - adapt the parameters of an evolution strategy :
The so called 1/5 Success Rule .
The 1/5 rule states :
If less than 20 % of the generations are successful ( i.e. offsprings better than parents ) , then decrease the step size for the next generation ; if more than 20 % are successful , then increase the step size in order to accelerate convergence .
It is an extremely simple rule and its robustness can be considered everything but weak .
However , it was a fisrt step into the quest for a strong self - adaptation mechanism .
The cannonical self - adaptation mechanism was devised by Hans - Paul Schwefel in the second half of the 1970s .
It uses a lognormal function and it is as follow :
The aforementioned self - adaptation mechanism distributes the Gaussian density function in the following way along the axes :
We can clearly see that the use of that mechanism spread the mutation distribution in a ellipsoidal fashion through the fitness landscape , but it can only follow directions that are aligned with the coordinate system and it has no capabilities for getting interdependence among objective ( or fitness ) function 's variables .
When dealing with problems of big dimensions , the ellipsoids become hyperellipsoids that can expand or contract along the axes directions only .
There is a simpler lognormal self - adaptation mechanism :
It also distributes the mutations in the same manner as the previous mechanism , but , instead of being ellipses , the shapes are circles :
It sees no interdependence among variables too and cannot expand or contract along the axes directions as the former mechanism does .
For problems of high dimensions , the circles become hyperspheres .
The other mechanism is almost the same as those ones above , but this one can take into account the interdepence among the variables .
It sees the interdepence through the calculation of the covariance matrix :
The alphas are rotation angles and theis a constant value chosen as 0.0873 .
Now , the mutation operator can spread an offspring along directions non-aligned with the coordinate system :
Now , there is an extra degree of freedom , since the ellipsoids now not only can contract and expand along axes directions , but they can also rotate toward directions that are not aligned with those axes .
Below , there is an example of a generic representation for an evolution strategy individual :
Those developments came from Schwefel 's experiences with numerical optimization and he introduced in his PhD. thesis the well known evolution strategy nomenclature :
The so called comma notation , ( μ , λ ) - ES ; and the plus notation ( μ + λ ) - ES .
Now , instead of using just one parent ( μ = 1 ) and one offspring ( λ = 1 ) , there are μ parents generating λ offspring .
The main difference between the comma and the plus strategies has to do with the selection mechanism .
The plus strategy works as follows :
There are μ parents generating λ offspring and , then , both parents and offspring compose a temporary population from which the best μ individuals are selected to become parents in the next generation ( or iteration ) .
The comma strategy follows a similar fashion , that is , there are μ parents generating λ offspring too , but the selection takes place only in the offspring set from which the best μ individuals are selected to be parents in the next generation .
The plus strategy seems to work better when it comes to combinatorial problems and it can get stuck easily in local optima when performing continuous optimization .
On the other hand , the comma approach is better suited to continuous / parametric optimization problems and one of its main advantages is exactly the selection mechanism which permits a temporary degradation of the best solution found so far to overcome local optima -- however , the comma approach can work poorly if ill configured , for example setting μ = λ , what is a simple random walk .
The inclusion of the crossover ( or recombination ) operator changed a little the " official " evolution strategy notation , adding a new parameter :
The number of individuals involved in recombination , ρ .
Then , the aforesaid notations would be : ( μ/ρ , λ ) - ES and ( μ/ρ + λ) - ES , ρ can be set up to μ ( ρ = μ ) , what permits multi-individual crossover .
There are two types of crossover : Intermediary and discrete .
The first one is just a centroid calculation or the center of mass .
The intermediary crossover scheme :
The other scheme is a simple random selection following a coordinate wise procedure .
The discrete crossover scheme :
In a paper from 1995 , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Günter Rudolph proposed what they calledand included another parameter into the notation :
The lifespan , represented by κ .
The new notation would be ( μ/ρ , λ , κ ) - ES .
That new parameter is important because it would avoid a candidate solution of surviving forever and trapping the search in local optima .
Recently , the derandomization approach has been incorporated into evolution strategies , such as CMA - ES , but this is other long story .
Along the time Rechenberg and Schwefel were developing the evolution strategy , in the other side of Atlantic Ocean there was another community investigating a similar algorithm .
The evolutionary computation communities in each side of the Atlantic Ocean would only meet in 1990 , at PPSN I ( Paralell Problem Solving from Nature , David Edward Goldberg helped to translate that conference name into English from the German ) .
But there was an " unofficial " meeting before this date , in 1989 David E. Goldberg and Yuval Davidor met in Germany , what could be considered the first encounter of both communities .
It is fair to say that when Rechenberg and Schwefel finished their respective PhD. dissertations , no one was aware of Professor John Holland 's pioneer work on genetic algorithms , that was made almost concurrently with the German evolution strategies .
The Germans even " missed " Holland 's seminal book Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems when it was published for the first time , but , later , both of them got aware of Holland 's work ( Schwefel gave Holland 's book as a birthday gift to Rechenberg ) .
Around 1969 - 1970 , Schwefel began to sistematically search for derivative free optimization methods and found interesting works that had , in essence , a similarity with evolutionary approaches : Schwefel tried to contact some of those researchers .
He first got into contact with Rastrigin , in Riga ( USSR ) and with Matyas in CSR -- Rastrigin even sent him a copy of a book ( monograph ) about a random search method he developed in which trials were done on the surface of a hypersphere .
Some years later , Schwefel got into contact with Bremermann , but was unable to maintain any academic connection due to the lack of Bremermman 's address .
Schwefel got some papers from and a copy of Lawrence J. Fogel 's book Artificial Intelligence Through Simulated Evolution
There were no important evelution strategy developments between 1976 and 1988 .
Schwefel began his professorship at University of Dortmund ( now Technical University of Dortmund ) in 1985 and evolutionary algorithms were just a minor topic inside the main branch named systems analysis .
The first student interested in evolutionary algorithms appeared only in 1989 , after hearing of genetic algorithms .
In the next decade ( 1990s ) , evolution strategy and evolutionary computation researchers focused their attentions to theoretical and complexity analysis of evolutionary algorithms and from those investigation have arisen the first steps to formalize evolutionary algorithms , despite disagreements between researchers .
The 1990s also saw the emergence of a new evolutionary based approach : Estimation of Distribution Algorithms
The kind of work Ingo Rechenberg , Hans - Paul Schwefel and Peter Bienert made in the 1960s can be considered an achievement that rarely happens during a lifetime .
After 45 years of hard work it is very beautiful to see their work has helped to establish a whole new research area and all the results investigators all around the world ( and , alas , other planets ) have got .
Nowadays , Ingo Rechenberg is the head of Bionik & Evolutionstechnik group at Technischen Universität Berlin .
Peter Bienert works with him there .
Hans - Paul Schwefel is now retired from the former systems analysis chair ( now algorithm engineering ) at University of Dortmund .
He is an emeritus professor at Dortmund .
