This is how one Russian company decided to design it ’s calendar .
They put on each page the one and same episode but drawn according to their point of view of one of twelve countries .
The first one is Russia , would you guess the rest ?
“ I do n’t agree with a lot of what he ’s done , but I actually recognize that he has a beast in front of him , ” said Lauren Bassi , a teacher who has since left .
“ I ’m not sure there ’s enough money in the world you could pay me to tackle this job . ”
Mr. Waronker , 39 , a former public school teacher , was in the first graduating class of the New York City Leadership Academy , which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg created in 2003 to groom promising principal candidates .
Considered one of the stars , he was among the last to get a job , as school officials deemed him “ not a fit ” in a city where the tensions between blacks and Hasidic Jews that erupted in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , in 1991 are not forgotten .
“ They just said he may be terrific , but not the right person for that school , ” Chancellor Klein said .
Some parents at J.H.S. 22 , also called Jordan L. Mott , were suspicious , viewing Mr. Waronker as too much an outsider .
In fact , one parent , Angie Vazquez , 37 , acknowledged that her upbringing had led her to wonder : “ Wow , we ’re going to have a Jewish person , what ’s going to happen ?
Are the kids going to have to pay for lunch ? ”
Ms. Vazquez was won over by Mr. Waronker ’s swift response after her daughter was bullied , saying , “ I never had no principal tell me , ‘ Let ’s file a report , let ’s call the other student ’s parent and have a meeting . ’ ”
For many students and parents , the real surprise was that like them , Mr. Waronker speaks Spanish ; he grew up in South America , the son of a Chilean mother and an American father , and when he moved to Maryland at age 11 , he spoke no English .
“ I was like , ‘ You speak Spanish ? ’ ” recalled Nathalie Reyes , 12 , dropping her jaw at the memory .
He also has a background in the military .
Mr. Waronker joined R.O.T.C. during college and served on active duty for two years , including six months studying tactical intelligence .
After becoming an increasingly observant Jew , he began studying at a yeshiva , thinking he was leaving his military training behind .
Editor 's note : A version of Glenn Beck 's commentary originally appeared last Sunday in the New York Daily News .
" Glenn Beck " is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
When it comes to our economy , politicians on both sides of the aisle are quick to say that a stimulus package should n't have anything to do with political ideology .
But while that 's nice in theory , it 's impossible in practice because economics and ideology go hand in hand .
" Debit cards also would have another big benefit over rebate checks : a deadline , " says Beck .
Show me an economist who thinks that giving tax rebate checks to our poorest citizens is the best idea and I 'll show you two economists who say that business tax cuts provide the most bang for the buck .
Show me a statistic that proves stimulus packages keep an economy out of recession and I 'll show you two that prove they do nothing but stimulate the deficit .
It reminds me of that old saying , " statistics do n't lie , but liars use statistics " because , when it comes to the economy , almost everyone is a liar .
People simply find the statistics and studies that prove their economic plan is the right one .
It 's just a coincidence how that plan happens to match up nicely with their own political ideology .
The stimulus package awaiting the President 's signature is no different .
Instead of spending weeks having ideological debates about whether the rich or poor , individuals or businesses are more likely to spend their rebate checks , our politicians should instead have been focusing on finding a way for it not to matter .
And I have one .
After Hurricane Katrina , FEMA needed to get money to victims fast , so they tried something new .
Instead of issuing checks , they issued $ 2,000 emergency debit cards for evacuees to use for food , water , and supplies .
As you probably remember , 2005 was n't exactly a banner year for FEMA .
Along with food and water , some hurricane evacuees also bought Louis Vuitton purses , diamonds , and even breast implants .
That caused major embarrassment for the government ( at a time when they were n't exactly in the market for any more of it ) and the debit card program was scrapped .
But while purchasing frivolous items may not have been what FEMA was hoping for , it 's exactly what the government is hoping for now .
Frivolous items have far higher profit margins than boring necessities like food and water , and it's that profit that will ( at least in theory ) trickle down to help create more jobs and eventually stimulate economic growth .
Debit cards also would have another big benefit over rebate checks : a deadline .
One major concern about the checks is how much time it will take for the IRS to issue them ( they 're a little busy processing 140 million tax returns right now ) , then for people to cash them and eventually for that money to be spent .
But all of those problems could be avoided by issuing debit cards with an expiration date .
Give people three or six months to use up the value of the card and , after that , it 's worthless .
Use it or lose it .
Just so we 're clear , I actually hate this idea .
I believe the government should stay out of the way and let the markets correct themselves .
I also happen to think that the only economy that will benefit from this package is China's .
But let 's face it : the stimulus ship has sailed and I hate this idea a lot less than the one that was just jammed through Congress .
Issuing tax rebate checks will not only cost us billions of dollars that we do n't have , but there 's absolutely no guarantee that the money will ever actually be spent .
Issuing debit cards would also cost us billions of dollars , but at least we'd know that every single one of those dollars would be put back into the economy .
And debit cards also have the advantage of looking exactly like credit cards , which will reinforce the behavior that got us into this mess in the first place .
It 's win-win !
Or , is it lose - lose ?
Debit cards come with one other benefit as well : we would n't have to debate who 's more likely to spend them , because it would n't matter .
If they 're not spent , they cost us nothing .
That means neither party will have to needlessly grandstand in front of the television cameras about how they 're fighting for [ insert political base here ] -- and that 's also exactly why an idea like this was likely never even considered .

1 BOX OF DRAWERS
This project took 4 days of thinking and 4 weeks of work .
My wife has been after me to make a box to
keep all her cross stitching supplies in .
Then the “ Not just any Box ” contest came up .
I figured that
I would kill two birds with one stone .
The box is a cube 17 ” square with the feet height of 7/8 ” and
extending beyond the cube 3/8 ” on each side .
It will fit into an 18 ” cube .
I made it as compact as
I could and still hold all her supplies .
Materials :
Case : mahogany
Front : Quilted maple , ebony and quilted sapel .
Drawer sides , bottoms and dividers : maple plywood .
Drawer front and back : Peruvian walnut
Drawer face : quilted maple , Peruvian walnut , poplar
Feet : Wenge
It ’s kind a lot to take in , in just a few pictures so I have included these showing more angles .
For any of the pictures that do n’t show up in full you can view them at
http://www.arealnice.com/box2
Here it shows all the drawers open displaying the pin joinery .
All drawers have full extension wood
dovetailed slides .
Like something that has 24 of anything it gets real boring after a while .
After applying
336 pins in the drawers , I hope not to see any for a long time .
The ends were dyed and dried before
inserting them into the drawers to avoid any bleeding into the maple sides .
.
.
Here is a closeup showing continuous quilted pattern across all drawer faces and the details
of the corners .
The corners were cut 1/8 ” deep and inlayed with walnut .
Then 3 holes were drilled
part way through and filled with poplar dowels .
The endgrain on the dowels surprised me with how good
they looked once flushed .
.
.
The following two show the back with and without the doors open .
Here I tried to made the
back copy the front as far as the drawer layout was concerned .
.
.
I have included some construction details that I felt might be of interest .
I do n’t think I will ever make anything with so many drawers ever again .
The full extension dovetailed
drawer slides seemed to take forever !
Here is one
.
.
A close up view
.
.
How the slide stop was done with a peg
.
.
Here is part of it installed in the box :
.
.
And the other part installed on the drawer bottoms
.
.
For the front and back of the drawers I also used walnut .
For the fronts it allowed
me to drill through the maple to expose the darker walnut .
.
.
For the drawer handles I drilled through the maple surface into the walnut behind it for a great
contrast .
The handles presented another problem .
At first I was just going to put little knobs in
the holes , but my wife was going to keep hundreds if different colored thread in there and I wanted
to have it organized so that she could find it easily .
The solution was name tags built into the
handles .
The slot was the hard part .
I started by putting a groove down the length of wood as
seen here :
.
.
Then after cutting it into handle sized pieces I glued a thin 1/16 ” piece of Laotian Boxwood
on it creating the slot for the label to slide into .
The boxbood is great because it is strong
machines great , and is splinter free .
.
.
Here it is completed and the fixture I used to route the window .
.
.
The last thing is the finish on the quilted maple drawer fronts .
To get the quilted figure to
really stand out I used a brown water based dye very diluted to about the color of a weak tea .
The dye really soaks into the wood especially the quilt pattern .
Then I sanded off just enough
to leave the dye in the quilted pattern .
Then applied a oil poly .
I did n’t want any handles on the box so to keep the doors closed I embeded small magnets in
the case and door .
The lower drawer is opened using the notch above it .
The feet are made from wenge , and I tried to make it look like the box was floating .
I am leaving for California tomorrow so I will answer any questions when I can get online .

The angel followed the single silver airplane with his eyes , until it faded out of sight behind the hills across the bay .
Then he took up his drink again , and turned back to me , to pick up the conversation where we 'd left it .
I was struck again by how ordinary he looked , how completely human in every way except that , looking at him , you knew instantly and beyond any doubt that he was an angel .
" So in Heaven , " he said , " you become exactly as you have always known yourself to be , exactly as you have pictured yourself , treated yourself , exactly as you expect yourself to be . "
I looked over his shoulder , past the balcony railing , across the sun -washed water .
" And Hell ? " I asked .
The angel nodded , as though agreeing with me .
" The same . "

Maybe it would n't have been so bad if we had n't been each other 's First Contacts .
Virgin civilizations , groping each other in the dark .
" Damn it , damn it , damn it , " the smaller of the two men moaned , his head down in his arms on the broken table , as the sounds coming in through the half - boarded - up window swelled louder .
" If they wanted to destroy us , why did n't they just send a missle , an asteroid , a fucking army ? "
The taller man took another drink from the bottle in his hand , staring without seeing at the window .
" We started it , you know . "
" Bastards , bastards . "
" We nearly destroyed them . "
" Should have . "
" It was the linguists , " his voice was rough and slow , detached , almost toneless , " that went out in the first starship .
We taught the Tanatha suicide . "
" Bastards . "
The sounds outside moved away a bit , grew softer .
" Their language was utterly alien .
No reflexive forms , strange verb tenses .
Eventually they learned enough of it to try to ask them questions , eventually they asked them what their word was for ' suicide ' .
They did n't have one . "
" Bullshit . "
" They did n't .
They had no reflexive forms , and ' to be ' and ' to kill ' were such utterly incompatible concepts that they had been literally unable to imagine killing the person that you are .
Until we asked the question , and kept asking it until they understood . "
He took another long drink , a deep breath , and shuddered .
The man at the table raised his head just long enough to wipe his eyes .
" It nearly destroyed their civilization .
They did n't have the millennia of evolved defense mechanisms that we do , the cultural institutions that discourage killing yourself , the structures to deal with it .
" They experimented .
" They died .
" Their cultures crumbled . "
" Not fucking far enough they did n't , " the smaller man muttered , and lay his head down again with a thud .
" They fell so fast .
Our linguists came back on the last starship they sent out , along with what was left of their Tanatha colleagues .
Half the crew died on the way , but they got here . "
" Bastards . "
" And their linguists , the ones that stayed alive , learned our language in return , and one day they knew enough to ask , to ask what was our word for --" " No , no , no , no , no , " the man slumped over the table moaned monotonously , as another explosion bloomed outside and a chorus of voices raised in an ululating scream , full of fear and an incomprehensible ecstacy .

" So you humans are really quite competent , " the alien said , leaning back with another alarming creak in the rocking chair , its massive feet up on the porch railing .
Rodriguez raised his eyebrows , " Not sure I 'd go that far . "
The alien gave a humorous snort , while taking a deep sip from the something - like beer mug in its left upper mandible ( an ability Rodriguez still found disconcerting ) .
" Not entirely complimentary , dear sentient , " it replied , " in that now I must wonder , given this quiteness of competence , why it is that those of you that came to us at the first , and that still are the ones that come to us much of the time , that those humans are , without offense , idiots ? "
The human nodded and leaned back himself , looking out at the children playing in the courtyard .
" A long , sad story , " he said .
The alien beside him made an enimgatic burbling sound .
" Yes , " it said , " we have those also . "
Pakistan protects entire world from the evils of YouTube , sort of more or less by accident .
Probably .
Techheads and other curious persons wondering how this happened are referred to RFC 4272 ( January 2006 ) , which contains interesting observations such as these : Border Gateway Protocol 4 ( BGP - 4 ) , along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before the Internet environment became perilous , was originally designed with little consideration for protection of the information it carries .
There are no mechanisms internal to BGP that protect against attacks that modify , delete , forge , or replay data , any of which has the potential to disrupt overall network routing behavior .
...
The legitimate BGP peers have the context and information to produce believable , yet bogus , routing information , and therefore have the opportunity to cause great damage .
...
By modifying or forging this field , either an outsider or BGP peer source could cause disruption of routing to the announced network , overwhelm a router along the announced route , cause data loss when the announced route will not forward traffic to the announced network , route traffic by a sub-optimal route , etc. Etc , indeed .
To change the subject entirely , the problem with certain things happening on a Saturday is that when you go to work on Monday , no one says " Hey , congratulations on surviving that extremely nasty 18 - hour bug ; I really hate those ! " .
Everyone acts as though everything was perfectly normal , even though , from your point of view , the world has just recently stopped being a sort of little Hell , and returned to its pleasant and shiny normal .
Still not sure if it was food - poisoning or a really high - speed replicator infection or what .
No one else has shown the symptoms , though , touch wood .
There are some links I 've wanted to put up for awhile now that would like to accompany a clever discussion of just exactly what they 're about , but given that I have n't gotten around to writing that discussion yet , it 's left as an exercise to the reader .
What might the amusing phrase Google as an MD5 password cracker mean ?
( See also this tool and this one and this one , and maybe think about the really good image - compression method that involves giving a number to every image anyone actually wants to send , and just sending that number instead of the image . )
One last thing I want to mention before it scrolls away is Justice Scalia 's recent statements on torture .
The underlying argument he wants to make here is that if there are any circumstances , however implausible , under which one might , however reluctantly , do something to someone , then " we 're into a different game " , and you can't anymore say " it 's no good " ( or at least you can't say it smugly and with great self - satisfaction ; one generally assumes that that was a rhetorical flourish and not a key part of his argument ) .
Scalia cheats ( as usual , we grumble ) in both directions .
He describes the usual specious " what if the only way to save everyone in Los Angeles was to smack this guy on the head ? " argument ( which is specious because not only is that really unlikely to ever be the only way , it 's also really unlikely to be even a way , since presumably the guy will just lie until after the bomb goes off ) .
And he uses as his examples of things that are n't really so utterly bad a " smack in the face " and " sticking something under the fingernails " .
He does n't mention waterboarding ( " controlled drowning " ) , say , or electrodes to the Ghraibs , or threatening to behead someone 's children , or poking out the eyes of innocent babies .
So it 's not clear where in there , if anywhere , Scalia would still draw a line .
Maybe he would draw the line at threatening or damaging anyone other than the probable ( or possible , or President - declared ) bad actor from which one is trying to get the information .
But why does n't his argument above , against drawing lines , apply just as well to that line ?
If smacking the bad guy 's kid in the face would get the bad guy to talk and save all those Angelinos , then presumably you still can't say " Oh , this is no good , " , can you ?
And if you can't say " Oh , this is no good " about poking out the eyes of completely unconnected innocent babies ( because there is after all some wildly implausible scenario involving the psychotic baby - hating Evil Emperor Xenu and the hydrogen - bombing of every planet in the galaxy in which you'd be willing to poke those eyes out ) , then you can't say " Oh , this is no good " about anything , and he 's sort of reductio'd himself out of the room .
Don 't 'cha think ?

I just got back home from our Texas caucus .
What a pleasant experience , compared to this story about a congressional campaign for sale ... or so it would seem .
Anyway , I wanted to point out a benefit of a caucus AFTER a primary that uses electronic voting machines .
The caucus should match the vote , and so , since everyone must say in public who they voted for , it is even better than an exit poll perhaps .
Other than that they are useless when they follow a primary .
Yep , it is a felony to vote twice except in Texas ...
I hope the allegations in this thread are wrong and the eye witnesses are mistaken , but if true the House must expel her forthwith !
There are enough criminals in the government already .

Yep GWN , different day , and different results .
I voted twice yesterday , as I pointed out in post # 1 , and sure enough when I got up this morning the caucus results are different from the election machine results .
Reprehensible Wilson should be ashamed of herself , as Hillary should be .
Last night she could have had a decent victory speech , but she chose instead , evidently like R. Wilson , to corrupt our process .
Hillary said she " won Florida " .
What a corrupt state of florida mind to say that when she was the only one on the ballot because the other dem candidates were not on the ballot by choice because the rules of the party did not recognize the Florida primary .
She is very bushie .
And now she thinks Florida and Ohio are her big wins .
In my book those states are contaminated and so is her state of mind unfortunately .

All of the candidates were on the ballot in Florida , they made a deal that they would n't campaign here tho .
Hillary won Florida by name recognition because of the New York factor .
In Michigan , everyone agreed to remove their names from the ballot except one and we know who that is , it 's the same one that wants them delegates counted now .

Sounds like bushie justice to me .
Speaking of bushie justice , Brad 's thread about the 60 minutes blackout in Alabama ( Siegelman story ) has new legs because the FCC is going to investigate ... evidently because of 20 or so complaints .
PS .
Speaking of bushie elections , there are some stories out there that Ohio results do not match the exit polls :
First Exit Polls : VT Obama - 67 , Clinton - 33
OH Obama - 51 , Clinton - 49

RI Obama - 49 , Clinton - 49 ( HuffPo ) .

STATE DEM CHAIR KAREN THURMAN ( officially on the payroll for the STATE REPUB CHAIR ) managed to keep the DEM DELAGATES DOWN with her own posturing / did not object to new PRIMARY DATE despite the DNC bylaws which could not have been more clear .
As a result of this incompetance ( ? ) , an attempt to remove THURMAN by George Maurer from her post at the FDP convention was shouted down , ridiculed , lamb - basted by STATE PARTY DEMS calling themselves " the NEW , REALITY - BASED PROGRESSIVE WING of the Democratic Party ... "
Funny , I call them " sell outs " .

THURMAN and buddies still found time and money to throw a GINORMOUS birthday party for Hillary , in absentia .
Cake the size of a football field .
Everyone had buttons that read , " SCREW HOWARD DEAN " and kept honking on mightily about the importance of PARTY UNITY .
REPUBS were often used as a shining example of party protocol .
It was damn creepy .
Is n't it amazing in these primaries how Hillary keeps " coming back " just in time to save her campaign ?

Jeannie , if Howard was smart he would just divide the delegates for Mich . and Fl. up 50/50 and walk away .
If he runs the primaries over again and lets say H loses this time , all hell would break loose IMO .
Or not seat them at all would be what I would do .
Mr. Maurer is right .

Jeanie # 9 So Hillary wins the TEXAS PRIMARY by 3 % (? ) , but once again OBAMA wins the caucus ?
How does that split shake down the delegates , Dredd ?
The primary alone chooses the delegates as far as I know .
The caucus is suplerflous , and I can't see it being much more than a waste of time ... except ...
The only useful purpose a subsequent ( following ) caucus would have in my estimation is to verify the voting machines .
The caucus is done in the open and who you vote for is spoken out in the open .
So , if it conflicts with the results the machine spits out , Houston , we have a problem .
It is sorta like an exit poll , only the results are spoken in public instead of a pollster .
And when there is a conflict I doubt the machines not what the people say out in the open in front of everyone .

Responding to # 12 .
Sorry , the post - primary caucuses in Texas are NOT meaningless .
The primary chooses 55 % of Texas delegates .
The caucuses choose 29 % of Texas delegates .
( The rest are superdelegates . )
It is a hybrid system .
Turnout in Houston at the caucuses was AMAZING --- 200 , 500 , 600 people came out , compared to a few dozen in recent history .
The caucus process is sort of a winding road --- those chosen at the caucus for Obama and Clinton then go to regional Dem conventions , which then choose people to go to the state convention , which then chooses people to go to the national Dem convention .
But , the caucuses are definitely a source of almost 1/3 of Texas ' delegates .
And , because of the way the districts and delegates work , with the Dems awarding the most delegates to the DFW Metroplex ( Dallas Ft Worth ) and Houston area ( 26 each ) , and less to rural areas where Clinton happened to be stronger , Obama may ultimately not do badly at all in Texas .

ARIZONA PRESS NO BETTER !!
As a recognized election integrity activist in Arizona I 've had numerous interactions with the press following actions we 've taken at the State Legislature , with the Maricopa County Elections Dept. , the Secretary of State , during elections , etc .
On three separate occasions by separate reporters from local affiliates for ABC , CBS , and NBC ( while I was special advisor to the democratic candidate for Secretary of State ) I was approached and interviewed .
Each was very excited because we gave over facts , evidence , verifiable and corroborated information they could trust .
One reporter even went so far as to swear me to exclusivity because she wanted to do a series of articles for " Sweeps Week . "
They took notes , we exchanged contact information and emails , and I forwarded information with websites they could check for themselves .
I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM EVER AGAIN !
I believe their station managers killed the stories .
And , it happened again just last month .
At a press conference at the State Senate to announce findings regarding issues with the Sequoia Elections Systems , their BPS software , and the Maricopa County Elections Dept. less than competent practices ; a local radio reporter queried us ( all available on YouTube btw ) carefully , she took a serious interest in what we were exposing , we exchanged contact information .
Like I said , that was over a month ago and we have n't heard a word !
Still wonder why we continue to scratch and fight for every bit of realization by the voters that they are being , or at the very least in danger of , being hosed !?!

Thanks for clearing that up , no need to be sorry .
I placed my vote , voted for precinct chair , secretary , and then left .
It was my first time and 90 % of the people there were first timers too !
At least I voted as I was supposed to , even tho I did not really understand what was going on .
About half stayed after the candidate votes ... to select people to be the delegates .
There was a very good cross section of the community , young , middle aged , and older folk .
Everyone was quite friendly .
The turnout everywhere seemed quite amazing for Texas ... I still think a caucus may be a good way to verify ... or not ... the election machines .
If done right it could raise flags about the results reported by the machines .
At the primary I put my paper ballot thru the scanner and it said my vote had been recorded , but it did not tell me who it thought I voted for ... so like I say ... it is a faith thang .

This is a message out to all the astroturfers who have been filling the internet with bull about Bev Harris , BradBlog , RawStory , and any other people and domains dedicated to truth and justice .
I am not a BevBot or a Bevamite or whatever your ilk have come up with lately to make a mockery out of free speech concerning the lack of election integrity in America .
The following is probably mostly old news to a the majority of readers here , but I do believe it is very important for newbies and fence sitters to understand that there has been a convoluted , organised effort to destroy the election reform movement .
I am not trying to overshadow this important story about Heather Wilson alleged to have been buying votes .
But I do think it 's important that we help out newbies and fence - sitters for when they eventually will come across the disinfo whitewashing the election fraud .
Yes , it 's fraud .
There can be just so many anomalies before one cannot deny that much of our electoral system is rigged .

No proof David ?

Today , I will take people step - by - step through the evidence that proves Diebold 's Robert Pelletier is behind a covert campaign to harass and malign Bev Harris , and other folks involved in BBV research ....
David Allen Shilling for Steven Hertzberg : 7 . Interesting to note that Steven Hertzberg [ is ] one of Bev 's early victims , and has been attacked in this forum by Bev supporters for his failure to embrace various Bev " truths " .
The usual tactics were used , insinuations that he was secretly in the pay of Diebold , et al .
And now we are seeing aspersions cast again .
Can you tell me when ESI was ever a paid lobbyist of any voting machine vendor ?
I take it then that if you disagree with ESI 's report , you find the voting machines in Ohio to be completely reliable ?
Mod Mom tried to get him to stop trolling .
Hertzberg has been criticized by Ohio ER groups NOT because of BBV but for his failure to respond to inquiries on a report based on precinct level data collected by many within the ER community .
He promised a report and after many attempts to contact him regarding this , he never replied .
He re-surfaced in the spring of 2005 after it was announced by Matt Damshroeder ( R Director of the Franklin Co BOE ) that ESI / Votewatch would be working with them .
His report for Damshroeder left many to question his intent .
He was invited to make his case at the spring 2005 CASE - Ohio ER Teach - In , but declined to participate .
More recently , after the May 2006 , while working for Cuyahoga Co his comments on the disastrous election ( I will have to search for the link ) stated voters were satisfied with the electronic voting machines .
( This after the disastrous election which led one 60 + old man to attack the machines . )
STOP USING FALSE INFORMATION BY RETURNING EVERY DISAGREEMENT
BACK TO BBV .
Nothing to see here , move along .
Or check out that grifter Bev Harris .
Yeah , that 's the ticket .

Brad and Bradblog :
Thank you for this story of a failed democracy in action and another example of criminal pirates in power using their corporate mass media effectively to eliminate the truth to portray " their damage control fantasy " as reality .
As long as electronic computer voting is used , you can count on ALL future Federal elections to be fake elitist shows paid for by multi-national corporations and the military industrial complex .
There are no bigger loser murderous criminals than the bushit adminstration and their accomplices .
The Republicans and Democrats are 1 party that act like they have different agendas .
We are still at war .
There is no talk of criminal prosecution for the numerous crimes against , people and other species by the bushit administration .
A quick example : Bush administration officials removed the wolf off the Federal Endangered Species Protection list last week and armed 2 airplanes to carry out airial killings to slaughter 900 wolves .
A policy move against the will of the majority of people who expressed their opinion not to during the open comment period .
This is important to note since this is the only way Americans can voice their opinion on these kinds of issues after bush changed the rules of US forestry in December 2004 .
Only 1 month after bush stole election Presidential election # 2 .
The bushies around Yellowstone have also been busy using taxpayers money to kill the American buffalo setting traps in Yellowstone at the only place they survive .
The bushit part of the story is they are claim local cattle could catch desease from wild buffalo bison that there is no evidence of let alone even 1 case in which this occured .
The story bigger that this simplification but the bushit is n't .
These fcking aceholes liars and their anti-environmental agenda thinks they got it made .
They better hope their plan for a US police state prior to the next election goes unhitched and happens real soon because otherwise these fcking loser inbred pirates are all going to jail .
Guantanamo's finest will appreciate the removal of habius corpus once the bushit administration arrive .
Hey cheney - bushit and accomplices :
Have you been fighting terrorism by given the nuclear bomb to any other contries lately since Pakistan and in turn North Korea got it from you ?
Or have you just been doing the US corporate mass media blackout to cover your disgraceful treasonous actions ?
Remove your US flag pins so I can stick through your eyes .

Now when some new porn starlet is introduced feet first into " Hardcore " or " extreme " porn in some extreme scene it 's known or referred to as a “ Mya Mason “ .
That 's the legend of the Porn " Rasputin " we all know and refer to as Max Hardcore .
A scene with Max Hardcore can truly " make you famous " or infamous .
Max Hardcore has made it where girls considering making some quick cash in an " extreme " or " Hardcore " porn scene should always read the fine print .
They should also find out who ’ll they ’ll be working with and what they ’ll be required to do ; to avoid ending up in a " Maya Mason " , and “ Max Hardcored “ .
If I had known that Mya Mason had been through the " Max Hardcore " treatment I would 've never even let that chick see my C@ck let alone suck it .
That bia -itch drank a belly full of rotten old man piss ...
Just thinking about what Max Hardcore did to her makes my skin crawl .
Being around that chick after that makes you feel like you should be wearing rubber gloves and running for the Lysol .
Ben Smith at Politico reports on a question and answer session at a Barack Obama rally in Beaumont , Texas yesterday :
“ An interesting moment came when he was asked a question about LGBT rights and delivered an answer that seemed to suit the questioner , listing the various attributes — race , gender , etc. — that should n’t trigger discrimination , to successive cheers .
When he came to saying that gays and lesbians deserve equality , though , the crowd fell silent .
So he took a different tack : ‘ Now I ’m a Christian , and I praise Jesus every Sunday , ’ he said , to a sudden wave of noisy applause and cheers .
‘ I hear people saying things that I do n’t think are very Christian with respect to people who are gay and lesbian , ’ he said , and the crowd seemed to come along with him this time . ”
Adds Smith : “ The moment reminded me of a conversation I had recently with a senior figure in the national gay rights movement , who noted that Obama ’s deference to some black Christian discomfort with homosexuality — his refusal to dump the “ ex - gay ” gospel singer Donnie McClurkin from a tour — angered some gays and lesbians ; but conversely , that his ability to sell gay rights in the black church is unique and appealing . ”

Lamperd , a " firearm training system " company , has patented a bracelet that delivers debilitating shocks when remotely triggered .
Their killer app for this is aviation safety : they 're proposing that the TSA could force everyone who flies to wear one of these and then flight - attendants could zap us into a stupor if we turn out to be Al Quaeda .
A method of providing air travel security for passengers traveling via an aircraft comprises situating a remotely activatable electric shock device on each of the passengers in position to deliver a disabling electrical shock when activated ; and arming the electric shock devices for subsequent selective activation by a selectively operable remote control disposed within the aircraft .
The remotely activatable electric shock devices each have activation circuitry responsive to the activating signal transmitted from the selectively operable remote control means .
The activated electric shock device is operable to deliver the disabling electrical shock to that passenger .
Best part ?
They 're Canadian !
Oh , my countrymen , you have a wicked sense of humo ( u ) r .

A Programmer 's Thoughts on Software Configuration Management
and Software Development Best Practices
BOSTON — He predicted the fall of the Soviet Union .
He predicted the explosive spread of the Internet and wireless access .
Now futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil is part of distinguished panel of engineers that says solar power will scale up to produce all the energy needs of Earth 's people in 20 years .
There is 10,000 times more sunlight than we need to meet 100 percent of our energy needs , he says , and the technology needed for collecting and storing it is about to emerge as the field of solar energy is going to advance exponentially in accordance with Kurzweil 's Law of Accelerating Returns .
That law yields a doubling of price performance in information technologies every year .
Kurzweil , author of " The Singularity Is Near " and " The Age of Intelligent Machines , " worked on the solar energy solution with Google Co-Founder Larry Page as part of a panel of experts convened by the National Association of Engineers to address the 14 " grand challenges of the 21st century , " including making solar energy more economical .
The panel 's findings were announced here last week at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Solar to compete in five years
Solar and wind power currently supply about 1 percent of the world 's energy needs , Kurzweil said , but advances in technology are about to expand with the introduction of nano - engineered materials for solar panels , making them far more efficient , lighter and easier to install .
Google has invested substantially in companies pioneering these approaches .
Regardless of any one technology , members of the panel are " confident that we are not that far away from a tipping point where energy from solar will be [ economically ] competitive with fossil fuels , " Kurzweil said , adding that it could happen within five years .
The reason why solar energy technologies will advance exponentially , Kurzweil said , is because it is an " information technology " ( one for which we can measure the information content ) , and thereby subject to the Law of Accelerating Returns .
" We also see an exponential progression in the use of solar energy , " he said .
" It is doubling now every two years .
Doubling every two years means multiplying by 1,000 in 20 years .
At that rate we 'll meet 100 percent of our energy needs in 20 years . "
Other technologies that will help are solar concentrators made of parabolic mirrors that focus very large areas of sunlight onto a small collector or a small efficient steam turbine .
The energy can be stored using nano - engineered fuel cells , Kurzweil said .
" You could , for example , create hydrogen or hydrogen - based fuels from the energy produced by solar panels and then use that to create fuel for fuel cells , he said .
There are already nano - engineered fuel cells , microscopic in size , that can be scaled up to store huge quantities of energy , he said .
Other grand challenges
The NAE panel thinks that meeting the energy challenge and the other grand challenges of the 21st century is " simply imperative to our survival on the planet , " said panel member Charles Vest , former president of MIT and current NAE president .
Other challenges that the panel addressed include providing access to clean water , engineering better medicines , reverse engineering the brain , securing cyberspace and enhancing virtual reality .
The inspiration for the report was a previous NAE that reflected on the engineering achievements of the 20th century , such as the automobile , aircraft , jet aircraft , rockets , missiles , satellites , radio , radar , television , nuclear power , nuclear weapons , the computer , internet , genetic engineering and antibiotics .
These inventions gave us the green revolution that improved food production as global population grew , the distribution of safe water and electricity , improved health and generated an improved standard of living for many in the world .
However , now the world faces some dark consequences of these advances , said Stanford University 's William Perry , a member of the Grand Challenges panel and a former Secretary of Defense in President Clinton 's administration , including the depletion of prevailing energy resources , a looming global environmental disaster in global warming , the emergence of drug - resistant bugs and the threat of a security disaster if nuclear and biological weapons fall into the wrong hands .
With this in mind , the NAE brought together the panel ( other members included Segway inventor Dean Kamen , biomedical engineer Robert Langer , former National Institutes of Health Director Bernadine Healy and genomics pioneer Craig Venter ) to report on the needs of society and how technology can meet them .
More solutions to 21st century challenges
Other tech solutions suggested by the NAE panel to the new century 's big challenges include :
Better detection and monitoring of nuclear weapons components to prevent them from getting in the hands of terrorists .
Improving rapid responses to possible bioweapons attacks .
Advances in genetic engineering to address the problem of drug - resistant viruses and bacteria , and to create personalized medicine .
Desalinization and water filtering to address the shortage of potable drinking water .
Tutoring computers to help meet education needs .
Artificial intelligence that better simulates the brain to help create faster computers and also to aid in the treatment of neurological disorders
Perry was optimistic about the ability of society to arrive at these solutions , saying the achievements of the 21st century " will I believe be just as spectacular as achievements of 20th century . "
Panel member Calestous Juma of Harvard University , an authority on using science and technology to promote sustainable development , said the policy implications of the 21st century challenges plan reveal a " more enlightened understanding of role of science and technology in general . "
" This idea [ of solving large - scale problems using technological innovation ] is being developed in the context of a globalized world , " he said .
" Even though the proposals have been developed in the United States , the challenges themselves that humanity faces are global in character . "
The NAE invites feedback on the document .
Docstoc , the company that describes itself as the “ YouTube for professional documents ” has closed a small first round of financing .
Docstoc , along with competitor Scribd , makes it easy for people to upload and post entire documents on the Web — where they can be easily read without clicking on links .
The companies have stirred controversy because of the potential for copyright infringement .
Scribd , which launched earlier this year ( see coverage ) , and which is open to the public , continually has to remove copyrighted books , such as Harry Potter novels .
Docstoc , of Beverly Hills , has not launched publicly yet , but has been testing privately with users .
It will launch soon , no later than the next couple of months , says chief executive Jason Nazar .
The company focuses on legal , business and educational documents .
Nazar said many people search for legal and financial advice .
Someone may want a will for free so that “ they do n’t get screwed by a lawyer , ” he said .
Others may want special help , and find a good lawyer or adviser by finding their document at Docstoc , seeing their contact details and getting in touch with them .
So lawyers and other professionals have an incentive to post , he said .
One difference from Scribd is the attention to different professional categories .
You ’ll be able to search for categories of professionals and then sub-categories , i.e. , tax lawyer , divorce lawyer and so on .
Scribd , which dubbed itself the “ YouTube for documents , ” earlier raised $ 4 million in venture capital .
Among the Docstoc investors are Scott Walchek , of Integrity Partners ; Brett Brewer , a co-founder of Intermix , which was the parent company of MySpace before it was sold to News Corp. ; Robin Richards , founding president of MP3.com ; and Rick smith , former managing director at Palomar ventures )
Docstoc ’s chief technology officer , Alon Shwartz , formerly led product development at MySpace .
Now a study by Kirsch and colleagues in the Public Library of Science ( Medicine ) that accessed unpublished research by drug companies suggests that antidepressants are no better than placebos except in the severest cases .
Does that mean that my initial experiences with drugs were due to placebo effects ?
Actually , I had puzzled over many years about the placebo effects of antidepressants .
Usually the drugs had only 5 - 25 % advantage over placebos .
But in a large enough study , even the lower range was statistically significant , and the drug was deemed to be effective .
I wondered why the efforts devoted to finding better drugs were not spent on research and improvement of placebo effects , which were clearly very potent .
To understand my different experiences over 30 years , the differences between drug , placebo , and specific therapies need to be addressed .
Drug therapy works on the assumption that depression is a disease , and that like an infection can clear with antibiotics , depression can clear with antidepressants .
Various drugs with various biochemical effects have been claimed over the years to specifically elevate pathologically depressed moods .
Placebo , an inactive medication , is nevertheless often associated with the powerful suggestion by an authority figure such as a doctor that the medication will fix the ailment , as well as with removal to a safe problem - free environment such as a hospital , and provision of kindness and concern for how patients feel .
Specific treatment for depression involves identifying a major loss and suppressed grief in relation to the loss .
It involves identifying hope beyond hopelessness and despair for such a loss , and allowing the grieving process to take place with support from the therapist .
It was when patients I saw in the emergency department were given their first opportunity to express their grief that their depressions turned to healthy tears .
It must be noted that depression refers to a variety of emotions that psychiatry and psychology have not separated clinically for treatment .
Among other emotions , they include defeat , demoralisation , anguish , abandonment , frustration and betrayal .
As with depression , specific treatment requires , through hope and support , recognition of the nature of the symptoms and their origins , and then dealing with them in the present context .
The reason why drug and placebo therapies are so popular is not only because of a desire for a simple solution by both patient and doctor , but also because of fear on the part of the patient that to uncover their real problems will expose their belief that their life is meaninglessness , a fear that may be conveyed to doctors , and even resonate within them .
It is easier then to immerse oneself in keeping busy , rather than open a can of worms .
In reality , doctors and patients negotiate an amalgam of drug , placebo and specific treatments according to their capacities , and available knowledge of the times .
For instance , we are much more attuned to stresses and traumas than we were in the '60s .
Benefits can be obtained in many combinations of treatments .
But not addressing specific issues has costs .
Patients are left in an uneasy equilibrium of being and not being themselves , while doctors chase their own tails as patients keep returning with unresolved problems .
The 12 million antidepressant prescriptions written in Australia in 2005 - 06 might have cured some , helped many from being overwhelmed at the time , and produced side - effects in others .
But there is no easy drug fix for psychological wounds .
Kindness and suggestion can be useful stop - gap measures .
But proper diagnosis and healing of root causes is still the best medicine .

Behind the Baghdad Bird Market Bombings Using the Disabled for the Jihad
For a while it looked as if the US military 's surge was pacifying Baghdad .
Now it seems al - Qaida may have found depraved ways around new security measures -- including female " suicide " bombers , recruited from mental hospitals .
This is a joke , of course , despite what you may have read in apparently credulous news stories and blog posts elsewhere , particularly in the British press .
I say it 's a joke not knowing for certain that it's a joke , but I 'm perfectly willing to be proven wrong should it come to that .
Been wrong before .
Not as a painful as walking into a lamppost while texting .
In the meantime , I say these news outlets are being taken in by a joke simply because it must be a joke .
From The Daily Star :
An amazing six million Brits were injured last year while texting and using their mobiles .
More than one in 10 people were hurt after stumbling into lampposts , bollards and litter bins in the street .
They suffered " walk and text " wounds , ranging from bruises to broken noses and fractured skulls .
A new study has revealed that more than 60 % of us concentrate so hard when texting we become blind to objects surrounding us .
It says here - with no data at my disposal - that 6 million Brits were not injured in auto and bicycle accidents combined last year , never mind texting while walking , so there 's your neon sign of a clue that we 're smelling Onionish fare here instead of genuine scientific research .
( The numbers are a mish - mash in various accounts , so some of this may be a matter of journalists being notoriously crappy at math . )
Nevertheless , from The Daily Mail , comes news of relief on the way for these clumsy communicators .
Britain's first ' Safe Text ' street has been created complete with padded lampposts to protect millions of mobile phone users from getting hurt in street accidents while walking and texting .
Around one in ten careless Brits has suffered a " walk 'n text " street injury in the past year through collisions with lampposts , bins and other pedestrians .
The story comes complete with a photograph of a lamppost that 's been outfitted with what looks like a boxing ring turnbuckle .
We 're even treated to quotations from an apparently real British pedestrian - advocacy group called Living Streets .
The study was allegedly conducted by a text - messaging company called 118.com , which seems to be a real firm with a respectable - looking Web site that contains not a mention of this startling new data .
( Update , March 6 : No word yet from 118.com but the Ministry of Silly Walks says I should n't be too quick to dismiss this public safety initiative . )
Perhaps March 5 is April 1 over there , I do n't know .
Either way , I 've sent an e-mail to 118.com congratulating them on a joke jolly well done .
( Update 2 : If you 're a Digger and enjoyed this post , you know what to do and here 's where to do it . )

I 'm starting up a gay gang !
We 'll do all the things that tough street gangs do ( pick fights , steal wallets , critique b- list actresses on the red carpet ) but we 'll be comprised of gay men !
Now this gang is n't fancy - pansy like the ones in West Side Story .
Wait , who am I kidding ?
It 's EXACTLY like West Side Story .
Only this time , Tony and Chino will have the cajones to actually get together , instead of wasting time on Natalie Wood ( whose only good performance was in Rebel Without a Cause there I said it ) .
To join you 'll have to pass a rigorous test .
We can't tell you our gang name or our colors yet ( and they change according to the Helmut Lang line ) , so you 'll meet us at an undisclosed location near the Santa Monica pier .
First , you have to find an unsuspecting straight couple ( preferably on a date ) and mug them .
Take their money , but only grab the wallet or purse if it is Burberry , Fendi , or something comparable .
And be sure to mention that you thought [ insert whatever the girl was wearing ] went out two years ago .
Second , you have to mastermind a huge drug sale .
This will be unbelievably easy , since you 'll do it with E in the bathroom of The Abbey .
Third , you will be forced to get in a fight with one of the other gang hopefuls .
The rest of us will be watching as you wrestle around , and you should be sure to tear some clothing and throw in a few light kisses and moans .
So if you 're tough enough , just email me and we can start our gang .
It does n't matter who you are or what you look like , as long as you are attractive and have a great body .
Rare Photo of Helen Keller as a Young Girl
An 1888 photo ofwith her teacher , , has been released by the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston .
The photo , taken on a family vacation on Cape Cod , shows an eight - year - old Keller , with a doll cradled in her lap , holding hands with Sullivan .
Experts believe this could be the oldest photo of the two women together , as well as the only one of Keller with one of her beloved dolls .
The photo was donated 87 - year - old Thaxter Spencer , who 's mother , Hope Thaxter Parks , played with Keller that summer in Massachusetts .
" I never thought much about it , " Spencer said in a statement released by the society .
" It just seemed like something no one would find very interesting . "
Spencer has recently been hospitalized and could not be reached for comment .
Though deaf and blind , Helen Keller became a world - famous author and humanitarian .
Anne Sullivan stayed at her side until her death in 1936 .
Keller died in 1968 at age 87 .
House narrowly passes immunity - free surveillance bill Nick Juliano
Published : Friday March 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Defying President Bush , the House of Representatives on Friday narrowly approved a surveillance bill that does not give in to White House demands to give legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated his warrantless surveillance program .
The bill passed 213-197 , with one lawmaker voting present .
The vote came after weeks of wrangling between House Democrats and the White House over the update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The bill fixes loopholes the Bush administration and Intelligence Community have said prevent surveillance of foreign communications that are routed through the US , while providing for more judicial oversight of surveillance procedures .
The House reached what Democrats say is a compromise on the immunity provision .
The bill passed Friday allows companies to defend themselves in court with using classified justifications for the warrantless wiretapping program , and it precludes the administration from invoking " state secrets " privileges .
The House bill also creates an independent commission to investigate Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The vote was quickly praised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is representing plaintiffs in a lawsuit against AT&T in San Francisco , and the American Civil Liberties Union , which also has fought hard to prevent some 40 lawsuits against the telecoms from being invalidated .
" We applaud the House for refusing to grant amnesty to lawbreaking telecoms , and for passing a bill that would allow our lawsuit against AT&T to proceed fairly and securely , " EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston said in a release .
" Amnesty proponents have been claiming on the Hill for months that phone companies like AT&T had a good faith belief that the NSA program was legal .
Under this bill , the companies could do what they should have been able to do all along : tell that story to a judge . "
 In spite of partisan scare tactics , the House of Representatives rose up today and put Americans  civil liberties concerns ahead of politics ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the Washington Legislative Office of the ACLU .
With Friday 's passage , the House bounced the FISA debate over to the Senate , which passed an update to the law that would have included immunity for the companies .
The Senate is expected to consider the House bill when it returns from recess on March 31 , according to EFF .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , who voted against the Senate 's FISA praised the House for passing a bill that adds " several crucial protections without interfering in any way with this important new surveillance authority . "
President Bush has promised to veto any FISA update that reaches his desk without a grant of immunity .
In recent weeks he has used used escalating rhetoric to make his case for immunity , claiming that it is unfair to subject the telecoms to " billions of dollars " in legal costs when the White House assured them their actions were legal .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said such justifications were bunk .
 Why would the Administration oppose a judicial determination of whether the companies already have immunity ? " she asked on the House floor .
" There are at least three explanations :
 First , the President knows that it was the Administrations incompetence in failing to follow the procedures in statute that prevented immunity from being conveyed  thats one possibility .
They simply didnt do it right .
Second , the Administrations legal argument that the surveillance requests were lawfully authorized was wrong ; or public reports that the surveillance activities undertaken by the companies went far beyond anything about which any Member of Congress was notified , as is required by the law . "
Zimbabwe 's opposition has said it will bring the government to its knees with Kenya - style mass protests if the president , Robert Mugabe , carries through extensive plans to rig Saturday 's presidential and parliamentary elections .
Mugabe has vowed to use the army to crush any demonstrations and warned Zimbabweans not to waste their votes on supporting opposition candidates whom he said he would never allow to come to power .
The 84 - year - old president would struggle to extend his 28 - year rule in a clean election amid widespread hunger , mass unemployment , 100,000 % inflation and a currency devaluing so fast that the few people with jobs are paid in billions of Zimbabwe dollars .
Monitoring groups say the ruling Zanu - PF party has paved the way to steal the election by printing millions of extra ballots , intimidating rural voters by threatening their food supplies , permitting policemen into polling booths to " help " voters , and fixing the electoral roll .
Among those registered to vote is Desmond Lardner - Burke , who was born a century ago and , as justice minister in the white Rhodesian government , jailed Mugabe as a terrorist .
Lardner - Burke died years ago in South Africa .
Ian Makoni , the election director for the opposition presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai , who narrowly lost the 2002 ballot amid widespread fraud , said his Movement for Democratic Change party would not repeat its mistakes of six years ago .
" The lesson from 2002 is we did n't have a plan for after the vote .
Everyone stayed at home and said we will go to the courts .
We have seen the lesson from Kenya .
We do n't want the violence that happened in Kenya .
The bit I like about what happened in Kenya was they knew there would be fraud and they were ready , " he said .
" We will be out on the streets celebrating when the polls close .
It will be a celebration which can turn into a protest easily .
Zimbabweans are angry , they are desperate , they are ready to protest .
It 's the tipping point we are planning for . "
Mugabe told an election rally this week that a vote for the opposition would be wasted because his opponents would " never be allowed to rule this country " , and he threatened to put down any Kenya - style protests .
" We have enough security forces .
No nonsense , if that is what the likes of Tsvangirai are planning , they are dreaming .
That will never happen here .
Never ever , " he said .
The most recent opinion poll gives Tsvangirai 28 % of the vote , Mugabe 20 % and a third candidate who broke away from Zanu - PF , Simba Makoni , 9 % .
Nearly a third of those polled were undecided or declined to reveal a preference .
The opposition says the bulk of them will be voting against Mugabe .
Tsvangirai said the real challenge for the opposition is to make sure its votes count .
" We expect the enemies of justice to engage in every trick in the book , " he said .
The opposition says one of those tricks is to have printed 9 m ballots , when there are 6 m names on the electoral roll – many of whom are dead , fake or improperly registered .
The law obliges the electoral commission to provide copies of the roll to the opposition in digital form .
The commission handed over 80,000 printed pages scanned on to a disc , technically digital but of no use for computer programs designed to turn up multiple registrations and false identity numbers .
Nonetheless , the MDC says it has uncovered 90,000 suspicious names on the lists for 28 parliamentary constituencies , and it expects that pattern to be repeated in the other 182 .
There are 25,420 registered voters in the Harare North constituency but 8,201 - nearly one third of the electorate - are listed as living in a single small area , described as Hatcliffe Housing Cooperate , with just 36 dwellings .
Some houses have more than 300 people assigned to a single address .
The MDC calculates that the last presidential election was stolen through a combination of ballot stuffing and by preventing hundreds of thousands of its supporters in the cities from voting by creating huge queues with too few polling stations .
Election monitoring groups estimate that for Harare polling stations to handle every potential voter , each will have to be checked on the roll , cast four ballots and leave in half a minute .
" It will be a problem , " said Makoni .
" Our hope is that voters will be so angry they will just stay to make sure they vote no matter how long it takes . "
Although the opposition leadership has been largely left alone since Tsvangirai was badly beaten up by Zanu - PF forces a year ago , the government has pursued election workers of the MDC and Simba Makoni by harassing and arresting them in their thousands .
Some have been detained for campaigning door to door or for putting up election posters in areas already smothered with Zanu - PF propaganda .
The ruling party has also pressured hungry rural voters through village chiefs by warning them that if the count for their area favours the opposition they will lose their food supply .
Even if Zimbabweans do not bow to intimidation , there is no guarantee their votes will count .
Ballots are counted in polling stations but the results announced after they are collated at a regional centre , which is where the numbers were changed in favour of Zanu - PF in the last election , according to the opposition .
Makoni said this time the MDC will use its agents to immediately announce the results from each polling station and pre-empt any alterations .
It will then collate them at an election centre in Harare and issue its own count ahead of the electoral commission , which is headed by a former military office .
" In order to avoid skulduggery , our supporters will follow the documentation with the results from the polling stations and to the collation centres to protect it .
It 's like a river that will be swelling and then if the government tries to deny our victory it will not be able to turn it back , " he said .
The opposition has in the past threatened - and failed - to mobilise millions of Zimbabweans .
If anger finally overcomes fear and fatalism , protesters will face a regime that has vowed never to surrender power .
The police and army say they will crush opposition protests .
The Zimbabwean justice minister , Patrick Chinamasa , said allegations of rigging were no more than an admission of defeat .
" What in fact is evident now is that Tsvangirai and his camp is now panicking .
They see the crowds that our president is drawing , they see our popularity .
In fact they are going to be wiped out of the political map , they are staring defeat in their face .
They are now trying to find excuses to justify that defeat , " he said on state television .
Ideological Exclusion Violates First Amendment Rights , ACLU Says
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
BOSTON – The Departments of State and Homeland Security are illegally blocking South African scholar Adam Habib from entering the U.S. under circumstances that suggest it is because of his political views , according to a lawsuit filed today by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Massachusetts .
Censorship at the border prevents U.S. citizens and residents from hearing speech that is protected by the First Amendment , the ACLU charges .
“ Once again , the Bush administration is stifling debate by preventing U.S. audiences from engaging prominent scholars face - to - face , ” said Melissa Goodman , a staff attorney for the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
“ When the government excludes scholars from the U.S. – particularly scholars who frequently traveled to this country without any problems in the past , but who happen to be vocal critics of U.S. policies – it sends the cowardly message that our government is afraid of opposing voices .
This kind of political litmus test is both unconstitutional and un-American . ”
The ACLU ’s lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of organizations that have invited Professor Habib to speak in the U.S. in the near future , including the American Sociological Association ( ASA ) , the American Association of University Professors ( AAUP ) , the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee ( ADC ) and the Boston Coalition for Palestinian Rights ( BCPR ) .
The lawsuit , which names Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff as defendants , seeks the immediate processing of Professor Habib ’s pending visa application and a declaration that his exclusion without explanation since October 2006 Habib violates the First Amendment rights of U.S. organizations , citizens , and residents .
Habib is a renowned scholar , sought after analyst , and Deputy Vice - Chancellor of Research , Innovation and Advancement at the University of Johannesburg .
He is also a Muslim who has been a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and certain U.S. terrorism - related policies .
Until the government suddenly revoked his visa last October without explanation , he never experienced any trouble entering the U.S. ; in fact , Habib lived in New York for years while earning a Ph.D. in Political Science from the City University of New York .
The October 2006 revocation of Professor Habib ’s visa prevented him from attending a series of meetings with representatives from institutions such as the National Institutes for Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the World Bank , Columbia University and the Gates Foundation .
When he landed in New York in advance of these meetings , Habib was detained for 7 hours and interrogated about his associations and political views .
Armed guards eventually escorted him to a plane and deported him back to South Africa .
The State Department later revoked the visas of Professor Habib ’s wife and two small children , again , without explanation .
“ I find it profoundly disturbing that the U.S. government continues to deny me the opportunity to participate in the kind of robust academic and political debate that is central to the American democratic system , ” said Habib .
“ Now more than ever , people from around the world recognize the consequences of American isolation within the global community .
By letting in outsiders who represent ideological diversity , the U.S. can make good on its democratic ideals . ”
Last May , Habib applied for a new visa that would allow him to travel to the U.S. to attend speaking engagements , including the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in August 2007 .
However , on the eve of his scheduled departure to New York , the State Department informed Habib that his visa application would not be processed in time for the meeting .
As a result of the State Department ’s unexplained visa denial , Habib was prevented from speaking to the ASA and its members .
His visa application continues to languish .
Professor Habib ’s exclusion is part of a larger pattern .
Over the past few years , numerous foreign scholars , human rights activists , and writers – all vocal critics of U.S. policy – have been barred from the U.S. without explanation or on unspecified national security grounds .
“ Immigration officials should not be in the business of blocking our borders to people with political views they dislike , ” said Sarah Wunsch , staff attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts .
“ Silencing critics and forbidding Americans the right to hear dissenting voices harms academic and political freedom in the United States . ”
In 2006 , the ACLU filed a similar lawsuit on behalf of U.S. academic groups and Professor Tariq Ramadan , a widely respected Swiss scholar of the Muslim world .
When the government revoked his visa in 2004 , Professor Ramadan was prevented from assuming a tenured teaching position at the University of Notre Dame .
The Ramadan lawsuit challenges the legality of his exclusion and the constitutionality of the Patriot Act provision under which he was initially excluded .
He remains excluded from the U.S. today .
Today , the ACLU launched a new interactive web feature that tells the stories of the artists , scholars and politicians the U.S. government has kept out of the country since the inception of ideological exclusion in 1952 .
It is available at : www.aclu.org/passportflash

Attorneys in the case are Goodman , Jameel Jaffer , Nasrina Bargzie , and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU , and Wunsch and John Reinstein of the ACLU of Massachusetts .
The battle against anti-scientific literalism continues .
Next stop Texas .
The creation–evolution debate in the United States is ever - changing : any given week might bring good news for science advocates in some states , but bad news in others .
At the moment , the good news is coming from Florida , which on 19 February voted to adopt new science standards that significantly strengthen the role of evolution in the state 's biology curriculum ( see page 1041 .
But the next round of news will undoubtedly come from Texas , where a state agency faces a decision whose ramifications could resonate across the United States for years to come .
The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is considering an application by the Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) to grant online master 's degrees in science education .
And an advisory panel to the board has recommended that Texas should accept the application .
The ICR accepts the Bible as literal truth on all topics .
According to its website , the palaeoclimatology class covers “ climates before and after the Genesis Flood ” .
Anatomy lab includes “ limited discussion of embryology and accompanying histology , specifically in regards to evolutionary theory and its alternative — the creation of fully functional major groups of animals ” .
For most of its existence the ICR was ensconced in the San Diego area , but in 2007 it relocated to Dallas , in an apparent move to expand its national reach .
California may have been glad to see it go ; the state had been battling the ICR over accreditation since 1981 , when , under a sympathetic official , the institute first got the go - ahead to offer degrees .
But in Texas the ICR must win approval from the state board to continue setting up its graduate programmes before seeking permanent accreditation .
The decision falls to the nine - member higher - education board .
It had been expected to vote on the issue in January , but instead asked the ICR for more information — about the research done by its faculty members , about how an online course would teach experimental science , and about why its curriculum is so different from other degree - granting institutions in science education .
A vote is expected at the board 's 24 April meeting .
High - powered scientists in Texas are already weighing in , asking board commissioner Raymund Paredes to deny accreditation .
And there are signs that the board is listening .
In a response to Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg , Paredes wrote that “ our primary criterion will be how the proposed program will contribute to preparing high school students to do rigorous science in higher education ” .
One can only hope such rational approaches will outweigh the primary ICR reaction , which has been to send out a call for prayer .
Scientists in Texas and the rest of the country must continue to make it clear to Paredes why the board should deny accreditation to this organization .
The ICR has managed to con its way into the California educational system for decades .
Texas must not succumb as well .

A large crane at a construction site on Manhattan ’s East Side collapsed Saturday afternoon , killing at least four people and injuring more than 10 , officials at the scene said .
“ This construction accident is one of the worst the city has had , ” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a news conference this afternoon .
“ Our hearts go out to all the victims and their families . ”
The big , white tower crane , which looked to be about 20 stories tall , appeared to have toppled across a street and crashed into other nearby buildings .
Mr. Bloomberg said the falling pieces of the crane demolished one building and damaged three others .
The accident happened at 303 East 51st Street , near Second Avenue about 2:20 p.m. , the authorities said .

“ The main place of carnage was either at the construction site  among probably all construction workers , and I ’m still trying to verify that  and then in the small building where the top piece of the crane came crashing down and just basically flattened the four - story town house right down to a mass of rubble , ” Mr. Bloomberg said .
The mayor also said that the crane had been inspected and that the appropriate permits had been in place .
Aides to the Manhattan borough president , Scott Stringer , said they had been told by the Office of Emergency Management that the building that was destroyed was at 305 East 50th Street .
Mayor Bloomberg said that the firefighters and police officers on the scene were continuing to look for survivors in the rubble and that dogs and listening devices would be brought in .
He also said another crane was standing by to remove the broken crane but that first efforts would be made to stabilize the site .

Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson , who will be sworn - in as governor on Monday , visited the site of the accident and was briefed on the situation .
“ This is going to be a very , very difficult recovery , ” he said in a news conference .
“ The crane is still balanced on the building and to take that down is going to take a tremendous effort . ”
He added that New York City was the best equipped city to deal with a calamity of this scope .
Several neighboring buildings were evacuated and a shelter for people who had been displaced was opened at 228 East 57th Street , near Second Avenue , the mayor said .
“ This is an absolute disgrace , ” Mr. Stringer said .
“ We need better inspection and more resources . ”
He said there were open violations on the construction site for a 44 - story condominium building that are “ quite serious , ” he said .
Ismael Garcia , who was working on the 15th floor of the building under construction , said that just before the crane collapsed , it was lifting material that apparently fell and struck a girder that connected the crane to the building .
“ Out of the corner of my eye , I saw a piece falling , ” he said .
There was a loud crash , and he rushed to the edge of the building to peer out over the street below .
“ I saw a guy laying on the roof there , ” he said , looking down on a building below .
“ His head was under the debris . ”
Image Firefighters carried stretchers at the scene of the accident .
People were feared trapped beneath the wreckage .

Stephen Kaplan , an owner of the Reliance Construction Group , which manages the condominium construction site told The Associated Press that the crane had been scheduled to be raised on Saturday so work could begin on higher stories of the building .
He said a piece of steel had fallen , shearing one of the ties holding the crane to the building .
“ It was an absolute freak accident , ” Mr. Kaplan told The A.P.
“ All the piece of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right , and nothing would have happened . ”
Mr. Kaplan said his company had subcontracted the work to different companies and was not in charge of the crane .
Bartle Bull , who has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years , said he was not surprised that the crane had fallen .
“ What I ’ve seen for the last two months is reckless construction and lack of enforcement , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ We have said this crane is going to come down . ”
Mr. Bull said he deliberately avoided walking along 51st Street “ because this thing looks so dangerous . ”
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) -
The leak of information about Barack Obama ’s position on the North American Free Trade Agreement was “ blatantly unfair ” to his campaign , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Wednesday .

Harper said the government was mounting an “ internal security investigation ” to find out who leaked the information , which suggested Obama ’s campaign had said not to pay too much attention to his protectionist rhetoric on NAFTA .
“ This kind of leaking of information is completely unacceptable and in fact ... it may well be illegal , ” the prime minister told Parliament .
“ It is not useful , it is not in the interests of the government of Canada , and the way the leak was executed , Mr. Speaker , was blatantly unfair to Sen. Obama and his campaign . ”
Obama ’s rival in the U.S. Democratic primaries , Hillary Clinton , had seized on the Canadian information to try to demonstrate that Obama could not be trusted on foreign affairs and that he said one thing in private and another in public .
The issue arose when Obama and Clinton said in a debate last week they would threaten to pull out of NAFTA -- which joins the United States , Canada and Mexico as trading partners -- unless its environmental and labor standards are renegotiated .
Shortly after , a memo circulated that was written by a Canadian diplomat after a February 8 meeting in Chicago with Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee .
“ He ( Goolsbee ) was frank in saying that the primary campaign has been necessarily domestically focused , particularly in the Midwest , and that much of the rhetoric that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy , ” the memo read .
On Monday afternoon , on the eve of the Democratic primaries in Texas and Ohio , the Canadian government issued a formal statement regretting any inference that Obama was taking a different position in public from views expressed in private .
U.S. Sen . Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat , said the flap probably had only a minor effect on the outcome because both candidates were offering a welcome change on trade policy .
“ The Canada thing was much ado about nothing , I think , to most voters , ” he said in a call with U.S. - based reporters .
Leo Gerard , president of the United Steelworkers Union , said he agreed with Brown .
But Lori Wallach , director of Global Trade Watch , part of the Washington - based advocacy group Public Citizen , said it may have helped stop Obama ’s momentum .
Obama was 24 points behind Clinton when he started campaigning in Ohio and managed to close much of that gap , partly by criticizing her for supporting NAFTA when her husband , Bill Clinton , was president , Wallach said .
The memo helped “ blur the distinction ” that Obama was trying to make between himself and Clinton on NAFTA and may help explain why he stopped rising in the polls shortly before the vote in Ohio , she said .
In Ottawa , Jack Layton , leader of the opposition New Democratic Party , said the leak had damaged relations with the United States , and he even asked Harper to call in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Harper said the clerk of the Privy Council -- Canada ’s top civil servant -- was handling an internal security investigation .
“ Based on what they find and based on legal advice , we will take any action that is necessary to get to the bottom of this , ” Harper said during the daily Question Period in the House of Commons .
International Trade Minister David Emerson said on Wednesday he did not believe Obama would just abandon NAFTA .
“ I ’m sure if Mr. Obama were the president he would look after the best interest of the United States , ” Emerson said when asked by reporters .
“ I just do not believe for a moment , not a nanosecond , that walking away from NAFTA is in the greater interests of Americans .
When they get down into that , it ’ll become pretty clear . ”
Ten supersonic engines will be launched at Woomera , in outback South Australia , over the next five years in a joint venture between Australia and the United States .
The first scramjet engine was launched successfully last year at Woomera and scientists are now ready for further testing .
Professor Michael Smart from the University of Queensland 's research team says the scramjet technology will allow passengers to fly from Sydney to London in two hours , and is all Australian .
" That scramjet that we fly is basically 100 per cent Australian designed , so it 's designed at UQ , we 've done the testing at UQ in our ground test facility , and then we 're going to fly it in Woomera in South Australia , so it 's really going to be a very exciting test , " he said .

Jesús Díaz :
How long have you been a LEGO fan ?
Will Chapman : I 'm 39 now , and I remember getting Lego for birthday presents ever since I was 5 years old .
I still remember the surprise of getting my first Technic vehicle as a teen , and being absolutely thrilled with the rack - and - pinion steering system , and holes in the bricks and pegs that allowed for incredible new possibilities .
Just before leaving for college , I gave my collection to a neighbor boy , and I do n't remember buying another set until after I was married and had my first son ...
JD : ... and then it all came back .
WC : Yeah , a few years later , in 1993 , I decided to introduce him to Lego when he was 2 , and he took to them immediately .
His enthusiasm was a real eye - opener , and I realized how much I missed having Lego in my life .
I promptly went on a spending spree and bought almost everything I could find on the shelves — including the entire line of Lego 9V trains .
My son fell in love with them instantly , and we decided to bring the trains and every brick we owned to a local Model Railroad show in Seattle , where we let all of the attending kids run the trains , and build with our bricks .
We brought our Lego trains to the show for a few years after that , each time bringing more and more of our creations , and bringing more and more trains and bricks for the kids to play with .
Advertisement
WC : It was about this time that I posted our experiences on the web , a web that had very few Lego sites at the time , and we attracted many Adult Fans of Lego ( AFOLs ) to our shows .
I met some incredible individuals , and helped inspire them to create the first Lego Train Club , the Pacific Northwest Lego Train Club , the founding members of are still active in the Lego Train scene today .
As my older son grew , he stopped playing with Lego trains , and we moved on to building other things while my youngest son has shown renewed interest in everything Lego !
We continue to collect a lot of Lego , with vehicles , Technic , robotics , and minifigures dominating our purchases .
The Lego is all " Family " Lego , with all of the parts and sets blended into a community collection that fills an entire wall of our Lego room .
JD : So when was the point in which you decided to get into the business of creating weapons for minifigs and military minifigs ?
WC : When my youngest son turned 9 in 2006 , he became interested in WW2 history and weaponry and wondered where we could find compatible WW2 minifig accessories for our army .
I looked and looked and found no one provided them , so we decided to make them ourselves .
I have always been interested in 3D design , so we started with a few US and German weapons from WW2 and realized that we might as well make enough parts for everyone that wanted them !
And so , BrickArms was born .

JD : Do you have any real weapons yourself ?
WC : No .
I have never owned a real weapon .
I am married , and while my wife tolerates the miniature toy BrickArms , she would never tolerate real firearms of any kind .
Honestly , I count myself lucky to have such an understanding spouse as far as the BrickArms are concerned .
JD : I know that LEGO has always been obsessed about the use of weapons in their sets ; was that the reason for you to jump in and start doing BrickArms ?
WC : Although Lego makes some nice weapons , they did not offer modern ones .
When BrickArms was founded in 2006 , the most modern weapon available from Lego was a Wild West carbine dating to the 1800's .
It just would n't work for WW2 and the modern era .
Lego had always said they did not like producing modern weapons , and until their licensed Batman series and Star Wars clone series , they had not .
Now they do , but they still do n't provide the items that my son and I were interested in , and we knew we could make some terrific ones .
The only reason BrickArms exists is because Lego does not provide modern , well - designed , minifig - compatible weapons .

JD : Did they ( LEGO ) contacted you about these creations in any way ?
WC : Yes , I have been contacted by the Lego company about BrickArms , but never in any negative way .
They were very interested in my custom minifigure designs and weapons designs and per their request , I sent them copies of each one .
The company seems to be supportive of anything that promotes Lego with the hobbyists , including AFOLs .
JD : I think the simplification of the real world weapons is amazing .
How is the creative process ?
How do you decide on one weapon or another ?
WC : Mostly , Ian ( my youngest son ) finds a weapon interesting and asks if we could make it .
It is that simple .
Once he finds one he likes , I study it and I abstract the design into minifig - scale .
For some weapons , it is a distinctive stock , while for others it might be the angle of the grip , or the size and shape of the magazine clip .
Finally , I study the design and look for as many places as possible for the oversized minifigure hand to grip the weapon , and I scale the proportions accordingly .
There are a few dimensions that you absolutely cannot deviate from , and the grip is one of those locations .
Each grip must be exact .
If it is too small , it will be too loose in the minifig 's hand , and will also slip out of any mounting areas on accessories , like gun racks .
Advertisement
JD : How do you actually produce the weapons ?
What technology do you use ?
WC : Once my designs are completed , I check them by placing them in the hand of a virtual minifig in my CAD program .
Once everything looks good , I cut small trial injection molds out of aluminum , on my small Computer Numerically Controlled ( CNC ) mill in my garage .
After the mold is cut , I inject it with hot ABS plastic — the same plastic Lego uses .
I then give it to Ian to play with and if it passes his approval I send the samples to my quality team ( super- fans and moderators of the BrickArms Forums ) for further evaluation .
Once a design gets the thumbs - up from everyone , I save the design and after I collect enough designs to fill a production mold ( 10 - 15 ) , I send it to a professional tooling company to produce a mold from hardened steel .
Once the mold is cut , it is sent to an injection molding company to shoot hot ABS into the mold and produce the finished BrickArms parts .
The whole process can take up to 12 weeks from start to completion and is definitely not for the faint of heart .
It is very important to choose the very best tooling and molding companies , or it will cost you much more than you bargained for in the long run .
I chose the best , and products are of very high quality , and can stand up to the scrutiny of hardcore Lego fans .

JD : What about the custom minifigs ?
WC : The custom minifigs give my customers something different than the standard offering from Lego , and allows them to buy not only the weapons from a certain period ( like WW2 ) , but also minifigs with the uniforms of the period as well .
The custom minifigs also help my son create the armies he always wanted .
Okay , the armies * I* always wanted !
I have my own small decal printer , and I design and produce professional decals for the custom minifigs I create and sell .
I also license designs from talented minifig decal designers that I 've met on the web , and offer their licensed designs on custom minifigs .
I can produce decal designs for soldiers that Lego would never dream of producing — or at least that is what I thought before the Lego released their Indiana Jones series this year , with their Lego German Army soldiers !
JD : Do you sell a lot of these ?
What 's your most popular model ?
WC : Custom minifigure accessories are a very small niche market .
I do this mostly for the love of designing something that has n't ever been produced at this scale , and also for the challenges it provides in creating small recognizable designs .
So far , the US M4 carbine is very popular along with an Aliens - inspired M41a Sci -Fi blaster .
While sales are good , I still have a day job , with BrickArms being run out of my garage .
I have a new mold of all new designs that is almost ready for sale .
In this mold are some terrific new items that I hope will be even popular than anything else I have offered .
I will have an M1 Garand , a Light Machine Gun , bipods and monopods for mounting BrickArms , as well as new sci-fi pistols and rifles and Personal Defense Weapons ( PDWs ) .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The dollar hit new record lows against the euro , the Swiss franc and a basket of currencies on Thursday on growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month .
Adding to downward pressure on the dollar was a recovery in equity markets and a slight pick up in risk appetite which made investors more willing to put on riskier trades in high - yielding or emerging market currencies .
The more risk - friendly mood also hit the yen , a favorite source of cheap funding for the carry trades based on interest rate differentials .
The Japanese currency eased from the previous day ’s 2 - 1/ 2 year peaks versus the dollar , while the high - yielding Australian and New Zealand units -- top carry targets -- gained broadly .
“ No one really wants to bet against a fall in the dollar , ” said Niels Christensen , FX strategist at Nordea .
“ Fears of recession or lower activity in the United States and strong expectations of rate cuts is driving the dollar down ...
I am struggling to find any factor or event that could turn the tide with the dollar , ” he added .
The dollar fell to a new record low of 1.1006 Swiss francs before recovering to 1.1019 francs by 9:43 a.m. EST .
The dollar index , which measures the dollar 's value against a basket of major currencies , hit a record low of 74.916 .
DXY .
However , the dollar gained against the yen to 108.67 yen , pulling away from the 2 - 1/ 2 year low of 108.23 yen hit on Wednesday , according to Reuters data .

Expectations for further U.S. rate cuts were reinforced on Tuesday by the Fed ’s projection that economic growth will slow next year , even though the central bank adopted a reasonably hawkish tone and said that October ’s cut was a “ close call ” .
U.S. short - term interest rate futures are pricing in a 25 basis point Fed cut to 4.25 percent on December 11 and are even giving a small chance of a 50 basis point move .
A POST - THANKSGIVING $ 1.50 FOR EURO ?
The euro hit a record high of $ 1.4873 , according to Reuters data , bringing its year - to - date gains to around 12.5 percent .
It also set fresh all - time highs against the ECB ’s trade - weighted basket of 24 currencies at 111.77 .
So far European policymakers and politicians have been less vocal about the euro ’s rise than they were during its 2004 rally , in part because economic growth has held up .
Germany ’s export industry could cope with the euro at $ 1.50 , the head of BGA exporters ’ group was quoted as saying on Thursday .
But there are some notes of concern about euro ’s levels .
Chief executive of Daimler DAIGn .
DE
Dieter Zetsche said the German car and truck maker would have to boost productivity even further to offset FX developments , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the strong euro could pose difficulties for exporters .
With the United States marking the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and Japan shut on Friday , volumes were likely to remain subdued into the end of the week , potentially exacerbating market volatility .
“ Last year the market took advantage of the low liquidity environment to drive euro / dollar above $ 1.30 on the Friday following the Thursday ( U.S. Thanksgiving ) holiday , ” RBC Capital Markets said in a research note .
This time , “ $ 1.50 looms as an equally large psychological magnet as did $ 1.30 . ”
The 100 Best NES Games Ever
When I registered SydLexia.com in October 2004 , I had several major projects in mind that I did not have the resources or time to complete at the site 's launch .
One such project was the Mortal Kombat Fatality Fest , which was eventually completed in April 2005 .
But the project I 've really wanted to undertake since before I even had a website is a comprehensive list of the 100 best NES games ever made .
I have n't seen this done anywhere , as most magazines and websites tend to favor doing " Best Video Games Ever " lists , where they have every video game ever made at their disposal .
I 'm not particularly interested in doing that and it's been done so many goddam times that there 's no real point in doing it again .
Besides , it 's not very hard to come up with 100 really good video games when you have thousands to choose from .
Actually , maybe it is ; I 've seen Halo on way too many of those lists .
Still , I thought it would be more interesting to stick to one console , and there 's really no better choice than the Nintendo Entertainment System .
With the notable exception of the PlayStation 2 , no game console has ever had both the game selection and the monopolistic strangehold on the market that NES had .
With a total of 775 games ( 668 licensed and 87 unlicensed ) released for it in North America , the NES certainly had no shortage of games , nor did it have any shortage of good ones .
With that pool to choose from , I knew it would n't be too hard to find 100 decent games .
Unfortunately , I also knew that I could n't undertake the project on my own .
To come up with a list of that magnitude , I would need to form some sort of coalition .
When the site launched .
I simply did not have those sort of connections .
But by the time site 's first anniversary rolled around , I did .
And so , in November of 2005 , this Top 100 NES Games project began .
And now , here it is a year later and the article is just launching .
I do n't know why you 're not seeing until now .
Part of it is laziness , part of it is coordination problems , and part of is just that project of this magnitude takes a long time to complete .
Through out the course of this list , you will see comments from several people , let me introduce them to you : greeneyedzeke of 2D - sprites and PlutoIsAPlanetDammit .

DarkMaze was invited to comment on the games , but he was not involved in the voting .
My comments appear in white .
The rules for voting were simple .
Each player picked 100 games and ranked them from 1 - 100 , with 1 being their top pick and 100 being their lowest .
In order to be eligible for inclusion a game had to be available in North America and have received a commercial release .
Therefore games such as Adventure Island IV , which was only released in Japan , and Earthbound Zero , which was never officially released , were not valid picks .
Players were also required to vote on a game based on its merits as a Nintendo game .
So classic games such as Donkey Kong and Pac - Man which debuted in the arcade and did not arrive on the NES until years later will not necessarily appear on this list .
This list also has some known limitations .
None of us have played every single game released for the NES in North America , but I have come fairly close in recent years .
Since we all voted for games they actually played , the list is somewhat biased in favor of the types of games that each of us personally favored .
Here are some of the known biases : Dr. Jeebus favors puzzle games .
Valdronius and Jeebus favor strategy games .
Jeebus , greeneyedzeke , and I all played a lot of games based on movie and TV licenses .
I heavily favor games published by Capcom , Konami , Nintendo , and Taito .
Being brothers , Dr. Jeebus and I had to share an NES .
As a result , we have played most of the same games .
Everyone involved favors RPGs , but I seem to like them the most .
None of us are especially huge fans of sports games .
I imagine this list is likely to become a point of controversy ; that 's simply the nature of the beast .
It is nigh impossible to come up with a Top 100 list that satisfies everyone 's sensibilities .
Consequently , I do n't presume to claim that this list is anywhere near perfect .
There are some omissions that disappoint me and some inclusions that disgust me .
So if you think you can do better , go for it .
Otherwise , shut the fuck up and enjoy this article for what it is : a look at 100 NES games that are worth your consideration .

Every 11 years or so , the sun gets a little pissy .
It breaks out in a rash of planet - sized sunspots that spew superhot gas , hurling clouds of electrons , protons , and heavier ions toward Earth at nearly the speed of light .
These solar windstorms have been known to knock out power grids and TV broadcasts , and our growing reliance on space - based technology makes us more vulnerable than ever to their effects .
On January 3 , scientists discovered a reverse - polarity sunspot , signaling the start of a new cycle — and some are predicting that at its peak ( in about four years ) things are gonna get nasty .
Here 's a forecast for 2012 .

Here in the birthplace of Cesar Chavez ’s nonviolent farm labor movement , a 14 - year - old who aspired to become a policeman is cut down by gunfire on his front porch .
In the farm town of Merced , billed as the gateway to Yosemite , an armed gang member shoots an officer after a vehicle stop -- the first police slaying in the city ’s 118 - year history .
And in Red Bluff , which prides itself on its Victorian homes , rodeos , hunting and fishing , a teenage gangster pumps seven bullets into another high school student outside a party .
Along the 450 miles of the Central Valley , an explosion of gang violence in recent years has transformed life on the wide , tree - lined streets of California ’s agricultural heartland .

As jobs and relatively affordable housing in the fast - growing region have attracted families from the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas , law enforcement officials say , some have brought gang ties with them , aggravating the valley ’s home - grown street crime .
“ What we are seeing is a migration of gangs from larger cities . . . to more rural areas , ” said Jerry Hunter , who oversees state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown ’s anti-gang units .
“ The gang activity . . . is a huge crisis for those communities . ”
The spread of gang violence has strained police resources and rendered some playgrounds and streets off limits .
Bullets have shattered the peace in parks and strip malls .
Some graffiti cleanup crews in Stanislaus County have bulletproof vests or police escorts .
Lifeguards in Turlock no longer sport traditional red or blue swimwear -- those gang colors might provoke gunfire .
Schools in many places have adopted anti-gang dress codes , and rumors of impending gang attacks sometimes scare students from classes .
Fear has silenced witnesses to gang crimes .

Up and down the valley , task forces have been formed as evidence mounts that street hoodlums are committing homicides , robberies and car thefts and trafficking in drugs .
Some communities have taxed themselves to pay for more police .
Local , state and federal sweeps have produced thousands of arrests -- but tens of thousands more gang members remain on the streets , authorities say .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appointed former Sacramento U.S. Atty .
Paul Seave as his anti-gang chief , hoping to improve the effectiveness and collaboration of state agencies that spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year to prevent and combat gang violence .
And Brown has declared the gang problem a top priority , likening it to domestic terrorism .
His office is providing local agencies with expertise , intelligence and agents for raids .
The Central Valley contains eight of the 22 counties that had the most gang - related homicides in 2005 and 2006 , Seave said .
And annual California Department of Justice figures show that the number of valley gang killings has accelerated , as has the number of law enforcement agencies reporting such crimes .
In 1997 , 50 gang - related homicides were reported , compared with 80 in 2006 , the most recent year for which statistics are available .

Gang violence came with startling brutality to the Tehama County town of Red Bluff , at the northern reaches of the Sacramento River .
After a 17 - year - old Sureno gang member repeatedly shot a 16 - year - old Norteno gang member outside a house party , rumors of an attack on a local high school caused many students to stay home .
The young gang member was sentenced last year to 25 years to life in prison for the 2006 shooting .
“ This is a small town , and . . . we ’re not used to those types of things happening , ” said Greg Ulloa , the county ’s juvenile probation chief .
“ But it is getting worse . ”
The lower end of the valley has long been known as the Mason - Dixon Line of California ’s major Latino gang rivalry .
But now clashes between the Surenos , or southerners , and the Nortenos , northerners , have migrated through the state .

“ In the eastern part of the county , families are moving in from the L.A. basin , ” said Kern County Sheriff ’s Sgt. Mike Whiting .
The gang members who come with them , he said , “ are small fish there , but they can be bigger fish here . ”
The North - South conflicts are particularly pronounced in Delano .
It is territory claimed by the Nortenos , whose traditional strongholds are farming communities and who have adopted as their insignia a version of the United Farm Workers Union ’s Aztec Eagle symbol .
But the town has Surenos too and is only seven miles from that gang ’s turf in McFarland .
One night last year , 14 - year - old Steven Fierro , a freshman at Delano ’s Cesar Chavez High School , was standing outside his tidy tract home with his older brother and two of his brother ’s friends when they were strafed by rifle fire from a car .
Steven was killed and the others wounded in what police say is an unsolved shooting rooted in the gang rivalry .
Steven ’s mother Isabel keeps a small , candlelight shrine inside her front door to remind her of a son she describes as good - hearted , loving and not a gang member .
He wanted to be a policeman , she said , and hoped to buy a bigger house and nice car for his mom , who works in a horticultural facility .

She left Steven ’s room untouched -- with his video games , baseball photos and paintball gun .
“ Maybe this way I ’m thinking he has gone off to school and will be back , ” she said , weeping .
“ The same night they killed my son , they killed me also . ”
Police , school officials and community groups say gang violence cannot be curtailed without prevention and intervention .
Some towns teach parents to be on alert for signs , such as red or blue clothing , shoes and handkerchiefs , that their children might be drifting toward gangs .
Other towns have stepped up recreational activities to keep youngsters busy .
Even when law enforcement agencies record successes against a gang , members often move elsewhere , as some may have done after crackdowns on Fresno ’s Bulldogs gang .
It has an estimated 6,000 members .

Police in nearby Selma are now seeing Bulldogs , with their dog - paw tattoos , standing on street corners literally barking warnings when squad cars approach .
There have been drive - by shootings in midday , and police say one crime witness was wounded by gang members who shot through her front door .
The rise of gang violence “ has caught us off guard and shocked our community , ” said Selma Police Chief Tom Whiteside , noting that the town of about 24,000 had five gang homicides in the last three years .
“ Today , gang crime is probably No. 1 on everyone ’s radar screen in the valley . ”
Selma voters overwhelmingly approved a half - cent sales tax in November that will allow its police force to nearly double in the next decade .
The Bulldogs have adopted the red theme and menacing mascot of Cal State Fresno ’s athletic teams , sometimes blurring the visual lines between gang members and others .
“ An Hispanic group occasionally will be in a compromising position at a mini- market or walking down the street . . . because they are wearing . . .
Bulldog - related clothing , ” said Fresno Police Sgt. Bill Grove .
“ It poses problems for law enforcement as well .
. . .
We come into contact with known gang members and they claim they are just fans of the teams . ”

University officials say they will not surrender their mascot to gangs .
“ By changing our name , it would reward them , ” said Paul Oliaro , vice president for student affairs .
A striking case of mistaken identity visited Atwater , 200 miles to the north .
A Fresno State student , home for the weekend several years ago , was jogging in her red school T - shirt when someone yelled at her for wearing Norteno colors and fired five shots from a car , narrowly missing her .
Her father , Richard Hawthorne , is now the town ’s police chief .
He collaborated with the state attorney general ’s office last summer on raids against the 150 - member A - Town Gang , a Sureno affiliate .
The raids yielded 31 arrests and a cache of drugs , cash , vehicles and weapons , which Hawthorne says at least temporarily crippled his town ’s biggest gang .
The attorney general ’s office coordinated raids in Stockton last summer that took down the leadership of the Loc Town Crips , a Cambodian gang allegedly engaged in nationwide drug trafficking and terrorizing entire blocks of the city with drive - by shootings and gun battles .

Despite such strides , law enforcement agencies have suffered painful losses as gang members turned their guns on officers .
Sheriff ’s deputies were killed in Tulare and Sacramento counties days apart in December , and gang members were accused of the slayings .
After big funerals and tributes , officers ’ families are left to live with the scars .
Michelle Gray still is doing so a year after a Gangster Crip member was sentenced to die for killing her husband , a Merced police officer , during a vehicle stop .
She moved to another town because , she said , the gang harassed her after her husband ’s slaying .
The 38 - year - old nurse is raising three children on her own .
“ Our lives will never be the same , ” she said .
“ Stephan never got a chance to see our son ’s first T - ball game .
. . .
With our daughter , he missed her first dance .
. . .
And she cannot believe he ca n’t be there to give her away when she gets married . ”

In the Stanislaus County community of Ceres , an alarming number of reports of shots fired prompted Police Chief Art de Werk to begin keeping count .
Last year , more than 160 were logged in the town of about 42,000 .
Some people , he said , “ are virtual prisoners in their own homes . ”
Police Sgt. Rick Armendariz of Modesto supervises the Central Valley Gang Impact Task Force , an alliance of local , federal and state agencies that exchange intelligence and keep tabs on gang members on parole or probation .
“ Gang members do not heed borders , ” he said .
“ Gang members move here but do not cut their ties . ”

Now :
" It 's bad enough when politicians turn their backs on a war they voted for and supported when it was popular , " Cheney said Monday .
" But no one in politics , regardless of party , should hesitate to object when an American soldier at war is mocked and insulted . "
“ We won north , we won south and we won in between , ” Obama told a roaring crowd , referring to his victories over Washington and Nebraska .
“ The Democratic Party must stand for change , not change as a slogan , change we can believe in . ”
To deafening cheers Obama , 46 , hammered home to party activists that he was the candidate of change , as he laid claim to the Democratic Party ’s nomination and down the track the presidency .
Tomorrow ’s contests have been dubbed the Potomac Primary , Obama , bidding to be the first black president , is expected to do well in tomorrow ’s vote due to the large African - American population in the region .
Hillary Clinton was seen as the inevitable Democratic nominee .
She has run a strong campaign , and been an impressive candidate , but much has changed in a short time .
Instead of finding a clear path to the White House , has run into the rather extraordinary movement set in motion by Barack Obama .
In reflecting on all of this , I am reminded of a haunting line in one of Bob Dylan ’s more memorable songs from the 1960s ( Ballad of a Thin Man )
It was written in the midst of the upheavals of that period , as the civil rights and anti-war movements and the just - dawning cultural revolution were converging into a social movement .
What is clear now , months later , is that the threads of Obama ’s appeal and inspiration , woven together , spring from a powerful philosophy of change that has resonated across generational lines .
Read
It is a philosophy of redemptive self - empowerment that calls for collective action to recognise , address and resolve long - standing social problems – in Obama ’s words , “ to heal the nation ” .
For Obama , change will not come from the top - down .
Winning an election , by itself , is not enough , since it only provides leadership with a fraction of the leverage needed to make fundamental change .
When Obama says , “ We have been waiting for so long for the time when we could finally expect more from our politics , when we could give more of ourselves and feel truly invested in something bigger than a candidate or cause .
This is it :
We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for , we are the ones that we seek ” – he is both empowering his supporters , and challenging them to become the instruments of radical transformation .
And it has worked , at least so far .
Hundreds of thousands of volunteers have been organised , either working directly in the campaign or making calls on its behalf .
Well over $ 100 million has been raised from over 700,000 donors .
( In just 72 hours last week , $ 7.5 million was raised from 40,000 donors . )
The momentum that Obama has recorded is measurable , and appears to be growing .
Just two and half months ago his campaign was viewed with skepticism , and dismissed .
“ Once I ’m elected , I want to organize a summit in the Muslim world , with all the heads of state , to have an honest discussion about ways to bridge the gap that grows every day between Muslims and the West , ”
The movement he has unleashed is not focused on just winning .
That is too limited and too cynical a goal for his supporters .
They do not seek power for its own sake , they seek to bring about fundamental change .
This election is important , but , more than that , it is also interesting .
“ My son had a hard time in school , but every time something happened it was a learning moment for him , ” Mrs. Asghar said .
“ He learned how to cope .
A lot of people were discriminated against in this country , but the only thing that brings change is education . ”
Many parents , however , would rather their children learn in a less difficult environment , and opt to keep them home .
Hina Khan -Mukhtar decided to tutor her three sons at home and to send them to a small Muslim school cooperative established by some 15 Bay Area families for subjects like Arabic , science and carpentry .
She made up her mind after visiting her oldest son ’s prospective public school kindergarten , where each pupil had assembled a scrapbook titled “ Why I Like Pigs . ” Mrs. Khan -Mukhtar read with dismay what the children had written about the delicious taste of pork , barred by Islam .
“ I remembered at that age how important it was to fit in , ” she said .
Many Muslim parents contacted for this article were reluctant to talk , saying Muslim home - schoolers were often portrayed as religious extremists .
That view is partly fueled by the fact that Adam Gadahn , an American - born spokesman for Al Qaeda , was home - schooled in rural California .
“ There is a tendency to make home - schoolers look like antisocial fanatics who do n’t want their kids in the system , ” said Nabila Hanson , who argues that most home - schoolers , like herself , make an extra effort to find their children opportunities for sports , music or field trips with other people .

Lodi ’s Muslims also attracted unwanted national attention when one local man , Hamid Hayat , was sentenced last year to 24 years in prison on a terrorism conviction that his relatives say was largely due to a fabricated confession .
( Had he been more Americanized , they say , he would have known to ask for a lawyer as soon as the F.B.I. appeared . )
On Friday 7 January 1944 , Anne Frank confessed her love for a boy she had been smitten with for years .
She had first set eyes upon him in school in 1940 , and they had been ' inseparable ' for a whole summer , walking hand in hand through their neighbourhood in Amsterdam , him in a white cotton suit , her in a short summer dress .
He was ' tall , slim and good - looking , with a serious , quiet and intelligent face ' .
He had dark hair , brown eyes , a slightly pointed nose .
Anne was ' crazy about his smile ' , which gave him a mischievous air .
At one point he gave her a pendant as a keepsake .
This was the boy she hoped to marry .
His name was Peter Schiff , he was almost three years her senior , and it is clear from her diary that he was seldom out of her thoughts throughout her two years in hiding in the secret annexe behind her father 's office .
On 6 January 1944 she wrote that her image of him was so vivid that she did n't need a photograph , but anyone who has read her diary may be curious to see what he looked like at the time she knew him .
Until now , no portrait of Peter Schiff has come to light .
But the picture you see opposite has ended this 60 - year mystery and provided another glimpse into a devastated world .
The photo does its trick - it shows an extremely handsome boy of 12 full of hope for the future ; it is not difficult to see his appeal to any vivacious and eager girl of similar age - but the background to its recent discovery provides something more , another layer in one of the most iconic stories of our time .
The story of Anne Frank is one of bravery and fortitude .
Her journal , the Diary of a Young Girl , continues to be read anew by hundreds of thousands each year not just for the insights it brings us into occupied Europe , or the practical details we glean about hiding in cramped conditions with limited resources .
It is also a story of a bright Jewish girl 's transition to adulthood , a maturing of intellect and sexuality and all the possibilities and challenges this brings .
At times her diary is a catalogue of frustration and insecurity , but it is all - involving , a saga of peril and yearning written with exceptional emotional insight and cadences that , judging by the teenage blogs of today , we may have lost for good .
But the romantic longing and crushes she experienced are timeless and universal , and anyone who has ever lost in love will sense their eyes swell with tears as she writes of Peter Schiff .
Anne Frank 's life and writing is not emblematic of the 6 million who died ; it is far more powerful as a single voice .
Since its first Dutch publication under the title The Secret Annexe in 1947 , total sales have been estimated at more than 35m .
Anne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt am Main .
She moved to Amsterdam with her family following the Nazis ' rise to power in 1933 , but became trapped by the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940 .
She moved from a Montessori school to a Jewish one , and her life became a series of restrictions and limitations .
In June 1942 she received a notebook for her 13th birthday , and her commonplace observations were usually accompanied by darker allusions .
The preceding months had seen the Frank family dispose of much of their furniture and other possessions as her father planned the flight from their house to a number of rooms at the back of his office by a canal in the western quarter of the city .
A move was set for 16 July , but circumstances forced a move 10 days earlier .
Decoys were set : the house was made to look like it was vacated in an emergency ; a note suggested their destination was Switzerland .
Anne shared her back rooms with seven others : her mother Edith , father Otto and sister Margot , a family friend named Fritz Pfeffer and the van Daan family ( real name : van Pels ) , and much of her writing describes the jostling for position within their confined environment .
She disguised the identity of the family who concealed them and brought them food and news of the outside world , and she addressed most of her diary entries to ' Dearest Kitty ' , a technique that prompted both a confessional style and the prospect of response .
Despite her desire to become a published author , she intended her diary to remain private .
But as the war progressed she began to realise the potential educational value of her writing , and she edited entries she judged to be too exposing .
At times her head is full of jealousy and self - doubt , but her mood is levelled by her memory of one boy .
' You must n't think I am in love with Peter [ van Daan ] , because I 'm not ...
This morning I woke up just before seven and immediately remembered what I 'd been dreaming about .
I was sitting on a chair and across from me was Peter ... Peter Schiff ... the dream was so vivid ...
Peter 's eyes suddenly met mine and I ...# 8239 ; stared for a long time into those velvety brown eyes .
Then he said very softly : " If only I 'd known I 'd have come to you long ago . "
I turned away abruptly , overcome by emotion .
And then I felt a soft , oh - so - cool and gentle cheek against mine , and it felt so good , so good . '
When she woke up she could still feel his cheek against hers , and his eyes ' staring deep into my heart ' .
She believed he knew how much she had loved him ' and how much I still do ' .
She had a nickname for him , Petel .
On 7 January 1944 , she writes of being kissed by her father , and wishing it was Peter .
' All day long I 've been repeating to myself , " Oh Petel , my darling , darling Petel ... " '
Later in the entry she asks : ' Where can I find help ?
I simply have to go on living and praying to God that , if we ever get out of here , Peter 's path will cross mine .
Once , when Father and I were talking about sex , he said I was too young to understand that kind of desire .
But I thought I did understand it , and now I 'm sure I do .
Nothing is as dear to me now as my darling Petel !'
As the months progress she wonders if Peter van Daan will serve as a suitable replacement for Peter Schiff , and her suspicious attitude towards him softens towards affection .
But at the end of the diary we learn that he has disappointed her .
Her last mention of Peter Schiff occurs at the end of April 1944 , six weeks before her 15th birthday and three months before her house was raided by the German Security Police .
She recalls her dream and the brushing of his cheek , and the intensity it aroused : ' I love Peter as I 've never loved anyone . '
Before he moved to Amsterdam in 1939 , Peter had another friend .
Ernst ' Mic ' Michaelis went to school with him in Berlin , and they saw each other whenever they could .
Michaelis is now 81 , and is a director of Pearson Panke , automotive and aerospace machinery suppliers in Mill Hill in north London .
His recollections of Peter Schiff are as vivid as if he had written them in a diary .
' I always had a feeling of elation being with him , ' he says .
' As a boy I liked making things , and I had simple woodworking tools and later a metal construction kit .
We played with that together .
I also had a very grand model railway layout , and we probably played with that as well .
We were 11 or 12 years old .
I was never bored in his company - I had always liked people who were full of odd ideas , and he was . '
Michaelis was born in Berlin in 1926 , and he still speaks with a slight German accent .
He remembers that Peter owned an expensive pen , perhaps the one in his pocket in the photograph , possibly bought for him by his mother 's new partner ( it is believed his father had separated from his mother before the war and moved to the United States ) .
Michaelis also remembers the comfort he felt from being with his friend the day after Kristallnacht , the evening in November 1938 when Jewish homes , shops and synagogues were vandalised throughout Germany and thousands of Jews were escorted to the camps .
' I must have known him for at least a year and a half , possibly longer , ' Michaelis remembers .
' He was an intelligent boy , and I think this must have been why he liked Anne - she had a lively mind .
You get the impression from her mentions of him that it was all to do with appearance , but I 'm sure she would have been bored with him if he'd been stupid . '
Michaelis and Schiff last saw each other in the summer of 1939 .
Michaelis came to England on the Kindertransport , going to school first in Sussex and then attending Bryanston School in Dorset .
Schiff , accompanied by his mother , went to Amsterdam .
But before the boys parted they exchanged photographs .
Michaelis 's picture was taken by a friend of his mother at his home , while Schiff 's may have been taken at a professional studio .
' We did not know how else to say goodbye to each other - 12 - year - old boys do not promise each other to write letters .
We were at my home , but to be together as long as possible I walked with him to his home , about 25 minutes ' walk . '
Schiff wrote a note using his full name : ' In friendly remembrance of your friend Lutz Peter Schiff ' and Michaelis pasted both note and photograph ( which was standard passport - size ) into an album .
A few years later the photograph was transferred to a larger book , where it sat undisturbed alongside other photos and correspondence for several decades .
When he first read Anne Frank 's diary in the Fifties , Michaelis had suspected that the Peter Schiff in the book was the same boy he had once known .
He imagined that Schiff had perished in a concentration camp , but he could n't confirm this either .
In the last few years , however , things have come into focus .
In 2000 he received a copy of Aktuell , a publication sent to refugees from Berlin scattered throughout the world .
It carried a class photograph from Holdheim School taken in the spring of 1938 , and with it a request for information regarding any of the 25 people pictured in it with their thick winter coats and sunny dispositions .
Michaelis recognised it as his class : there he was , number 18 , leaning to his left so we could get a good look at him .
To his right in the same row , at number 10 , was Peter Schiff .
But Michaelis had more important things on his mind at the time : his wife Ann had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer .
He put the magazine to one side , and forgot about it .
In May 2005 his wife was told there was nothing more they could do for her .
She said she would like to pay a final visit to Berlin , but this may have been as much for his benefit as for hers : she was born in London in 1939 , and was not Jewish .
They had visited the city not long after the wall came down , at a time when large parts of it still resembled a building site , and Ann said she wanted to see what had been built .
They visited the Jewish Museum , and she bought a copy of Anne Frank 's diary .
' At that time , because of her confused mind , she could n't read novels , but she could still read biographies , ' her husband says .
She died four months after their visit .
Last summer , shortly before his two children had found him sheltered accommodation , Michaelis picked up Anne Frank 's diary again and began to wonder .
' I realised that there were lots of pictures associated with her life , but no picture of Peter Schiff .
That seemed very odd , as his [ good ] looks are at the heart of his story .
I thought that people might be interested in my picture . '
He contacted the man who had placed the class photo in Aktuell , and began a correspondence with several of his old classmates .
Two remembered Peter Schiff well : ' He was a very likeable and friendly boy , ' wrote Ursula Meyer ( nee Totschek , number six in the photograph ) , who now lives in Maryland , ' and I think I had a bit of a crush on him . '
Helga Burch ( nee Walnau , number two ) , now residing in California , remembered that he was a ' delightful , funny , alert class clown , the spirit of the class .
He once made Dr Gottschalk [ the rabbi to the right of the picture ] so angry that he hit him . '
When Michaelis searched the internet he found conflicting information , but his research did at least confirm Schiff 's date of birth , and that he and Anne Frank shared the same friend .
Michaelis called the Anne Frank Trust in London : they said they did n't have a picture of Peter Schiff and knew very little about him .
Then he wrote to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam ( the preserved building where she and her family hid - an educational centre that attracted more than 1 m visitors last year ) , and staff confirmed that they did n't have a picture .
They encouraged Michaelis to visit , and earlier this year he made the trip with his children and his grandchildren , and his photograph .
' They were very excited , ' he says , and he agreed the photograph could be used for educational purposes and on the museum 's busy website .
They told him there are pictures of the school Peter attended in Amsterdam , and they might now be able to pick him out .
The photo will soon be on display on the Anne Frank House website , and perhaps at the House itself , but the story is not quite complete .
We know of Anne Frank 's fate - arrest and then deportation to Auschwitz and Bergen - Belsen ; she died of typhus in late February or early March 1945 , only a few weeks before the camp was liberated .
Of those in hiding with her only her father survived , and until his death in 1980 he dedicated his life to the protection and promotion of her diaries .
But the fate of Peter Schiff is less certain .
He too must have spent many months in hiding , and upon capture it is believed he disobeyed orders to join an enforced labour unit in Amsterdam ( the fate of his mother is unclear ) .
Classified as a criminal , he was transported to the Westerbork transit camp near the Netherlands ' northeastern border ( the Frank family was also held there for a while ) , and from there to Bergen - Belsen and probably Auschwitz .
The date of his death is unknown , although it is entered in the record books on 31 May 1945 .
In place of Peter Schiff 's final details we have something quite as valuable .
Not just a photograph but also a love story , between a famous girl and a handsome boy , and an elderly man and his memories of a fractured childhood .
' We tried to make some very silly jokes , ' Mic Michaelis says of the day he obtained his unique memento and said goodbye to a friend he would not see again .
' But instead of laughing , all we could do was to try not to cry . '
CHAMPAIGN , Ill . --
A new catalyst - free , self - healing material system developed by researchers at the University of Illinois offers a far less expensive and far more practical way to repair composite materials used in structural applications ranging from airplane fuselages to wind - farm propeller blades .
The new self - healing system incorporates chlorobenzene microcapsules , as small as 150 microns in diameter , as an active solvent .
The expensive , ruthenium - based Grubbs ' catalyst , which was required in the researchers ' first approach , is no longer needed .
" By removing the catalyst from our material system , we now have a simpler and more economical alternative for strength recovery after crack damage has occurred , " said Jeffrey Moore , the Murchison - Mallory Professor of Chemistry at Illinois .
" Self - healing of epoxy materials with encapsulated solvents can prevent further crack propagation , while recovering most of the material 's mechanical integrity . "
The new chemistry is described in a paper accepted for publication in Macromolecules , and posted on the journal 's Web site .
During normal use , epoxy - based materials experience stresses that can cause cracking , which can lead to mechanical failure .
Autonomous self - healing - a process in which the damage itself triggers the repair mechanism - can retain structural integrity and extend the lifetime of the material .
" Although we demonstrated the self - healing concept with a ruthenium - based catalyst , the cost of the catalyst made our original approach too expensive and impractical , " said Moore , who also is affiliated with the university 's Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory and with the Beckman Institute .
" Our new self - healing system is simple , very economical and potentially robust . "
In the researchers ' original approach , self - healing materials consisted of a microencapsulated healing agent ( dicyclopentadiene ) and Grubbs ' catalyst embedded in an epoxy matrix .
When the material cracked , microcapsules would rupture and release the healing agent , which then reacted with the catalyst to repair the damage .
In their new approach , when a crack forms in the epoxy material , microcapsules containing chlorobenzene break .
The solvent disperses into the matrix , where it finds pockets of unreacted epoxy monomers .
The solvent then carries the latent epoxy monomers into the crack , where polymerization takes place , restoring structural integrity .
In fracture tests , self - healing composites with catalyst - free chemistry recovered as much as 82 percent of their original fracture toughness .
The new catalyst - free chemistry has taken down the barriers to cost and level of difficulty , Moore said .
" From an economics and simplicity standpoint , self - healing materials could become part of everyday life . "

Courts Bracing for Cut of About $ 300 Million From Judiciary Budget , Judge Marks Says in Memo
Ryan Tarinelli
In a memorandum dated Tuesday , Chief Administrative Judge Lawrence Marks characterized the cut as “ dramatic ” and said it has compelled them to “ implement a range of painful measures . ”
Rails 2.0 is finally finished after about a year in the making .
This is a fantastic release that ’s absolutely stuffed with great new features , loads of fixes , and an incredible amount of polish .
We ’ve even taken a fair bit of cruft out to make the whole package more coherent and lean .
What a milestone for Ruby on Rails as well .
I ’ve personally been working on this framework for about four and a half years and we have contributors who ’ve been around for almost as long as well .
It ’s really satisfying to see how far we ’ve come in that period of time .
That we ’ve proven the initial hype worthy , that we ’ve been able to stick with it and continue to push the envelope .
Before jumping into the breakdown of features , I ’d just like to extend my deep gratitude towards everyone who helped make this release possible .
From the stable of merry men in the Rails core to the hundreds of contributors who got a patch applied to everyone who participated in the community over the year .
This release is a triumph for large - scale open source development and you can all be mighty proud of the role you played .
Cheers !
With the touchy - feely stuff out of the way , let ’s dig into the feast and look at just a sliver of what ’s new :
Action Pack : Resources
This is where the bulk of the action for 2.0 has gone .
We ’ve got a slew of improvements to the RESTful lifestyle .
First , we ’ve dropped the semicolon for custom methods instead of the regular slash .
So / people / 1 ; edit is now / people / 1/ edit .
We ’ve also added the namespace feature to routing resources that makes it really easy to confine things like admin interfaces :
map.namespace( : admin ) do |admin| admin.resources : products , : collection => { : inventory => : get } , : member => { : duplicate => : post } , :has_many => [ : tags , :images , : variants ]
end
Which will give you named routes like inventory_admin_products_url and admin_product_tags_url .
To keep track of this named routes proliferation , we ’ve added the “ rake routes ” task , which will list all the named routes created by routes.rb .
We ’ve also instigated a new convention that all resource - based controllers will be plural by default .
This allows a single resource to be mapped in multiple contexts and still refer to the same controller .
Example :
# /avatars /45 => AvatarsController #show map.resources :avatars # / people/5/avatar => AvatarsController #show map.resources : people , : has_one => : avatar
Action Pack : Multiview
Alongside the improvements for resources come improvements for multiview .
We already have #respond_to , but we ’ve taken it a step further and made it dig into the templates .
We ’ve separated the format of the template from its rendering engine .
So show . rhtml now becomes show .html.erb , which is the template that ’ll be rendered by default for a show action that has declared format .
html in its respond_to .
And you can now have something like show .csv.erb , which targets text / csv , but also uses the default ERB renderer .
So the new format for templates is action .
format.renderer .
A few examples :
show.erb : same show template for all formats
index.atom.builder : uses the Builder format , previously known as rxml , to render an index action for the application / atom+xml mime type
edit.iphone.haml : uses the custom HAML template engine ( not included by default ) to render an edit action for the custom Mime : : IPHONE format
Speaking of the iPhone , we ’ve made it easier to declare “ fake ” types that are only used for internal routing .
Like when you want a special HTML interface just for an iPhone .
All it takes is something like this :
# should go in config / initializers / mime_types.rb Mime.register_alias " text / html " , :iphone class ApplicationController < ActionController :: Base before_filter :adjust_format_for_iphone private def adjust_format_for_iphone if request.env [" HTTP_USER_AGENT " ] && request .
env [ " HTTP_USER_AGENT
" ][/( iPhone|iPod ) / ] request .
format = :iphone end end end class PostsController < ApplicationController def index respond_to do |format| format.html # renders index.html.erb format.iphone # renders index.iphone.erb end end end
You ’re encouraged to declare your own mime - type aliases in the config / initializers / mime_types.rb file .
This file is included by default in all new applications .
Action Pack : Record identification
Piggy - backing off the new drive for resources are a number of simplifications for controller and view methods that deal with URLs .
We ’ve added a number of conventions for turning model classes into resource routes on the fly .
Examples :
# person is a Person object , which by convention will # be mapped to person_url for lookup redirect_to ( person ) link_to ( person.name , person ) form_for ( person )
Action Pack : HTTP Loving
As you might have gathered , Action Pack in Rails 2.0 is all about getting closer with HTTP and all its glory .
Resources , multiple representations , but there ’s more .
We ’ve added a new module to work with HTTP Basic Authentication , which turns out to be a great way to do API authentication over SSL .
It ’s terribly simple to use .
Here ’s an example ( there are more in ActionController : : HttpAuthentication ) :
class PostsController < ApplicationController USER_NAME , PASSWORD = " dhh " , " secret " before_filter :authenticate , : except => [ : index ] def index render : text =>
" Everyone can see me ! " end def edit render : text =>
" I 'm only accessible if you know the password " end private def authenticate authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |user_name , password| user_name == USER_NAME && password == PASSWORD end end end
We ’ve also made it much easier to structure your JavaScript and stylesheet files in logical units without getting clobbered by the HTTP overhead of requesting a bazillion files .
Using javascript_include_tag( : all , : cache => true ) will turn public / javascripts /.js into a single public / javascripts / all.js file in production , while still keeping the files separate in development , so you can work iteratively without clearing the cache .
Along the same lines , we ’ve added the option to cheat browsers who do n’t feel like pipelining requests on their own .
If you set ActionController : : Base.asset_host = “ assets%d.example.com ” , we ’ll automatically distribute your asset calls ( like image_tag ) to asset1 through asset4 .
That allows the browser to open many more connections at a time and increases the perceived speed of your application .
Action Pack : Security
Making it even easier to create secure applications out of the box is always a pleasure and with Rails 2.0 we ’re doing it from a number of fronts .
Most importantly , we now ship we a built - in mechanism for dealing with CRSF attacks .
By including a special token in all forms and Ajax requests , you can guard from having requests made from outside of your application .
All this is turned on by default in new Rails 2.0 applications and you can very easily turn it on in your existing applications using ActionController : : Base.protect_from_forgery ( see ActionController : : RequestForgeryProtection for more ) .
We ’ve also made it easier to deal with XSS attacks while still allowing users to embed HTML in your pages .
The old TextHelper #sanitize method has gone from a black list ( very hard to keep secure ) approach to a white list approach .
If you ’re already using sanitize , you ’ll automatically be granted better protection .
You can tweak the tags that are allowed by default with sanitize as well .
See TextHelper #sanitize for details .
Finally , we ’ve added support for HTTP only cookies .
They are not yet supported by all browsers , but you can use them where they are .
Action Pack : Exception handling
Lots of common exceptions would do better to be rescued at a shared level rather than per action .
This has always been possible by overwriting rescue_action_in_public , but then you had to roll out your own case statement and call super .
Bah .
So now we have a class level macro called rescue_from , which you can use to declaratively point certain exceptions to a given action .
Example :
class PostsController < ApplicationController rescue_from User:: NotAuthorized , : with => : deny_access protected def deny_access ... end end
Action Pack : Cookie store sessions
The default session store in Rails 2.0 is now a cookie - based one .
That means sessions are no longer stored on the file system or in the database , but kept by the client in a hashed form that ca n’t be forged .
This makes it not only a lot faster than traditional session stores , but also makes it zero maintenance .
There ’s no cron job needed to clear out the sessions and your server wo n’t crash because you forgot and suddenly had 500K files in tmp / session .
This setup works great if you follow best practices and keep session usage to a minimum , such as the common case of just storing a user_id and a the flash .
If , however , you are planning on storing the nuclear launch codes in the session , the default cookie store is a bad deal .
While they ca n’t be forged ( so is_admin = true is fine ) , their content can be seen .
If that ’s a problem for your application , you can always just switch back to one of the traditional session stores ( but first investigate that requirement as a code smell ) .
Action Pack : New request profiler
Figuring out where your bottlenecks are with real usage can be tough , but we just made it a whole lot easier with the new request profiler that can follow an entire usage script and report on the aggregate findings .
You use it like this :
$ cat login_session.rb get_with_redirect '/' say " GET / => # {path} " post_with_redirect '/ sessions ' , :username => ' john ' , : password => ' doe ' say " POST / sessions => # {path} " $ ./script/performance/request -n 10 login_session.rb
And you get a thorough breakdown in HTML and text on where time was spent and you ’ll have a good idea on where to look for speeding up the application .
Action Pack : Miscellaneous
Also of note is AtomFeedHelper , which makes it even simpler to create Atom feeds using an enhanced Builder syntax .
Simple example :
# index.atom.builder : atom_feed do | feed| feed .
title ( " My great blog ! " ) feed.updated((@posts.first.created_at ) ) for post in @posts feed .
entry ( post ) do |entry | entry.title(post.title ) entry.content(post.body , : type => ' html ' ) entry.author do |author| author.name ( " DHH " ) end end end end
We ’ve made a number of performance improvements , so asset tag calls are now much cheaper and we ’re caching simple named routes , making them much faster too .
Finally , we ’ve kicked out in_place_editor and autocomplete_for into plugins that live on the official Rails SVN .
Active Record : Performance
Active Record has seen a gazillion fixes and small tweaks , but it ’s somewhat light on big new features .
Something new that we have added , though , is a very simple Query Cache , which will recognize similar SQL calls from within the same request and return the cached result .
This is especially nice for N+1 situations that might be hard to handle with : include or other mechanisms .
We ’ve also drastically improved the performance of fixtures , which makes most test suites based on normal fixture use be 50 - 100 % faster .
Active Record : Sexy migrations
There ’s a new alternative format for declaring migrations in a slightly more efficient format .
Before you ’d write :
create_table : people do |t| t.column , “ account_id ” , : integer t.column , “ first_name ” , : string , : null => false t.column , “ last_name ” , : string , : null => false t.column , “ description ” , : text t.column , “ created_at ” , : datetime t.column , “ updated_at ” , : datetime end
Now you can write :
create_table : people do |t| t.integer :account_id t.string : first_name , : last_name , :null => false t.text : description t.timestamps
end
Active Record : Foxy fixtures
The fixtures in Active Record has taken a fair amount of flak lately .
One of the key points in that criticism has been the work with declaring dependencies between fixtures .
Having to relate fixtures through the ids of their primary keys is no fun .
That ’s been addressed now and you can write fixtures like this :
# sellers.yml shopify : name : Shopify # products .yml pimp_cup : seller : shopify name : Pimp cup
As you can see , it ’s no longer necessary to declare the ids of the fixtures and instead of using seller_id to refer to the relationship , you just use seller and the name of the fixture .
Active Record : XML in , JSON out
Active Record has supported serialization to XML for a while .
In 2.0 we ’ve added deserialization too , so you can say Person.new.from_xml ( “ David ” ) and get what you ’d expect .
We ’ve also added serialization to JSON , which supports the same syntax as XML serialization ( including nested associations ) .
Just do person.
to_json and you ’re ready to roll .
Active Record : Shedding some weight
To make Active Record a little leaner and meaner , we ’ve removed the acts_as_XYZ features and put them into individual plugins on the Rails SVN repository .
So say you ’re using acts_as_list , you just need to do ./ script / plugin install acts_as_list and everything will move along like nothing ever happened .
A little more drastic , we ’ve also pushed all the commercial database adapters into their own gems .
So Rails now only ships with adapters for MySQL , SQLite , and PostgreSQL .
These are the databases that we have easy and willing access to test on .
But that does n’t mean the commercial databases are left out in the cold .
Rather , they ’ve now been set free to have an independent release schedule from the main Rails distribution .
And that ’s probably a good thing as the commercial databases tend to require a lot more exceptions and hoop jumping on a regular basis to work well .
The commercial database adapters now live in gems that all follow the same naming convention : activerecord - XYZ - adapter .
So if you gem install activerecord - oracle - adapter , you ’ll instantly have Oracle available as an adapter choice in all the Rails applications on that machine .
You wo n’t have to change a single line in your applications to take use of it .
That also means it ’ll be easier for new database adapters to gain traction in the Rails world .
As long as you package your adapter according to the published conventions , users just have to install the gem and they ’re ready to roll .
Active Record : with_scope with a dash of syntactic vinegar
ActiveRecord :: Base .with_scope has gone protected to discourage people from misusing it in controllers ( especially in filters ) .
Instead , it ’s now encouraged that you only use it within the model itself .
That ’s what it was designed for and where it logically remains a good fit .
But of course , this is all about encouraging and discouraging .
If you ’ve weighed the pros and the cons and still want to use with_scope outside of the model , you can always call it through . send ( : with_scope ) .
ActionWebService out , ActiveResource in
It ’ll probably come as no surprise that Rails has picked a side in the SOAP vs REST debate .
Unless you absolutely have to use SOAP for integration purposes , we strongly discourage you from doing so .
As a naturally extension of that , we ’ve pulled ActionWebService from the default bundle .
It ’s only a gem install actionwebservice away , but it sends an important message none the less .
At the same time , we ’ve pulled the new ActiveResource framework out of beta and into the default bundle .
ActiveResource is like ActiveRecord , but for resources .
It follows a similar API and is configured to Just Work with Rails applications using the resource - driven approach .
For example , a vanilla scaffold will be accessible by ActiveResource .
ActiveSupport
There ’s not all that much new in ActiveSupport .
We ’ve a host of new methods like Array # rand for getting a random element from an array , Hash # except to filter down a hash from undesired keys and lots of extensions for Date .
We also made testing a little nicer with assert_difference .
Short of that , it ’s pretty much just fixes and tweaks .
Action Mailer
This is a very modest update for Action Mailer .
Besides a handful of bug fixes , we ’ve added the option to register alternative template engines and assert_emails to the testing suite , which works like this :
Assert number of emails delivered within a block :
assert_emails 1 do
post : signup , : name => ‘ Jonathan ’
end
Rails :
The debugger is back
To tie it all together , we have a stream of improvements for Rails in general .
My favorite amongst these is the return of the breakpoint in form of the debugger .
It ’s a real debugger too , not just an IRB dump .
You can step back and forth , list your current position , and much more .
It ’s all coming from the gracious note of the ruby - debug gem .
So you ’ll have to install that for the new debugger to work .
To use the debugger , you just install the gem , put “ debugger ” somewhere in your application , and then start the server with — debugger or - u .
When the code executes the debugger command , you ’ll have it available straight in the terminal running the server .
No need for script / breakpointer or anything else .
You can use the debugger in your tests too .
Rails : Clean up your environment
Before Rails 2.0 , config/environment.rb files every where would be clogged with all sorts of one - off configuration details .
Now you can gather those elements in self - contained files and put them under config / initializers and they ’ll automatically be loaded .
New Rails 2.0 applications ship with two examples in form of inflections.rb ( for your own pluralization rules ) and mime_types.rb ( for your own mime types ) .
This should ensure that you need to keep nothing but the default in config / environment.rb .
Rails : Easier plugin order
Now that we ’ve yanked out a fair amount of stuff from Rails and into plugins , you might well have other plugins that depend on this functionality .
This can require that you load , say , acts_as_list before your own acts_as_extra_cool_list plugin in order for the latter to extend the former .
Before , this required that you named all your plugins in config .
plugins .
Major hassle when all you wanted to say was “ I only care about acts_as_list being loaded before everything else ” .
Now you can do exactly that with config .
plugins = [ : acts_as_list , :all ] .
And hundreds upon hundreds of other improvements
What I ’ve talked about above is but a tiny sliver of the full 2.0 package .
We ’ve got literally hundreds of bug fixes , tweaks , and feature enhancements crammed into Rails 2.0 .
All this coming off the work of tons of eager contributors working tirelessly to improve the framework in small , but important ways .
I encourage you to scourger the CHANGELOGs and learn more about all that changed .
So how do I upgrade ?
If you want to move your application to Rails 2.0 , you should first move it to Rails 1.2.6 .
That ’ll include deprecation warnings for most everything we yanked out in 2.0 .
So if your application runs fine on 1.2.6 with no deprecation warnings , there ’s a good chance that it ’ll run straight up on 2.0 .
Of course , if you ’re using , say , pagination , you ’ll need to install the classic_pagination plugin .
If you ’re using Oracle , you ’ll need to install the activerecord - oracle - adapter gem .
And so on and so forth for all the extractions .
So how do I install ?
To install through gems , do :
gem install rails -y
… if you ’re having trouble with that ( gem not found ) , just grab gems from our own repository in the meanwhile :
gem install rails -y — source http://gems.rubyonrails.org
To try it from an SVN tag , use ( you may need to run this command twice depending on your current Rails version ) :
rake rails : freeze:edge
TAG
=rel_2-0-1
Note :
It ’s 2.0.1 because we found a small issue just after we pushed 2.0.0 .
Do you sometimes have the feeling that you ’re running into the same obstacles over and over again ?
Many of my conflicts have the same feel to them , like “ Hey , I think I ’ve been here before ”
Snorting cocaine is an environmental crime whatever your views on drug use , scientists declared last week .
A panel of scientists meeting at the Natural History Museum in London last week detailed how the production of the drug and its trafficking affect biodiversity and contribute to climate change .
The production of a gram of cocaine means the destruction of four square metres of Colombian forest , they said , raising the question of which supermodels , popstars and city types should be lined up with hummer drivers and big game hunters in the environmental most - wanted stakes .
Colombia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the planet , and also the biggest cocaine producer .
Bad combination .
Cocaine production is a threat to environment is all its stages , said Liliana Davalos , lecturer in Molecular Ecology at the Open University , UK .
The first step of the cycle is the destruction of forest to plant coca .
Every year , 100 thousand hectares of Colombian forest is destroyed for this end .
The plantations also use tons of herbicides that are forbidden in many other countries .
Since the UK is one of the world ’s largest consumption markets for cocaine , it makes concerns about organic tomatoes and pesticides seem futile .
Then , the coca leaves must be soaked in solvents to release their psychotropic substances .
Every year , 20 million litres of acetone , 13 million litres of gasoline and 81 thousand litres of sulphuric acid are used in this process and then thrown away , untreated , in rivers and water streams .
Transporting the product demands the clearing of more forests for landing strips , preferably in national parks and conservation areas .
" These areas belong to the Government , so no owner can be held liable for the illegal activities , " Davalos points out .
Finally , the Colombian government 's efforts to eradicate the plantations only serve to exacerbate the situation .
They use planes to spray herbicides over coca plantations , with predictably gruesome consequences for insects , amphibians and other plants in the area .
Growers then move to other areas , clear the native vegetation and start all over again .
For those who are convinced of the huge impact of their stimulant consumption and want to change for a milder and more ethical one , massive doses of caffeine are the way to go .
Coffee from shade trees cultivation farms , where the bushes are grown in the shadow of native taller trees , is a much more eco-friendly option .
" Biodiversity in these plantations is almost as high as in primary forests , " said botanist Sandy Knapp from the Natural History Museum .
So , the geek classic stimulant is eco-friendly , while the yuppie classic is a no no . ®

Randall Jeppsen and Whit Johnson reportingA video of a Utah Highway Patrolman is getting big play all over the Internet .
So , is the trooper in the right or the wrong ?
The man has filed a complaint and is threatening to sue the Utah Highway Patrol for being wrongfully tasered .
He got his hands on the trooper 's dash - cam video and posted it all over the Internet .
This whole thing started with a speeding ticket that escalated into much more very quickly .
The Utah Department of Public Safety is now trying to figure out whether or not the trooper 's actions were justified .
Posted on popular Web sites like YouTube , a trooper with the UHP shows the world what can happen if you resist arrest .
The incident happened near Vernal in mid-September .
Jared Massey , the driver of an SUV was pulled over for speeding .
His wife was in the passenger seat ; his toddler was in the back .
In the video Massey clearly becomes frustrated about the citation , demanding to know how fast he was going .
The trooper said , " Well , you 're going to sign this first . "
Massey replies , " No , I 'm not .
I 'm not signing anything officer . "
And the trooper says , " OK , hop out of the car . "
He then attempts to place Massey under arrest .
" Turn around , put your hands behind your back . "
You can see in the video that Massey ignores the command and proceeds to walk toward the car .
He 's then tasered .
Massey spoke to KSL Newsradio .
He says , " I 'm laying there on the ground , and I start coming to and I hear him yelling at me another command , and before I can process it , he 's telling me to roll over , he hits me with the Taser again .
" I gashed my head open and had cuts and bruises on my back , and they had to take me to the hospital . "
He 's threatening legal action .
Meanwhile , the Utah Department of Public Safety is trying to answer some questions of its own .
Sgt. Jeff Nigbur said , " I do not know what that particular trooper was thinking about , what he was concerned about , whether he felt his life was in danger , whether he was worried about the driver 's life so close to traffic .
I do n't know . "
If you refuse to sign a citation , troopers can give you another citation or , in some cases , they can place you under arrest .
That 's what happened in this instance .
The investigation should be complete sometime next week .

One of those sixteen days is September 20 , 2003 , the day the DoJ and FBI announced their investigation into who leaked Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity .
Quite a coinky - dink , is n't it ?
Ken Livingstone will be thumbing through his thesaurus in search of new adjectives .
The US embassy in London - whose head has been described by the London mayor as a " chiselling little crook " - now owes more than £ 2 m in unpaid congestion charge payments and other traffic penalties , the Guardian has learned .
The figure puts America at the top of a list of foreign embassies and missions which have been refusing to pay the daily £ 8 charge .
More than £ 10 m in outstanding penalty charge notices ( PCNs ) is owed by 20 embassies , according to figures released by Transport for London ( TfL ) under the Freedom of Information Act .
The US embassy has been on a collision course with the mayor since July 2005 when , following state department orders , it declared the congestion charge an illegal tax under the Vienna convention and instructed diplomatic , administrative and technical staff to stop paying it .
That led Livingstone to label the US ambassador , Robert Tuttle , a " chiselling little crook " in a TV interview in 2006 .
Although the mayor threatened to retaliate by clamping and removing cars belonging to diplomats , a crackdown has yet to happen .
A US embassy spokesman said it was wrong to consider the issue a personal row between Livingstone and Tuttle .
" It is unfortunate that the mayor is taking a policy instruction from the department of state and inappropriately personalising it . "
Livingstone , whose comments saw him reported to a standards watchdog , was silent on the matter yesterday .
But a spokesman for the mayor said : " The UK government has ruled that the congestion charge is a charge for a service - namely reduced congestion and traffic - and not a tax .
This means that diplomats are not exempt from payment .
" The worst culprit by far is the American embassy , which has taken a deliberate decision to ignore UK law and refuse to pay the charge .
As a result they now owe over £ 2 m , which would have been invested in improving the transport network . "
He added that if the US expected diplomats in Washington to respect US law , the UK had the right to expect American diplomats in London to observe British law .
The biggest debtor after the US is the Japanese embassy , which owes more than £ 1 m , followed by Nigeria 's high commission ( £ 982,350 ) and the embassies of Russia ( £ 912,360 ) and Germany ( £ 828,170 ) .
A spokesman for the Japanese embassy said its government had carefully studied the legal nature of the charge before ceasing payment on August 1 2006 .
" As a result , the government of Japan reached an understanding that the charge corresponds to neither ' dues and taxes ... such as represent payment for specific services rendered ' nor ' charges levied for specific services rendered ' , as stipulated in the relevant international conventions , " he said .
" Therefore the embassy , its diplomatic agents and their family members should be exempt from the charge . "
Germany began following a similar line last year , and other European embassies have met to discuss the congestion charge but have been unable to agree a common EU stance .
Other EU states to feature in the top 20 embassies with outstanding PCNs are France ( £ 263,200 ) , Poland ( £ 249,000 ) , Romania ( £ 203,740 ) , Spain ( £ 184,580 ) and Greece ( £ 181,200 ) .
The mayor 's position is supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , which points out that UK diplomats in Norway and Singapore are not exempt from congestion charges there .
Other figures released by TfL show that the embassy of Saudi Arabia is the worst diplomatic offender when it comes to flouting parking laws .
It owes £ 6,950 , followed by Nigeria ( £ 3,850 ) , Guinea ( £ 2,950 ) , the United Arab Emirates ( £ 2,700 ) , Egypt ( £ 2,300 ) , Qatar ( £ 2,250 ) , and Brunei ( £ 2,000 ) .
The Two - Envelope Paradox : A Complete Analysis ?
The Two - Envelope Paradox : A Complete Analysis ?
chalmers@arizona.edu
[ [ Doug Hofstadter introduced me to the two - envelope paradox in 1988 .
This paper corresponds to more or less the position I came up with then .
I wrote this up in 1994 after a couple of papers on the subject appeared in Analysis .
I never published it , partly because it came to seem to me that this treatment resolves only part of the paradox : it resolves the " numerical " paradox but not the " decision - theoretic " paradox .
For a more recent treatment of the decision - theoretic paradox , see The St. Petersburg Two - Envelope Paradox . ] ]
A wealthy eccentric places two envelopes in front of you .
She tells you that both envelopes contain money , and that one contains twice as much as the other , but she does not tell you which is which .
You are allowed to choose one envelope , and to keep all the money you find inside .
This may seem innocuous , but it generates an apparent paradox .
Say that you choose envelope 1 , and it contains $ 100 .
In evaluating your decision , you reason that there is a 50 % chance that envelope 2 contains $ 200 , and a 50 % chance that it contains $ 50 .
In retrospect , you reason , you should have taken envelope 2 , as its expected value is $ 125 .
If your sponsor offered you the chance to change your decision now , it seems that you should do so .
Now , this reasoning is independent of the actual amount in envelope 1 , and in fact can be carried out in advance of opening the envelope ; it follows that whatever envelope 1 contains , it would be better to choose envelope 2 .
But the situation with respect to the two envelopes is symmetrical , so the same reasoning tells you that whatever envelope 2 contains , you would do better to choose envelope 1 .
This seems contradictory .
What has gone wrong ?
The paradox can be expressed numerically .
Let A and B be the amounts in envelope 1 and 2 respectively ; their expected values are E( A ) and E ( B ) .
For all n , it seems that p( B > A|A=n ) = 0.5 , so that E( B|A=n ) = 1.25n .
It follows that E ( B ) =1.25 E ( A ) , and therefore that E( B ) > E( A ) if either expected value is greater than zero .
The same reasoning shows that E( A ) > E( B ) , but the conjunction is impossible , and in any case E( A ) = E( B ) by symmetry .
Again , what has gone wrong ?
This problem has been discussed in the pages of Analysis by Jackson , Menzies and Oppy [ 2 ] , and by Castell and Batens [ 1 ] , but for reasons that will become clear I think that their analyses are incomplete and mistaken respectively , although both contain insights that are important to the resolution of the problem .
I will therefore present my own analysis of the " paradox " below .
Some distractions inessential to the problem arise from the facts that in the real world , money comes in discrete amounts ( dollars and cents , pounds and pence ) and that there are known limits on the world 's money supply .
We can remove these distractions by stipulating that for the purposes of the problem , the amounts in the envelopes can be any positive real number .
There are a number of steps in the resolution of the paradox .
The first step is to note ( as do the authors mentioned above ) that the amounts in the envelopes do not fall out of the sky , but must be drawn from some probability distribution .
Let the relevant probability density function be g , where the probability that the smaller amount falls between a and b is integral [ a , b ] g(x ) dx .
We can think of this distribution as either representing the chooser 's prior expectations , or as the distribution from which the actual values are drawn .
I will generally write as if it is the second , but nothing much rests on this .
To fix ideas , we can imagine that our sponsor chooses a random variable Z with probability density g , and then flips a coin .
If the coin comes up heads , she sets A=Z and B=2Z ; if it comes up tails , she sets A=2Z and B=Z .
Recognizing the existence of a distribution immediately shows us that the reasoning that leads to the paradox is not always valid , as Jackson et al note .
For example , if the distribution is a uniform distribution over values between 0 and 1000 , with amounts over 1000 being impossible , then if A > 500 , it is always a bad idea to switch .
It is therefore not true that for all distributions and all values of n , p( B > A|A=n ) = 0.5 .
In general , E( B|A=n ) will not depend only on n ; it will also depend on the underlying distribution .
In their analysis , Jackson et al are satisfied with this observation , combined with the observation that limitations on the worlds ' money supply ensure that in practice the relevant distributions will always be bounded above and below .
The paradox does not arise for bounded distributions , as we saw above .
When A is a medium value , there may be equal chances that B is larger or smaller , but when A is large B is likely to be smaller , and when A is small B is likely to be larger , so the paradox does not get off the ground .
This practical observation is an insufficient response to the mathematical paradox , however , as Castell and Batens note .
Unbounded distributions can exist in principle if not in practice , and in - principle existence is all that is needed for the paradox to have its bite .
For example , it might seem that if the distribution were a uniform distribution over the real numbers , then p( B > A|A=n ) = 0.5 for all n .
This would seem to have paradoxical consequences for mathematics , if not for the world 's money supply .
This leads to the second step in the resolution of the paradox , which is that taken by Castell and Batens .
( We will see that this step is ultimately inessential to the paradox 's resolution , but it is an important intermediate point of enlightenment . )
There is in fact no such thing as a uniform probability distribution over the real numbers .
To see this , let g be a uniform function over the real numbers .
Then integral [ k , k+1 ] g( x ) dx is equal to some constant c for all k .
If c=0 , then the area under the entire curve will be zero , and if c> 0 , then the area under the entire curve will be infinite , both of which contradict the requirement that the integral of a probability distribution be 1 .
At one point Jackson et al raise the possibility of infinitesimal probabilities , but if this is interpreted as allowing c to be infinitesimal , the suggestion does not work any better .
To see this , note that if the distribution is uniform :
integral [ 0 , infinity ] g(x ) dx
= integral [ 0,1 ] g( x ) dx + integral [ 1,2 ] g( x ) dx + integral [ 2,3 ] g( x ) dx + ...
= integral [ 0,1 ] g( x ) dx + integral [ 2,3 ] g( x ) dx + integral [ 4,5 ] g( x )dx
= ( integral [ 0 , infinity ] g( x ) dx ) /
2
so that the overall integral must be zero or infinite .
A uniform distribution over the real numbers can only be an " improper " distribution , whose overall integral is not 1 .
The impossibility of a uniform probability distribution over the real numbers is reflected in the fact that every proper distribution must eventually " taper off " : for all epsilon > 0 , there must exist k such that integral[ k , infinity ] g( x ) dx < epsilon .
It is very tempting to suppose that this " tapering off " supplies the resolution to the paradox , as it seems to imply that if A is near the high end of the ( proper ) distribution , it will be more likely that B is smaller ; perhaps sufficiently more likely to offset the paradoxical reasoning ?
This is the conclusion that Castell and Batens draw .
They offer a " proof " that the distribution must be improper for the paradoxical reasoning to be possible .
Unfortunately Castell and Batens ' proof is mistaken , and in fact there exist proper distributions for which the paradoxical reasoning is possible .
The error lies in their assumption , early in the paper , that p( B > A|A=n ) = g(n ) / ( g( n ) + g( n / 2 ) ) .
This seems intuitively reasonable , but in fact p( B > A|A=n ) = 2g (n ) /( 2g( n ) + g( n /2 ) ) , which is significantly larger in general .
To see this , note that if A is in the range n +/- dx , then B is either in the range 2n +/- 2dx or in the range n/2 +/- dx/2 .
The probability of the first , relative to the initial distribution , is g( n ) dx ; the probability of the second is g( n / 2 ) dx / 2 .
The probabilities that B is greater or less than A therefore stand in the ratio 2 g ( n ) : g( n / 2 ) , not g( n ) : g ( n / 2 ) , as Castell and Batens suppose .
For example , given a uniform distribution between 0 and 1000 , if A is around 100 , it is in fact twice as likely that B is around 200 than that B is around 50 .
To dispel any lingering counterintuitiveness , note that something like this has to be the case to make up for the fact that when A > 500 , B is always less than A .
To find a distribution where the chances of a gain and a loss are truly equal for many n , we should turn not to a uniform distribution but to a decreasing distribution , where g( n / 2 ) = 2g ( n ) for many n .
An example is the distribution g( x ) = 1/x , where we cut off the distribution between arbitrary bounds L and U , and normalize so that it has an integral of 1 .
This distribution will have the property that for all n such that 2L < n < U/2 , p( B> A|A=n ) = 0.5 .
To illustrate this intuitively , note that for such a decreasing distribution , the prior probability that the smaller value is between 4 and 8 is the same as the probability that it is between 8 and 16 , and so on , if L and U are appropriate .
Given the information that 8 < A < 16 , it is equally likely that B is in the range above or below .
This flaw in Castell and Batens ' reasoning nullifies their proof that a distribution must be improper for the paradoxical reasoning to arise , but it does not yet show that the conclusion is false .
It remains open whether there is a proper distribution for which the paradoxical reasoning is possible .
The bounded distribution above will not work , as its bound will block the paradoxical reasoning in the usual fashion ; and the unbounded distribution g( x ) = 1/x is improper , having an infinite integral .
But this can easily be fixed , by allowing the distribution to taper off slightly faster .
In particular , the distribution g( x ) = x ^( - 1.5 ) , cut off below a lower bound L and normalized , allows the paradox to arise .
The distribution has a finite integral , and even though for most n , p( B > A|A=n ) < 0.5 , it is still the case that for all relevant n , E ( B|A=n ) > n .
To see this , note that if n < 2L , then E( B|A=n ) = 2n ; and if n >= 2L , then
p( B> A|A=n ) : p( B < A|A=n )
= 2g ( n ) : g( n/2 )
= 2n ^( - 1.5 ) :( n/2 ) ^( - 1.5 )
= 1:sqrt ( 2 ) .
The expected value E( B|A=n ) is ( 2n+sqrt ( 2 ) n /2 ) / ( 1+sqrt ( 2 ) ) , which is about 1.12n .
The paradox therefore still arises .
The distribution here may be unintuitive , but it is easy to illustrate a similar distribution intuitively .
Take a distribution in which the probability of a value between 1 and 2 is c , the probability of a value between 2 and 4 is just slightly less , say 0.9 c , the probability of a value between 4 and 8 is 0.81 c , and so on .
This distribution has a finite integral , as the integral is the sum of a decreasing geometric series ; and it is sufficiently close to the case in which the probability of a value between 2^k and 2 ^ ( k+1 ) is constant that the paradoxical reasoning still arises .
Even though p( B < A|A=n ) is now slightly less than 0.5 , due to the incorporated factor of 0.9 , it has decreased by a sufficiently small amount that E( B|A=n ) remains greater than n .
The case g( x ) = x ^( - 1.5 ) is just like this , except that the factor of 0.9 is replaced by a factor of 1 / sqrt ( 2 ) , which is around 0.7 .
The paradox has therefore not yet been vanquished ; there are perfectly proper distributions for which the paradoxical reasoning still applies .
This leads us to the third and final step in the resolution of the paradox .
Note that although the distributions above have finite integrals , as a probability distribution should , they have infinite expected value .
The expected value of a distribution is integral [ 0 , infinity ] xg( x ) dx .
When g( x ) = x ^( - 1.5 ) ( cut off below L ) , the expected value is integral [ L , infinity ] x ^( - 0.5 ) dx , which is infinite .
But if the expected value of the distribution is infinite , there is no paradox !
There is no contradiction between the facts that E( B ) = 1.12 E( A ) and E( A ) = 1.12 E( B ) if both E( A ) and E ( B ) are infinite .
Rather , we have just another example of a familiar phenomenon , the strange behavior of infinity . [*]
* [ [ [ Castell and Batens note some similar consequences of infinite expected values in another context , in which the distribution is over a countable set .
They say that infinite expected values are " absurd " , but I do not see any mathematical absurdity . ] ] ]
To fully resolve the paradox , we need only demonstrate that for distributions with finite expected value , the paradoxical situation does not arise .
To do this , we need to precisely state the conditions expressing the paradoxical situation .
In its strongest form , the paradoxical situation arises when E( B|A=n ) > n for all n .
However , it arises more generally whenever reasoning from B's dependence on A leads us to the conclusion that there is expected gain on average ( rather than all the time ) by switching A for B .
This will hold whenever E ( K - A ) > 0 , where K is the random variable derived from A by the transformation x -> E( B|A=x ) .
We therefore need to show that when E( A ) is finite , E ( K - A ) = 0 .
Let h be the density function of A . Then h( x ) = ( g( x ) + g( x / 2 ) /2)/2 = ( 2g ( x ) + g( x / 2 ) ) / 4 .
( Note that h != g , as g is the density function of the smaller value . )
Then
E ( K - A ) = integral [ 0 , infinity ] h( x ) ( E( B|A=x ) - x ) dx
= integral [ 0 , infinity ] ( 2g ( x ) + g( x / 2 ) ) / 4 . ( ( 2x.2g ( x ) + x /2.g( x/2 ) ) / ( 2g( x ) + g( x / 2 ) ) - x ) dx
= integral [ 0 , infinity ] ( 2xg ( x ) - x/2 . g( x /2 ) ) /4 dx
= ( integral [ 0 , infinity ] 2xg ( x ) dx - integral [ 0 , infinity ] 2yg(y ) dy ) /
4
= 0 .
Note that the fourth and fifth steps above are valid only if integral [ 0 , infinity ] xg( x ) dx is finite , which holds iff E( A ) is finite .
( If integral [ 0 , infinity ] xg( x ) dx is infinite , it is possible that integral [ 0 , infinity ] 2xg ( x ) - x/ 2.g( x / 2 ) dx != 0 , even though integral [ 0 , infinity ] 2xg ( x ) dx = integral [ 0 , infinity ] x/2.g( x / 2 ) dx . )
It follows that when E( A ) is finite , consideration of the dependence of B on A will not lead one to the conclusion that one should switch A for B . A colollary of the result is that when E( A ) is finite , it is impossible that E( B|A=n ) > n for all n , so that the strong form of the paradox certainly cannot arise .
If E( A ) is infinite , this result does not hold .
In such a case , it is possible that E( A ) = E ( K ) ( both are infinite ) but that E ( K - A ) >
0 . Here , the " paradoxical " reasoning will indeed arise .
But now the result is no longer paradoxical ; it is merely counterintuitive .
It is a consequence of the fact that given infinite expectations , any given finite value will be disappointing .
The situation here is somewhat reminiscent of the classical St. Petersburg paradox : both " paradoxes " exploit random variables whose values are always finite , but whose expected values are infinite .
The combination of finite values with infinite expected values leads to counterintuitive consequences , but we cannot expect intuitive results where infinity is concerned . [*]

Lots of laughter too , thanks to the sexual jokes of late night talk show hosts and the millions of lewd and rude comments on Internet forums .
Lots of hand wringing and head - shaking too , especially from the so - called progressive new sites , like the New York Times and the Huffington Post , bemoaning the fate of the so - called liberal reformer .
At Huffington Post , Alec Baldwin penned a lament called : Reflections
On A Fallen Hero , while columnist Nora Ephron wailed , predictably : " So goodbye .
I feel sad .
I liked him .
It 's tragic . "
Tragic ?
Certainly , but not in the way these highly paid pundits think .
Funny how so many of these otherwise intelligent people , many of them NEW YORKERS , hardly realize that their former attorney general , Eliot Spitzer , ignored and , indeed , possibly conspired in the 911 mass murder that took the lives of nearly 3,000 New Yorkers .
Truly New Yorkers must either be some of the dumbest people in the world or those most in denial .
According to Jon Gold : " In November of 2004 , an independent inquiry into the events of 9/11 entitled ' Citizens ' Complaint & Petition ' was submitted to Eliot Spitzer 's office .
This document contained great detail about the glaring questions still unanswered and listed damages suffered by so many people .
There were 100 signatures from prominent Americans such as Howard Zinn , Daniel Ellsberg , Ralph Nader , John Gray , Ray McGovern , Medea Benjamin , and Ed Asner .
The Complaint also had 48 victims ' families as signatories .
Spitzer 's top prosecutor , William Casey , personally received the document .
However , this has been met with a deafening silence .
No action was ever taken . "
What - or who -- was this so - called reformer trying so desperately to hide ?
Whose involvement in the crime and why ?
According to journalist and publisher Sander Hicks , the former governor was no white knight , no reformer , no caped crusader , but rather a deep dark shadowy figure on a sinister steed .
Exactly the sort of the duplicitous , cowardly , hypocritical poseur he eventually was revealed to be .
If it took a hooker to take him down , so be it and thank God .
One down , and another hundred shadowy characters to go .
Do a simple Google search of Who Did It ?--
Conspirators and scroll down the list of benefactors , while asking yourself why did n't Spitzer do his damn job ?
Hicks reported : " In 2004 , Eliot Spitzer was asked to investigate 9/11 by 66 % of New Yorkers .
Those pleas were ignored . "
Added Hicks , in an earlier feature for the New York - based Megaphone : " His own attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , ( then ) investigating the governor 's office 's misuse of state troopers to monitor political rival Joe Bruno .
To minority leader James Tedisco , Spitzer recently snapped , ' I 'm a fucking steamroller , and I 'll roll over you . ' " Steamroller ?
Of course the current karmic steamrolling of Spitzer wo n't bring back a single dead New York firefighter or the fading health of a single first responder .
Added Hicks , of the shady deals behind the 911 tragedy : " Silverstein put up only $ 14 million of his own money , ( to acquire the WTC complex ) and his friends at the powerful investment bank Blackstone Group kicked in another $ 111 million .
After 9/11 , Silverstein demanded a whopping $ 7 billion insurance payout , in the form of two $ 3.5 billion payment .
Spitzer got involved behind the scenes , filing a " friend of the court " brief on Silverstein 's behalf .
The court ended up agreeing with Spitzer and Silverstein , over - turning the decision of a lower court .
Spitzer helped midwife a fat compromise and an eventual $ 4.5 billion payout for Silverstein . "
Funny , in every major crime , EXCEPT 911 , investigators are always instructed to follow the money and conclude just who exactly benefits .
World Trade Center Building 7 , ostensibly a US government building , victim of several suspicious fires ( Arson ? ) and soon evacuated on 911 , collapsed at 5:20 PM without being hit by an airplane .
According to Hicks , 37 eyewitnesses working on the ground as firefighters , first responders and reporters recalled being warned in advance that WTC - 7 was coming down .
The official story determined a fire ignited a fuel tank in the building , resulting in a sudden collapse at the free fall speed of gravity .
" WTC 7 was the NY headquarters of CIA and the SEC office investigating Enron , " said Hicks .
So why did n't the New York state attorney general , Eliot Spitzer , demand a full investigation ?
Why , conversely , did Spitzer literally serve as a whore for private citizen Silverstein in secret , rather than serve his public duty as top cop ?
Petitioners demanded he do his sworn duty .
Instead the so - called reformer looked the other way , retired to the Mayflower hotel to be serviced by a gilded hooker , and shafted American citizens .
In truth , Spitzer is only one of more than a hundred powerful and well - connected " persons of interest " involved in some way with the 911 crime and subsequent cover up .
A person of interest is someone detectives interview to get the bigger picture and hopefully apprehend the true criminals .
Not surprisingly , for lack of evidence , the FBI no longer considers Osama bin Laden the mastermind behind 911 .
Spitzer , had he done his duty at any time in his career , might have helped solve a perplexing crime rather than muddy the waters , Some will claim that was Spitzer 's sole purpose .
Many top New York officials , former and current , also share Spitzer 's murky connection to the 911 crime and the aftermath .
Wrote John Albenese : " Bernard Kerick was having affairs in a hotel room overlooking ground zero !
How romantic !
Where was his summer home , overlooking Auschwitz ? "
Meanwhile millions of gossip - starved Americans hotly debate the predicament of Spitzer 's former call girl , ' Kristen . '
I 'd predict a quarter million dollar spread in some men's magazine and a million dollar book deal .
Crime does pay , extremely well , a lesson learned well on 911 .

MAKE senior editor Phillip Torrone reviewed NOVA 's Judgment Day : Intelligent Design on Trial .
When the advocates of Intelligent Design during the trial said that the book " Of Pandas and People " had nothing to do with creationism , they lied ; it turned out the original drafts were all about Creationism .
After the drafts were subpoenaed ( thousand of pages ) it was discovered that a simple search and replace was used to change the text from creationism wording to something , well , less creationism sounding .
It was changed because the Supreme Court in 1987 ruled it was unconstitutional to teach creationism in public schools .
When I say " search and replace " I really mean they found examples of where the words did n't exactly get changed enough .
You can see it here …
Wherever the word " creationists " appeared it was replaced with " cdesign proponentsists " – that 's merely creationists without the " reation " and with " design " and " proponents " replaced in .

The Australian Olympic Committee ( AOC ) says its athletes will not be stopped from speaking about human rights issues at this year 's Beijing Games .
Some athletes have expressed concern about being asked to sign an agreement which asks in part that they only comment to the media about their own events , prospects and performances .
It comes as the monk - led uprising in Tibet focuses attention on China 's record ahead of the Games in August .
Committee media director Mike Tancred says the intention is to stop Australian competitors from criticising their team - mates or opponents .
He says the clause is not designed to prevent athletes from commenting on the situation in Tibet and other political matters .
" Our athletes in Beijing will be entitled to speak on any issue , including human rights , " he said .
" They will not be gagged .
" The only way that an athlete on our team would be sent home from Beijing is if they were to commit a serious doping offence , or a criminal offence . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Scientists in the United States are developing a screening test for breast cancer that checks a woman ’s saliva for evidence of the disease to help find tumors early , when they are most treatable .

Scientists in the United States are developing a screening test for breast cancer that checks a woman 's saliva for evidence of the disease to help find tumors early , when they are most treatable .
REUTERS / National Cancer Institute / Handout
In research published on Thursday , the scientists said they identified 49 proteins in saliva that the screening test would track to distinguish healthy women from those with benign breast tumors and those with malignant breast tumors .
Breast cancer triggers a change in the type and amount of proteins in secretions from the salivary glands , said Charles Streckfus , a professor of diagnostic sciences at the University of Texas Dental Branch at Houston .
The proteins are produced by tumor cells and affect cell growth , cell metabolism and cell self - destruction -- all of which go awry in cancer , Streckfus said .
Streckfus and colleagues tested saliva from 30 women -- 10 healthy women , 10 with malignant breast cancer and 10 with benign breast tumors .
The pattern of proteins is different in each of the three groups , the researchers reported in the journal Cancer Investigation .
More work needs to be done before a screening test based on these proteins can be made available to the public , Streckfus said .
But U.S. government approval for the test may be sought within five years , he added .
FOCUS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Mammography and breast self - examination for tumors are leading methods used for early detection of breast cancer .
But Streckfus said mammograms -- X -rays of the breasts -- are too expensive in many developing countries and a cheap , easy - to - perform screening test would be valuable .
“ On a global perspective , mammography is not very common , ” Streckfus said in a telephone interview .
“ Even in our neighbor Mexico , there are very few mammography centers around . ”
Streckfus said he envisioned a saliva test as a quick , inexpensive and simple screening method .
In developed countries like the United States , such a test could complement existing screening methods , he added .
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide , according to the American Cancer Society .
The organization estimated that about 465,000 women died from it globally in 2007 , with 1.3 million new cases diagnosed .
Declining death rates from breast cancer in developed countries have been attributed to early detection through mammography screening and to improved treatment , the organization said .
The American Cancer Society recommends women age 40 and older get a mammogram every year .
Streckfus said the new test could be done more frequently to find tumors that might arise between mammograms .
Other researchers last week said they were developing a saliva test to screen for head and neck cancers .
Their test also was years away from being available to the public .
My plan for de-baptism started to formulate when travelling on the Trans - Siberian Railway .
While reading Richard Dawkins ' atheist polemic
The God Delusion , I had a friendly argument with a Russian babushka about our differing beliefs in an Almighty ( not an easy task , given the state of my Russian ) .
When I got home , my parents told me how difficult it was to get me baptised in the first place .
The rector even came round for tea , presumably to see if I was the sort of baby acceptable to the Church of England .
It seemed to me that my divorce from the church would hinge on getting my name taken off the baptism register .
I am an atheist , but for me there was also a political dimension : why should my name be placed on the church 's record and be used as a statistic to claim political and social influence ?
I joined the National Secular Society and was pleased to hear that de-baptism had been successfully attempted in this country , albeit in Roman Catholicism .
What happens is that the NSS sends you a form to sign and have witnessed .
I was informed by a spokesman that de-baptism " was a bit of a joke " but this made me more determined to do it for real .
I therefore wrote to the rector of St Mary Newington , south London , where my baptism took place 22 years ago , outlining my intentions .
After three weeks without a reply , I decided to give him a call .
He did n't sound too pleased , informing me that I was on his " to - do list " .
A few days later a letter arrived informing me that the procedure was impossible as " the register of baptisms is a public legal record which may not be altered or deletions made " .
Further messages and emails went unanswered so I decided to go over his head and put in a call to the Church of England .
My proposal was met with much laughter before I was asked if I was " gay or straight " , presumably as this variable would explain why I was planning to " divorce " religion .
After being passed between various departments , I was finally told that baptism was " once and for all time and could not be redone or undone " .
Could the refusal to remove my name from church records be against the Data Protection Act ?
What about the European court of human rights ?
Clearly , splitting from a whole religion was never going to be easy , but I 'm still considering my options .

The occasion is the Polish edition of a new book by the Princeton historian of Polish origin Jan Tomasz Gross .
The book with the punchy title " Fear .
Anti-Semitism in Poland after Auschwitz " ( New York 2006 ) revolves around a central question : " How was Polish anti-Semitism possible after Auschwitz ? "
According to the reports by Holocaust survivors cited by the author , rather than being welcomed with open arms , Polish Holocaust survivors were met in their hometowns by the cynical question " Are you still alive ? ! "
The Holocaust victims were confronted with more or less open hostility on the part of the Polish population , which ultimately ended in pogroms .
Gross ' book examines three of these in detail , in Rzeszow ( 1945 ) , Krakow ( 1945 ) and the most notorious pogrom in Kielce ( 1946 ) in which 37 Jews were murdered .
For Gross , neither the allegedly widespread participation of Polish Jews in the slowly consolidating Communist regime nor the horror stories circulating about the ritual murder of Christian children were the real reasons for these occurrences .
Ultimately , economic interests were behind the events .
Many Poles had taken possession of Jewish property after the German occupiers fled , and the Holocaust survivors ' return was perceived as a real threat .
Regardless of the pretexts for the pogroms , Gross writes , their real purpose was to get rid of the inconvenient victims .
Although many Poles had heroically come to the aid of their fellow Jewish citizens by providing them with shelter at their own peril , most had looked on with indifference – sometimes even approval – at the crimes committed by the German occupiers on the Jews .
Pangs of conscience can be very effective , destructive even , especially when they veil a clear interest .
Gross is particularly critical of the Polish Catholic Church , maintaining that with the exception of the Bishop of Czestochowa , clerics not only did nothing to protect Jewish survivors from assaults after the war , but even sought explicitly to justify these attacks to a greater or lesser extent .
Nevertheless , one must add , Gross ' controversial book was printed in Poland by a respectable Catholic publisher .
This is not the first time that a book by Gross has created a stir in Poland .
The publication in 2001 of his " Neighbors " had already kindled an emotional debate about the Polish population 's involvement in the Holocaust .
That book dealt with the murder of the Jewish residents of Jedwabne ( a small town in Eastern Poland ) in 1941 .
For decades under the Communist regime this crime was attributed to the German troops .
It was only with Gross ' assertion that Polish neighbours had carried out the crime that an investigation initiated by the Polish Institute for National Remembrance ( IPN ) confirmed direct Polish participation ( leaving the role of the German occupiers open ) .
Even before the report was published , Alexander Kwasniewski , then Polish president , officially apologised for the Jedwabne murders " in the name of those Poles whose consciences are troubled by this crime . "
Many people never forgave Kwasniewski for this apology .
Most Yad Vashem trees ( dedicated to the " Righteous Among the Nations " who risked their lives to save threatened Jews during WWII ) bear Polish names .
Poland was the sole occupied country where helping Jewish citizens was punishable by death .
Under the occupation , the Polish underground Armia Krajowa initiated a structure unique in Europe ( called Zegota ) which offered aid – including military support – to the Jews .
Since the Poles staunchly resisted the Nazi aggression and were themselves victims of Hitler 's policy of genocide , many saw – and continue to see – themselves exclusively in the role of war victims .
For that reason they consider any allegation that casts
Poles in the role of perpetrators a brazen effrontery , if not a direct attack on the Polish people .
Accordingly , even events that took place after World War II , in particular the pogrom in Kielce , are seen by many historians as a provocation by the ( Polish or even Soviet ) secret service , which sought to damage Poland 's image in Western Europe and secure its adhesion to the Russian sphere of influence .
It 's no wonder , then , that Jan Tomasz Gross is such a controversial figure in Polish public life , although he has never questioned the merits of the Poles , nor their bravery in the fight against fascism .
Hence it was predictable that his new book would set off a new wave of outrage even before it came out in Polish .
Already after the original version was published in the US , some Polish senators alerted the Polish public prosecutor 's office that the book could insult the Polish people and incite hatred , charges which the office is currently reviewing .
The radical Catholic League of Polish Families has officially demanded that the Polish Foreign Ministry deny Gross entry into Poland .
Many commentators believe Gross ' book reveals no previously unknown facts , brings nothing new into the debate and is more an essay " with a presupposed thesis " than a genuine historical study .
Janusz Kurtyka , director of the Institute of National Remembrance , has accused Gross of historical incompetence and highly one - sided use of his sources .
But critical voices are also being heard among moderates , for example Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz , the secretary to Pope John Paul II , as well as the legendary Solidarnosc leader Lech Walesa , who maintained Gross ' book would awaken dangerous demons and divide where it should reconcile .
The Polish–Jewish dialogue must be carried out with a view to the future , not the past , Walesa argued .
Very few people have come to the defence of this author , who has taken on the difficult task of making uncomfortable facts known to a wider audience and removing blind spots in Polish history .
His supporters include Konstanty Gebert , chief editor of Midrasz a Jewish - interest magazine .
However the widespread Polish indignation is also explained by the fact that many feel the book paints an outdated portrait of Poland .
Many believe the old mantra of Polish anti-Semitism no longer rings true , because much has changed since the 1990s .
The policy of reconciliation and dialogue between Poles and Jews begun by President Walesa and carried through by his successor Kwasniewski – as well as current President Lech Kaczynski – has been highly successful .
Jewish life in Poland has reawakened , and interest in Jewish culture , history and religion has grown enormously , especially among young Poles .
Many Jewish festivals have been established and exhibitions and theatre performances focussing on Jewish issues are on the rise .
Just a few weeks ago , the postal workers ' union spontaneously and successfully refused to distribute anti-Semitic brochures put out by an extreme right - wing politician .
Jan Tomasz Gross by no means denies these tremendous changes in Polish society .
He simply believes that uncomfortable topics of the past must be discussed openly .
Controversy over a book is always welcomed by its author , people say .
The only thing Gross would find scandalous would be if this debate had to be continued in the courtroom .
You only need to look at the development of the democratic public sphere in Poland since the 1990s , however , to see that this debate , emotional as it is , is far more likely to be carried out in a more appropriate forum .
And in all probability it will lead Poles to regard their history with more critical distance .
Regardless of people 's fears , it is unlikely that the book and the discussion around it could harm Jewish–Polish dialogue .

DALLAS - Texas , where strip clubs have given rise to Anna Nicole Smith and many other less - generously endowed performers , is about to make it more expensive to watch a little bump and grind .
In what some have dubbed the " pole tax , " the Lone Star State will require its 150 or so strip clubs to collect a $ 5 - per- customer levy , with most of the proceeds going to help rape victims .
The tax goes into effect on New Year 's Day .
Club owners and some of their customers say the money is going to a noble cause , but they argue that the tax infringes on their First Amendment right to freedom of expression , that it will drive some bars out of business and that it unfairly links their industry to sex crimes .
" We 'll be fine .
I 've already stopped advertising , and we 're raising our cover charges .
But this is going to kill some of the smaller clubs , " said Dawn Rizos , who runs The Lodge , a Hemingway - inspired place that has exotic animal heads on the walls and is packed after Dallas Cowboys games at nearby Texas Stadium .
The strip clubs are suing to block the tax , which state officials estimate will raise more than $ 40 million a year , based on liquor sales figures .
If accurate , the estimate suggests at least 8 million people a year go to Texas strip clubs to get a lap dance or watch women pole - dance in a G - string .
Supporters of the stripper tax say they are not out to close the clubs — that would just mean less money for victims of sexual assault .
" This is an industry that largely employs women , and this gives them an opportunity to raise funds for a crime that affects women , " said state Rep.
Ellen Cohen , a Houston Democrat who sponsored the bill , approved by the Legislature in May .
" I 've been told the fees to get into these places can be $ 10 , $ 15 .
I do n't think another $ 5 is going to prevent someone from going , " said Cohen , who is also president of a women 's center that could get funding from the new law .
Most places will probably raise drink prices and cover charges , or start charging a cover if they do n't do so already .
Strip clubs occupy a mythic place in Texas lore as a spot where young women can work their way through college and small - town girls with dreams of Hollywood stardom get their start on the lowest rung of show biz .
Texas ' topless spots range from dimly lit dives with pickup trucks lined up outside to gentlemen's clubs that resemble plush hunting lodges and attract men in business suits .
The pole tax is unlikely to have much effect on your finer establishments .
On a recent weekday at The Lodge , the cars in the valet parking lot included BMWs , a Ferrari and several Mercedes .
At a table in a back corner sat Jerry Trigg , an architect who said he goes alone or takes customers to clubs in Dallas and Houston about three times a week .
Trigg said he typically spends about $ 50 during each solo visit and $ 200 or more when entertaining clients .
He said a $ 5 tax wo n't affect the number of Diet Cokes he consumes , tips he doles out or lap dances enjoyed .
But Elle , a 28 - year - old former Dallas dancer , said she worries the tax will hurt women like herself who work their way through college by stripping .
She earned a degree from the University of Texas at Arlington and said she now runs a computer - servicing business with her husband .
Elle said she averaged $ 200 a day at the Lodge — " on good days , a hell of a lot more . "
The owners of Players , a small topless bar in Amarillo , are among those suing the state .
They said that adding a $ 5 tax to the $ 4 cover could drive away customers and force the club out of business .
" They wo n't pay it , " said Chandra Brown , president of the company that owns Players .
" They wo n't come in .
They can't afford it . "
Some customers and clubs say it is not the extra five bucks ; they resent the implication that strip clubs lead men to commit sex crimes .
Rizos said The Lodge already pays the state $ 1.3 million a year in taxes , and the topless tax will be an additional $ 60,000 per month .
" Run the right way , these businesses can really be a benefit for the community , " Rizos said .
" We 're a huge convention draw for the city .
We raise money for charity with our car washes . "
Utah enacted a 10 percent tax on topless clubs in 2004 .
That same year , the Texas Legislature considered a $ 5 - per - head fee , with the money going toward schools .
But lawmakers did n't like the link between strip clubs and kids — the idea was mocked as " Tassels for Tots " — and the proposal died .
The idea was resurrected last summer by the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault as a way to open more rape - crisis centers .
In their lawsuit , the clubs said nude dancing is protected by the First Amendment and the state can't selectively tax it , even if it is conduct some may find offensive .
Besides , they argued , the tax is so broad it could apply to concerts by performers like Madonna or Britney Spears who wear low - cut tops .
Jonathan Turley , a constitutional law expert at George Washington University , said the Texas tax goes too far .
" It seems clear legislators are targeting strip clubs because they 're unpopular , " Turley said .
" Laws like this would expose any unpopular industry to punitive taxes .
It could be abortion clinics . "
Under a scorching summer sun , a swarm of 400 furious women engulfed the scruffy electricity office of Banda district in north India .
They were all dressed identically in fluorescent pink saris .
For more than a fortnight they and their families had had no electricity , plunged into darkness at dusk and stewed in sweat at dawn .
But they had all been sent bills demanding payment for power they had never received .
It was at noon one day last May that the group , brandishing sticks , first surrounded and then charged into the office , punching the air and shouting slogans of solidarity .
They wanted to confront the officer in charge but met instead his cowering juniors , at whom they bawled to telephone the boss .
When the man refused to come to the office , the women became incensed .
They snatched the office key , roughed up the terrified staff and , after herding them outside , locked the door and ran away , vowing to return the key only when they had electricity again .
There are few places on earth where life is as short and brutal as in Bundelkhand , the desolate region straddling the southern tip of Uttar Pradesh where Banda lies .
Farming is the principal livelihood ; wages are as little as 60 p a day for men and half that for women .
Bonded and child labour are rife .
Corruption is routine .
Its reputation in India is that of a place where people still die of hunger .
But what has made Bundelkhand infamous is banditry .
Scores born out of feudalism and caste violence are settled by bullets .
It was here that Phoolan Devi , the Bandit Queen of India , used to lead her gang of robbers in vicious acts of retribution on rich , upper - caste villagers .
Products of this cruel environment , the hundreds of pink - clad women knew that their electricity supply had been disconnected by corrupt officials to extract bribes from them to get the power switched back on .
With no functioning law to fall back on , they knew also that the only way to get a power supply was to take matters into their own hands .
Within an hour of their absconding with the key , the electricity was restored .
It is just one victory in a list of successes achieved by the Gulabi Gang since it formed two years ago .
Gulabi means pink , and refers to the electric shade of the uniform worn by the 500 - plus members , who hail from Banda 's arid villages .
The women have become folk heroes , winning public support for a series of Robin Hood - style operations .
Their most daring exploit was to hijack trucks laden with food meant for the poor that was being taken to be sold for profit at the market by corrupt officials .
The targets of the Gulabi Gang 's vigilantism are corrupt officials and violent husbands .
The gang has stopped child marriages , forced police officers to register cases of domestic violence - by slapping them - and got roads built by dragging the official responsible from his desk on to the dust track in question .
The gang is led , and was created by , 46 - year - old Sampat Devi Pal .
When I meet her , she is demonstrating self - defence moves with a stick .
" We always carry them but only for protection , " she explains , twisting the weapon high over her head and thwacking it hard against her opponent's .
The daughter of a shepherd , Pal was put to work on the family 's land while her brothers went to school .
Married at 12 to a 20 - year - old man from a neighbouring village whom she had never met , she was pregnant by 15 .
She wanted to be sterilised after having two daughters but her mother - in - law would n't allow it until she had produced a son .
Another four children followed .
As is common among Hindu families in rural north India , her in - laws wanted Pal to veil her face and remain silent in the presence of male family members , as a sign of respect for authority .
" I never did either , " she giggles throatily .
Pal is difficult company .
Those not showing her the utmost respect get crude abuse .
Yet in a place where expectation of female restraint is so faithfully observed , only someone as irascible as Pal could defy it .
I meet her husband in the couple 's home , which is built in a ditch with plastic sheeting for a roof .
He is mute and utterly obedient to her every order .
Later , an astonishing role reversal takes place as half a dozen loyal and obedient male hangers - on are sent running at the snap of her fingers to fetch us tea and guavas .
To them Pal is someone who can defend the weak , which , in the badlands of Bundelkhand , is rare indeed .
Although 80 % of the gang 's actions are on behalf of women , they are increasingly called upon by men .
When 7,000 Banda farmers decided to take to the streets to demand compensation for failed crops earlier this month , they asked the Gulabi Gang to be there .
The gang 's challenge to the throttling grip of male authority has brought new confidence - and dangers - to its members .
I meet Radha , 40 , the leader of the ambush on the electricity office , walking with a friend in the market .
" Before I joined the gang I was in purdah and never went out of the house , " she says .
" Now I 've tackled ministers and officials and I 've done away with my shyness - and the veil . "
Others have been less fortunate .
A few days before I arrive in Banda , one of the gang 's youngest members , a 14 - year - old girl , had been attacked with a sickle as she went for her morning ablutions in the fields .
She had put up a fight when a 16 - year - old neighbour tried to rape her .
Meanwhile , Pal herself is in danger of being criminalised .
Following a complaint by the police , she is waiting to hear if she will be formally charged with 11 offences , including unlawful assembly , rioting , attacking a government employee and obstructing an officer in the discharge of duty .
" To face down men in this part of the world , you have to use force , " Pal says .
" I did n't do anything wrong .
I have faith that justice will prevail . "
It took Pal over a decade to muster the foot soldiers for the gang she now calls her " army " .
Travelling from village to village , she amassed hundreds of female fans by belting out her repertoire of protest songs .
" I wanted to lift them out of the black hole they 'd been pushed into , " Pal says , like a true orator .
Only 20 % of women in Bundelkhand 's villages can write their name and most are child brides .
" I realised that without education , women are steeped in superstitious beliefs . "
Eventually , hundreds of women were turning out to hear Pal .
They also brought their problems : land grabbing by powerful thugs that left whole families homeless ; their violent husbands ' alcoholism and drug abuse ; how officials demanded bribes even for payment of a widow 's pension .
" I realised that if I could have this kind of control over women then I could get them out of the clutches of their husbands , " Pal says , narrowing her eyes .
There is not the faintest hint of a smile on her lips .
1863 : British chemist John Newlands organizes the known elements , listing them in a table determined by atomic weight , according to what he provisionally calls his " law of octaves . "
It is not an instant hit .
Newlands noticed , as he cataloged the elements sequentially based on Stanislao Cannizzaro 's atomic - weight system , that elements with similar properties tended to appear in intervals of eight , reminding him of the perfect eighth , or octave , in music .
He called his explanatory paper " The Law of Octaves , and the Causes of Numerical Relations Among the Atomic Weights . "
He arranged the elements both in order of succession ( like Cannizzaro ) and in such a way as to get elements with similar characteristics on the same line of his table .
This required some fudging on Newlands ' part and ultimately resulted in some inaccuracies .
Nevertheless ,
Newlands defended his org chart , saying that no other method for cataloging the elements was workable .
Newlands ' table was initially dismissed by the English Chemical Society as irrelevant .
It was n't until the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his own periodic table of the elements in 1869 that Newlands ' achievement began to be appreciated .
Still , it would be another 18 years before the Royal Society got around to awarding Newlands the Davy Medal in recognition of his work .
And it was n't until 1913 that Henry Moseley established that the properties of the elements varied periodically according to atomic number , not atomic weight .

Identity Crisis Among American Youth
When trying to solve water crisis around the globe , we are overlooking some important domestic crisis - the use of fake identity among American college students .
Alcohol seem to be the need as essential as water for these youngsters , preoccupied with drinking and partying .
Fake identification documents , often bought online from sites like Freedom Fakes or printed on campus , are used to cheat upon age related limitations .
We interpret this as an identity crisis , which we can not solve with simple prohibition .
Instead , Globalwater offers healthier choices for college students , such as getting involved in one of our missions - read Reddit reviews and feedback here https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeIDForum/.

When the World Trade Center was attacked for the first time on Feb. 26 , 1993 , President Bill Clinton flew to New York to be briefed on the attack and the response by city , state and federal authorities .
According to newly released White House calendars of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s time as first lady , Mrs. Clinton stayed behind in Washington to attend a photo shoot with Parade magazine and a performance of “ Jesus Christ Superstar . ”
Seven years later , in October 2000 , Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were enjoying a quiet weekend at their new home in Chappaqua , N.Y. , when word came that the Cole , an American destroyer , had been attacked in a Yemen port .
Mr. Clinton rushed back to the White House to deal with the crisis .
Mrs. Clinton returned to the campaign trail in her run for the Senate .
As Mrs. Clinton runs for president , a central theme of her candidacy has been that her years in the White House gave her firsthand experience in dealing with foreign crises .
In her now - famous TV advertisements that ran before the Ohio and Texas primaries , she portrayed herself as the candidate best prepared to answer a 3 a .m. phone call to address a sudden crisis .
While there is no doubt that she had an intimate view of foreign policy during her husband ’s presidency , her claims that she was a central player on counterterrorism , Ireland , Africa and the Balkans have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks .

Polls show Obama surge in California
ST . LOUIS –Sen .
Barack Obama has surged in California and substantially narrowed or erased the double - digit lead once held there by Sen.
Hillary Clinton , according to three polls released this weekend .
Obama leads Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent among California Democrats in a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll of 1,141 likely voters with a 2.9 percent margin of error .
The poll was conducted from January 31 to February 2 .
A California Field Poll also showed strong movement toward Obama .
After trailing Clinton 39 percent to 27 percent as recently as mid-January — and after trailing her by 30 points in an August Field Poll — Obama has pulled into a statistical tie with Clinton .
Clinton was favored by 36 percent to Obama ’s 34 percent .
A sizable portion of voters , 18 percent , remain undecided .

The poll was based on a survey of 511 likely voters in the Democratic primary and was conducted between Jan. 25 and Feb .
1 . The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
A bright spot for Clinton was a McClatchy - MSNBC poll that had her leading Obama by nine percentage points , 45 percent to 36 percent .
The poll of 400 likely Democratic voters had a 5 point margin of error .
The surveys came as both campaigns continue to crisscross the country making their closing arguments with voters in the more than 20 states who will go to the polls and caucuses Tuesday .
Obama ’s gains in California are especially significant because the state has 370 delegates at stake , more than any other state .
“ It is tightening .
I can feel it a little bit , ” said California Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez , a Clinton booster who added that Clinton will do well in the state .
But in a race marked by its unpredictability , both camps were careful not to put too much emphasis on the polling data .
“ Ultimately , it ’s a race for delegates and I think we ’ve learned from the last contests , I would never bet money on polls .
But I feel that we have strong momentum , ” said Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki .
Clinton spokesman Jay Carson said the poll numbers did not worry the campaign .
“ Tuesday ’s going to be a tight day for everybody , but I think there are enough cautionary tales about polls in just this election that people should take them with a grain of salt , ” he said .
“ You only need to look to New Hampshire in our direction and South Carolina in his to see that polls are n’t necessarily the most reliable predictors . ”
Polls failed to predict the eventual outcomes in either state .
Obama , Clinton and their surrogates have spent considerable time in California over the last few days .
Clinton spent all day Friday stumping up and down the coast while Obama held an event and a press conference on Thursday and Friday .
“ I think what we ’re seeing in California is what we ’re seeing across the country , ” Psaki said .
“ When the people get to know Barack Obama , they often become more comfortable with him as a candidate and consider coming in our direction . ”
Pollsters caution against drawing too many conclusions about a state that began early voting on Jan. 7 , where as many as half of the Democratic votes are expected to be cast early .
According to the Field Poll , 12 percent of the Democratic voters already voted for or expressed a preference for a candidate other than those who remain in the running .
Over half of these voters were early mail ballot voters , and have already sent them in .
Ayn Rand , was a Russian - born American novelist and philosopher .
She is widely known for her best - selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism .
She was an uncompromising advocate of rational individualism and laissez - faire capitalism , and vociferously opposed socialism , altruism , and other contemporary philosophical trends .
She is generally either hated or loved .
Her objectivist philosophy had a strong influence on the evolution of the Libertarian political philosophy movement ( though she rejected the title ) .
Here are 25 of her more profound quotes .
Quotes 1 – 5
1 . A government is the most dangerous threat to man ’s rights : it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims .
2 . Ask yourself whether the dream of heaven and greatness should be waiting for us in our graves – or whether it should be ours here and now and on this earth .
3. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy .
The savage ’s whole existence is public , ruled by the laws of his tribe .
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men .
4 . Do not ever say that the desire to “ do good ” by force is a good motive .
Neither power - lust nor stupidity are good motives .
5 . From the smallest necessity to the highest religious abstraction , from the wheel to the skyscraper , everything we are and everything we have comes from one attribute of man – the function of his reasoning mind .
Quotes 6 – 10
6. Government “ help ” to business is just as disastrous as government persecution … the only way a government can be of service to national prosperity is by keeping its hands off .
7 . I swear , by my life and my love of it , that I will never live for the sake of another man , nor ask another man to live for mine .
8. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote ; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority ; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities ( and the smallest minority on earth is the individual ) .
9 . It only stands to reason that where there ’s sacrifice , there ’s someone collecting the sacrificial offerings .
Where there ’s service , there is someone being served .
The man who speaks to you of sacrifice is speaking of slaves and masters , and intends to be the master .
10 .
Man ’s unique reward , however , is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background , man survives by adjusting his background to himself .
Quotes 11 – 15
11 . Money is the barometer of a society ’s virtue .
12 . Only the man who does not need it , is fit to inherit wealth , the man who would make his fortune no matter where he started .
13 . People create their own questions because they are afraid to look straight .
All you have to do is look straight and see the road , and when you see it , do n’t sit looking at it – walk .
14 . Reason is not automatic .
Those who deny it can not be conquered by it .
Do not count on them .
Leave them alone .
15 . Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil .
That sentence is the leper ’s bell of an approaching looter .
Quotes 16 – 20
16 .
The man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap .
17 .
The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals .
Well , when there are n’t enough criminals , one makes them .
One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws
18 . The purpose of morality is to teach you , not to suffer and die , but to enjoy yourself and live .
19 .
The question is n’t who is going to let me ; it ’s who is going to stop me .
20 .
There are two sides to every issue : one side is right and the other is wrong , but the middle is always evil .
Quotes 21 – 25
21 . There is a level of cowardice lower than that of the conformist : the fashionable non-conformist .
22 . We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion : the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases , while the citizens may act only by permission ; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history , the stage of rule by brute force .
23 .
When I die , I hope to go to Heaven , whatever the Hell that is .
24 . Wealth is the product of man ’s capacity to think .
25 .
The most depraved type of human being is the man without a purpose .
People who get only 6 to 7 hours a night have a lower death rate than those who get 8 hours of sleep .
— From a six - year study of more than a million adults
Many Americans are sleep - deprived zombies , and a quarter of us now use some form of sleeping pill or aid at night .
Wake up , says psychiatry professor Daniel Kripke of the University of California , San Diego .
The pill - taking is real but the refrain that Americans are sleep deprived originates largely from people funded by the drug industry or with financial interests in sleep research clinics .
" They think that scaring people about sleep increases their income , " Kripke told LiveScience .
Thanks to the marketing of less addictive drugs directly to consumers , sleeping pills have become a hot commodity , especially in the past five years .
People worldwide spent $ 2 billion on the most popular sleeping pill , Ambien ( zolpidem ) , in 2004 , according to the BioMarket , a biotech research company .
Earlier this month , it was reported that some Ambien users are susceptible to amnesia and walking in their sleep .
Some even ate in the middle of the night without realizing it .
Global sales for all sleeping pills , called hypnotics , will top $ 5 billion in the next several years .
Some Serious Shut -eye Improved sleep behavior and attitudes do more good than sleeping pills for the treatment of insomnia , experts at a recent National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference agreed , says Daniel Kripke of the University of California , San Diego .

Spend time outdoors .
People exposed to daylight or bright light therapy sleep better .
The number of adults aged 20 - 44 using sleeping pills doubled from 2000 to 2004 , according to Medco Health Solutions , a managed care company .
Sleep problems are commonly reported in the elderly , but the increase in spending on sleeping pills was highest in this period for 10 - 19 year olds , possibly due to an association with medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Sleep on this
Still , more sleep is no guarantee for overall health , and more sleeping pills might not bring on either .
A six - year study Kripke headed up of more than a million adults ages 30 to 102 showed that people who get only 6 to 7 hours a night have a lower death rate than those who get 8 hours of sleep .
The risk from taking sleeping pills 30 times or more a month was not much less than the risk of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , he says .
Those who took sleeping pills nightly had a greater risk of death than those who took them occasionally , but the latter risk was still 10 to 15 percent higher than it was among people who never took sleeping pills .
Sleeping pills appear unsafe in any amount , Kripke writes in his online book , " The Dark Side of Sleeping Pills . "
" There is really no evidence that the average 8 - hour sleeper functions better than the average 6 - or 7 - hour sleeper , " Kripke says , on the basis of his ongoing psychiatric practice with patients along with research , including the large study of a million adults ( called the Cancer Prevention Study II ) .
And he suspects that people who sleep less than average make more money and are more successful .
The Cancer Prevention Study II even showed that people with serious insomnia or who only get 3.5 hours of sleep per night , live longer than people who get more than 7.5 hours .
And there are questions about the effectiveness of sleeping pills .
A study by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School found that a change in sleep habits and attitudes was more effective in treating chronic insomnia , over the short - and long - term , than sleeping pills ( specifically Ambien ) .
Night of the living dead
Until 15 years ago , sleeping pills were mainly addictive , overdose - risky barbiturates ( such as Seconal ) and sedatives called benzodiazepines ( Valium and Dalmane ) .
For these reasons , they were less popular and less prescribed .
That changed in the early 1990s when Ambien , which is less addictive , came on the market .
It acts on the same neural receptors as a benzodiazepine , but is safer .
It is the only hypnotic drug Kripke recommends and then , only for fewer than four weeks .
Other new hypnotic drugs are safe but ineffective , he says .
Most sleeping pills are recommended for short - term use , but lots of people take them frequently and become dependent upon them to fall asleep .
Most sleeping pills , especially when taken over long periods of time , stay in the bloodstream , giving a hangover the next day and beyond , impairing memory and performance on the job and at home .
A time - release version of Ambien ( Ambien CR ) bound for the market and designed to prevent waking after 4 hours when the drug normally would wear off , along with one of the newest pills on the market , Lunesta , or eszopiclone , ( designed for longer - term use ) might be even more harmful in this way , Kripke says .
Hypnotic drugs have dangerous side effects , Kripke says .
For one , they reduce fear of risky behavior , such as driving fast .
Ironically , that could result in the inability to see that the sleeping pills are doing more harm than good over time .
A recent study published in the British Medical Journal showed that the risks of taking sleeping pills ( benzodiazepines and other sedatives , in this case ) outweighed the benefits among people over 60 in a series of studies carried out between 1966 and 2003 .
The pills helped people fall asleep and they slept more , but they were twice as likely to slip and fall or crash a car due to dizziness from the pills than they were to get a better night 's sleep .
Even the safest hypnotic drugs have strange side effects , as the alleged Ambien sleepwalkers showed .
And one over - the - counter approach , the hormone melatonin , was found by scientists at the University of Alberta , Canada , to be ineffective in treating jet lag and sleep trouble associated with medical problems .
Studies also show it is associated with skin blanching in frogs , gonadal atrophy in small animals , and obesity in some mammals .
Are you sleeping ?
The real number of Americans with sleep problems is unclear because the same figure — 70 million — appears on National Institutes of Health documents from 2006 and from 1994 .
This catch - all category reportedly includes insomnia , jetlag , sleepwalking , bed wetting , night terrors , restless legs syndrome , narcolepsy and disordered breathing during sleep ( called apnea ) .
The National Sleep Foundation , the source of many sleep surveys and statistics , has financial and institutional ties to sleeping pill manufacturers , according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper .
Sleep problems could be increasing , Kripke says , but there is no evidence for this .
If they are increasing , it could be a result of less exposure to daylight ( due to cable TV , the Internet , indoor gyms ) and increasing obesity , which causes apnea .
But he still recommends against taking sleeping pills in nearly all cases and in favor of improved sleep habits .
" Sleeping pills usually do more harm than good , " he says .

In America , helium is running out of gas .
The element that lifts things like balloons , spirits and voice ranges is being depleted so rapidly in the world 's largest reserve , outside of Amarillo , Texas , that supplies are expected to be depleted there within the next eight years .
This deflates more than the Goodyear blimp and party favors .
Its larger impact is on science and technology , according to Lee Sobotka , Ph.D. , professor of chemistry and physics in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis .
" Helium 's use in science is extremely broad , but its most important use is as a coolant , " said Sobotka , a specialist in nuclear chemistry and physics who collaborates with researchers at several national laboratories .
Generally the larger users of helium ( He ) , such as the national laboratories , have the infrastructure to efficiently use and recycle helium , Sobotka said .
The same can not be said of many smaller scale users .
Helium plays a role in nuclear magnetic resonance , mass spectroscopy , welding , fiber optics and computer microchip production , among other technological applications .
NASA uses large amounts annually to pressurize space shuttle fuel tanks .

" Helium is non-renewable and irreplaceable .
Its properties are unique and unlike hydrocarbon fuels ( natural gas or oil ) , there are no biosynthetic ways to make an alternative to helium .
All should make better efforts to recycle it . "
Drift away
The helium we have on Earth has been built up over billions of years from the decay of natural uranium and thorium .
The decay of these elements proceeds at a super - snail 's pace .
For example , one of the most important isotopes for helium production is uranium - 238 .
In the entire life span of the earth only half of the uranium - 238 atoms have decayed ( yielding eight helium atoms in the process ) and an inconsequential fraction decay in about 1,000 years .
As the uranium and thorium decay , some of the helium is trapped along with natural gas deposits in certain geological formations .
Some of the produced helium seeps out of the Earth 's mantle and drifts into the atmosphere , where there is approximately five parts per million of helium .
However this helium , as well as any helium ultimately released into the atmosphere by users , drifts up and is eventually lost to the Earth .
Helium is applied broadly in science and technology , from nuclear magnetic resonance to computer microchip production and devices like this mass spectroscopy apparatus .

" When we use what has been made over the approximate 4.5 billion of years the Earth has been around , we will run out , " Sobotka said .
" We can not get too significant quantities of helium from the sun — which can be viewed as a helium factory 93 million miles away — nor will we ever produce helium in anywhere near the quantities we need from Earth - bound factories .
Helium could eventually be produced directly in nuclear fusion reactors and is produced indirectly in nuclear fission reactors , but the quantities produced by such sources are dwarfed by our needs . "
Unlike any other element , helium 4 ( two protons , two neutrons ) becomes a liquid below 4.2 Kelvin , just four degrees short of absolute zero .
When one puts an object next to liquid helium , energy is extracted from the object , making it colder .
The energy extracted from the object vaporizes the helium .
It is this helium vapor which , Sobotka claims , should always be recaptured , to be recycled for future use .
Much of the world 's supply of helium lies in a reserve in the Texas Panhandle , better known for the locales of Larry McMurtry 's novels , such as " The Last Picture Show , " and " Texasville , " than as an elemental factory farm .
Scientists have n't even approached mining helium out of the air because costs are too prohibitive .
A rebel , a loner
Both hydrogen and helium , the first two elements on the Periodic Table are very abundant in the universe ( about 92 percent and about 8 percent of the atoms , respectively ) .
Helium is rare on Earth while hydrogen is abundant .
The reason is that helium is a rebel , a loner , and it does not combine with other atoms while hydrogen does .
Hydrogen is one of the two elements that make water .
Under standard conditions , there are no combined or molecular forms of helium .
" It 's the most Noble of gases , meaning it 's very stable and non-reactive for the most part , " Sobotka said .
" Helium has a closed electronic configuration , a very tightly bound atom .
If you try to extract an electron from helium , you pay a lot of energy to pull it off .
It 's very high in ionization energy .
It is this coveting of its own electrons that prevents combination with other elements . "
In addition to the Texas panhandle , helium can be found in small regions of Colorado , Kansas and Oklahoma .
It is marketed in Australia and Algeria .
And Russia has the world 's largest reserves of natural gas , where helium certainly exists .
But there is no push to market it , as , for the short term , supplies are adequate , though increasingly costly .
Sobotka believes that Russia will be the world 's major source of helium in 30 years .
The price of liquid helium is about $ 5 per liter , having gone up more than 50 percent over the past year because of what Sobotka calls " conventional " economics .
He cited the withdrawal of some companies from the marketplace , and the emergence of others that are not yet in production , as the driving force behind higher prices , and ( as yet ) a scarcity of the element .
Helium capture in the United States began after World War I , when the primary use of the gas was for dirigibles .
Because helium is non-flammable , its use in balloons prevented another Hindenburg tragedy .
The U.S. government ran the helium industry for 70 years , but since the mid-90s it has been in the domain of the oil and natural gas industries .
Tell it like it is
" The government had the good vision to store helium , and the question now is :
Will industry have the vision to capture it when extracting natural gas , and consumers the wisdom to capture and recycle ? "
Sobotka said .
" This takes long - term vision because present market forces are not sufficient to compel prudent practice . "
Helium plays second fiddle to marketing oil and natural gas , and much of it is lost in a process that removes noncombustible nitrogen and helium from the product of prime interest .
" When they stick that straw into the ground to suck out oil and gas , the helium comes out , and if it does n't get captured it drifts into the atmosphere and is lost , " Sobotka said .
" Helium production is a side industry to oil and natural gas , an endeavor that nobody wants to lose money on . "
Meanwhile , laboratories worldwide could make better attempts at conserving helium .
They can either use costly machines called liquefiers that can capture , store and reliquefy helium on site , or researchers can take captured helium in gas form , return it to the company that originally sold it to them and receive a monetary return , just as in a deposit on a bottle .
" We have to be thinking of these things , " he said .
" Up to now , the issue often has n't risen to the level that it 's important .
It 's a problem for the next generation of scientists .
But it 's incumbent upon us to have a vision , and tell it like it is — a resource that is more strictly non-renewable than either oil or gas . "
Economists and others weigh in on the weaker - than - expected gain in payrolls and the rise in the unemployment rate .
The sharp jump in the unemployment rate — from 4.7 % to 5.0 % — may be the most alarming feature of this report .
Single - month increases that large occur only rarely and most often near business cycle turning points . [… ]

Ebbin is sponsoring a bill to allow Virginia restaurants to sell Sangria .
Enlarge Wisconsin Historical Society / AP Wisconsin Gov. Albert Schmedeman signs a bill revising beer laws after Prohibition in 1933 .
Going out for Spanish food in Virginia ?
Forget about ordering authentic sangria .
Want to toast your candidate on Election Day in Idaho ?
Better stock up on spirits a day before .
Looking for highbrow brew in Alabama ?
Head for Georgia .
Nearly 75 years after the repeal of Prohibition , some alcohol laws passed in the 1930s have become the target of connoisseurs who say they are as stale as old beer .
" We have a lot of antiquated liquor laws in Virginia that do n't seem to have a lot of purpose in modern society , " Delegate Adam Ebbin says .
His bill to repeal a law making it illegal for restaurants to mix distilled spirits and wine was the subject of a hearing Thursday .
Shana McKillop , the managing partner of La Tasca , a Spanish tapas restaurant in Alexandria , Va. , had never heard of the law until a state inspector cited her for selling traditional sangria made with red wine and brandy .
The restaurant could be fined $ 2,500 and lose its liquor license .
She 's appealing .
" It 's as if the health department told us we could n't serve paella , " Spain 's signature seafood dish , McKillop says .
Now she 's serving ersatz sangria with non-alcoholic triple sec .
Customers have complained .
" Although there is no one here that was around when the Legislature passed the statute in 1934 , I presume that the purpose was to encourage temperance , " says Curtis Coleburn of the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control .
" Adding the spirits increases the alcohol content . "
Other booze bills in the works : •A Wisconsin Assembly committee voted last month to repeal a 1933 law that prohibits local elected officials from owning businesses that sell products or services to liquor - license holders .
At least four have resigned , state Rep. Louis Molepske says , including Stevens Point councilman Norm Barber , who has sold vacuum cleaners to taverns and restaurants for 35 years .
• Idaho lawmakers last week introduced a bill to repeal a 1939 law that bans distilled liquor sales on election days .
That costs Idaho $ 400,000 in sales each time , state liquor chief Dyke Nally says .
He says the law , similar to statutes in eight other states , is a relic of the days when saloons served as polling places .
Delaware , Kentucky and South Carolina also have legislation to lift Election Day sales bans , according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States .
• Beer enthusiasts in Alabama , Mississippi and West Virginia are lobbying to overturn laws that ban sales of beer that exceeds 6 % alcohol .
Stuart Carter of the Alabama lobbying group Free the Hops says Belgian ales and craft beers , which range from 7 % to 14 % , appeal to tourists and aficionados and are n't the kind of brews preferred by binge drinkers .
William Perkins of the Mississippi Baptist Convention Board supports state restrictions .
" The intellectual argument ignores the ill effects of alcohol , " he says .
" Piling up more beers , no matter how tasty or expensive or exclusive , does n't make sense . "
Carter disagrees .
The Scottish - born computer technician often buys beer in Georgia , which raised its alcohol limit to 14 % in 2004 and is now home to 300 craft beers .
In Birmingham , he says , " You can buy a case of Bud Light but you can not buy one bottle of beer brewed by Trappist monks . "

JERUSALEM
The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is " man-made " and worse than it has ever been since the Israeli occupation in 1967 , a coalition of British organisations said in a new report released on 6 March , urging better regional cooperation and saying Hamas can no longer be ignored .
Entitled A Humanitarian Implosion , the 16 - page report details the various effects the Israeli - imposed blockade has had in the last nine months since the Hamas takeover of the enclave , and concluded that all aspects of life have been negatively affected , including healthcare , employment and education .
The agencies , such as CARE , Amnesty , Christian Aid , and Oxfam , quoted UN statistics showing that aid dependency has risen significantly .
While in 2006 some 60 percent of Gazans needed food aid , in 2008 that number rose to 80 percent , and is expected to increase .
In 1999 , before the second `intifada ’ ( Palestinian uprising against Israel ) , UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestinian affairs , provided food to some 16,000 families in the enclave , while now it and the World Food Programme distribute aid to over 1.1 million people .
The report said Gaza 's economy has collapsed as a " majority of private businesses have shut down and 95 percent of Gaza 's industrial operations are suspended . "
The restrictions on imports and exports were also the cause of failings in the agricultural sector .
" As a result of the blockade and collapse of the economy , there is little money to buy food and limited food to buy .
Food prices are rising and wheat flour , baby milk and cooking oil are increasingly scarce , " the report said .
The Gaza Strip suffers from power outages due to the Israeli air strike on the power plant in 2006 and the restrictions on fuel imports , affecting the plant 's productivity and vital institutions like hospitals , which lack 60 - 70 percent of their diesel needs for generators .
Power outages are also affecting the water supply to about 30 percent of Gaza 's residents .
About 40 - 50 million litres of sewage are pumped into the sea daily for the same reason .
The agencies also noted a drop in the percentage of patients allowed out of the Strip for medical treatment , adding that over 20 people have died since June 2007 as a result .
Israeli response

On a recent tour of OPT , UN under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs John Holmes said he was shocked by the " grim and miserable " situation in the Gaza Strip
In a response issued to IRIN , the Israeli Ministry of Defense said some 90 percent of patients are able to leave for treatment , and Israel allows in all medication and other humanitarian supplies needed in spite of Palestinian rocket fire targeting crossing points .
It insisted the amount of fuel it lets in is enough for humanitarian purposes , blamed Hamas for internal distribution problems and noted that it continues to supply electricity to Gaza .
" Israel has the right and duty to defend itself and its people , " Neil Durkin of Amnesty International in London told IRIN , condemning rocket fire at Israeli towns .
However , security concerns could not explain bans on basic imports or patient movement , he said .
Report ’s conclusions
The report concluded that the violence on all sides should cease , and Israel should end its power and fuel cuts to Gaza and open the borders .
In the meantime Israel 's definition of humanitarian aid should be extended to include items like cement and spare parts .
" We ask that the UK government and EU [ European Union ] put pressure on the government of Israel to ensure that emergency assistance essential to fulfilling fundamental human rights is never used as a bargaining tool to further political goals , " the report said .
Finally , the groups called for an inclusive policy that would mean dialogue with Hamas , which rules Gaza but is shunned by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , Israel and the West .

Drinking champagne or red wine is a divine experience as such wines compositions are not just simple alcoholic drinks rather the rich taste is always the basic feature that people want to enjoy .
Most of the wine lovers who know the taste differences and the features that make every kind of wine different from each other are in a better place to decide on the wines they would like to drink .
Though new buyers also have the same kind of options in front of them and they can buy any kind of wine from online suppliers and the local suppliers , but they may choose differently .
The reason behind choosing the wines in a different way is because there is an array of things that people have to compare when they are looking for fresh and tasty wines .
New buyers are usually in the process of choosing the wine brands that they would love to try depending on the alcohol consistency and overall taste .
They may have to pick the smaller packs or pinot noir or sauvignon blanc to check if they will be able to drink them with the particular amount of alcohol inclusion or they might need some different ones if they prefer a different taste .
The common mistakes that people may do depend on the level of information they have and their experience with wines .
Those who are aware of the kind of wine they are looking for may compare the availability and the features and they may also consider the quality on the basis of the brand and customer reviews .
For example , if the new buyer in Australia who wants to buy rose wine orshiraz they will look into the reviews of these wines and then compare them with other options including white wine , Grenache or other types t know these deeper and better .
Furthermore , the common mistakes of people who are buying dessert wine and Semillon for the first time may include buying the wrong packing and quantity that they may not need .
Buying more alcoholic drinks when they cannot have them easily may also be a bad idea .
Beginners may not have to go through a lot of mistakes because of the available information that is always there online .

Senate Republicans are set to announce today the hardest - hitting package of immigration enforcement measures seen yet -- one that would require jail time for illegal immigrants caught crossing the border , make it harder for them to open bank accounts and compel them to communicate in English when dealing with federal agencies .
Most of the bills stand little chance of being debated in the Democratic - controlled Congress .
But the move by some of the Senate ’s leading Republicans underscores how potent the immigration issue remains , particularly in a presidential election year .
The bills give Republicans a way to put pressure on the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to take a tougher stance on immigration .
They also reflect a shift toward harsher immigration rhetoric and legislative proposals from both parties since Congress failed to pass a comprehensive overhaul in 2007 .
The package -- an enforcement smorgasbord assembled by at least eight lawmakers -- consists of 11 bills , but it could expand to as many as 14 .
Some elements echo
House bills , but others go beyond House proposals .
Advertisement
One would discourage states from issuing driver ’s licenses to illegal immigrants by docking 10 % of highway funding from states that continue to do so .
Another would extend the presence of the National Guard on the border , and a third would end language assistance at federal agencies and the voting booth for people with limited English ability .
A bill by Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) , who is leading the effort , would impose a maximum two - year prison sentence on someone caught illegally crossing the border a second time .
“ The point is to reinforce the idea that most of us here feel that we need to make enforcement and border security a first step to solving the overall problem , ” said Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , one of the sponsors .
Advertisement
Although Congress usually avoids tough legislation during an election year , Vitter insisted that he and his colleagues could still get something done .
“ There are concrete steps we can take .
None of us see any reason to waste this time , ” he said .
Other bills in the package would :
* Block federal funding to cities that bar their police from asking about immigration status .
* Give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to use information from the Social Security Administration to target illegal immigrants .
Advertisement
* Require construction of 700 miles of fencing along the southern border , not including vehicle barriers .
* Impose sanctions on countries that refuse to repatriate their citizens .
* Deport any immigrant , legal or illegal , for one drunk - driving conviction .
* Enable local and state police to enforce federal immigration laws .

Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , said the Republican proposal “ falls far short of what is needed . ”
Democrats want to combine enforcement with a guest - worker program and a way to deal with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Reid “ continues to support legislation that is tough on people who break the law , fair to taxpayers and practical to implement , ” Manley said .
But Democrats have also begun embracing a tougher stance on immigration .
A confidential study assembled for the Democratic leadership earlier this year urged them to start using tougher language .
Democrats have focused on offering opportunity to immigrants , but the study by two public - policy groups urged them to begin speaking in terms of “ requiring ” illegal immigrants to become legal and about what ’s best for the United States .
Many House Democrats have gone a step further , endorsing an enforcement - only bill by freshman Democratic Rep. Heath Shuler ( D - N.C. ) that would bolster border security and require employers to verify their workers ’ legal status with an electronic verification system .
The SAVE ( Secure America through Verification and Enforcement )
Act has drawn 140 cosponsors , 48 of whom are Democrats , many of them vulnerable freshmen who won seats from Republicans .
Advertisement
The Democratic leadership dislikes Shuler ’s bill and has refused to schedule a debate .
Republican leaders are considering collecting signatures for a special petition that requires
House leaders to bring a bill up for debate if 218 members sign .
There are 198 Republicans .
Angela Kelley , director of the Immigration Policy Center , said Senate Republicans might be trying to match their House colleagues .
“ They might feel they ’re being upstaged by House Republicans , ” she said .
But she also suggested that the Senate bills could provide political protection to Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who has clinched the GOP presidential nomination .
Conservatives consider McCain soft on immigration .
McCain , along with Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , has backed giving illegal immigrants some form of legal status , which conservatives consider “ amnesty . ”
If McCain endorsed the Senate package , that could “ create a platform for McCain to look tough on immigration , create distance from Ted Kennedy [ D - Mass . ] and erect a shield around the amnesty charge , ” Kelley said .
Advertisement
Besides Sessions and Vitter , the bills are being introduced by GOP Sens.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , John Barrasso of Wyoming , Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , Jim DeMint of South Carolina , Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina , Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico , James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .

Lively Kernel , a Self Supporting System on a Web Page 12 January , 2008
Do n’t Miss Dan Ingalls ’
Talk about the Lively Kernel !
It ’s Squeak on steroids !
Ok not steroids ( considering everything that going on with baseball ) , but it is Squeak on JavaScript !
Details below :
Stanford EE Computer Systems Colloquium
4:15 PM , Wednesday , January 16 , 2008
HP Auditorium , Gates Computer Science Building B01
http://ee380.stanford.edu
Topic : The Lively Kernel
A Self Supporting System on a Web Page
Speaker : Daniel Ingalls
Sun Laboratories , Menlo Park
About the talk :
The Sun Labs Lively Kernel is a new approach to web programming .
It provides a complete platform for web applications , including dynamic graphics , network access , and development tools , and requires nothing more than available web browsers .
We call the system lively for three reasons :
It comes live off a web page .
There is no installation .
The entire system is written in JavaScript , and it becomes active as soon as the page is loaded by a browser .
It can change itself and create new content .
The Lively Kernel includes a basic graphics editor that allows it to alter and create new graphical content , and also a simple IDE that allows it to alter and create new applications .
It comes with a basic library of graphical and computational components , and these , as well as the kernel , can be altered and extended on the fly .
It can save new artifacts , even clone itself , onto new web pages .
The kernel includes WebDav support for browsing and extending remote file systems , and thus has the ability to save its objects and “ worlds ” ( applications ) as new active web pages .
The Lively Kernel uses only existing web standards .
The implementation and user language is JavaScript , known by millions and supported in every browser .
The graphics APIs are built upon SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) , also available in major browsers .
The network protocols used are asynchronous HTTP and WebDav .
The Lively Kernel is being made available as Open Source software under a GPL license .
While it is not ready for use as a product , we expect significant participation from adventurous developers and academia .
About the speaker :
Dan Ingalls is the principal architect of five generations of Smalltalk environments , culminating in the release of Squeak , an open - source Smalltalk system written in itself .
He designed the byte - coded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976 .

' The pollution in China is a threat to my health and it would be difficult for me '
The marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie has said he will not compete in the event at this year 's Beijing Olympics because of concerns about the city 's high levels of air pollution .
The Ethiopian runner suffers from asthma , and the condition forced him out of last year 's London Marathon .
Gebrselassie will instead compete in the 10,000 m event in Beijing .
" The pollution in China is a threat to my health and it would be difficult for me to run 42 km in my current condition .
But I am not pulling out of the Olympics all together , " Gebrselassie told Reuters .
Beijing has such high pollution levels that spectators intending to visit the Olympics have been advised to undertake only limited exercise while in the city .
CURRENT EVENTS , IT now appears , shape sex appeal .
According to a recent theory in psychology , individuals react defensively when the world around them ( the " system " ) is threatened .
This defensiveness generally prompts them to embrace the status quo , along with any of its associated stereotypes .
In a new test of the theory , researchers found that men who read one article conveying pessimism about their country became significantly more interested in traditionally feminine women - women who were portrayed in profiles as " vulnerable , pure , and ideal for making men feel complete . "

IF THE PATRIOTS had won the Super Bowl last Sunday , would you be a happier person today ?
Probably not , studies suggest , because major happy events ( a big promotion , winning the lottery , etc. ) do not have an enduring effect .
So how do we become happier ?
One answer may be to incorporate small , repeated positive events into our lives .
Researchers randomly interviewed people going to a religious service , the gym , or a yoga class , asking them to answer , using a scale of 1 to 100 , several simple questions : " How do you feel right now ? , " " How satisfied are you with your life in general ? , " and " How satisfied are you with your spiritual and religious life ? "
They found that people scored higher after the activity .
But they also found that the people who went more often scored higher .
This has broad economic implications , the authors write : " single - shot events such as a one time tax refund will probably have little lasting impact on the well - being of the country , while policies that lead to small but repeated gains are likely to succeed . "

SMOKING BANS CAN be hazardous to some people 's health .
A rigorous statistical examination has found that smoking bans increase drunken - driving fatalities .
One might expect that a ban on smoking in bars would deter some people from showing up , thereby reducing the number of people driving home drunk .
But jurisdictions with smoking bans often border jurisdictions without bans , and some bars may skirt the ban , so that smokers can bypass the ban with extra driving .
There is also a large overlap between the smoker and alcoholic populations , which would exacerbate the danger from extra driving .
The authors estimate that smoking bans increase fatal drunken - driving accidents by about 13 percent , or about 2.5 such accidents per year for a typical county .
Assuming a smoking ban is still worth it , the results suggest the need for a more aggressive approach to drunken driving - or a nationwide smoking ban .
Since its inclusion on Amazon 's Echo speakers , Alexa has grown into a formidable voice assistant .
But if you 've been on the fence about investing in an Echo speaker for yourself , there 's a chance you might now already own an Alexa - equipped device thanks to a software update from Amazon .
The update , which is timed to coincide with the release of the new Amazon Fire TV stick , will bring support for Alexa to Amazon 's entire range of Fire streaming devices , going back to its first generation Fire TV and Fire TV Streaming Stick .
' Alexa , play The Grand Tour '
As well as offering control over the playback of video on your device , Alexa will also give access to a wide range of other voice functionality such as giving you weather alerts , controlling smart devices around your house or even having it tell you jokes .
If you 've invested in a Fire TV device that does n't come with a voice remote then you 'll be able to access Alexa through the Fire TV's app which is available for iOS and Android .
The new update will be rolling out to customers today .
Mr Mozilo : ' As our company did well , I did well '
Angelo Mozilo , boss of Countrywide Financial , Merrill Lynch ex-head Stanley O'Neal and ex-Citigroup boss Charles Prince all faced the panel .
The three firms were hit by the US home slowdown and subsequent credit crunch .
" It seems that CEOs hit the lottery when their companies collapse , " said House Oversight chair Henry Waxman .
' Broken down '
At the opening of the hearing Mr Waxman said : " Any reasonable relation between their compensation and the interests of their shareholders appears to have broken down . "
Mr Waxman highlighted the fact that Mr Mozilo received more than $ 120 m in compensation and sales of Countrywide shares in 2007 , at the same time that the firm registered losses of $ 1.6bn .
And Merrill Lynch lost $ 10bn in 2007 , but Mr O'Neal got a $ 161 m retirement package .
Meanwhile , Mr Prince was paid a bonus of $ 10.4 m for 2007 as well as $ 28 m in stock and stock options .
' Proud '
The three told the committee the reasons behind their packages .
Mr Mozilo said his direct compensation and value of his shareholdings fell heavily in 2007 and will not receive a bonus for 2007 and 2008 .
" As our company did well , I did well , " said Mr Mozilo , founder of Countrywide , the nation 's largest mortgage lender .
" But when our company did not do well , as in 2007 , my direct compensation and the value of my holdings declined materially , which is as it should be . "
Mr O'Neal also said : " I received no bonus for 2007 , no severance pay , no ' golden parachute . '
" The amount discussed in the press consisted mainly of deferred compensation , stock and options that I had earned during the years prior to 2007 . "
" I 'm proud of my accomplishments , " Mr Prince said , referring to his contributions to Citigroup 's growth .
“ It ’s import ant to impeach Bush as a civics lesson — to say to the American people that America does n’t torture people .

He has to be impeached .

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to send a message
Author lists mountaintop removal among ‘ Crimes Against Nature ’
By Ken Ward Jr .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. flew over the West Virginia coalfields this week to get a better view of mountaintop removal mines .
Kennedy lunched with West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney , and listened to coalfield residents during a staged town meeting at a Raleigh County church .
The three - day tour was all part of Kennedy ’s effort to get a wider audience to hear his message about the “ Crimes Against Nature ” — the title of his 2004 book — that he says companies commit and governments ignore .
Filmmaker Angus Yates and writer Clara Bingham are turning Kennedy ’s book into a movie , a move that has drawn comparisons to the Oscar - winning documentary , “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” about Al Gore ’s famous global warming sli de show .
And as it did in the book , mountaintop removal in West Virginia is expected to be among Kennedy ’s examples of environmental outrages .
Parts of the film , for example , will focus on the battle over a huge coal processing plant and waste impoundment near Marsh Fork Elementary School near Sundial .
“ It ’s more than a sound bite , ” Kennedy said during an interview Wednesday in Charleston .
“ It ’s the destruction of a resource . ”
Kennedy had seen mountaintop removal from the air before .
After a May 2002 flight , he recounted the view in his book as “ a sight that would sicken most Americans . ”
After this week ’s flyover , Kennedy said the damage had only gotten worse .
“ Even if they stop today , they ’ve done so much damage , ” Kennedy said , his voice trailing off .
“ This is the worst stuff I ’ve seen anywhere . ”
Kennedy is an environmental lawyer and the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy .
Even before his book was published , Kennedy was speaking out about mountaintop removal .
During an October 2001 speech at the University of Charleston , he called the practice “ the worst example of what human beings can do to their environment when they behave irresponsibly . ”
And in Kennedy ’s view , it is pollution — not environmental regulations that restrict pollution — that amounts to a legal “ taking ” or a crime against society .
“ If you pollute a creek and a child gets sick , that ’s child abuse , ” Kennedy said .
“ If you pollute air and a child has an asthma attack , that ’s assault and battery . ”
Above all , Kennedy says that blowing up mountains and burying streams is taking precious resources that rightly belong to the public and to future generations .
“ They are stealing historic landscapes , ” Kennedy said .
“ They are stealing an entire state . ”
And like Gore , Kennedy also connects environmental problems to large issues in society .
He favors campaign finance reform , thinks newspapers and other media need to do more investigative reporting , and wants to impeach President Bush .
“ It ’s import ant to impeach Bush as a civics lesson — to say to the American people that America does n’t torture people , ” Kennedy said .
“ We do not intercept the telephone conversations of hundreds of thousands of American citizens illegally .
“ You ca n’t just tear up the Bill of Rights , ” he said .
“ He has to be impeached .
The American people have to remember how sacred the Constitution of the United States is . ”
Story from the Charleston Gazette .
I ’ve got to wonder what the Bush Administration will say about this :
A 37 - year - old American businesswoman and married mother of three is seeking justice after she was thrown in jail by Saudi Arabia ’s religious police for sitting with a male colleague at a Starbucks coffee shop in Riyadh .
Yara , who does not want her last name published for fear of retribution , was bruised and crying when she was freed from a day in prison after she was strip - searched , threatened and forced to sign false confessions by the Kingdom ’s “ Mutaween ” police .
Her crime ?
Sitting in a Starbucks :
Her ordeal began with a routine visit to the new Riyadh offices of her finance company , where she is a managing partner .
The electricity temporarily cut out , so Yara and her colleagues — who are all men — went to a nearby Starbucks to use its wireless internet .
She sat in a curtained booth with her business partner in the café ’s “ family ” area , the only seats where men and women are allowed to mix . (…)
“ Some men came up to us with very long beards and white dresses .
They asked ‘ Why are you here together ? ’.
I explained about the power being out in our office .
They got very angry and told me what I was doing was a great sin , ” recalled Yara , who wears an abaya and headscarf , like most Saudi women .
The men were from Saudi Arabia ’s Commission for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice , a police force of several thousand men charged with enforcing dress codes , sex segregation and the observance of prayers .
(…)
They took me into a filthy bathroom , full of water and dirt .
They made me take off my clothes and squat and they threw my clothes in this slush and made me put them back on , ” she said .
Eventually she was taken before a judge .
“ He said ‘ You are sinful and you are going to burn in hell ’ .
I told him I was sorry .
I was very submissive .
I had given up .
I felt hopeless , ” she said .
Because she ’s an American citizen , Yara is likely to escape the fate of other Saudi women who get caught in this trap , but her story brings home just how bad things are when you ’re ruled by our “ friends ” the Saudis .

Hawk sez , " In what I can only view as troubling and a move surely to invite more backlash against photographers , London 's Metropolitan police has launched a new counter - terrorism PR campaign complete with anti-photography propaganda .
The campaign is meant to encourage people to turn in ' odd ' seeming people that they see taking photographs . "
" Thousands of people take photos every day , " reads their advertisement being run in London 's major newspapers .
" What if one of them seems odd ? "

Allen Roland : The Battle For America Has Begun
The Battle For America Has Begun / We Are All On The Front Lines By Allen Roland
" An election cannot give a country a firm sense of direction if it has two or more national parties which merely have different names but are as alike in their principles and aims as two peas in the same pod " -- Franklin D. Roosevelt
The Battle for America has begun and all of our voices and votes are on the front lines .
It will be a battle of hope versus a battle of fear , it will be a battle for true change versus a battle to maintain the status quo , it will be a battle for inclusion versus exclusion ~ and it will occur first within the Democratic party .
Only an Obama victory will be a victory for America for only Barack Obama offers the possibility of real change in a jaded party and democracy which has lost touch with its base ~ the people .
On the day that John McCain became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party , a Time poll confirmed what voters and polls have consistently demonstrated in the last few weeks – Barack Obama is the candidate best suited to win Independents , play well in Red States , and beat John McCain in November .
In all six of the most recent general election head - to - head match - ups , Obama does better than Hillary Clinton against McCain by an average of more than five points .
In four out of the six , Clinton loses to McCain .
Must watch ~ 4 Minute Video /
Here are Americans of all colors , genders and occupations whose voices and votes must be heard and counted this election year .
All rightfully exclaiming that " We do the dirty work of democracy and that work starts now "

Pass it on to your friends ~

Movie : Jodha Akbar
Cast : Aishwarya Rai( Jodhaa Bai ) and Hrithik Roshan( Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar )
Writers : Haidar Ali and Ashutosh Gowariker
Director : Ashutosh Gowariker
It ’s been a long time since I have walked out of the cinema hall with a feeling of equanimity and the asseveration of having just witnessed a film that will go down in history as a classic .
The last time I was overcome by such a feeling was with Sanjay Leela Bhansali ’s poetic Saawariya , a film that many people rejected for its folklore style .
Market Review
Though the film is expected to open better overseas , the Friday advance opening of ' biggest film of the year ' in India is well below expectations .
Chennai is at 85 % which is good but not recordbreaking .
Delhi is hovering around 65 % .
Bombay is trailing at 60 % and Calcutta follows even tad below .
Indore is around the 60 % mark .
Centers across Rajasthan are of course 0 % because they are n't even letting the movie open there .
The figures are mostly off single screen theaters as most multiplex chains nationally have bypassed the film till now .
Movie Review
The movie Jodhaa Akbar rekindled my faith in why Hindi cinema is the greatest entertainer in the glimmering world of movie lights , for it could only be the Hindi film industry that could conceive such a monopolizing oeuvre .
Set in the 16th century , Jodha Akbar is a sumptuous saga of romance which blossoms under the schismatic setting of political astriction during the Mughal era .
Rajput King Bharmal of Amer ( Khulbhushan Khabarnda ) arranges a marriage of alliance between his daughter Jodhaa ( Aishwarya Rai ) and the Mughal Emperor Jalaudin Akbar ( Hrithik Roshan ) thus sewing the seed of tranquility between both communities .
Asutosh Gowariker has to be congratulated for making a film with such conviction and executing his story on such a grand platform .
Whilst the general consensus of many is that historical films dabble more in the complexities of the past through stolid like factual presentation , Gowariker is able to use his finesse of mixing drama with authenticity – the result being an exhilarating lesson in history which also carries a strong heart .
The nail biting battle scenes have all been captured with sharp camera movements , transporting the viewer to the battlefield , the tense palaver between Ila Arun and Aishwarya demanded pin drop silence from everyone in the cinema hall … exemplary of the maestro director ’s ability to capture the audience and throw them into a bygone era .
Hrithik Roshan as the Great Emperor Akbar is awe - inspiring .
His performance is of dizzying heights , meticulously delivered without any room for criticism .
Roshan epitomizes perfection , both physically and creatively resulting in the finest screen presence to be witnessed since Amitabh Bachchan .
His Akbar is powerful and unflinching yet in a split second can transform to a smirking lover of loyalty towards his queen presenting a humane depiction of a figure who was obviously more than just a temerarious ruler .
Roshan proves yet again just why he is the finest male lead to grace the screen since the millennium .
Aishwarya Rai is always at her best when she is regal and in Jodhaa Akbar she is dignity personified .
The character of Jodhaa demanded a fiery yet graceful streak of personality and Rai achieves this balance with uttermost ease .
The scene where she exchanges heated words with Akbar upon his accusation of her deceit is tremendous as she conveys vulnerability with angst , using her eyes to emote a thousand words .
A character that does not demand huge amounts of dialogues but more so relies on the ability for Rai to emote with her expressions resulting in a play of wholehearted curtailment .
Jodhaa Akbar is sure to go down as one of Rai ’s finest examples of talent .
A R Rahman ’s music may not be of chartbusting quality but it moulds itself into the story in such a way that without becoming officious to the narrative , it still acts as a conclusive transition , especially the Sufi style “ Khwaja Mere Khwaja ” which oozes a spiritualistic aroma of melody .
“ Azeem O Shah Shahensha ” is robust in its presentation and only electrifies the magnitude of the character that Akbar was .
The war is back in the streets of Baghdad and Basra and all over the place .
After a period of relative quiet , the Sadr militia seems to have given up on their ceasefire and what is considered an embryonic Shia civil war has broken out again in what used to be Iraq .
Yesterday two of Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi ’s guards were killed within the Green Zone in mortar attacks .
US military is fighting and bombing Sadr City and involved in fighting in Basra , too .
Basra has been the responsibility of British troops , which have been redeployed from there only last December to a camp at Basra airport .
They are now joining in the fighting again and have announced that planned troop reductions to about 2500 in spring are unlikely now .
The intense fighting means that Des Browne , the Defence Secretary , is likely to tell the Commons next week that British troop levels will remain at about 4,100 for the next few months , abandoning plans to reduce numbers to 2,500 from the spring .
Iraqi army soldiers and police are defecting and handing equipment to the Mehdi militia if not outright fighting for them :
The scene on the other side of the battlefield proved his suspicions right .
Dug in behind a wall was a squad of Mehdi Army fighters , the Shia militiamen Lt Abbas and 15,000 other Iraqi soldiers have been sent to quell .
Sure enough , one was driving an American - issue Iraqi army Humvee – one of seven , said the squad ’s leader , Haji Ali , handed to them by sympathisers within the Iraqi army .
“ We shall fight them until the last drop of our blood , ” he snarled , clutching a Glock pistol of the kind issued to Iraqi police .
“ We will force them to respect the Mehdi Army . ”
A German parliamentary delegation to Iraq has to cancel meetings that are supposed to take place in the relative safety of the Green Zone , because of “ security concerns ” .
But even this mess is not big enough , so that it ca n’t be spun :
Gordon Brown ’s spokesman said : “ The fact that the Iraqi security forces are able to engage in this way in Basra is a recognition of the training and support that they have been given in recent years , that they are now able to take on a much greater degree of responsibility for their own security . ”
I ’d like to have some of what they get to smoke or drink or swallow .
Let ’s just hope , the Bush Administration is n’t using this outbreak to “ prove ” Iran ’s meddling and turn it into a “ defining moment in the history of IRAN . ”
If China 's carbon usage keeps pace with its economic growth , the country 's carbon dioxide emissions will reach 8 gigatons a year by 2030 , which is equal to the entire world 's CO2 production today .
That 's just the most stunning in a series of datapoints about the Chinese economy reported in a policy brief in the latest issue of the journal * Science . *
Coal power has been driving the stunning , seven plus percent a year growth in China 's economy .
It 's long been said said that China was adding one new coal power plant per week to its grid .
But the real news is worse : China is completing two new coal plants per week .
That power is being used to drive an enormous manufacturing expansion .
China has increased steel production from 140 million tons in 2000 to 419 million tons in 2006 , the authors report .
Even more recent numbers from the International Iron and Steel Institute show China 's production leading the world at 489 million tons , more than double Japan and the US combined .
That steel is getting used quickly too .
In 1999 , Chinese consumers bought 1.2 million cars .
That number had increased 600 % by 2006 , when 7.2 million cars were sold .
And yet with all these numbers , Chinese per capita emissions remain one - quarter of our own here in the US .
If the Chinese economy steps into our carbon footprint , all other greenhouse gas reduction efforts will be for naught .
But I have hope for China because their government knows that climate change will impact their country as much , if not more , than many others .
That would leave them with a structural competitive disadvantage , which the Chinese have generally avoided .
Just take a look at the Chinese water situation .
Half of the country 's land is arid or semi-arid , and like the American West , vulnerable to drying out in the early stages of climate change .
Climate change linked drying could reduce China 's agricultural output by 5 to 10 percent by 2030 , which would be a disaster in a country that the authors point out has 20 percent of the world 's population and 7 percent of its arable land .
Chinese government officials know they have an environmental disaster unfolding within their country .
If the US takes positive steps towards reducing our own emissions and helping the Chinese with theirs , I think we will find a willing partner .
After all , there is one bright spot in the journal article .
China 's reforestation efforts , which replant trees that act as carbon sinks .
Forest cover has increased from 12 % in 1980 to 18.2 % in 2005 .
My back - of - the - envelope math says that added 348,000 square miles of forest to China .
That 's a whopping 223 million acres .
Another positive is that China 's renewable energy production is outstripping , on a percentage basis , coal power production .
But despite that growth , the government 's 2020 targets seem low , except for hydro , which has its own problems .
Chinese Government Renewable Energy Targets for 2020
Hydro : 300 gigawatts
Nuclear : 40 gw
Biomass : 30 gw
Wind : 30 gw
Solar : 1.8 gw
To put these numbers numbers in perspective , China built at least 78 gigawatts of energy capacity in 2007 alone , which brought the country over 700 gigawatts of total capacity .
The vast majority of that increase , of course , came from coal fired power plants .
( US capacity is around 900 gigawatts . )
What I think policy makers in the US and China are going to realize is that they need all the R&D resources that both sides can muster to come up with cleaner energy technologies and more sustainable processes .
As both of countries start to experience drought and lack of resources , it 's going to make more sense to work together than to keep playing chicken .
What Americans can't expect is that we 'll be able to strongarm the Chinese into anything .
We 're not dealing with a small Latin American country or a former Soviet republic .
As these raw economic numbers make clear : they are going to generate power to build their economy , with or without us .
The policy perspective was a joint effort between University of Maryland professor Ning Zen , grad student Jay Gregg , and colleagues in Beijing .

著作権法 第八節 裁定による著作物の利用 :
第六十七条 公表された著作物又は相当期間にわたり公衆に提供され、若しくは提示されている事実が明らかである著作物は、著作権者の不明その他の理由により相当な努力を払つてもその著作権者と連絡することができないときは、文化庁長官の裁定を受け、かつ、通常の使用料の額に相当するものとして文化庁長官が定める額の補償金を著作権者のために供託して、その裁定に係る利用方法により利用することができる。
ここで言っている 「補償金」というのは、もしも著作物の利用規定が明確に許諾されているような場合で、かつ、使用料を必要としないことが明示されている場合（例えば、GPL）でも、文化庁長官は補償金を徴収することが可能なのでしょうか。
本来無料で利用できることになっていたものでも、著作権者に連絡がとれないというだけで、第三者に補償金を支払わなければならないと規定できるのでしょうか。
この文面だけではどうもはっきりしません。
さらに、 第九節 補償金 :
第七十四条 ３ 第六十七条第一項又は前二項の規定による補償金の供託は、著作権者が国内に住所又は居所で知れているものを有する場合にあつては当該住所又は居所のもよりの供託所に、その他の場合にあつては供託をする者の住所又は居所のもよりの供託所に、それぞれするものとする。
この供託所というものは、現実には何を指していて、
それはどのように決定されていて、どこから情報を得ることができるのでしょうか。
また、最終的に結局著作権者に連絡がとれないまま、
著作権が消えてしまうほどに時間が経ったとして、
この補償金がどういう運命を辿るのか、どこにも規定がないように見受けられます。
この場合、支払いを受けるべき人間が現れないのであるから、
補償金を支払った人間に払い戻されるべきであると解釈するのが自然な気がするのですが、規定が見付からない以上、供託所とやらにネコババされても文句は言えないように思えます。
実際のところはどうなのでしょうか。

NTIA Says Bush Has Met Broadband Goals Findings based on flawed data
At the end of 2007 , the acting administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) stated that she believed that President Bush ’s goal to achieve universal broadband had been met .
That statement was met with serious opposition .
But that has n’t deterred NTIA releasing its report claiming that the country has made many achievements related to this goal .
quote : “ Today ’s report shows the nation ’s broadband success story .
The President ’s policies have made a significant impact on the availability and affordability of broadband in the United States , ” said U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez .
“ The broadband policies put in place by the President have created a competitive environment to foster innovation and provide effective technologies , services and cost - effective solutions to revolutionize health care delivery , education , society and the economy . ”
The measurements used to promote the meeting of that goal remain
The measurements used to promote the meeting of that goal remain in question as they are based on FCC findings that use biased data .
On the other side of the world , Japan claims to have already rolled out 100 Mbps fiber to eighty five percent of its homes .

We can have Government funded socialistic welfare broadband when you can pry my wallet out of cold dead hands .
Oh I forgot they already can
It is called all the death tax .
This is all this argument is all about : roll out the poor and rural folks to demand government buy you the latest toys .

Oh brother .
The whiners are looking for low latency broadband since satellite internet is nearly universally available .
At my remote property , no less than 15 miles from the local CO I had DRS and it worked great .
Sorry if Verizon and Comcast are n't charitable enough to lose billions deploying in BFE just to support your P2P piracy and FPS gaming habits .
You whiners who MUST HAVE low latency broadband more than electricity and water should have thought about that before picking where you live .
Normal people have considerations when buying a house or renting an apartment including proximity to work , school , freeways , the crime rate , etc .
You should have pulled your head out of your ass and put low latency broadband on that list if you needed it that badly .
Meanwhile , go start a WISP instead of bitching about others not giving you low latency service fast enough .
That is what my neighbors did .
What 's next for you guys ?
You going to move next to an airport then bitch about the noise ?

Personalmente ho sempre visto la tecnologia
Wimax come soluzione di molti problemi : la difficoltà di raggiungere alcune località con i cavi , la ristrettezza della banda , il problema dell ’ultimo miglio ( doppini di rame che prima dovevano portare solo qualche chiamata , ora devono sopportare diverse ADSL sempre connesse ) , e finalmente come la possibilità di avere Internet disposizione sempre e dovunque !
Abbinata a un dispositivo portatile ( che so , un iPhone , meglio di un notebook ) potrebbe rivoluzionare le nostre abitudini .
Pochi si sono posti il problema che le nuove tecnologie sono sempre più complicate di quelle che vengono rimpiazzate .
Adesso pare che qualcuno , una volta provata “ su strada ” l ’applicazione di questa tecnologia , cominci a rendersi conto di quanto sia difficile mettere a punto una rete che funzioni bene per l’utente finale .
In Australia sta costruendo una rete di questo tipo la compagnia Buzz Broadband ; devono aver incontrato molti problemi , perchè l’altro giorno , alla International Wimax Conference di Bangkok , il CEO Garth Freeman ha stupito la platea di addetti ai lavori definendo le prestazioni della rete wireless “ un disastro “ .
Pare che il segnale abbia sia praticamente inesistente a soli 2 km dalla sorgente , e che le prestazioni all ’interno siano altrettanto scadenti , con ritardi del segnale che arrivano ai 1000 millisecondi .
Altri problemi potrebbero riguardare l’assegnazione delle frequenze : il Wimax opera su frequenze che in alcuni Paesi sono già utilizzate da altre reti , commerciali o militari .
Insomma , questo non deve certo farci disperare sulle possibilità della nuova tecnologia , ma solo riflettere su quanto potrà accadere in futuro .
Io spero sempre che presto potremo disporne tutti senza problemi !

It is interesting Koch more or less admitted to We Are Change ( see video ) mayor Giuliani destroyed the 9/11 crime scene evidence but refuses to believe the macabre and documented fact the pulverized bodies of the victims were used to fill potholes .
Not surprisingly , former New York mayor Ed Koch denied and dismissed as “ conspiracy theory ” nearly all the points
Alex made on his show earlier today .
From the well documented fact the supposed 9/11 hijackers trained at U.S. military bases to the undisputed fact remains of bodies from the World Trade Center attack site were used by city workers to fill ruts and potholes , Koch refused to believe , preferring instead the manufactured fairy tale that is the self - serving government version of events .
Moreover , Koch seems to believe censoring free speech is acceptable , so long as it occurs in Europe .
He asserts such will never happen in America , even as Congress continually attempts to pass “ hate speech ” legislation , as it tried to do with H.R. 254 , titled , “ The David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act . ”
In fact , America has a long and sordid history of censoring books and speech deemed either unpatriotic , politically incorrect , or a threat to “ national security , ” that is to say if it reveals too much about the criminal operation of government and corporations .
In essence , Koch ’s acceptance of “ hate crime ” laws in Europe probably means he would accept likewise here , so long as it is framed with political correctness .
In regard to “ conspiracy theories , ” Koch should read the following :
“ The pulverized remains of bodies from the World Trade Center disaster site were used by city workers to fill ruts and potholes , a city contractor says in a sworn affidavit filed yesterday in Manhattan Federal Court , ” the New York Daily News reported almost exactly a year ago .
“ Eric Beck says debris powders – known as fines – were put in a pothole - fill mixture by crews at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island , where more than 1.65 million tons of World Trade Center debris were deposited after the Sept. 11 attacks . ”
But then maybe Mr. Koch does not read the New York Daily News .
It was also reported by Reuters , usually not earmarked as a conspiracy nut news outlet .
Maybe Koch was giving a speech or cutting a ribbon somewhere when the news was reported .
It is interesting Koch more or less admitted to We Are Change ( see video ) mayor Giuliani destroyed the 9/11 crime scene evidence but refuses to believe the macabre and documented fact the pulverized bodies of the victims were used to fill potholes .
But then admitting this would put Koch on the slippery slope to truth , a place a person of his stature cannot go without repercussion .
Koch also said it was a conspiracy theory that the supposed hijackers spent time on U.S. military bases , even though this inconvenient truth was reported by Newsweek on September 15 , 2001 .
“ U.S. military sources have given the FBI information that suggests five of the alleged hijackers of the planes that were used in Tuesday ’s terror attacks received training at secure U.S. military installations in the 1990s , ” write George Wehrfritz , Catharine Skipp and John Barry .
“ Three of the alleged hijackers listed their address on drivers licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in Pensacola , Fla . — known as the ‘ Cradle of U.S. Navy Aviation , ’ according to a high - ranking U.S. Navy source … .
Another of the alleged hijackers may have been trained in strategy and tactics at the Air War College in Montgomery , Ala. , said another high - ranking Pentagon official .
The fifth man may have received language instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Tex . ”
However , now that the story has more or less found its way to the memory hole , Ed Koch and other hucksters of the official Brothers Grimm version of events can ignore it and claim it is simply a zany conspiracy theory .
Out of sight , out of mind .
And you ’re a mental case if you believe otherwise — in other words , a possible candidate for tasering , beating to a pulp , and incarceration in a government re-education camp , at least according to certain high profile members of the corporate media .
Of course , the bare naked truth will not make Ed Koch a believer .
As documented by We Are Change , Koch has very little patience for 9/11 truth activists and intolerantly demands they shut up when they ask questions .
Obviously , as the video here demonstrates , Koch is more interested in attacking Arabs and Muslims and thus continuing the neocon crusade , promised to last over a hundred years .
Finally , it is nothing short of amazing Ed Koch consented to come on the Alex Jones Show , leading us to conclude he did not do his homework before the appearance , same as he is reluctant to investigate the truth behind the events surrounding September 11 , 2001 , and would rather come off as an ignoramus .

For years , activists in the marijuana legalization movement have claimed that cannabis is America ’s biggest cash crop .
Now they ’re citing government statistics to prove it .
A report released today by a marijuana public policy analyst contends that the market value of pot produced in the U.S. exceeds $ 35 billion -- far more than the crop value of such heartland staples as corn , soybeans and hay , which are the top three legal cash crops .
California is responsible for more than a third of the cannabis harvest , with an estimated production of $ 13.8 billion that exceeds the value of the state ’s grapes , vegetables and hay combined -- and marijuana is the top cash crop in a dozen states , the report states .
The report estimates that marijuana production has increased tenfold in the past quarter century despite an exhaustive anti-drug effort by law enforcement .

Jon Gettman , the report ’s author , is a public policy consultant and leading proponent of the push to drop marijuana from the federal list of hard - core Schedule 1 drugs -- which are deemed to have no medicinal value and a high likelihood of abuse -- such as heroin and LSD .
He argues that the data support his push to begin treating cannabis like tobacco and alcohol by legalizing and reaping a tax windfall from it , while controlling production and distribution to better restrict use by teenagers .
“ Despite years of effort by law enforcement , they ’re not getting rid of it , ” Gettman said .
“ Not only is the problem worse in terms of magnitude of cultivation , but production has spread all around the country .
To say the genie is out of the bottle is a profound understatement . ”
While withholding judgment on the study ’s findings , federal anti-drug officials took exception to Gettman ’s conclusions .

Tom Riley , a spokesman for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , cited examples of foreign countries that have struggled with big crops used to produce cocaine and heroin .
“ Coca is Colombia ’s largest cash crop and that has n’t worked out for them , and opium poppies are Afghanistan ’s largest crop , and that has worked out disastrously for them , ” Riley said .
“ I do n’t know why we would venture down that road . ”
The contention that pot is America ’s biggest cash crop dates to the early 1980s , when marijuana legalization advocates began citing Drug Enforcement Administration estimates suggesting that about 1,000 metric tons of pot were being produced nationwide .
Over the years , marijuana advocates have produced studies estimating the size and value of the U.S. crop , most recently in 1998 .
Gettman ’s report cites figures in a 2005 State Department report estimating U.S. cannabis cultivation at 10,000 metric tons , or more than 22 million pounds -- 10 times the 1981 production .
Using data on the number of pounds eradicated by police around the U.S. , Gettman produced estimates of the likely size and value of the cannabis crop in each state .
His methodology used what he described as a conservative value of about $ 1,600 a pound compared to the $ 2,000 - to $ 4,000 - a- pound street value often cited by law enforcement agencies after busts .

In California , the state ’s Campaign Against Marijuana Planting seized nearly 1.7 million plants this year -- triple the haul in 2005 -- with an estimated street value of more than $ 6.7 billion .
Based on the seizure rate over the last three years , the study estimates that California grew more than 21 million marijuana plants in 2006 -- with a production value nearly triple the next closest state , Tennessee , which had an estimated $ 4.7 - billion cannabis harvest .
California ranked as the report ’s top state for both outdoor and indoor marijuana production .
The report estimates that the state had 4.2 million indoor plants valued at nearly $ 1.5 billion .
The state of Washington was ranked next , with $ 438 million worth of indoor cannabis plants .
California also is among nine states that produce more cannabis than residents consumed , Gettman estimates .
According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health , the state ’s 3.3 million cannabis users represent about 13 % of the nation ’s pot smokers .
But California produces more than 38 % of the cannabis grown in the country , the study contends .
Nationwide , the estimated cannabis production of $ 35.8 billion exceeds corn ( $ 23 billion ) , soybeans ( $ 17.6 billion ) and hay ( $ 12.2 billion ) , according to Gettman ’s findings .

It is possible to predict that 2008 will be another presidential election in which only six general election presidential candidates will theoretically be able to be elected .
It is quite likely that the presidential nominees of the Democratic , Republican , Libertarian , Green , and Constitution Parties , as well as independent candidate Ralph Nader , will be the only presidential candidates on the ballot in states containing a majority of the electoral vote .
This will be a repeat of the situation in 2004 .
The July 1 , 2007 Ballot Access News paper issue listed such presidential candidates from all presidential elections 1856 through 2004 .
The number of electable presidential candidates has varied between two and seven , in all those elections .
RocktheDebates was founded to work for at least one general election presidential debate in which all the candidates who could potentially be elected , are invited .
The fact that there almost surely will be six such candidates in 2008 should give renewed strength for the RocktheDebates goal .
This year , if the Commission on Presidential Debates again claims that the 15 % poll rule must be enforced or there would be “ hundreds ” of candidates on the stage , let that claim be countered with the facts .
Also remember the large number of Democratic and Republican presidential debates held this season which were quite successful , even though there were often 6 , 7 , 8 or 9 candidates in those debates .

When Joan Boardman felt her chest tightening , her husband James took no chances and summoned an ambulance .
It was a decision the pensioners were to regret .
The paramedic who answered the call tripped in their driveway and is planning to sue for damages .
In a letter to the couple , Stephen Canning 's solicitors claim the incident left their client with a severely damaged ligament in his left ankle which has led to a loss of earnings .
Scroll down for more ...
When Joan Boardman , 82 , from Louth in Lincolnshire suffered what was thought to be an angina attack and her worried husband James made a frantic 999 call
The Boardmans yesterday said the threat was " morally wrong " and accused Mr Canning of bringing the ambulance service into disrepute .
The incident happened when Mrs Boardman , an 82 - year - old great grandmother , who had had a heart attack two years previously , felt chest pains while at their bungalow in Louth , Lincolnshire .
Mr Boardman , 83 , who served with the 5th Royal Enniskillen Dragoon Guards during World War II , dialled 999 and an ambulance arrived shortly afterwards .
The two medics began treating his wife in her living room , before one of them - Mr Canning - went back to the ambulance to fetch a stretcher .
He tripped over a step next to the sloping driveway as he returned to the property .
Both he and Mrs Boardman were taken to hospital and the pensioner was later given the all clear .
Scroll down for more ...
The offending step , marked with a circle , over which the paramedic stumbled and hurt himself .
He is now sueing the couple
But a letter outlining his personal injury claim which was sent a few months after the incident last March .
His solicitors , Wilkin Chapman , of Louth , claim the accident happened as a result of the Boardmans ' security light cutting out .
Although no sum of money was mentioned , the letter stated : " The light was either faulty because of a lack of maintenance or had not been programmed correctly in that the light was not on for sufficient time to allow someone to walk along the driveway and reach the front door .
" Furthermore the drop from the level of the driveway to the adjoining pathway is itself dangerous . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Canning was not covered by the East Midlands Ambulance Service 's liability insurance because he was not inside the ambulance at the time .
Mrs Boardman , a former nurse who is a grandmother of ten and great - grandmother of three , said the couple had contacted their own solicitors to fight the claim .
" I thought the letter was a joke at first but both myself and my husband fail to see how we could be at fault for his accident , " she said .
" The security light may have switched itself off but the porch light was on , as were the street lights and the ambulance had been left open so there was the light from that . "
Mr Boardman said the paramedic may have fallen because he was struggling to carry the " great big " stretcher on his own .
He said : " This is morally wrong .
We are now reluctant to call the public services and this has brought into disrepute an organisation which I 've got the greatest admiration for . "
Mr Canning refused to comment on the case at his home in Louth .
East Midlands Ambulance Service said he was pursuing the matter in his own right but has received the backing of his union , Unison .
A Unison spokesman said : " When someone is injured doing their job , then somebody has to take responsibility for it . "
A GENERATION of young people is effectively being " raised online " by spending their free time on internet sites such as Facebook and MySpace , a report said today .
Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) suggests many teenagers are spending more than 20 hours a week online , staying up into the early hours of the morning and leaving their mobile phones on all night in case they receive a text message .
It warns a lack of parental knowledge and understanding means that few have any idea about what their children are doing online .
This new research , titled Behind the Screen : the Hidden Life of Youth and published next month , comes ahead of the final report of the Byron Review of children and new technology , set up by Gordon Brown in 2007 and headed by Dr Tanya Byron .
The report argues that with children being " raised online " the Government and internet companies need to do more to protect them from inappropriate content and to promote and enforce guidelines on the limits of acceptable behaviour .
Kay Withers , IPPR research fellow and report author , said : " The internet offers great benefits and opportunities for young people .
But with kids spending an ever - increasing amount of time online , parents need to be reassured about what they are looking at .
Parents
" Government needs to improve media literacy programmes for kids and to make sure parents are aware of how they can support young people 's positive online experiences .
" But more importantly internet companies need to take more responsibility for the content on their sites and promote acceptable behaviour . "
The report found four out of five children aged five to 15 have access to the internet at home .
Almost half of children ( 49 % ) between aged eight and 11 , and eight out of ten aged 12 to 15 have their own mobile phone .
More than two - thirds ( 71 % ) of 12 to 15s say they mostly use the internet unsupervised at home .
It says that while many websites have their own guidelines , these are not always properly enforced .
The researchers found that on YouTube , a search for the term " happy slap " delivered 117 videos posted in the last week and " street fight " 312 videos .
The report found 57 % of children have reported having come into contact with pornography on the internet , most of it accidentally such as in the form of pop - up adverts , and a quarter had received pornographic spam ( junk emails ) .
The report will recommend that communication industry regulator Ofcom should produce an annual report on the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at tackling harmful internet content .
It says internet sites popular with young people , such as social networking sites MySpace and Bebo and video - sharing website YouTube , should develop industry guidelines setting out the limits of what young people can expect and how young people are expected to behave in return .
Risks
It also recommends parents should be given help to learn how to use the internet so they can ensure their children are not being exposed to " unnecessary risks " online .
Unlike television programmes , internet content is not subject to any legal restrictions such as the Obscene Publications Act , Sexual Offences Act , and laws relating to race hatred , defamation and libel .
The Byron Review was set up in September 2007 by the Prime Minister .
Headed by Dr Tanya Byron the review is examining the risks to children from exposure to potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games .
The Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the potential risks from harmful material on the internet and in video games .

The sign has been up for over a year now .
The Fed has already eased rates three times since September in a bid to inject confidence into jittery markets .
But analysts cautioned that central bankers may now feel constrained against further easing : inflation is growing , particularly as oil hovers near $ 100 a barrel .
Lower interest rates , over time , can generate the seeds of inflation , and could make an already weak dollar worth less against foreign currencies .
“ The Fed is trying to juggle a two - sided sword , ” said Ryan Larson , senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management .
“ They ’re trying to fight inflation moving higher and they ’re trying to fight a slowdown in growth . ”
In an effort to encourage lending , the Fed has been pumping cash through the banking system by auctioning off loans at discounted rates .
On Friday , it said it would expand a pair of auctions scheduled for this month , offering $ 30 billion .
Some economists said the markets and other analysts were making too much of a lone jobs report that could yet be revised .
“ The stock and bond markets are going into panic mode , ” said Michael Darda , chief economist at MKM Partners , a research and trading firm in Greenwich , Conn .
“ We ’re going to have a slowdown , but I do n’t think we ’re going to have a recession . ”
While filings for jobless benefits have been rising in recent weeks , the pace has not been swift enough to justify such a sharp jump in the unemployment rate , Mr. Darda added .
For months , the economy had managed to grow vigorously despite worrying developments , from the unraveling of the housing industry to turmoil in the credit markets .
Through it all , economists marveled at the resilience of the labor market , suggesting that as long as the economy kept creating jobs by the tens of thousands each month , Americans would keep spending and growth would carry on .
Stories like this keep us up at night .
One woman was using her husband 's Vodafone mobile phone to download four episodes of Friends .
The downloads were interrupted as the man left his home in the UK for a business trip in Germany , but once his plane touched down , the downloads continued .

( As the headline suggests , this does n't end well . )
When the man arrived back home , Vodafone actually called his firm to alert him of the huge data charge coming in the mail — all £ 11,000 of it — based upon some sort of punishing out - of - network rate from the Germany portion of the downloads ( despite the fact that Germans using Vodafone do n't pay £ 11,000 phone bills every month ) .

Given that this is n't the first time mobile carriers have exploited their Europe - trotting customers , the European Union commissioner is giving wireless companies until July 1st to justify exorbitant cross-boundary charges .
We wish Vodafone the best of luck in their great time of difficulty .

The Philadelphia Inqurer
Elizabeth Holtzman
served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973 to 1981
Since mid-December , members of the House Judiciary Committee Robert Wexler ( D. , Fla . ) , Luis Gutierrez ( D. , Ill . ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D. , Wis. ) have called for hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Cheney .
This should not be surprising , given the strength of the case for impeachment .
What ’s surprising is that it took so long for members of this committee , normally tasked with holding impeachment proceedings , to call for them .
They face huge political resistance on Capitol Hill .
But they are n’t alone .
Other Democratic members are joining them .
Former senator and Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern recently published an op - ed demanding impeachment proceedings for both Bush and Cheney .
Bruce Fein , a Republican who served in the Reagan Justice Department , and many other constitutional scholars also argue for impeachment .
There is more than ample justification for impeachment .
The Constitution specifies the grounds as treason , bribery or “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” a term that means “ great and dangerous offenses that subvert the Constitution . ”
As the House Judiciary Committee determined during Watergate , impeachment is warranted when a president puts himself above the law and gravely abuses power .
Have Bush and Cheney done that ?
Yes .
With the vice president ’s participation , President Bush repeatedly violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires court approval for presidential wiretaps .
Former President Richard Nixon ’s illegal wiretapping was one of the offenses that led to his impeachment .
FISA was enacted precisely to avoid such abuses by future presidents .
Bush and Cheney were involved in detainee abuse , flouting federal criminal statutes ( the War Crimes Act of 1996 and the anti-torture Act ) and the Geneva Conventions .
The president removed Geneva protections from al - Qaeda and the Taliban , setting the abuse in motion , and may have even personally authorized them .
The president and vice president also used deception to drive us into the Iraq war , claiming Saddam Hussein and al - Qaeda were in cahoots , when they knew better .
They invoked the specter of a nuclear attack on the United States , alleging Hussein purchased uranium in Niger and wanted aluminum tubes for uranium enrichment , when they had every reason to know these claims were phony or at least seriously questioned within the administration .
Withholding and distorting facts usurps Congress ’ constitutional powers to decide on going to war .
Can a commander - in - chief disobey laws on wiretapping or torture to protect the country in wartime ?
No .
The Constitution requires the president to “ take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ”
The Supreme Court ruled Harry S. Truman could not seize steel mills to prevent a strike , even during the Korean War .
Nixon ’s claim of national security as a justification for illegal wiretaps was also rejected in impeachment proceedings against him .
What then is the justification for taking impeachment “ off the table ” ?
Congressional leaders do n’t defend the administration , nor do they contend that its actions are unimpeachable or less serious than Nixon ’s .
Instead they argue there is no time , or that impeachment proceedings would distract the Congress from other work , or divide the country .
The subtext seems to be fear that impeachment could undermine Democratic election prospects in 2008 .
But even these “ pragmatic ” arguments are wrong .
Let ’s take them one at a time :
Insufficient time .
In the case of Nixon , the House officially instructed the Judiciary Committee to act in early February 1974 .
The committee finished voting on articles of impeachment July 29 , less than six months later .
No presidential impeachment proceeding had taken place for almost 100 years , so the committee had to start from scratch , analyzing the Constitution and developing procedures for the impeachment inquiry .
Now that the relevant legal spade work is done and a road map for proper impeachment proceedings exists , Congress might conduct them even faster than in 1974 .
Distraction .
During Watergate , the impeachment inquiry did n’t prevent Congress from getting its work done .
In fact , the House Judiciary Committee also worked on other matters during impeachment , just as the Senate did during its impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton .
Divisiveness .
True , President Clinton ’s impeachment was a highly partisan process that divided the country – because most Americans did n’t support it .
They believed his conduct was reprehensible , but not an impeachable offense .
Impeachment therefore had negative repercussions for the Republicans who instigated it .
Nixon ’s impeachment united the American people .
The process was bipartisan , demonstrating this was n’t just a Democratic ploy to undo an election .
The fairness of the process , the seriousness of purpose , the substantial evidence – all gave the public confidence that justice had been done .
This reinvigorated the shared value that the rule of law and preservation of democracy are more important than any president or party .
This value is again asserting itself in grassroots impeachment movements across America .
The Vermont Senate , several state Democratic parties , and many municipal governments have adopted resolutions supporting impeachment .
More state legislatures would have acted except for pressure from Washington .
Many polls show a majority of Americans support impeaching Cheney ( a Nov. 13 American Research Group poll says 70 percent of Americans believe he abused his office ) , and slightly less than a majority support impeaching Bush .
Stonewalling such widespread public sentiment is itself divisive , leading at least half the country to feel their concerns about upholding the Constitution are being ignored .
Only a serious airing of evidence in hearings would heal the split .
Undermining election prospects .
When the impeachment process began , Nixon had just been reelected in one of the largest landslides in history .
Few , if any , worried about whether impeachment was a political winner for Congress or the Democrats .
Public opinion simply forced Congress ’ hand when Nixon fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox .
After the Judiciary Committee conducted impartial hearings and voted on impeachment , Congress ’ approval ratings soared .
Republicans were swamped in the November 1974 elections .
Whether or not they bring electoral rewards in 2008 , impeachment proceedings are the right thing to do .
They will help curb the serious abuses of this administration , and send a strong message to future administrations that no president or vice president is above the law .
Former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman ( [ email protected ] ) served on the House Judiciary Committee during proceedings toward Nixon ’s impeachment .
She coauthored the 1973 special - prosecutor statute , and cowrote ( with Cynthia L. Cooper ) the 2006 book “ The Impeachment of George W. Bush . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The decline in residential real estate accelerated though the end of 2007 , and home prices in 20 key markets plunged 9.1 % for the year , according to a survey released Tuesday .
The S&P Case / Shiller Home Price index showed its largest annual drop in its 20 - year history .
By comparison , during the 1990 - 91 recession , home prices fell 2.8 % .
Prices dropped faster throughout 2007 with the index recording a 9.1 % year - over - year drop in December .
" We reached a somber year - end for the housing market in 2007 , " said Robert Shiller , Chief Economist at MacroMarkets LLC and co-founder of the index , in a statement .
" Home prices across the nation and in most metro areas are significantly lower than where they were a year ago . "
All metro areas are now reporting at least four consecutive monthly declines .
Case / Shiller 's 10 - city index fell even more sharply and finished down 9.8 % .
The Case / Shiller indexes compare same - home sale prices .
The industry considers them to be among the most accurate snapshots of housing prices .
Of the 20 metro areas examined , all but three posted declines for the year .
Miami homes lost 17.5 % in value - more than any other metro area - and Las Vegas and Phoenix both had 15.3 % declines .
The three that posted modest gains : Charlotte , N.C. , 2.3 % ; Portland , Ore. , 1.2 % ; and Seattle , at 0.5 % .
Los Angeles , the nation 's second biggest housing market , was the worst performer in December , when prices fell 3.6 % compared with November ; the decline for the year was 13.7 % .
Other double - digit losers for the year were San Francisco , down 10.8 % ; Tampa , 13.3 % ; Detroit , 13.6 % ; and San Diego , 15.0 % .
Losses in the nation 's biggest market , New York , were more modest , down just 5.6 % for the year .
The game is up .
It is not the end of capitalism ; but a particular form of financial capitalism is going outside and may be some time .
And , irony of ironies , where is the Left , other than in a sad and debilitated state , having sold its soul to the snake - oil salesmen ?
As we watch the bailing - out of failed financial institutions with taxpayers ' money on both sides of the Atlantic , we find that , finally , it is socialism in our time ; but it is socialism for irresponsible ( sorry , they are also responsible ) bankers to safeguard the wider public weal .
People keep asking me about the historical parallels .
Well , they may be parallels , or they may be tangents .
They could even be parabolas .
The South Sea Bubble ; Dutch Tulip Mania ; the events leading to the Wall Street crash of 1929 ; the economic impact of the oil crises of the 1970s - they all come to mind .
It was indicative that , having presided over a period of low interest rates that did nothing to dent ' irrational exuberance ' , the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve , Alan Greenspan , turned his attention , in his memoirs , to those two primeval human motivations : greed and fear .
Greed was the driving force behind the recent worship of the financial sector ; and fear , as Greenspan recognised - he who thought complicated ' derivative ' financial instruments were the economic philosopher 's stone , gaily spreading and eliminating risk - has taken over .
Above all , trust , the cornerstone of good banking and financial practice , has been eroded .
One of the most striking aspects of the credit crunch is the revelation that ' they ' did n't know what they were doing either .
By ' they '
I mean the financial whizz kids who spoke in a jargon few intelligent laypeople understood - a lack of understanding that was often shared by their bosses .
I am struck by the frequency with which bankers and lawyers stress the complexity of so many of these ' derivative contracts ' that are now unravelling .
Derivatives are financial assets whose value depends on the value of one or more other assets .
They enable traders to hedge their bets on the movement of interest rates or exchange rates - to hedge or to gamble .
As John Eatwell and Lance Taylor wrote in Global Finance at Risk ( 2000 ) , after the collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 , ' one use of derivatives has been to create " towers of leverage " far taller than those that helped bring down the American financial system in the 1920s ' .
' Leverage ' : this is the word that has cropped up time and time again recently ( pronounced , irritatingly , in financial circles with a short , American - style 'e' ) .
Private equity groups such as Blackstone and Carlyle were conducting huge deals on the basis of an inverted pyramid .
In ' leveraged ' deals , the base of the pyramid is your own money ; the rest is borrowed .
When the loans are called in , there is a domino effect .
The parallels with the ' something for nothing ' mania of those earlier historical episodes are uncanny .
As Galbraith wrote in The Great Crash : 1929 ( in that famous chapter ironically entitled ' In Goldman Sachs We Trust ' ) :
' Had these securities all been sold on the market , the proceeds would invariably have been less , and often much less , than the current value of the outstanding securities of the investment company . '
One of the characteristics of the financial markets is ' herd behaviour ' .
This is common to most historical financial crashes .
As Professor Charles Goodhart said in his recent GLS Shackle Memorial Lecture at St Edmund 's College , Cambridge ( topically entitled ' Risk , Uncertainty and Financial Stability ' ) :
' Since we are a social animal the tendency will be for us to think and decide much as everyone else .
But if we , and everyone else , are taking similar decisions , and perhaps at the same juncture , that can lead to large jumps , discontinuities in outcomes .
All that has been very evident recently in financial markets . '
Parallels with 1929 - 1932 should not be overdone , because , as can be seen from recent Federal Reserve monetary actions and from the speed with which the US Treasury moved to facilitate the rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns ( talk about a fire sale : JP Morgan paid less than the value of the Bear Stearns building ) , policymakers have at least learnt over the years that conditions should be loosened , not tightened , at a time like this .
But I am struck by the number of serious economists who think there is a limit to what policy can do when the banks are cutting back on lending to help repair their balance sheets .
The parallel , or parabola , with the 1970s is the collapse of the dollar , the high price of oil , and the fear of ' stagflation ' .
Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , is well schooled in the horrors of the Great Depression and the Japanese deflation of the 1990s .
His fear is most certainly that of deflation .
By contrast , his colleague on the Fed Open Market Committee , Richard Fisher , president of the Reserve Bank of Dallas , recently told a meeting of the Society of Business Economists in London that he feared too much monetary easing at this stage might provoke a revival of inflation .
What Fisher fears is the kind of drastic treatment meted out by the Fed under Paul Volcker in the early 1980s in order to bring inflation down from a great height .
Personally , I think deflation rather than inflation is the danger .
But I am reminded that the high interest rates of the early 1980s contributed to the Mexican debt crisis of 1982 .
Asked why he continued to lend to Mexico when he could see the crisis coming , the Mexico expert at a leading bank replied : ' Because it was my job . '
The vast majority of direct marketers want happy customers who buy again and again , and yield what 's known as high lifetime value .
Then there 's that other type .
Look at this landing page from IQ Derma , with one of the wiliest before and afters you 'll ever see .
You may find yourself saying " No effen way " and wondering how they 're able to depict such an impossible transformation without incurring the wrath of some governing body .
I 'll tell you how .
Take another peek at the photo and zoom in on the right - hand side where it says , " simulated imagery " in vertical type .
They 're actually saying it 's bullshit !
But wait , there 's more .
Click the " CLICK HERE " button and fill in the required fields to reach the payment page .
Notice the " FREE TRIAL " for as low as $ 3.95 with standard shipping .
Great deal , do n't ya think ?
Before you click " Place Order , " read the oh - so - fine print in 7 1 / 2 point type .
Basically , if you do n't return the product within 30 days , you pay the " discounted price " of $ 95.70 -- and because this is a negative option offer , they 'll automatically ship you nearly a hundred bucks worth of miracle cream every 60 days until you say " STOP . "
You may be wondering why IQ Cosmetics placed such critical terms near the bottom in tiny type .
I 'll take a stab at it :
They were hoping you 'd miss it .
And apparently more than a few people did .
The Better Business Bureau said , " On September 24 , 2007 we wrote to this company requesting they make modifications to their websites and pop-up ads to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms and conditions of their free trial . "
You tell me if the owners , Intelligent Beauty , adequately addressed the problems .
To date , the BBB has received 42 complaints relating to Intelligent Beauty .
In almost 100 % of cases , they agreed to make a full refund or " perform according to their contract . "
But if a small fraction of buyers complained to the BBB , that 's a lot of dissatisfied consumers .
Question for my direct marketing colleagues :
Do you think this approach is misleading ?
They program every single voting machine in New Hampshire , Connecticut , almost all of Massachusetts , Vermont , and Maine .
But did state officials in five New England states ever do a criminal background check on this company 's executives ?
Do the laws of these five states even ALLOW them to hire convicted criminals for services paid for by the state ?
What about over 500 local towns and municipalities ?
According to my sources , LHS Marketing and Sales Director Ken Hajjar grew up with owner John Silvestro in Lawrence , Massachusetts .
They both moved to Londonderry , New Hampshire , where Ken Hajjar was arrested , indicted , and pleaded guilty to " sale / CND " and sentenced to 12 months in the Rockingham County Correctional facility , and fined $ 2000 .
As things go for the politically connected , he was then given a deferred sentence and $ 1000 of his fine was suspended . [ ]
Hajjar does n't limit his involvement in the voting machine business to sales .
According to an interview conducted by Brad Friedman , Hajjar totes memory cards around in the trunk of his car and defends the boggling concept of swapping out memory cards during the middle of elections .
Hold onto your hats , there 's more .
Start with this LiveLeak video , if you have n't already seen it :
Then read this BradBlog story : quote : ( excerpt ) Other LHS staff members we spoke with , including Mike Carlson and Tom Burge , provided similar comments .
They said they would open machines up during an election and swap memory cards as needed .
This is illegal under Connecticut law and Deputy Secretary Mara told us she has since informed LHS that such actions were in violation of Connecticut election laws .
In 2006 , as Hajjar argued in favor of their policy to change cards during elections , I asked him about about the laws which govern chain of custody issues .
His response : " I mean , I do n't pay attention to every little law .
It 's just , it 's up to the Registrars .
All we are is a support organization on Election Day " .
He said he had three memory cards in the trunk of his car and , in the event they had to be used , the chain of custody issues would n't matter since , " once you run the [ pre- election ] test deck through , you 're golden " .
Black Box Voting has sent out 10 freedom of information requests , called " right to know requests " in New Hampshire , and public records requests elsewhere .
Hajjar 's conviction was in 1987 , but we have asked also for complaints filed on a threat allegedly made in recent years to a New Hampshire woman , and any other reports for Hajjar or LHS owner John Silvestro .
Until recently , LHS employees were listed on the company Web site .
Now the pages identifying who programs New England voting machines have been taken down .
We want to know .
We want to know exactly what the secretaries of state / commonwealth know about LHS Associates .
Did they know of Hajjar 's criminal background ?
If so , why 's he toting voting machine cards around in the trunk of his car in case they are " needed " in live elections , and if not , why not ?
Link to Kenneth Hajjar criminal record : VOTING MACHINES - SKILLFULLY MANIPULATED - LEAVE NO EVIDENCEThe famous " Hursti Hack " of the memory card in the voting system version used in New Hampshire preloaded the card with minus and plus votes , passed the " zero test " at the beginning of the day , and after 6 no and 2 yes votes were fed through it , pronounced election totals of 7 yes and 1 no .
Yes , these are the cards Hajjar totes in trunk .
Good news for the citizens of Connecticut .
According to Brad Friedman , Hajjar was booted out of the state after he posted " You 're full of shit " on BradBlog , a liberal political site that does kick - ass voting machine stories .
Whether Hajjar works in Connecticut or not , he works at LHS , and it is inside the Methuen , Massachusetts - based factory that the memory cards are programmed for Connecticut and the rest of New England .
The men were traveling 100 miles to the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , to meet a Turk who had earlier told Khintsagov ’s three Georgian associates that he represented a Muslim from a “ serious organization ” that was interested in getting HEU .
There was , of course , the problem of the Russian - Georgian customs post , just a few miles from Nogir .
But one of Khintsagov ’s relatives worked there on the Russian side , and he saw to it that things went smoothly .
When Khintsagov and his group approached Tbilisi , they veered off to the hardscrabble Mukhiani district on the outskirts and then arrived at a run-down , nine - story Soviet - style apartment block .
There , in a squalid two - and - a - half - room apartment on the seventh floor , Khintsagov and Sud­jash­vili waited for their Turkish buyer .
Unfortunately for Khintsagov , however , the “ buyer ” was a Turkish - speaking operative of Georgia ’s security service , which had gotten wind of his plans and set up a sting .
At first , the Georgian government did n’t believe that Khint­sagov ’s uranium was weapons grade .
“ There are a lot of scammers saying they have nuclear materials , ” Archil Pavlenishvili , Georgia ’s chief nuclear investigator , told me in Tbilisi in January 2007 .
“ In Khint­sagov ’s case , we thought that , at most , he had some low - grade radioactive stuff , not highly enriched . ”
In fact , according to tests done by the U.S. government shortly after Khint­sagov ’s arrest , his HEU was more than 89 percent pure , a level that the U.S. testing report described as “ suitable for … military purposes including nuclear weapons . ”
Even more alarming was the apparent ease with which Khintsagov , a minor - league hustler , had acquired the material ( most likely in the Siberian city of Novo­si­birsk , as he initially claimed to the Georgian authorities ) .
Only by happenstance had the Georgians been able to apprehend Khintsagov , who had made several attempts to sell his HEU in Georgia ’s lawless , breakaway territory of South Ossetia — one of several geopolitical black holes created in the region by the dissolution of the U.S.S.R .
In 1989 , the Soviet economy was imploding .
Khint­sa­gov , who had worked at a state - run auto - repair facility and as a tractor driver after he finished school in 1973 , was lucky enough to land a job in Iraq , as one of several thousand Soviet citizens brought in by Saddam Hussein to help develop the country ’s oil fields .
But that stint ended in 1991 , and Khintsagov headed home , where he had no prospect of a decent job .
Much of the Soviet workforce was either unemployed or , more often , underemployed .
Professors had become paupers .
White - collar professionals were being turned into penniless paper pushers .
So Khintsagov became a spekulant — a speculator — still a pejorative in those early days after the fall of the U.S.S.R. , where such activity had once been a crime .
First he traded in fish , anything from the dried vobbly that working - class Russian men washed down with vodka , to the trout that thrive in the streams of the Caucasus and the much more expensive , and illicit , Caspian Sea beluga that pass through Khintsagov ’s home region on the way to markets in Moscow .
He dabbled in another Russian staple — kolbasa , or sausage .
And at some point he began dealing in furs , a trade that took him from Nogir to Novosibirsk , the Siberian city famous for its academic research facilities , and infamous for the secret cities nearby that formed the heart of the Russian nuclear - weapons complex .
It seems that every decade brings us a new slew of science fiction dystopian films .
This is because it is such a popular genre .
True fans of the style will generally have seen most of the well known films ( 1984 , Clockwork Orange ) , so I thought that we could look at some lesser known ones rather than simply rehash the ones you already know about .
Admittedly people will probably know at least one or two from this list , but if everyone learns about at least one new film , we will have done our job !
So , here is a list of the top 10 lesser known dystopian films .
10 A Boy and his Dog 1975 , L.Q. Jones
A post -apocalyptic tale based on a novella by Harlan Ellison .
A boy communicates telepathically with his dog as they scavenge for food and sex , and they stumble into an underground society where the old society is preserved .

They use him for impregnation purposes , and then plan to be rid of him .
9 Videodrome 1983 , David Cronenberg
Sleazy lowlife cable TV operator Max Renn discovers a snuff broadcast called “ Videodrome . ”

8 Things to Come 1936 , William Cameron Menzies
Things to come was written by H. G. Wells .
A global war begins in 1940 .
This war drags out over many decades until most of the people still alive ( mostly those born after the war started ) do not even know who started it or why .

In 1966 a great plague wipes out most of what people are left but small numbers still survive .
One day a strange aircraft lands at one of these communities and its pilot tells of an organisation which is rebuilding civilization and slowly moving across the world re-civilizing these groups of survivors .
Great reconstruction takes place over the next few decades and society is once again great and strong .
The world ’s population is now living in underground cities .

3 Alphaville 1965 , Jean - Luc Godard
Alphaville combines the genres of dystopian science fiction and film noir .
Although set far in the future on another planet , there are no special effects or elaborate sets ; instead , the film was shot in real locations in Paris , the night - time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville , while modernist glass and concrete buildings represent the city ’s interiors .

Dutch movie about Islam threatens nation
AP
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende has warned a maverick lawmaker of the risks to Dutch national interests if he presses ahead with a film criticizing the Koran .
Balkenende 's appeal to Geert Wilders on Friday stopped short of demanding that he not release the film , which Wilders said was in the final stages of editing .
" Already we are having to take account of serious threats to Dutch people , " Balkenende said in a televised news conference .
" When you see how the reactions have been at home and abroad , what the risks could be of this film , then there 's one person who must answer for it , and that is Mr Wilders himself , " he said .
Wilders said his short film would portray the Koran as a " fascist book . "
He does not yet have a broadcaster for it , but says he will release it on the Internet if he fails to find one .
In a statement after Balkenende 's news conference , Wilders accused the Cabinet of " bowing to fear of terror and fear of Islam " and rejected calls to scrap the movie .
" Let me make one thing clear :
The film will be released , " he said .
Last week , the Pakistani government ordered Internet providers to restrict access to YouTube , allegedly to prevent Pakistanis from accessing a clip of Wilders in which he makes derogatory remarks about Islam .
The move inadvertently caused a worldwide outage of the video sharing site .
The Dutch development minister called off a visit to Somalia on Friday after he was warned his life would be in danger on the trip .
" This is about the safety of Dutch citizens and businesses abroad , the Dutch military which is on a mission [ in Afghanistan ] , about the broader interest of the Netherlands , the values for which we stand , our reputation internationally , " Balkenende said .
In an earlier last week , Wilders said negative reactions to his film " only served to prove the point " that Islam should be criticized .
Wilders said the film would demonstrate how the Koran incites violence and intolerance of women and homosexuals .
Muslim groups in the Netherlands say they will file hate - speech charges against Wilders for previous statements , such as his description of Islam as a " retarded " religion .
The Grand Mufti of Syria has warned of " bloodshed " if the film is released .
The Dutch national antiterrorism coordinator has told Wilders he may have to go into hiding abroad once his film is released .
He already lives under constant police protection .
Dutch embassies have warned staff to brace for similar violence if the film is broadcast .
American Express , have avoided the cost and stigma of defending themselves against criminal charges with a so - called deferred prosecution agreement , which allows the government to collect fines and appoint an outside monitor to impose internal reforms without going through a trial .
In many cases , the name of the monitor and the details of the agreement are kept secret .
Deferred prosecutions have become a favorite tool of the Bush administration .
But some legal experts now wonder if the policy shift has led companies , in particular financial institutions now under investigation for their roles in the subprime mortgage debacle , to test the limits of corporate anti-fraud laws .

52 Jobs in One Year College grad tries one job a week to find his true passion .
Nov. 23 , 2007  --
Experts predict that today 's college graduates will have four to five different careers in their lifetime .
And if one college grad has his way , he 'll have 52 different careers in one year .
Sean Aiken has only been working at the One Girl Bakery in Brooklyn , N.Y. , for a couple of days , but he has already baked dozens of cookies and pies and become an expert at icing .
His goal is n't to create the perfect cookie ; instead it's to find the perfect job .
" I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career , " said Aiken .
" So instead of jumping at the first job that came along , I thought maybe I should go out there and try a whole bunch of different jobs and learn what I need in a career to be happy . "
For the last nine months , Aiken , a recent college graduate with a business degree , has been traveling throughout the United States and Canada working a different job every week .
His experiences are documented on his Web site oneweekjob.com .
So far he 's worked as a veterinary assistant , a cancer research fundraiser , a bungee - jumping instructor and even a repairman at the Georgia Aquarium .
Aiken admitted to " Good Morning America " that one week was probably not long enough to learn about a job .
" It 's more about the overall experience and learning something new each week , " said Aiken .
Generational Problem ?
Some critics have called Aiken 's job - a - week experiment symptomatic of his generation 's inability to fully commit to something .
But other experts have a different take .
" This generation is not lazy , " said Trudy Seinfeld , who works at the New York University Career Services office .
" They 're coddled by their parents , yes , but what this generation really wants is to change the world , to do something they feel passionately about and might help others . "
Aiken said that his father has asked him why he does n't just get a " real job , " but said he responded by reminding him of something he had told him last year , about his own experience in the real world .
" I said to him that in my last year of college , he said , ' Sean , whatever it is you do , just find something you 're really passionate about , ' " said Aiken .
" He said , ' I 've been alive 60 years and I 've yet to find something I 'm really passionate about , besides your mother . ' "
Aiken has received a few job offers from his job - a - week employers — including one from One Girl Cookie — but says he wants to try his hand at at least 18 more weeklong jobs before settling into anything permanent .
" There 's no rush , " said Aiken .
" That 's one thing that people tell me , ' You 're going to be working the majority of your life so take the time to figure out what makes you happy . ' "
Aiken earns no money from the weekly jobs .
Instead , his employers donate his wages to charity and , when they can , offer him a place to stay as he makes his way around North America .
FOR THE RECORD :
Tupac Shakur :
An article in Thursday ’s Section A on The Times ’ plan to investigate its March 17 report on rapper Tupac Shakur gave the wrong first name for the lawyer for rap talent manager James Rosemond .
He is Jeffrey Lichtman , not Marc .
Reporter Chuck Philips and his supervisor , Deputy Managing Editor Marc Duvoisin , issued statements of apology Wednesday afternoon .
The statements came after The Times took withering criticism for the Shakur article , which appeared on latimes.com last week and two days later in the paper ’s Calendar section .
The criticism came first from The Smoking Gun website , which said the newspaper had been the victim of a hoax , and then from subjects of the story , who said they had been defamed .
“ In relying on documents that I now believe were fake , I failed to do my job , ” Philips said in a statement Wednesday .
“ I ’m sorry . ”
In his statement , Duvoisin added : “ We should not have let ourselves be fooled .
That we were is as much my fault as Chuck’s .
I deeply regret that we let our readers down . ”
Times Editor Russ Stanton announced that the newspaper would launch an internal review of the documents and the reporting surrounding the story .
Stanton said he took the criticisms of the March 17 report “ very seriously . ”
“ We published this story with the sincere belief that the documents were genuine , but our good intentions are beside the point , ” Stanton said in a statement .
“ The bottom line is that the documents we relied on should not have been used .
We apologize both to our readers and to those referenced in the documents and , as a result , in the story .
We are continuing to investigate this matter and will fulfill our journalistic responsibility for critical self - examination . ”
The story first appeared March 17 on latimes.com under the headline “ An Attack on Tupac Shakur Launched a Hip - Hop War . ”
The article described a Nov. 30 , 1994 , ambush at Quad Recording Studios in New York , where the rap singer was pistol - whipped and shot several times by three men .
No one has been charged in the crime , but before his death two years later , Shakur said repeatedly that he suspected allies of rap impresario Sean “ Diddy ” Combs .
The assault touched off a bicoastal war between Shakur and fellow adherents of West Coast rap and their East Coast rivals , most famously represented by Christopher Wallace , better known as Notorious B.I.G. Both Shakur and Wallace ultimately died violently .
The Times story said the paper had obtained “ FBI records ” in which a confidential informant accused two men of helping to set up the attack on Shakur -- James Rosemond , a prominent rap talent manager , and James Sabatino , identified in the story as a promoter .
The story said the two allegedly wanted to curry favor with Combs and believed Shakur had disrespected them .
The purported FBI records are the documents Philips and Duvoisin now believe were faked .
The story provoked vehement denials from lawyers for Combs and Rosemond , both before and after publication .
Rosemond said in a statement Wednesday that the Times article created “ a potentially violent climate in the hip - hop community . ”
His attorney , Jeffrey Lichtman , added : “ I would suggest to Mr. Philips and his editors that they immediately print an apology and take out their checkbooks -- or brace themselves for an epic lawsuit . ”
Although The Times has not identified the source of the purported FBI reports , The Smoking Gun ( www .the smokinggun.com ) asserted that the documents were forged by Sabatino .
The website identified him as a convicted con man with a history of elaborate fantasies designed to exaggerate his place in the rap music firmament .
He is currently in federal prison on fraud charges .
“ The Times appears to have been hoaxed by an imprisoned con man and accomplished document forger , an audacious swindler who has created a fantasy world in which he managed hip - hop luminaries , ” the Smoking Gun reported .
Combs ’ lawyer Howard Weitzman , in a letter to Times Publisher David Hiller , called the story inaccurate .
He expanded an earlier demand for a retraction and said he believed that The Times ’ conduct met the legal standard for “ actual malice , ” which would allow a public figure such as Combs to obtain damages in a libel suit .
The purported FBI reports were filed by Sabatino with a federal court in Miami four months ago in connection with a lawsuit against Combs in which he claimed he was never paid for rap recordings in which he said he was involved .
Sabatino , 31 , said he had obtained the documents to help him prepare his defense in a criminal case against him in 2002 , according to the Smoking Gun .
Philips , a Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter , said he believed in the authenticity of the documents in part because they had been filed in court .
But the Smoking Gun ’s sharply critical review said The Times had overlooked numerous misspellings and unusual acronyms and redactions that could have cast doubt on the documents ’ authenticity .
Moreover , the documents appeared to have been prepared on a typewriter , the Smoking Gun account noted , adding that a former FBI supervisor estimated that the bureau ceased using typewriters about 30 years ago .
The website said its reporters had learned that the documents could not be found in an FBI database .
The website also described unexplained coincidences that made it appear Sabatino had composed the documents from prison .
The Smoking Gun showed that Sabatino had filed court papers on his own behalf that had “ obvious similarities ” in typography and “ remarkably similar spelling deficiencies ” to those in the purported FBI documents .
The Smoking Gun used a report from Sabatino ’s sentencing in 2003 for fraud and identity theft to suggest that his history of lying began in childhood .
When the boy ’s mother left home at 11 , he told a teacher that his mother had died in an accident , rather than acknowledge the truth , said his father , Peter Sabatino , according to the website .
It posted what it said was a letter that the father wrote to the judge .
At the sentencing , the younger Sabatino told the judge that he had been battling a “ demon for a very long time ” and that his motivation for committing fraud was “ to make attention to myself , ” according to another court document posted by the website .
The headline on the Smoking Gun story , over a picture of the picture of the portly Sabatino : “ Big Phat Liar . ”
Philips said in an interview that he had believed the documents were legitimate because , in the reporting he had already done on the story , he had heard many of the same details .
He said a source had led him to three prison inmates who purportedly carried out the attack on Shakur .
One of those inmates implicated the planners of the attack and another implied who was involved , Philips said .
Two others who said they witnessed the attack corroborated portions of the scenario described in the article , he said .
None of the sources were named in the story .
Philips also said the events the sources described fit with previous accounts in the media and even in Shakur ’s songs .
Still , Philips said he wished he had done more .
Philips said he sought to check the authenticity of the documents with the U.S. attorney ’s office in New York , which had handled the investigation of the attack on Shakur , and with a retired FBI agent , but did not directly ask the FBI about them .
The U.S. attorney ’s office declined to comment , while the former FBI agent said the documents appeared legitimate , Philips said .
His statement said he “ approached this article the same way I ’ve approached every article I ’ve ever written : in pursuit of the truth .
I now believe the truth here is that I got duped .
For this , I take full responsibility and I apologize . ”
Philips has spent years digging into the rap music business and had won a reputation as a dogged streetwise reporter .
He and Times reporter Michael Hiltzik shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1999 for beat reporting for their accounts of entertainment industry corruption , including illegal detoxification programs for celebrities .
Duvoisin has overseen many of The Times ’ most notable investigative projects in recent years .
The first significant tip that led to the Shakur story came nearly a year ago , Philips said .
He conducted interviews and reported the story in the interim , then focused on the piece more intensively beginning in January .
The story was reviewed by Duvoisin and two editors on the copy desk .
Other investigative stories published by The Times in recent years have in some cases received the scrutiny of at least one more editor and often of the managing editor or editor of the newspaper .
The Shakur piece did not receive that many layers of review .
Bob Steele , a journalism values scholar at the Poynter Institute , said he would not pass judgment on The Times ’ editing process .
“ But any time you have a substantive investigative project you need multiple levels of quality control , ” Steele said .
“ You need contrarians within the organization who are going to be very skeptical . ”
The editor of Smoking Gun , Bill Bastone , who shepherded the website ’s critique , had been an acquaintance of Philips before the Shakur investigation .
The two met not long ago for lunch , discussing their mutual passion for investigative reporting and other matters .
Bastone knew The Times would publish a story related to the attack on Shakur , and he said he had immediate misgivings when he saw the piece last week .
He said he called Philips to say “ things just do n’t feel right about this . ”
Bastone said he “ took no joy in doing this , ” adding , “ We greatly respect your paper and Chuck and Chuck ’s work .

But I think what happened here is that this guy Sabatino is a master con man , and they got caught up with him . ”

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - President Hugo Chavez crashed to an unprecedented defeat on Monday as Venezuelans voted down his bid to run for re-election indefinitely and accelerate his socialist revolution in the major U.S. oil supplier .
Despite an oil - financed , state - backed campaign , Chavez narrowly failed to muster enough support for a constitutional reform package that would have scrapped term limits on his rule and given him broad new powers
The U.S. government , opposition groups and investors cheered a defeat that curbs for now his plan to control foreign currency reserves , erode private property rights and enshrine socialism as a state priority in the constitution .
The country ’s currency and debt prices had both fallen sharply in recent weeks on fears that a victory for the anti-U.S. leader would both increase tensions in Venezuela and lead him to intensify his assault on “ evil ” capitalism .
In a sign investors perceived lower risk in the OPEC nation , debt prices jumped , helped by Chavez ’s concession speech that was unusually conciliatory .
The president , who remains popular and powerful , might have to pause in seeking to fulfill his ambition of ruling for life atop a Cuba - inspired socialist state .
But he was not giving up on his plan .
“ I will not withdraw even one comma of this proposal , this proposal is still alive , ” he said .
“ For me , this is not a defeat . ”
The former paratrooper led a failed coup in 1992 and came to power via the ballot box seven years later .
Election officials said the “ No ” camp won with about 51 percent of the vote against the reform package , while Chavez scored around 49 percent support .
“ He should now get real .
He has to get his head out of the clouds , come back down to earth because he was losing the plot a little , ” said Carmen , a woman selling newspapers at a roadside kiosk who asked her full name not be divulged .
Controlling Congress , Chavez could resurrect moves to reduce the workday to six hours and give pensions to street vendors and housewives , moves especially attractive to the majority poor who form the base of his support .

DICTATORSHIP
Student protests spearheaded an opposition campaign with rights and business groups , opposition parties , the Roman Catholic Church all lined up against him .
They accused him of pushing the constitutional reforms to set up a dictatorship .
“ We are in a process of reconfiguring the opposition , ” opposition leader Teodoro Petkoff said .
“ Chavez ’s big strength has been to not tire of weakening his adversary .
But his adversaries are beginning to rise up despite their weakness . ”

The U.S. government has branded Chavez a menace to democracy in Latin America and welcomed his defeat .
“ We felt that this referendum was a referendum to make Chavez president - for - life , and that ’s not ever a welcome development in a country that wants to be a democracy , ” Nicholas Burns , the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs , told reporters in Singapore .
One of Venezuela ’s leading opposition newspapers , El Nacional , dubbed the result the “ First Victory ” on Monday .
“ Apart from shelving a package of undesirable reforms indefinitely , the defeat should revitalize the opposition , ” Gianfranco Bertozzi of Lehman Brothers said .
But opposition groups still have to overcome divisions that Chavez , a former paratrooper , had exploited to win all previous national votes since he swept to power in a 1998 election .
“ President Chavez lost an important battle but hardly the war , ” Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs warned investors in a research note from New York .

Scientific research in India is lagging behind other countries
With Indian managers and consultants crowding investment banks , Indian computer scientists sighted in Silicon Valley with the abundance of wildebeests in an African safari and IIT - trained engineers not only working all over the world but appearing in Dilbert cartoons , there seems to be good reason for this .
Yet , over these last two months that I spent in India I came across repeated warnings from prominent personalities associated with Indian academe .
For instance , the scientist CNR Rao , the sociologist Andre Beteille and , most recently in a lecture in Calcutta , Mr Narayana Murthy of Infosys , who is also chairman of the board of directors of the Indian Institute of Management , Ahmedabad , have all warned about India 's faltering higher education system .
How do we reconcile these diverse points of view ?
Moribund universities
As soon as one ferrets through some of the statistics of higher education , the answer becomes evident .
India 's production of professionals is phenomenal .
With over 300 universities and 15,600 colleges spewing out 2.5 million graduates each year , in terms of the volume of production India trails behind only the US and recently China .
A recent evaluation of universities and research institutes all over the world ... has not a single Indian university in the world 's top 300
Your views on the article
Each year India produces 350,000 engineers , twice the number produced by the US .
The IIT 's are indeed world - class training institutes , as are the IIMs ; and in recent years the new law schools are also beginning to produce first - rate lawyers .
What is , however , equally true is that , in terms of research and the purely academic disciplines , such as mathematics , physics and literature , India is beginning to trail in comparison not just to other countries but its own past performance .
The Indian universities , once alive with the hum of intellectual activity , are increasingly moribund .
This is worrying .
The benefits of good professional training are for all to see .
What is less visible but , in the long run , just as important are the academic disciplines , like mathematics and the arts , which are meant to be taught and nurtured in the universities .
Tradition bound
These shape a citizenry 's mind , fertilise a nation 's intellect and provide the milieu out of which emerge the engineer , the lawyer and the computer technician .
If India is to be a global economic powerhouse it is essential to nurture this pure knowledge sector .
India produces over 2.5 million graduates every year
The Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore , comes in somewhere in the top 400 and IIT , Kharagpur , makes an appearance after that .
Given that India was once home to frontline research - Ronald Ross , CV Raman and Satyen Bose easily come to mind - and even a few decades ago the Delhi School of Economics , with Amartya Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati doing cutting - edge research , was routinely compared to the best departments in the world , how have we come to this pass ?
It may at first seem hard to imagine what the answer could be , since our universities function pretty much the way they did in their heydays .
But therein lies the answer .
The organisation of international academe has changed , whereas the Indian university has remained tradition - bound .
There are many things that need to be done .
We need today the kind of initiative that led to the founding of the IITs and to remove the bureaucratic stumbling blocks for the infusion of private funding into the universities .
Pockets of excellence
Minimally , we need to break away from the mindset of having one uniform standard for all .
When India had a few universities treating them all alike , with the same travel and research funding , same salary and the same autonomy ( or lack thereof ) was fine .
But in today 's India to tie all universities to the same level of support and rules is to commit them all to mediocrity .
Amartya
Sen has done cutting - edge work in economics
Our government has to allow pockets of excellence to emerge and to allow them to bid for the best researchers .
Most current academics will tell you that the salary was of little consequence in their choice of career .
I think they are right .
But to survey only the ones who have chosen to be academics is to miss out on people who are sensitive to salary and therefore did not choose to be academics .
To attract some of the best minds to fundamental research , especially with top corporate salaries on the rise , we have to permit research funding to match a scholar 's productivity .
A professor at a top research institute told how they recently hired a talented PhD , who was earning a big salary in a leading IT company and was giving that up to earn the standard 14,000 rupees ( $ 305 ) per month for a starting academic .
This is roughly what a senior call centre worker earns .
The dedication of this particular person , like that of many current academics , is remarkable ; but to rely entirely on such dedicated people to build a dynamic knowledge sector is to court failure .
This debate is now closed .
Here is a selection of your views on Kaushik Basu 's column .
Indian education system is not driven by the institutes , you will have people coming out of shabby colleges but they excel in international careers the reason being hard work being put by average Indian in work place .
The amount of work a Indian employee puts in initial years of his / her career are much more then any country which compensate for the gaps in educational system .
The article is correct but to a larger scale it does not reflect performance of Indian professional .
Ashish Shukla , London , Uk
Good article .
The author missed out on one point .
It is so disheartening and depressing to see the caste and religion being dragged into every inch of educational system .
For people in India , it is demotivating .
Also , why so much reliance on IITs and IIMs ?
It is the very Indian mentality that the system is crippled .
Like we rely on Sachin Tendulkar in cricket , we rely on these institutions .
Before giving them so much credit , one should think how much money and political will is being pumped into these institutions compared to ordinary universities .
Give the same attention to many other universities and IITs and IIMs will become a thing of past .
DM , India
A very good article .
But having done my complete studies in India including higher studies , I feel the failure could also be attributed to lack of quality teaching of basic science right from school .
Not many teachers talk of the philosophy of science .
Vidhya Jagannathan , India
I think in addition to the comments of Mr Basu , my recent visit to India highlighted yet another and in my opinion a more worrying trend , reservation of seats in high education for backward castes .
This reservation system is nothing short of a blatant populist measure aimed at the vote banks with scant regard to the talent and indeed desire to develop high class talent in India .
In the long run , India ( with such populist measures ) will lose further ground in producing talent and encourage mediocrity .
Alarmingly , the Ministry concerned actually made a statement dismissing " merit " as a criteria for entering top universities .
I see more brain drain from India and yes , a lot of growth in the " dumb " call centre sector .
Well done , India .
Murli , UK / India
I am a final year student at IIT Kharagpur .
The reasons about the declining number of students who are pursuing research after under graduation can be attributed to the following factors : 1 ) A job in India for IITians could easily fetch a starting salary of 400,000 rupees plus .
However ,
If one opts to work as a research assistant , or go for PhD , then the stipend one gets is very less .
It 's like 10,000 rupees per month , whereas if a student goes to US to pursue higher education ( read MS / PhD ) , he gets $ 1800 in hand ( after taxes ) per month .
2 ) Dearth of quality professors in India .
I think the reason for this is the low salary for the professors .
At 25,000 rupees ( $ 600 ) per month , one cant lead a life anywhere near to the kind of lifestyle a highly qualified and brilliant person would like to have .
These people would better go abroad and join the US universities , where they get a much better deal .
3 ) Lack of proper infrastructure : Despite the fact that IITs have produced some great minds , the fact remains that it has to do with the tough entrance procedure .
The faculty and infrastructure inside is quite modest by any international standards .
There 's shortage of water , lavatories stink , mess food is a mess altogether and surroundings are not much hygienic .
Why would one like to stay if in every regard the option of doing MS from USA seems a more viable and better option ?
Pushkar Prasad , India
I completely agree with what Prof Basu has to say .
Whilst I was at university , there where a number of students that had come to study there from India .
None of these students opted for pure subjects - instead always opting for the likes of Business / management courses or else computer science / systems engineering .
Whilst having good employability skills is important , it is equally as necessary to have a quorum of pure academics .
I believe it is up to the government and the high net - worth individuals like Mr Narayana Murthy to increase awareness and funding in these areas .
We already have so many MBA's and software engineers - how about some Nobel prize winners in physics / economics / literature ...?
Akshit , India
Mr Basu is correct in pointing out that the rigidity of Indian academic institutions are to be blamed for the deterioration of standards .
However , the increasingly bureaucratic nature of universities , as well as the drain of the brightest students to the US after school in India is also to blame .
I can't believe , however , that the IITs and IIMs are not in the top 300 - I would like to see the basis of such a study before I can take that as a credible result , since the graduates from these institutions are more sought after in their professional fields than graduates from Oxford or Cambridge .
Rustam Roy , London , UK
The IITs were ranked third - best worldwide for technology , after MIT and the University of California Berkeley and 50th best overall university ( Source : The Times Higher Education Supplement ( 2005 ) .
Also check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology and http://www.thes.co.uk/.
So are the comments here justified ?
Vinod , India
The degeneration story is partly true and India 's less than 2 % contribution to world research is the reason for low ranking , but it has quite a few world class teaching institutions and recent private sectors players who emphasise quality .
The only shortcoming is research .
Dayal , Malaysia
Reading Mr Basu 's article makes clear why Cornell is not among top 50 universities of Arts and Humanities ( where Mr. Basu is a professor ) in world , where as Calcutta University , India has 39th place according to Times Higher Education Supplement ( 2005 ) ( link : http://www.epfl.ch/soc/etudes/pdf/world-rankings05.pdf).
When somebody chooses to follow one of the least known surveys just to support his / her claims , we , people of science describe him / her as a person mollifying the evidence .
Times Higher Education Supplement 's university ranking is considered as pretty authentic .
According to the survey , Indian Institutes of Technology ( IITs ) get 50th rank among overall Universities , 3rd rank ( after MIT and Berkeley ) in technology , 36th place in science .
IISc , which is not an university but a research institute is ranked higher than IITs in research in India has not been considered in the Times ' survey ( because by definition it is not a university ) .
With his limited knowledge of Indian science , Mr Basu could name only two economists ( one of whom was his PhD advisor ! ) as the cutting edge researchers from India , he fails to make any comment about several scientists like Ashok Sen , Ramachandran etc who have made very important contribution to the world of science working from India .
After independence , India had to answer several problems and of course funding for science and research was not high till recent period of economic boom .
Recently after the steady economic development even several less known research institutes of India have been found to thrive fast , for example , NCBS , a not so well known research place with 15 research groups has published 60 research papers including 18 in high impact journals like Nature and Cell in 2004 , according to Nature , July 28th , 2005 edition 's Outlook .
This is an impressive record for any research institute any where in the world .
Mr Basu claimed that somebody has joined academia for only 14000 rupees ( $ 305 ) per month salary !
I am quite surprised with this comment .
In India , now grad students in science get a salary of - Rs 10000 - 11000 ( $ 250 ) per month !
I do n't have any evidence saying the exact salary of starting academics , but as far I know , it starts from Rs 35000 ( $ 830 ) per month at research institutes .
In India a salary of Rs.50000 ( $ 1130 ) per month is equivalent or better than $ 100,000 pa in USA .
So , on the whole , I think Mr. Basu 's article is unsubstantial and biased .
Hope in future , respected news sources like BBC will be more serious in selecting guest columnists .
Dipankar , New Haven , USA
There is a curious straitjacket in the Indian education system - that good students study engineering and medicine and mediocre students study commerce .
Therefore , the cream of the students is forced to study mechanical subjects with little emphasis on original research .
Few have the patience to study classical sciences , since all are after quick money .
The poorest of the students are forced to study humanities and social sciences , and it is fruitless to expect them to come up with cutting - edge research .
No wonder most of the top Indian academics , including Kaushik Basu , are based overseas .
Aruni Mukherjee , India
Brilliant people like Mr. Basu should go to serve mother India instead of enjoying life in the West and lecturing about their own homeland .
America has already too many brainy people , but India needs her genius to put order in the lawless and grossly iniquitous society .
Is it asking too much ?
Neil Bee , USA
I am currently a student at MIT , Boston and I have also earned a bachelor 's degree from a nondescript engineering school in India .
My point is that there are a lot of talented students in nondescript schools dotting the Indian landscape .
Harness the capabilities of these students first by providing them with quality education .
This action will enhance the present capabilities of the Indian industry .
golden , USA
Narayanamurthy talks a lot but how much money is Infosys spending for research ?
How many patents do they get in a year per employee ?
They are running a sweat - shop and with a workforce of some 50,000 employees , they cannot match the number of patents from companies like Intel - India who have 3000 - 4000 employees .
Even if research is not considered , how many products do they bring out to the market in a year ?
The answer is close to zero .
They only cater their laundry services to companies in USA .
Manjunath , India
It was a fantastic article and I thoroughly enjoyed the follow up comments .
I am perhaps one of the few yearning to go back to India , in spite of facing a situation 10 years back where I was asked to shell out cash to get a government job for which I had the marks , but not the clout and the reservation factor .
On my last visit to India , the country still lacks infrastructure to support the much touted 8 % economic growth but the country is moving forward and if people like Mr Basu do not step forward and contribute to development in the field of Science and Medicine , Indians will depend on foreign publications and research output to modernise India .
Its time to walk the walk and talk the talk !
Joey , Canada
I am an Italian American executive recruiter , working for technology companies in the west part of the United States .
As a part of my job , I have met quite a good number of Indian software professionals from IITs .
Most of them are quite successful , established and holding c- level positions in big / blue - chip companies .
However , none of these people has ever made any contribution to his / her IIT institute endowment .
Surprisingly , some of these people actually made contributions to their graduate schools , such as Caltech , Stanford or CMU .
On the other hand , I have seen Chinese people making significant contributions to their institutes in the mainland .
I have seen same trends here in the US too .
For most of Ivys , these endowments are the major source of funds to attract right talents .
Sometimes I wonder - do these people really hate their Indian institutes or ashamed of being Indian ?
Again , I am not an Indian and this is just my personal opinion .
So , no flame please .
Bob Copliano , US
Companies like Wipro and Infosys should start their University rather than asking governments to supply qualified personnel trained at subsidized government tuition rates .
We have lost the initial mom !
entum and we have to make a choice between producing brilliant minds ranging from arts , law , management and engineering or we want to be happy to earn above average salaries in our call centres doing work that are rejected by developed societies .
Nomogen , USA
Indian higher education is excessively loaded in favour of the more utilitarian , technical disciplines .
Faculties teaching the humanities are , to say the least , backward and under funded .
One of the things I regret , growing up in India is the fact that I could not get a degree in the classics .
Universities just did n't offer Greek and Latin .
Prashant , New York
I cannot say much about the Indian higher education setup because I am not well versed with its system although what I can confidently state is that the problem of not welcoming change , sticking by redundant curriculum , presence of the widening gap between the educational system and the ultimate professional performance , lack of funds in the system , lack of emphasis of research and social sciences is a problem that is present in the entire region not just India .
This is in reference to some of the most well renowned institutions in the country : IBA ( Institute of Business and Administration ) Karachi , GIK ( Ghulam Ishaq Khan University ) Frontier , Nust ( Punjab ) , Punjab University , Karachi University are some names .
Pakistan is heavily suffering from brain drain and other related issues , ultimately having a degrading effect on our society ... and why not ! , given the dismal standards we have set in some of the top universities in the country .
We fail to recognize reality .
Our institutions dictate our market not the other way round hence the quality of education we set in our institutions will be reflected in the ultimate force a local graduate would become .
Ali Sohail , Pakistan
If Government institutions cannot attract good researchers , then private research institutions should start doing this .
Why are there are not good private universities in India ?
Lets not forget that schools like Cornell , MIT , Stanford are private schools .
Sathyan Subbiah , USA / India
This is a reply to Mr. Dipankar .
The salary figures quoted by Dr Basu are absolutely correct .
The salaries for top academics in India are pathetic , to say the least .
An assistant professor .
at an IIT or IISc starts with a basic salary of Rs. 12000 pm which translates to a max . of Rs. 18500 pm. in hand .
What is more ridiculous is that teachers in low - grade colleges dotting every corner of the country too gets a very similar amount !
After all , elitist practices have to be avoided at all cost !!
Now when it comes to graduate studies , most science and engineering grad students get a stipend of 6000 - 8000 Rs per month , with the exception of an extremely small number of high value scholarships valued at Rs. 10000 - 12000 .
And they expect research to thrive in such an environment .
What a nonsense !
Kumar , India
This article has certainly raised a lot of debate !
As someone educated in India and abroad in the Social Sciences , I believe that the Indian higher education system definitely needs improvement .
It does not rise to meet the talent , ambition and intelligence of Indians .
This is a sad waste of potential .
Indians simply deserve better .
There are institutes of excellence in India but the average college / university needs modernizing and overhauling as Mr Basu suggests .
( The rating system he refers to may be biased and an inadequate measure , but his article has many good points nevertheless . )
There 's a strong bias towards commerce and science or professional degrees among middle - class Indians .
Social Sciences are seen as absolutely the last choice , with parents literally forcing children away from say a degree in Literature .
How then can one get good students / departments / teachers for the Social Sciences ?
Yet these departments have an important role of play .
After all society needs good journalists , social workers , psychologists , social science teachers , not just engineers , managers and lawyers .
I also agree that in their race towards practical and commercial achievement , the higher education system as a whole does not promote " pure " research as much as it should .
This is definitely a loss as Indians have critical minds and a strong intellectual tradition .
We should build on this .
The Indian govt .
can definitely afford to invest in higher education given the country 's much made of 8 per cent annual average growth rate .
Veena Gokhale , Canada
Unlike the Information Technology revolution , India cannot catch the impending innovation revolution without a strong government backing .
The Governments of the US , Canada , Japan , and the EU are precisely doing what I have said .
Thus they are subsidising high - quality research in their non-government sectors .
Kapali Viswanathan , India
I completely agree with Prof Basu on what he has said in his article .
One point I must add to make his article more meaningful so far I am concern .
India is one of the most corrupt countries in the world , and so is India 's education system .
You can buy admission to a higher educational institute by donating money irrespective of the qualification of the candidate .
Also , cheating during the test , as well as falsifying the research data is the norm of life in many educational institutes .
India is far behind in quality of mass education as compare to the west .
A few institutes like IIT cannot help India to compete globally , if India 's educational system stays corrupt .
It is the high time for India to overhaul the system to survive in the highly competitive global economy .
Salil / MD , USA
Salil , USA
I feel first of all we need real politicians with vision like we had many just after our independence .
Shyamal Chatterjee , Egypt
Of course salary is a major issue .
Research and independent thinking is seldom promoted in India .
The education system I agree is very rigorous but like one reader said , hopelessly outdated at times .
Our economy is booming but look at our health sector .
A graduate doctor gets less than 10,000 Rupees a month !!
Who would want to work for that salary after five and a half years of undergraduate studies , I would n't , Is this a joke ?
If it is then it definitely is in a very poor taste .
Sachin Jauhari , United Kingdom / India
There are two ways to think about plugging brain drain in academia -- the article proposes offering greater financial incentives for scholars by tapping into the private sector .
But is n't it naive to imagine that private research funding will rush in to support pure science research or the arts ?
As the article points out , an alternative way to retain talent is by tapping into the idealism of " dedicated " individuals who choose to work in academics in India despite more lucrative opportunities in the private sector or abroad .
I do n't see why this method should n't be encouraged or relied upon ; why make the default assumption that young Indian academics would uniformly be unable to resist the allure of an easy life in the private sector or abroad ?
Many of the brightest have shown and will continue to show the good taste and sense of duty to stay back and do something meaningful with their lives .
There is n't a market solution for everything , Mr Basu -- and perhaps we could persuade you to return to the Delhi School of Economics ?
Vandana Gaurishankar , India
After graduating from a US university with a Masters degree and having interacted with graduates coming out of India , I can say for sure that the quality of Indian fresh graduate engineers is a big concern .
Narayan , USA
I obtained my undergrad degree at Delhi University ( DU ) .
This degree is not even worth the paper it is printed on .
In the 3 years I spent there - learning by rote was the norm and the professors dictated notes from fraying yellow pages .
There was a apt joke to describe the situation - A student is sitting idly in class while the others are furiously jotting down his words .
The professor asks him why he was not taking any notes - the student replies " But I already have them from my grandfather " .
The state of education is just pathetic and we are talking of Delhi University - not some remote non-descript entity .
Fast forward to the US - One cannot even compare my PhD studies here to the sad nonsense that passed for undergrad in Delhi University .
While I was in the lower third of my class in Delhi University , it was at the top of my class during PhD in US .
If I ultimately did well in life - it was because of my own intelligence and cutting edge PhD studies in the US .
At least for me - " Higher education " in India were a waste of time and nothing I would " acclaim " .
B. Roy , USA
I am a Professor at Georgia Tech , in Atlanta , GA , USA and still carry an Indian passport after 25 years in the US .
I fear that with the added 27 % reservation , lack of infrastructure combined with poor student quality and relatively low salaries for professors in India , it will become increasingly hard to find educators in India that can compete with the best from America , Europe , Japan and China .
I fear that the best academics in India might wind up leaving for better prospects in countries such as Australia and Singapore which are welcoming Indian immigrants .
The govt needs to seriously rethink its approach to higher education in India .
I am really concerned .
Abhijit Chatterjee , USA
An excellent article - I hope that scientists like CNR Rao that are also involved with policy and administration can institute these well recommended changes to alter the moribund landscape of Indian academia .
Another medium for change would be to create incentives for Indian students that often leave India to pursue graduate studies in the US , Canada , UK for example , to return to India upon completion of their PhD's and seek professorships with Indian institutions .
Our enriching experiences from well - funded graduate schools outside of India will surely serve as catalysts for transforming research and teaching approaches in the pure sciences and arts .
Sadly , the severe lack of funding both for research and salaries ( $ 305 a month for a PhD holder ?! ) that currently persists will never encourage this at a significant enough scale .

Cloud streets are lines of clouds that form in unusual conditions .
The most favorable conditions for their formation occur when the lowermost layer of air is unstable , but is capped by an inversion - by a stable layer of air .
This often occurs when upper air is subsiding , such as under anticyclonic conditions , and is also frequently found when radiation fog has formed overnight .
Convection occurs below the inversion , with air rising in thermals below the clouds and sinking in the air between the streets .
There 's a video of a plane flying over them after the jump , and I think you 'll agree that these clouds are clearly the work of an evil sorcerer .
Why the hell he 's spending his time making cloud streets is anyone 's guess , but I have a sneaking suspicion it has something to do with mobilizing his dragon army .
I swear , those dragons are so freaking stupid they'd get lost without a line to follow .
He needs to start breeding those dumb bastards with TomToms in their brains .

From the three - or four - stringed bolon that incites warriors to battle and to the six - stringed donso ngoni or seven - stringed simbi which provide music to protect and impassion hunters , to the twenty - one - stringed kora that symbolizes the royal synthesis of indigenous and Islamic cultures , all calabash spike harps are a major feature of traditional and even modern music in West Africa .
The pentatonic sound of the donso ngoni is reminiscent of African American blues tonality , and its use in modern electric ensembles in Mali makes for some of the most fascinating popular music in Africa .
Wooden - box - resonator spike harps of the forest regions farther south do not enjoy the widespread distribution nor the documentation of their northern relatives and may be in a state of decline .
The peculiarity of West African harp construction has until quite recently prevented scholars from realizing that these instruments are harps and not a hybrid kind of harp lute .
By articulating the distribution of these harps , as well as their morphological features , I hope to have laid the groundwork for future comparative studies which might investigate with increasing sophistication the diffusion of musical instruments .
West African guitar playing Mande guitarists are active players in an unbroken and still - vibrant tradition that goes back to the thirteenth - century founding of the Mande , or Mali , empire .
That tradition is primarily guarded by jelis , hereditary professional verbal / musical artisans .
The acoustic guitar was first picked up in the 1920s or 1930s by jelis who began an Africanization process by adapting their balafon ( xylophone ) , nkoni ( lute ) , and kora ( harp ) repertories and playing styles to it .
The rise of modern Mande music and of the electric guitar began with the independence of Guinea in 1958 when the new government launched a sweeping modernization policy in which European musical instruments ( including electric guitars ) were handed out , musicians were made civil servants , and a network of regional and national orchestras was established .
Mali soon followed suit .
Jelis used the electric guitar as the main vehicle for transferring their local repertories to these new urban electric groups .
The process of traditional musicians ( jelis ) embracing , Africanizing , and integrating the guitar into their music culture , and then using it to move their music into the international arena of popular dance music is the focus of this article .
Fed up with being excluded from the debates and otherwise marginalized , former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska announced today that he will seek the Libertarian Party nomination for president .
That ’s right , we said Mike Gravel , who had been running as a Democrat – not Representative Ron Paul , who has run on the Libertarian ticket in the past , but recently submitted his name to appear on the ballot in the remaining Republican primary contests .
Skyler McKinley , a Gravel spokesman , said that Mr. Gravel would try to pursue the Libertarian nomination at the party ’s convention , which will be held in Denver on May 22 - 26 .
“ Whether or not some of our delegates will accept Mike Gravel with some of his positions , that has yet to be seen , ” said Andrew Davis , a spokesman for the Libertarian National Committee , adding that Mr. Gravel ’s advocacy of universal health care , paid for with a national retail sales tax , could turn off some Libertarians .
Also , there are already about 15 candidates vying for the nomination .
From Mr. Gravel ’s e-mail message to supporters this morning :

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The Iraq war has already cost the lives of nearly 4,000 U.S. troops , but there is another cost that is not so readily quantifiable : the economic toll .
Forecasts of the cost to the U.S. have reached into the trillions of dollars , fueling a controversy over the impact on the budget and the economy .
Missing from the debate until now has been the man who famously sparked it : Lawrence Lindsey , then President Bush 's chief economist , who gave an estimate in 2002 that sent the Bush administration into sticker shock .
Less than three months later he was out of the White House .
In this exclusive essay adapted from his new book , What a President Should Know ... but Most Learn Too Late ( Rowman & Littlefield , 246 pages ) , Lindsey reveals how he came up with the number and what he thinks now .
FORTUNE has a history of taking on such topics :
In 1966 we published a landmark story researched by young economist Alan Greenspan that revealed Washington 's massive underbudgeting for the Vietnam war .
In the case of Lindsey 's viewpoint , we think you 'll find his case for the war 's affordability to be a provocative one .
To voice your opinion on the issue , go to fortune .com / talkback .
" Lindsey Predicted Iraq War Would Cost $ 100 Billion to $ 200 Billion . "
It is a line that I refuse to put on my tombstone , but there is little doubt that it will be the lead in some of my obituaries .
As things turned out , my estimate was far too low .
But it was far higher than other estimates that were circulating around Washington at the time , which is how I sparked a debate over the dollar cost of the Iraq war that continues today .
In September 2002 , as President Bush 's chief economist , I committed one of the most grievous mistakes someone in government can make : I answered a hypothetical question from a reporter .
The line of questioning was whether the prospective war in Iraq would be affordable , or whether the increase in government spending would drive up interest rates and sink the economy .
I estimated that such a war , if it were to happen , might cost 1 % to 2 % of GDP and that it would not be economically damaging .
Compared with the costs of possible future terrorist attacks , I said , it would easily pass a cost - benefit test .
The President would have many other questions to consider , including the loss of life , but I did n't feel that money would be an issue .
For the past five years , whenever a reporter was around , despite my best efforts , the subject always came up .
Washington teaches many ways to avoid answering a question , and I 've probably used them all to avoid publicly commenting on the issue .
Until now .
Here is the true story behind my estimate of the cost of the Iraq war - and how the situation looks today .
As it turns out , I was partly right .
The war has not been economically ruinous .
The bill for Iraq over the past five years is now approaching a cumulative $ 500 billion , or about $ 100 billion per year on average .
My hypothetical estimate got the annual cost about right , but I misjudged an important factor : how long we would be involved .
As we approach the fifth anniversary of the start of the war , it 's worth making a new appraisal of where we are going with this investment .
Is the war 's total cost going to run into the trillions of dollars , as some economists have asserted ?
Are those numbers meaningful in terms of what to do next ?
If we stick around to finish the job , are we throwing good money after bad ?
Oscar Wilde 's maxim about people who " know the price of everything and the value of nothing " is sometimes applied to economists .
When it comes to the Iraq war , the point has validity .
Some budget items can be clearly added up , like the Pentagon 's plan to supplement its fleet of Humvees in Iraq with as many as 15,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles at an average cost of $ 1 million apiece .
Other numbers are much fuzzier .
Some economists have strived to produce as large a number as possible , casting a wide net to include items that have not traditionally been in the accounting of past wars , ranging from the costs of higher oil prices to an increase in military recruiting costs .
While potentially interesting from an academic viewpoint , not to mention politically provocative , these estimates put too much emphasis on computing a price and not enough on putting those costs in a geopolitical context .
To make a fair estimate on this scale , one has to consider the costs of the alternative , which in this case was leaving Saddam Hussein in power , as well as the possible benefits toward which we 've made a huge down payment .
Economically , what matters in a war is whether you win or lose .
It is as simple as that .
How I started the furor
In September 2002 , six months before the invasion of Iraq , Bob Davis , a reporter for the Wall Street Journal , interviewed me in my West Wing office about what we had learned about the economic effects of the war on terror and how one should assess the economics of eliminating potential terrorist threats , particularly Iraq .
At the time , it was worth considering the economic impact of a possible war in Iraq as an event that could conceivably derail the economy .
The recovery after 9/11 was still fragile , so much so that I was actively agitating for an acceleration of the tax cuts passed the previous year .
But no matter how one calculated the purely budgetary cost of the war , it was hard to get a number that posted a significant threat to the economy .
I was not privy to any war planning or detailed estimates from the Pentagon .
Those were probably available on a need - to - know basis , but to do my job as economic advisor , the back of an envelope was not only sufficient but also more objective than a formal process that relied on the Pentagon .
There was plenty of data to go on .
The liberation of Kuwait in 1991 cost the equivalent of 1 % of the GDP of the time , or about $ 80 billion in today 's dollars .
Logically , Iraq was going to cost more , given its size .
The Vietnam war cost between 1.5 % and 2 % of GDP each year during the eight years of major American commitment , or about $ 600 billion .
At its peak we had more than 500,000 soldiers and other military in Vietnam .
The publicly available information indicated that if we went into Iraq , it would involve less than one - third as many troops , implying an annual cost of between 0.5 % and 0.7 % of GDP .
I assumed the war could take as long as 2 1 / 2 years , which led me to my upper estimate of $ 200 billion .
One can argue about whether this or any other expenditure is a wise one , but any expenditure of this order of magnitude is simply not going to roil the domestic economy .
Yet my estimate conflicted with numbers circulating in Washington that were improbably low .
Administration figures were giving Congress an estimate of $ 50 billion or so , while Democratic staffers on Capitol Hill were putting it at between $ 30 billion to $ 60 billion .
As one wag put it , " The Pentagon could spend that much on a parade . "
Given my sanguine overall view , the defensive reaction of my administration colleagues was puzzling to me .
Budget director Mitch Daniels described my estimate as " very , very high . "
The communications people were furious .
The main internal criticism I got was that I was " off message . "
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill declared it was " not possible " to estimate the cost of a prospective war when the President had not yet decided to go through with it .
He had n't , but does that mean I should have waited for his decision , then made a calculation on the consequences ?
Suppose my analysis had come up with a different conclusion , so that after the President had made his decision I would have to tell him , " By the way , Mr. President , the decision you just made may be economically ruinous . "
There is a phrase for such thinking that has to do with a donkey going through a door the wrong way .
The other aspect of the " off message " criticism was not the content , but that I was discussing the matter at all .
The possibility of a war in Iraq was hardly a national - security secret .
We were beginning a buildup to more than 100,000 troops surrounding the country and the UN Security Council was about to unanimously warn Saddam of " serious consequences , " diplomatic code for war .
The whole country , indeed the whole world , was discussing the possibility , including my son's fifth - grade class .
The only institution not publicly involved in the discussion and its implications was the White House .
It was n't so much that I was " off message , " but that I was breaking radio silence at a time power and decision - making were becoming more centralized in the White House .
My war cost estimate became part of the never - ending office politics that dominate the West Wing and was doubtless a factor in why I left three months later .
The real problem with the interview for my colleagues in the White House was not my analysis but that I mentioned a hypothetical cost of the war that might be sufficiently high to raise budgetary objects in Congress .
But there was a high cost to their strategy .
Five years after the fact , I believe that one of the reasons the administration 's efforts are so unpopular is that they chose not to engage in an open public discussion of what the consequences of the war might be , including its economic cost .
I think that having done so not only would have been good government , but would also have been good politics .
Suppose the President had gone out and said , " the war might cost $ 200 billion . "
If the lower estimates turned out to be correct , no one would mind .
Government almost never comes in underbudget .
On the other hand , if the costs turned out to be that much or even higher , the President would be spared the refrain we now hear from critics that he " lied about the cost of the war . "
Putting out only a best - case scenario without preparing the public for some worse eventuality was the wrong strategy to follow .
Long - term credibility is the best asset any President has , and it is too bad for the country that his credibility was squandered by the White House not being upfront about what the war might cost .
War , what is it good for ?
There is a widely held but utterly false belief that wars are good for the economy .
Taking resources that could be used to build homes , manufacture appliances , or invent and develop new technologies and using them instead to make things that get blown up is not good for an economy .
It can foster inflation and erode a nation 's capital base .
The Iraq war is not on that scale , and not likely to be .
Hundreds of billions of dollars is a large sum no matter how one slices it ; expressing such figures in terms of GDP helps by contrasting the number to the size of the economy .
But this raises the question whether a number like " 1 % of GDP " is large or small .
For this , imagine that we are not contemporaries trying to evaluate an ongoing conflict but economic historians a couple of centuries from now deciding whether going into Iraq was worth it for America .
The future historian would note that for the past century America has been one of largest military powers on the planet .
This naturally involved a budgetary commitment .
For some of the past century , the American military was quite small .
But on average American military spending was about twice the share of GDP that it now is , about 5 % .
Moreover , with Iraq consuming between 15 % and 20 % of that figure , the future historian would likely view the entire affair as relatively minor in purely budgetary terms .
That is hard for us to comprehend while living through it , but it is the way the numbers break .
An even more challenging leap to the perspective of the future historian comes in the consideration of the human cost .
Since 2003 nearly 4,000 U.S. troops have been killed in the war , and nearly 30,000 wounded .
We Americans view every life as precious , and each of our service members who dies represents a huge personal tragedy for his or her loved ones .
But our future historian would not necessarily regard the Iraq toll as a turn toward callousness toward our citizens in uniform .
In the past century American military fatalities during wartime totaled about 620,000 , or an average of 6,200 per year in a nation with an average population of about 165 million .
In the century before that , American fatalities averaged about 3,800 per year in a country with a population that averaged only about 30 million .
One reason is better medical care , which lowers the fatality rates of those who are wounded but leaves many who would otherwise have died with long - term disabilities .
Specialized care for wounded soldiers is one of many expenditures and social costs that some economists have swept into the accounting in an effort to get a bigger perspective .
One of the first was from Yale 's William Nordhaus , who in 2002 gave two estimates : a low number of $ 99 billion for a short , favorable war and a high figure of $ 1.9 trillion for a case in which " the U.S. has a string of bad luck or misjudgments . "
He acknowledged that such estimates were " virtually certain to be wrong . "
In 2006 economists Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz estimated that " the true costs may exceed $ 2 trillion , " including a major increase in the cost of oil .
The Congressional Budget Office last October gave an estimate of $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion for the entire war on terrorism , including Iraq and Afghanistan , through 2017 ; a month later the Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee pushed that number to $ 3.5 trillion as a high - side estimate .
While many of those costs can reasonably be connected to the war , some of them are dependent on so many other variables that it enters the realm of the cosmic to tie them all together into one pricetag .
Simply adding up the costs does n't reach a sum that tells you on its face whether the war is worth it .
Moreover , a 15 - year cost estimate needs to be compared with 15 years of economic output , which will total $ 300 trillion .
The cost of the alternative
If the Bush administration was less than candid about the cost of the war , the war 's current critics are conveniently forgetting that there were costs involved in not going to war .
If Saddam had not been deposed , it is not as if the power players of the Middle East would be currently sitting around some campfire singing " It 's a Small World After All . "
Nor is it likely that we would have no troops in the region .
To understand the true cost of the war , budgetary or otherwise , one has to go back to consider what the realistic alternative was at the time .
In late 2002 the U.S. had more than 60,000 troops stationed in the countries around Iraq to back up UN Security Council resolutions .
Hans Blix , the UN's weapons inspector , credited those forces as being the reason he was getting even limited co-operation from Saddam .
In the congressional debate about authorizing the war , the opponents ' position was that we should continue with the UN inspection process , which required U.S. troops to stay on the scene .
It was presumed that Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) , not just by President Bush , but by the National Intelligence Estimate and the spy agencies of many other countries .
It would have taken a long time to convince a skeptical world that Saddam 's noncompliance with 17 UN resolutions was innocent .
Under the alternative scenario of the time American forces would have been stationed around Iraq for years , many of them in harm 's way .
The true cost of the Iraq war , therefore , is not the pricetag we see in the papers , but the cost of that conflict relative to the alternative scenario on offer .
We would have still stationed half to three - fourths as many troops as we now have in Iraq in neighboring countries .
The cost of stationing them there would be lower than what we now pay but would still be substantial .
The continuous use of air power would have been necessary to police the no-fly zones established in the ceasefire of the first Iraq war .
Increased surveillance of the Iran - Iraq and Syria - Iraq borders would have been necessary to limit terrorist migration .
While we did not find WMDs in Iraq , there was plenty of evidence on the ground to suggest that Iraq would have developed them if it had had the opportunity , as it had in the past .
Hence , the real alternative to the war was probably eternal vigilance and a large troop commitment .
I do n't claim that my back - of - the - envelope calculations would be any better than they were in 2002 , but it seems plausible that not invading Iraq would probably have cost at least a third as much as we ultimately spent on deposing Saddam .
Measuring the benefits
We went into Iraq with a set of goals in mind , but most of them were intangible .
We need to consider whether we achieved our objectives , or other benefits , to know whether it was worth the cost .
While no WMDs were found in Iraq , the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to go to war over them .
Shortly after Saddam fell , Libya 's ruler Muammar Qadaffi decided to reveal that he had a stockpile of WMDs - along with a nuclear weapons program - and that he would like to give them up voluntarily and abide by the norms of international law .
The timing of his conversion made it clear that he had learned some lessons from Saddam 's defeat .
Moreover , the National Intelligence Estimate released in December concluded that Iran probably suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 , around the same time as the Libya move .
This latter finding is controversial , with no certainty regarding whether Iran has since restarted the program it denied ever having .
But if the estimate is correct , the timing of Iran 's decision to suspend its program , bowing to what the intelligence estimate called " international pressure " with 150,000 American troops suddenly next door , suggests that at least some good was done on this front .
In Iraq the war toppled an outlaw regime that not only had been flouting international law but had been a systematic abuser of human rights .
It 's fair to claim that America cannot afford to liberate all the people who live under oppressive regimes , but the causes of human freedom and dignity have certainly gained by his downfall .
These intangibles are real but are hard to quantify against the costs .
It is certainly true , I would argue , that the net costs of the Iraq war are much lower than war critics maintain , or even than the usual budgetary accounting suggests .
Each individual must make up his own mind about whether these imperfect successes justified the cost .
Most voters do n't believe they do , given the evidence to date , polls say .
But to those skeptics I offer one more argument in favor of Iraq passing the cost - benefit test .
A key aspect of good decision analysis is the question " What if I 'm wrong ? "
The administration and much of the world intelligence community turned out to be wrong about Saddam 's WMD program .
The costs of that error are now clear .
But what if the administration had decided to leave Saddam alone and , in turn , he had had WMDs ?
The costs to the world would have been much higher .
The cost of staying or going
A war for home territory is the most expensive one to lose , but even though the American heartland is not directly at stake , there are still huge consequences to whether the U.S. is perceived as winning or losing in Iraq .
Like it or not , a number of significant countries in the region depend on the perception that America would block any threat to their peace and security .
A precipitate American withdrawal suggesting a lack of American commitment to the region or , worse , the perception that America had been defeated , could lead to a major regional realignment .
Most countries in the gulf would have to reconsider their security situation and choose either between rearmament ( including the acquisition of nuclear weapons ) or cooperation with Iran , which would be happy to fill the vacuum left by an American defeat or withdrawal .
This would ultimately cost us in ways far beyond the ability of dollars to measure .
On the other hand , an American success in Iraq could also change the course of history in the Middle East , where the U.S. has made huge investments in security over many decades .
A stable Iraqi government selected by its own people would be a first in the Arab world .
It would suggest that there is a third alternative to the current choice between repressive regimes and Islamic fundamentalism .
It may have been naive to think it would happen in one or two years , and the administration can probably be faulted for not changing its occupation strategy sooner , but the initial success of the U.S. surge in troop levels shows that the decision is not yet out of our hands .
Whether we win or lose will come down to our perseverance and our willingness to learn and adapt as a result of our mistakes .
It was former Secretary of State Colin Powell who cited the so - called Pottery Barn rule in warning President Bush about America 's commitment after the invasion : " You break it , you own it . "
Well , we own it .
Whether or not we like the decision to have invaded in March 2003 is immaterial now .
This is difficult for an economist who deals with figures all the time to admit , but when it comes to war , the dollar cost is hardly a major concern .
I am not a military expert .
It 's the military 's judgment that should determine whether to double our investment or take our losses and go home .
If our military leaders think we can ultimately prevail , we should stay .
If we ultimately cannot , we should leave .
It 's as simple as that .
This has been the case in all our wars .
World War II ultimately cost about 140 % of GDP .
Would FDR have thought , " Well , the war is worth it at 130 % of GDP , but not at 170 % " ?
In terms of the damage it did to the American economy and the American heartland , or simply in terms of the number of dead , the Civil War dwarfed all the others .
But Lincoln certainly never took a pencil to do a cost - benefit test .
Nor did John F. Kennedy when he said , " We will pay any price , bear any burden ... to assure the survival and the success of liberty . "
Had any of these leaders done that , they would have fallen into the trap that the economics profession is so often accused of :
They would know the price of everything and the value of nothing .

HOUSTON  Crude oil closed above $ 100 a barrel for the first time Tuesday , vaulting through a longstanding psychological barrier amid persistent concern about whether production can keep up with rising global demand .
The day ’s price rise of more than 4 percent capped a week - long run-up that began when President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela threatened to cut off oil exports to the United States over a legal struggle with Exxon Mobil .
Crude oil fell from a record $ 100.10 a barrel in New York on speculation that a U.S. Energy Department report will show stockpiles rose for a sixth week , according to Reuters .
Crude oil for March delivery dropped as much as 90 cents , or 0.9 percent , to $ 99.11 a barrel in after - hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Just as Mr. Chávez appeared to back off from his threats , an explosion at a Texas refinery on Monday reminded traders and hedge fund managers of the gasoline shortages and price increases that accompanied similar refinery failures last year .
Even though the Alon USA refinery at Big Spring , Tex. , was relatively small and American inventories are considered adequate , traders and hedge funds took the explosion as a buying signal .
“ With this credit crisis going on , everyone is on edge and the slightest disruption in crude oil or its products takes prices right up , ” said Michael Rose , director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
“ Prices are going to go higher before they go lower . ”
ATLANTA --
A severe storm ripped a hole in the roof of the Georgia Dome during the Southeastern Conference tournament Friday , delaying Mississippi State 's 69 - 67 overtime win over Alabama for more than an hour and postponing a game between Georgia and Kentucky .
As Mississippi State led 64-61 with 2:11 left in overtime , a loud blast was heard inside the dome .
The girders near the dome 's roof began to swing , and a gaping section of the north part of the roof was ripped open , dropping debris that included nuts and bolts .
Players and coaches from the Bulldogs and Crimson Tide were sent to the locker room , along with the coaches ' wives and children , and stadium officials began evacuating fans from the upper reaches of the stadium .
The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for the Atlanta area at 9:26 p.m. ET after radar indicated a storm capable of producing a tornado was about six miles west of Atlanta .
Tyler Williams , from Knoxville , Tenn. , said he was sitting in section 128 , six rows behind the home team 's bench .
" It sounded like a freight train , " Williams said .
" The rafters were swaying , and the roof of the dome was starting to ripple .
" It was a little frightening , to say the least . "
SEC officials said early Saturday that the Georgia - Kentucky game will be played at noon Saturday at Georgia Tech 's Alexander Memorial Coliseum .
The
winner of that game will have to return in the evening to face
Mississippi State in the semifinals .
The other semifinal , between No. 4 Tennessee and Arkansas , will be
played at 6 p.m. Saturday .
Television production crews moved their equipment late Friday night from the stadium to Alexander Memorial Coliseum .
The arena seats only 9,100 , so ticketing will be an issue , and it can't hold the 200 media members who potentially could cover the event .
Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie said late Friday that he did n't know whether the Wildcats would be playing Saturday .
He said the team was warming up to go on the court when it was told the game would n't be played .
Security personnel inspect the high seating area of the Georgia Dome in Atlanta late Friday night .

Gillispie was n't in favor of playing two games in one day if the Wildcats were to beat Georgia and advance to the semifinals , but he said he did n't think any coach would be in favor of that scenario , calling it unfair .
An NCAA official told ESPN.com by e-mail from Indianapolis that SEC commissioner Mike Slive , who is on the NCAA tournament selection committee , was monitoring the situation .
The tournament bracket must be done by 6 p.m. Sunday for the CBS selection show .
The NCAA official said it was too soon to talk about Plan B , what would be done if the SEC could n't provide an automatic qualifier by the time the bracket was announced .
The championship game is scheduled for Sunday afternoon on CBS .
Also , an NCAA official e-mailed ESPN.com and said the NCAA will plan Saturday morning for how the SEC situation will affect the selection , seeding and bracketing process .
Semifinalists Tennessee , Arkansas and Mississippi State all are likely to be in the NCAA field , but Kentucky needs the games to ensure a berth .
Georgia must win the tournament to earn a berth .
In addition , Tennessee is in contention for a No. 1 seed , so not playing games could affect its place in the seeding .
SEC spokesman Charles Bloom said SEC officials spent time Friday assessing whether the games could be played in the Georgia Dome because of the damage caused by the storm .
With more bad weather expected in the area early Saturday morning , it 's expected the dome could sustain even more damage .
" That 's one of the issues we 're talking about , whether we can still be in the building , " Bloom said .
" There 's more bad weather coming , and we 're not sure what those [ storm ] cells will bring . "
Meanwhile , all other weekend events at the Georgia Dome , Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia World Congress Center have been cancelled .
Those include the Atlanta Home Show , the Hinman Dental Society of Atlanta 's annual Hinman Dental Meeting , the Red Bull Illume exhibit of sports and action photography , and several private events .
As the Mississippi State - Alabama game resumed after a 63 - minute delay Friday night , long metal panels littered the parking lot and lawns on the north side of the dome .
Full - grown trees lay uprooted , and 30 - foot traffic signs that direct patrons where to park were turned over .
Eddie Smith , a bus driver who was shuttling media members from the dome to a downtown hotel , said the bus parked in front of him in a Georgia Dome parking lot began rocking back and forth and nearly tipped over during the storm .
" It blew up the hatches on top of the bus , " he said .
" I thought it was going to tip over . "
With crews on hand to fix downed power poles across the street , security personnel began to usher people back inside around 10:20 p.m. as another storm approached .
Next door , at the Georgia World Congress Center , where an ROTC ball hosting 11 high schools was underway ,
windows were blown out .
Several girls walked without shoes , their feet bleeding .
At the adjoining Philips Arena , the Atlanta Hawks were able to finish their 7:30 p.m. NBA game against the Los Angeles Clippers , a 117- 93 win for Atlanta .

Stock trading represents the growth and shrinkage of a company ’s performance .
It is affected by numerous factors within geopolitics , production output , supply and demand and more , but is also affected by the emotional response of the trader and investor .
Technical stock market trades
Some would say that technical trading is purely based in the science of mathematics , where every single decision is based on inventory , order flow , and risk / reward .
Price movement depends on supply and demand at each price level .
Traders will know from their research what a key supply level is for the company in which they hold stocks .
Institutions / banks will know when to sell at prices where the odds have been calculated to show the price is likely to fall .
They will also have calculations that show the time a price spends at a level , quantifying the balance supply and demand at any given point .
When looking for key support and resistance levels these too can be shown in charts .
Technical trading using science in mathematical equations , theories and science hypotheses to help predict future developments for a particular company chart .
Studying the history of the company ’s developments , mathematical models can be established for futures trading .
As an example , the Elliot wave chart helps establish a staircase pattern .
There are various charts that help traders , all with their own purpose .
Stock traders often resort to science , calculations and predictions based on several charts and not just one .
As an example , information seen in a candlestick charts will help the trader understand the resistance points and in turn help in determining the point where the share value can be expected to rise .
Charts formations like “ death cross , ” “ cup and handle , ” “ dragonfly dojo ” and “ falling knife ” may not sound like science , but behavioural finance is unearthing growing evidence that shows technical analysts that plotting stock prices visually leads to better investing decision - making .
Market Dynamics
Studies of market dynamics , while still in their infancy , have already demonstrated an ability to understand many aspects of financial markets , Using tools of neuroscience and behavioural studies it can be shown that markets are ruled primarily by emotions , challenging the long - held view that they price stocks based on information alone .
Yet , other researchers warn against basing a stock market purchase on particular charts , since research shows people often see patterns that are not there , or that others do not see in the same way .
Despite the difference of opinion , charts present information visually that helps counteract information overload and complexity , enabling users to interactively discover information from large information sets to improve the financial decision - making processes .
When creating charts to assist in decision making it is vital to use the same metrics consistently .
Watching moving averages is the basic concept of charts .
When a stock moves out of its trading range , it suggests movement , up or down .
What is most important is not to become carried away with charts .
Evaluation of the fundamentals is necessary as they are what supports everything .
Fundamental stock market trades
Should a Chief Executive Officer of a company unexpectedly resign , or even rumoured to be resigning , or when a plant is taken out of production due to accident or ‘ acts of God ’ , it is usual for the news to spread fast and the stock index of the company usually drops by several points .
This fall is due to loss of confidence in the company by investors and traders , leading to the sale of company stocks and resulting in the reduced index value in the market .
A company ’s share value can see a significant change on any given day for a number of reasons .
Stock traders have to be vigilant about these various factors when dealing with a particular company ’s shares , needing to monitor the market performance as well including any active rumours .
The basis for fundamental trading strategies in these cases do not involve much mathematical calculations , based more on the science of psychology giving traders and investors the opportunity to gamble which stock will rise and which one will fall .
Top money makers in the markets must have some type of common strategy whether it be science of not .
Investors have been inventing new formulas and ways to beat the market since the market was invented .
New developments are being made and new strategies are being discovered to work .
It can be agreed there is , as yet , no one single formula or numerical sequence is required to be successful in the market .
There is the need to have risk taking skills and the ability to see into companies and their plans .
Technical analysis is just one tool to use along with a full view of a company ’s earnings and business fundamentals .
Current formulas and strategies will not suit every situation , but can be chosen wisely .

A convicted criminal has moved in with a married couple against their wishes after giving their address in court as his home .
Shane Sims , 19 , has spent the last few days living with Brenda and Robert Cole after he was sentenced to a week 's curfew for breaching a supervision order .
But the couple claim the first they knew about it was when Sims , a friend of their daughter , moved in on Thursday - followed by security contractors who put a box in a bedroom to monitor his movements with an ankle tag .
Scroll down for more ...
Sims ' tag keeps him indoors between 7 pm and 7 am much to the horror of the Coles , who both have learning difficulties .
Mrs Cole , 47 , said : " It 's turned our lives upside down .
" He 's taken over the whole place .
He sprawls across the sofa and he 's always in the bathroom when you need it .
" It 's an absolute disgrace .
They 've let a criminal come into our home and there is nothing we can do about it .
" How can he get away with giving false details ?
Can crooks pick anywhere they like and just move in ?
Who needs to break into a house when the courts will do it all for you ?
" When the men turned up and installed the tag box , I thought it was some kind of a joke .
I told them there had been a mistake but they just said it was n't their problem . "
Sims appeared before magistrates last Thursday where he admitted breaching a two - year supervision order imposed for assault .
Scroll down for more ...
He gave the Coles ' Bristol address as his bail address but the Probation Service did not verify it .
Sims claims he was told he could stay by the Coles ' 16 - year - old daughter Tanya after he fell out with his father .
He allegedly told Mrs Cole : " I 'm staying here until the tag 's off .
There 's f**k all you can do about it .
The courts have told me to . "
The court said it was looking into the situation but police said they could not act without a court warrant .
Sims said : " I said ' I 'll be gone before Christmas ' and I will be .
I can't see what the problem is .
They keep changing their minds .
I do n't even want to be here . "
A spokeswoman for South Gloucestershire Council , whose social workers care for Mr and Mrs Cole , said : " We are seeking legal advice and doing all we can to resolve the situation . "
Religious Freedom Day , 2008 ; By the President of the United States of America -- A Proclamation
Contact : White House , Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2580
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia , Jan. 14 / Standard Newswire / --
The following is a proclamation released by the White House :
Thomas Jefferson counted the freedom of worship as one of America 's greatest blessings .
He said it was " a liberty deemed in other countries incompatible with good government , and yet proved by our experience to be its best support . "
On Religious Freedom Day , we celebrate the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom .
The freedom to worship according to one 's conscience is one of our Nation 's most cherished values .
It is the first protection offered in the Bill of Rights : that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
In America , people of different faiths can live together united in peace , tolerance , and humility .
We are committed to the proposition that as equal citizens of the United States of America , all are free to worship as they choose .
In an era during which an unprecedented number of nations have embraced individual freedom , we have also witnessed the stubborn endurance of religious repression .
Religious freedom belongs not to any one nation , but to the world , and my Administration continues to support freedom of worship at home and abroad .
On Religious Freedom Day and throughout the year , we recognize the importance of religious freedom and the vital role it plays in spreading liberty and ensuring human dignity .
NOW , THEREFORE , I , GEORGE W. BUSH , President of the United States of America , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States , do hereby proclaim January 16 , 2008 , as Religious Freedom Day .
I call on all Americans to reflect on the great blessing of religious liberty , endeavor to preserve this freedom for future generations , and commemorate this day with appropriate events and activities .
IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of January , in the year of our Lord two thousand eight , and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty - second .
GEORGE W. BUSH

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor Co F.N is due to announce its agreement to sell its luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover to India 's Tata Motors Ltd TAMO .
BO for about $ 2 billion on Wednesday , the Financial Times said on Monday .
The sale will include a pledge by Ford to contribute to the pension fund for workers at Jaguar and Land Rover and a commitment by Tata to continue buying engines from Ford , the Financial Times said in the story posted on its Web site .
A spokesman for Ford Europe was not immediately available .
A Tata representative could not be immediately reached .
Sources close to the deal told Reuters last week that Ford was expected to announce the sale of the British luxury brands this week , just ahead of Ford ’s target of closing the deal by the end of the first quarter .
Tata is launching a $ 3 billion syndicated loan to fund its purchase of the Jaguar and Land Rover .
Ford , which lost $ 2.7 billion in 2007 and $ 12.6 billion in 2006 , is spinning off Jaguar and Land Rover to focus on turning around its loss - making operations in North America .
Ford acquired Land Rover from German carmaker BMW in 2000 .
It bought Jaguar in 1989 .
Ford spun off Aston Martin for $ 925 million last March as it began to disband its stable of European luxury brands .

A collaboration of over 50 astronomers , The IPHAS consortium , led from the UK , with partners in Europe , USA , Australia , has released today ( 10th December 2007 ) the first comprehensive optical digital survey of our own Milky Way .
Conducted by looking at light emitted by hydrogen ions , using the Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma , the survey contains stunning red images of nebulae and stars .
The data is described in a paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
To date , the IPHAS survey includes some 200 million unique objects in the newly released catalogue .
This immense resource will foster studies that can be at once both comprehensive and subtle , of the stellar demographics of the Milky Way and of its three - dimensional structure .
This is an image of the centre of the Rosette Nebula , as imaged in Hydrogen alpha emission in the IPHAS survey .
The centre of this HII region , where the exciting star cluster ( NGC 2244 ) is located , lies at the middle - bottom of this image ( N is to the left , and E down ) .
The longer dimension in this image is approximately 30 arcminutes .
( credits : Nick Wright , University College London ) Image taken using the Isaac Newton Telescope .
Professor Janet Drew of the University of Hertfordshire said “ Using the distinctive Hydrogen marker we are able to look at some of the least understood stars in the Galaxy – those at the early and very late stages of their life cycles .
These represent less than one in a thousand stars , so the IPHAS data will greatly improve our picture of stellar evolution . ”
IPHAS is embracing a recent change in the way astronomers share data .
As well as being available through traditional web access it is also being published through a Virtual Observatory interface , where it can automatically be cross-referenced with other relevant data catalogues .
Dr Nic Walton of the University of Cambridge said “ Using the standard Virtual Observatory interface is a very effective way of exploiting the IPHAS survey data .
This is a substantial and significant survey , which aims to eventually contain 7-800 million objects .
Access through the AstroGrid Virtual Observatory opens up a full range of analysis options and should allow astronomers to make greater use of the information .
IPHAS is the largest dataset published primarily through Virtual Observatory interfaces to date , and as such heralds the future of survey data mining . ”
This initial data release is of observations of the Northern Plane of the Milky Way ( the star filled section ) that cover 1600 sq deg , in two broadband colours , and a narrow band filter sensitive to the emission of Hydrogen in the red part of the spectrum ( H - alpha emission ) .
The image resolution is high enough to permit the detection of individual stars exhibiting H - alpha emission , in addition to the diffuse gas that makes up the often - beautiful glowing nebulae that lower spatial resolution surveys have made known to us before .
The IPHAS database is already revealing a wealth of new science .
For example , IPHAS team members from the University of Southampton , have led an effort to extract and catalogue the brighter H - alpha emission line stars revealed so far by the survey .
This list of nearly 5000 objects is already the longest single list of its kind .
The distribution of these special objects , across the northern sky , traces ' hot spots ' of recently formed stars in our Galaxy much more convincingly than has been possible hitherto .
The IPHAS survey will eventually be extended to cover the entire galactic plane of our galaxy , with a coverage approaching 4000 square degrees ( for comparison , the moon on the sky as seen from Earth covers ~ 0.1 square degrees ) .
One of the most important lessons they teach in business school is to ‘ ignore sunk costs ’ .
It does n’t matter how much time or money or effort you ’ve invested in something , if that project no longer makes economic sense , you should stop .
And in The Dip , I talk about the powerful benefits of quitting .
Which leads to an interesting marketing question that does n’t have a lot to do with your political views and a lot to do with your take on sunk costs and brand quality : Should Hillary Clinton quit ?
Certainly , there are a lot of sunk costs .
Years of effort , dues paid , heartaches endured .
This might be her best window of opportunity , after all .
And yet , all of these sunk costs should be completely irrelevant to the decision .
For every brand and for every person , yesterday is irretrievably gone and tomorrow is worth a great deal .
Last week , my company switched providers of an expensive commodity .
The company we had been with realized we were moving on and moved into high gear to keep the account .
At one point , it was clear that they could have gone into war room - mode , denigrating our decision , criticizing the new company and scorching the earth .
I watched the gears turn , though , and saw them take a different path .
Here ’s the math as I see it for brand Hillary :
The only chance she has to win is to burn down other brands , violate protocol , push harder than many think appropriate .
She has to change her brand to achieve her goal .
Not only that , but she has to risk the entire Party at the same time .
If she does manage to win the nomination , she will be pilloried by the right ( the very same Rush that endorsed her in Texas ) .
They ’re just waiting for the chance .
The new brand , the one that it would take to succeed at this stage , almost guarantees she does n’t succeed at the next .
And the alternative ?
The alternative is to quit .
To become a statesman .
A respected power broker .
The alternative is to be the trusted advisor , the person who gave up one dream to realize a bigger one , and to build a brand and a lifestyle with long - term leverage .
That company we switched from last week ?
Instead of ruining our relationship and criticizing our judgment , they kept the door open .
They congratulated us on our growth and earned the right to work with us again one day .
For a long time , we ’ve created a myth in our culture that it ’s worth any price to reach your goal , especially if your ego tells you that you ’re the best solution .
We ’ve created legends of people and organizations that pursued transformative long shots to achieve great results .
I need to be really clear : pushing through the Dip and becoming the best in the world at what you do is in fact the key to success .
But ( and it ’s a big but ) , if you ’re required to become someone you ’re not , or required to mutate your brand into one that ’s ultimately a failure in order to do so , you ’re way better off quitting instead .
— A Lee County man will be monitored by a Global Positioning System device for the rest of his life .
Murnice Chandler was convicted on 21 counts of indecent liberties with a child and was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison .
A law passed last year created the GPS program to track sex offenders , like Chandler .
With old house - arrest bracelets , officers could only tell if an offender left the home .
With GPS , they know where the person is at all times .
Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ordered Chandler to be tracked by GPS .
The judge would not comment on the case , but said the law makes the punishment automatic for certain sex offenders .
" That person is determined to be a recidivist , a sexually violent predator or to have committed an aggravated offense .
Those are the three main categories , " Baddour said .
Hannah Rowland , an administrator for the GPS program at the North Carolina Department of Correction , said there are 124 offenders wearing GPS devices .
Among those , 40 will be wearing them for life , she said .
The device " allows us to know their whereabouts if needed , " Rowland said .
Equipment carried at the ankle and waist communicates with satellites to give an offender 's position .
Probation officers receive updates on computer through cell phone signals .
They get alerts when an offender goes where he or she is not supposed to go .
The system costs about $ 8.30 a day for each offender .
It takes only a couple of correctional officers to track the GPS wearers across the state .
The GPS system does have trouble updating when offenders live in bad cell phone signal areas .
In those cases , the equipment sends a report once a day when it is plugged in to charge its batteries .
On a morning that should by rights have been frozen in time as a moment of pure pageantry , with military marching bands , pipers trucked out in tricorn hats and powdered wigs , and visiting royalty , one can count on George Bush .
The president yesterday once again demonstrated his gift for the gaffe , injecting an unintended sense of levity into the White House welcome for the Queen .
In his speech on the south lawn of the White House , he noted that the Queen had made repeated visits to the US during her reign , including celebrations to mark the country 's 200th anniversary .
" The American people are proud to welcome Your Majesty back to the United States , a nation you 've come to know very well , " Bush said .
" After all , you 've dined with 10 US presidents .
You helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in 17 - in 1976 . "
As the laughter rippled through the crowd of 7,000 invited guests corralled behind red , white and blue bunting , Mr Bush tried to make light of his slip .
He shot a quick look at the Queen , and said : " You gave me a look that only a mother could give a child . "
But by then , Mr Bush 's discomfort with the pageantry that a royal visit entails was an open secret .
His wife , Laura Bush , told ABC television yesterday morning that she and the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , had to use all their persuasive powers to coax him into a white tie for the state banquet scheduled later yesterday .
It was to be the first white - tie event of his administration .
" I do n't know how thrilled he was about this - but , of course , when you 're hosting the Queen of England , of course you want to have it be white tie , " Mrs Bush said .
" This is the perfect occasion for it - and he was a very good sport . "
However , that sense of sportsmanship was not very evident at the White House yesterday morning when Mr Bush appeared to treat the visit by the Queen like that of any world leader , launching into a boiler plate address on the war on terror .
He praised Britain 's historic contributions such as the Magna Carta in equal measure to its contribution in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Today our two nations are defending liberty against tyranny and terror .
We 're resisting those who murder the innocent to advance a hateful ideology , whether they kill in New York or London or Kabul or Baghdad , " he said .
Mr Bush went on to pay tribute to the monarch 's personal contribution in the war on terror .
" Your Majesty , I appreciate your leadership during these times of danger and decision , " the president said .
" You 've spoken out against extremism and terror .
You 've encouraged religious tolerance and reconciliation .
You have honored those returning from battle and comforted the families of the fallen . "
It was impossible to see the Queen 's reaction from beneath her black and white hat , but the tone of her brief comments were in sharp contrast to those from Mr Bush .
" A state visit provides us with a brief opportunity to step back from our current preoccupations to reflect on the very essence of our relationship , " the Queen said .
" It is the moment to take stock of our present friendship , rightly taking pleasure from its strengths while never taking these for granted .
And it is the time to look forward , jointly renewing our commitment to a more prosperous , safer and freer world . "
With a wave from the portico of the White House , the Queen and Mr Bush then retreated inside the White House for a lunch of baby sea bass followed by raspberry meringue , and chocolate sorbet .
But the focus was really on the state banquet later .
The White House reportedly has been agog with preparations for the event , at which some 134 invited guests will dine on gold - trimmed china , and hear a performance from the violin virtuoso , Itzhak Perlman .
Mrs Bush has been ebulliant about the prospect .
For Mr Bush , however , it 's a different story .
He likes to dine on Tex - Mex food and be in bed by 10 pm .
Yesterday morning 's remark was not his first slip in front of the Queen .
When she visited the White House in 1991 during his father 's presidency , he said he was the black sheep of the Bush family .
He then asked : " Who 's yours ? "
The Queen did not reply .
That awkward moment may well have been weighing on his mind in the run-up to last night 's encounter .
Avevo incontrato Ivan Rios , il comandante delle FARC appena ucciso dalla sua guardia del corpo nei pressi della frontiera tra le province di Caldas e di Antioquia , nel febbraio 2001 , al momento della mia inchiesta sulle guerre dimenticate .
La stampa dice che aveva 40 anni.
A quanto ricordo , ne aveva un po ’ di più .
Ma era , senza dubbio , il più giovane dei sette " segretari " che formavano la stato maggiore dell ’Organizzazione .
Era anche il più colto , forse il più intelligente – il solo che , ad ogni modo , prima di darsi alla macchia , e quando ancora si chiamava Manuel Munoz Ortiz , avesse fatto , a Medellin , degli studi universitari di un certo livello , tanto che il Numero Uno - il vecchio capo di cui si conosce appena il viso , ed appena appena il nome , soprannominato " Tirofijo " , cioè " Tiro preciso " - ne fece un dei consiglieri più ascoltati e , come diceva un altro grande terrorista ( Bin Laden ) di un altro brillante intellettuale ( Omar Sheikh ) , una sorta di " figlio adottivo " .
Lo rivedo , nel suo bunker di Los Pozos , nel cuore della foresta amazzonica , mentre mi racconta il concorso di circostanze che lo avevano condotto , giovane e dotto marxista , nutrito al latte del castrismo , fine lettore dei Francesi Althusser e Bettelheim , ad unirsi ad una delle guerriglie più sanguinose del pianeta .
Lo rivedo , molto calmo , molto posato , molto " assassino sensibile " alla Camus - ma un assassino sensibile che avrebbe appreso , con il tempo , a superare i suoi stati d’animo ; un Kaliayev i cui anni di solitudine , di isolamento in una giungla fuori dal mondo , anni di paranoia e di tenebre , avrebbero trasformato in uno Stepan ancora più furioso , più ossesso , più spregiudicato e determinato – lo rivedo , piccola figura emaciata , coi capelli ben sistemati , barba nera ad incorniciargli il viso impeccabilmente curata e tono da professore intento a scomporre un’equazione complicatissima , spiegarmi , senza imbarazzo alcuno , la " profonda giustizia " della strategia dei sequestri mirati .
Lo sento , in un altro momento , mentre ci incamminiamo verso l’aeroporto di campagna dove è annunciato l’arrivo di Camilo Gomes , l’alto - commissario per la Pace del presidente colombiano , dar prova di alta dialettica al fine di convincermi che la cultura della coca , l’escavazione e la militarizzazione dei laboratori clandestini in cui verrà distillata , il suo traffico , la sua massiccia commercializzazione in direzione delle metropoli dell ’impero , sono una forma di resistenza all ’oppressione , un mezzo di difesa dei poveri contadini schiacciati dal grande capitale , una risposta politicamente corretta al deterioramento voluto dai trust americani dei termini di scambio tra il Nord e il Sud ... Raramente nella mia vita ho provato , fino a quel punto , la sensazione di una razionalità divenuta folle .
Mai , come allora , ho toccato con dito questa degenerazione dell ’ Ideologia divenuta l’alibi di ghiaccio di un gangsterismo puro .
Oggi , quell ’ uomo è morto .
Di quel viso illuminato , talvolta , da un sorriso furtivo , un po ’ demente e che metteva del tempo a cancellarsi , non resta che la maschera mortuaria che sporge dalla plastica nera in cui hanno avvolto il cadavere , oggi mostrata dalla stampa colombiana .
Di quei gesti raffinati che mi indicavano , alle sue spalle , sulla malridotta carta appesa al muro del bunker , le zone delle province di Huila e di Putumayo dove i " gringos " riversavano , stando a quando diceva , agenti chimici defoglianti tipo quelli usati in Vietnam , non resta che quella mano mozzata consegnata , insieme al suo passaporto e al suo computer portatile , da Rojas , il guerrigliero che lo ha abbattuto , al comandante della caserma di San Mateo che li accerchiava da settimane .
E la verità è che io oscillo , stamattina , tra due , o piuttosto tre , sentimenti .
Una certa emozione – perché non confessarlo ?
– al ricordo di quello spirito deviato , di quell ’intelligenza sprecata e che , persino lì , in quella giornata passata a sentirlo dispiegare sofismi insopportabili , non era priva di un oscuro fascino .
Una vera soddisfazione – bisogna dire anche questo , e dirlo con fermezza – all ’idea che questa gang , quest ’associazione mafiosa che sono divenute le FARC , vola di disfatta in disfatta , e che la morte di Rios - che segue così da vicino quella del primo marzo di Raul Reyes - possa significare , forse , infine , l’avvicinarsi della capitolazione tanto attesa .
E poi – si tratta , naturalmente , dell ’essenziale – più che un pensiero direi un orrore all ’idea di quale destino , per le ore o per i giorni a venire , possa spettare agli ostaggi in generale e ad Ingrid Betancourt in particolare : perché chi può dire come reagiranno queste bestie feroci , questi selvatici cani da guerra , quando si sentiranno definitivamente con le spalle al muro ?
e come , malgrado l’orrore , malgrado i crimini , malgrado l’imprescrittibile colpa che sono questi anni di terrorismo cieco , non pregare che si apra un ultimo , ultimissimo , dialogo – quello che permetterà che siano risparmiati gli innocenti ?

SD West 2008
For the second year in a row organizers at the Software Development Conference & Expo West felt the super sessions hosted by C++ legends Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter were worth some ink on the event agenda .
" There was a time in the late 1990s and early 2000s when they simply stopped advertising C++ sessions at this conference , " Sutter told attendees .
" And yet they found a curious thing : every year for four years , C++ was the strongest track at the show .
With zero advertising !
That says something about the market .
That says that there are problems that C++ is solving . "
The duo offered the C++ crowd day - long sessions at SD West .
In fact , a session presented last year ( Concepts and generic programming in C++0 x " ) was back by popular demand , alongside an additional day of new material covering the design and evolution of the grandpappy of object - oriented programming languages .
Sutter is the author of several books on software development , a lead architect at Microsoft , chair of the ISO C++ standards committee , and coiner of the phrase " concurrency revolution . "
Stroustrup is also an author , a professor of computer science at the Texas A&M University 's college of engineering , and a research fellow at AT&T Labs .
Of course , the Danish computer scientist is best known as the creator and original implementer of C ++.
Stroustrup does n't like to hear his brainchild referred to as an object - oriented programming ( OOP ) language , though he allowed that its main contribution was to make OOP mainstream .
" Before C++ , 99.9 per cent of programmers never even heard of it OOP , " he said during a post- session Q&A .
" Those who'd heard of it believed that it was only for slow graphics written by geniuses . "
Still , he 'd rather we call it a " multi- paradigm programming language . "
" We were trying to do something that had n't been done when we started , " he said .
" We wanted this language to be useful in the hands of average programmers , and the writing of new concepts to be possible by fairly ordinary good programmers .
We thought you should n't have to be a genius to use it . "
Stroustrup combined features of C with features of Simula to create a general - purpose programming language that supports data abstraction and object - orientation .
In 1984 he named it C ++.
The language has since been used to build some " interesting things , " Stroustrup pointed out , including systems on the Mars Rovers , tools for the Human Genome project , the Google search engine , and the software systems running most of the world 's windmills .
C++ is non-proprietary and supported on more platforms than any other language but C , Stroustrup observed .
" If you do n't want to be owned by your vendor , " he said .
" Write your code with C ++. "
How many C++ programmers are actually doing that these days ?
Between 1980 and 1991 , the number of C++ coders doubled every seven and a half months , Stroustrup estimated .
That growth rate was unsustainable , he said .
Extrapolating from compiler sales , book sales , workloads of consultants , and other statistics , he estimates that the number is now growing at about five to ten per cent per year .
Analysts at IDS estimate that in 2004 there were approximately six million programmers coding with C++.
GOP lawmaker apologizes for calling unwed teen parents ' sluts '

A Republican state representative in Colorado has apologized for calling unmarried teenage parents " sluts . "
Larry Liston of Colorado Springs was talking at a GOP caucus meeting about teenagers who have babies and expect the government to support them .
" In my parents ' day and age , they were sent away , they were shunned , they were called what they are , " Liston told the caucus .
" There was at least a sense of shame . "
He then used the word " slut , " adding , " I do n't mean just the women .
I mean the men , too . "
Rep. Stella Garza - Hicks , who was at the meeting , said she was " disturbed ' and " offended " by Liston 's use of the word .
Other Republican women in the Colorado House of Representatives also called it inappropriate .
" A slut is a whore , that 's the same word , " one former unwed mother told a local news channel .
" I 'm a survivor , I made it .
I raised my children , I was a good mother .
...
He needs to talk to some young women , he needs to have some compassion . "
" I regret using the word , " Liston says now .
" It was an inadvertent comment . "

President George Bush expressed no regret today in a bullish speech to mark the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion in which he described the war as noble , necessary and just and boasted that violence has been significantly reduced and al - Qaida 's off - shoot in the country defeated .
With polls showing a clear majority of Americans opposed to the war , Bush was unrepentant and adamant US forces will remain in the country : " Five years into this battle , there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting , whether the fight is worth winning , and whether we can win it .
" The answers are clear to me : removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision - and this is a fight Americans must win . "
The war has left tens of thousands dead , cost hundreds of millions of dollars and has been blamed for creating fresh instability in the Middle East .
Speaking to a small gathering of troops in the Pentagon , he claimed his decision in January last year to expand the number of US troops in Iraq from 124,000 to 154,000 , the surge strategy , has brought a significant drop in violence and " opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror " .
Having already indicated that the number of US troops will drop to about 140,000 in the summer , he hinted he is not planning any further withdrawals when the US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , returns to Washington to review progress next month .
There were small protests throughout Washington today but a promised mass demonstration failed to materialise .
Bush 's comments amounted to his most upbeat assessment of the Iraq war since his famous ' mission accomplished ' speech on a US aircraft carrier in May 2003 .
Since then , Iraq has been convulsed by Sunni and Shia Muslim insurgencies against the US - led coalition and vicious sectarian tit - for - tat killings .
The Iraq Body Count group , in a survey on behalf of the Guardian that looked at the death toll province by province , today put the number of civilian deaths at 89,322 .
These are based on reported deaths , as opposed to other surveys that offer estimates and put the toll much higher , between 600,000 to 1 million .
The number of US military killed stands at 3,990 , and the British toll at 175 .
Bush made no mention today of the failure to find Saddam Hussein 's alleged weapons of massive destruction , the stated reason for war , but returned to the theme , warning that that a hasty US withdrawal from Iraq could lead to an emboldened al - Qaida with access to Iraq 's oil resources pursuing " its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destructions to attack America and other free nations " .
The cost of the war is estimated at between half a trillion dollars to three trillion .
Bush , in his speech , claimed the latter figure was exaggerated , but did not provide a figure of his own .
Bush launched the war with a surprise air strike aimed at taking out Saddam Hussein but the Iraqi president had left the location .
The invasion was a time of high confidence in the White House , with the hawks and neo-conservatives certain that their project of establishing Iraq as a model of democracy in the Arab world would prevail .
With less than a year left in office , Bush is a largely isolated figure .
Most of the hawks and neo-conservatives who pressed him to go to war , such as the then defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz , have gone .
The fragile multi-national coalition Bush put together has also largely disappeared , with countries having either abandoned the war or left token forces behind .
In spite of continuing bombings and the criss - crossing of Baghdad with high cement walls that have left communities cut off , there is some evidence to support Bush 's claim that the surge strategy is working , with the US reporting the number of attacks on its forces down from 1,580 a week in June last year to about 570 now .
Sectarian violence is also reported by the US administration to be down .
Bush today attributed this not just to the deployment of more US troops but the alliance of US and Iraqi forces with local tribal and community leaders throughout the country against al - Qaida , whose Iraqi off - shoot has been responsible for some of the most gruesome atrocities .
Bush is preparing to leave the problem to his successor , who will take office in January next year .
The Republican candidate , John McCain , who visited Iraq this week and has said the US would maintain a military presence in Iraq for 100 years if need be , said today : " America and our allies stand on the precipice of winning a major victory against radical Islamic extremism . "
Both the Democratic candidates , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , have promised to withdraw troops .
Obama has said all US combat troops would be out by the end of next year while Clinton has said troop withdrawals would begin within 60 days of her becoming president .
" We can not win their civil war .
There is no military solution , " she said today .
In words addressed to Obama and Clinton , Bush said : " The successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable - yet some in Washington still call for retreat .
War critics can no longer credibly argue that we are losing in Iraq . "
He warned that leaving Iraq prematurely would allow al - Qaida to grow in strength inside its borders .
It would also embolden Iran in its bid to secure a nuclear weapon capability .
And , in a new argument reflecting US and world concern over impending recession , it would threaten the world economy .
" If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq , the violence that is now declining would accelerate - and Iraq could descend into chaos .
Al - Qaida would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones - fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq 's borders , with serious consequences to the world economy , " he said .

There is a certain truth to Greenspun 's tenth law of programming .
A Python project I was developing at work has slowly mutated into a compiler for a programming language without me planning it that way .
Usually ( I assume ) compilers parse their input and construct an AST which is passed to the compiler proper .
My code did n't have an AST , just a bunch of lambdas .
I realised that I 'd actually come across a real world example of what Wadler was talking about in Recursive Types for Free !
In Haskell , the foldr function reduces a list using a binary function and some initial value .
Suppose the function is called a and the initial value is b .
Take a list , for example [ 1,2,3 ] .
Now write it without using list notation , directly in terms of its constructors .
Ie. 1:( 2:( 3 : [ ] ) ) .
foldr replaces ( :) by a and [ ] by b .
So this becomes a ( 1 , a( 2, a( 3 , b ) ) ) .
The best known example is a= (+ ) and b = 0 so we get 1+2+3+0 and hence the sum of the values in the list .
Here is how we 'd use foldr in Haskell :
The interesting thing is that anything you might want to know about a ( finite ) list can be extracted using foldr .
There is a sense in which it the universal function on lists and all other functions can be factored through it .
For example , we can implement head and tail as followsSo if x is a list , \a b -> foldr a b x tells you everything you could want to know about the list .
In other words , you can completely replace the list itself with functions like this .
In fact , we can replace the list constructors with functions that build such functions :
We can use nil and cons just like [ ] and ( : ) .
In fact , given an element defined byWe can convert it to a conventional list viaSo foldr embeds a list as a function .
We can write the same thing in Python .
( Note that Python already has a variation of foldr , called reduce . )
It 's surprisingly easy to implement cons and nil in Python too : Folds can be generalised to any recursive type , not just lists .
( Stricly speaking I mean recursive rather than corecursive types .
Folds are n't appropriate for infinite structures . )
Note how for lists , foldr takes two arguments besides the list : a two argument function and a zero argument function .
Applying a fold simply replaces the list constructors ( :) and [ ] with these functions .
Generalised folds do something similar : each constructor gives rise to an argument to the fold and when the fold is evaluated , each constructor is replaced with the appropriate function .
Here 's an example : Now consider a simple expression type in Haskell : This is a recursive type so it has a generalised fold associated with it .
This fold will take three arguments , one for each of X , Const and Binop , and each one will take the same number of arguments as the constructor .
Here it is : efold simply replaces each constructor with an application of the matching function recursively through the entire Expr .
Anything you might want to do to an Expr can be done using efold , and many things you might naturally want to do with an Expr are particularly easy to write using it .
Here the functions to ( 1 ) evaluate the expression for X equal to some Int , and ( 2 ) to determine whether or not an expression is free of references to X : Now we can do the same thing we did above , replace the Expr structure with its corresponding fold .
And again , I 'm implementing it in Python rather than Haskell : So we have translated the Haskell algebraic type Expr into functional expressions in Python .
Here are some examples of their use : Evaluating X , 2 and X+2 at X=2 : Testing whether 10 - 2 and X ( ) + 2 are free of references to X ( ) : You can even implement a version in a blend of functional and OO style : Some final comments :
This can sometimes be an inefficient style of programming , especially so in a strict language .
Look again at tail for the cons / nil lists .
But many uses are quite efficient , and folds capture a very common design pattern .
When I wrote this post a while back I left out mention of what the main point of the paper was .
This post fixes that .
Wadler 's paper also describes a dual version of this for codata such as streams .
But as far as I understand it 's not very interesting .
It 's interesting that theory about static types has something to say about programming in a dynamically typed programming language .
Just so you know , my work project does n't look anything like the code above .
Oh ... and I guess you could say this was a form of the visitor pattern .
Ugh .
It 's hideously complicated in C ++ . " " "

If the dreaded MSM ( mainstream media ) is a big , bad oligarchy of elitist J - school grads who want nothing better than to tell the rest of us how to think , then the web , the blogosphere , and the rise of user - generated content have been seen as a way around the filter .
In a world where publishing is cheap or free , millions of unique voices will present a far greater variety of news and opinion .
" They " ca n't censor " us " now !
But a funny thing happened on the way to the new media revolution ; it got taken over by old media .
While the Internet is home to a staggering diversity of voices , most people still get their online news from established , old - media players .
The Project for Excellence in Journalism has just released a report on the state of the news media in 2008 , and it finds that top online news destinations command an even greater percentage of readers than than do the top offline news destinations .
" Even with so many news sources , more people now consume what old - media newsrooms produce , particularly from print , than before , " says the report .
" Online , for instance , the top 10 news web sites , drawing mostly from old brands , are more of an oligarchy , commanding a larger share of audience than they did in the legacy media .
The verdict on citizen media for now suggests limitations . "
In addition , bloggers do n't tend to be the voice of the people ; instead , the report notes that the most - read blogs tend to be produced by people " with even more elite backgrounds than journalists . "
That 's not to say that the web has n't changed the newsroom ; it has .
The report notes two key changes that news organizations had to make as they shifted their operations online .
First , news is n't a " finished product " anymore .
Constant updates to stories and to websites throughout the day are now the rule .
In addition , readers have become increasingly savvy about sources , and they no longer are willing to take a journalist 's statements on their own merit .
Links , once used only by bloggers to document sources and offer background , have gradually found their way into the traditional newsroom .
As the report puts it , " a news organization and a news web site are no longer final destinations . "
But no matter the destination , the basic stories are fairly limited .
A survey of news coverage from 2007 showed that more than a quarter of all news stories dealt with the Iraq war and the 2008 elections .
Education , religion , race , welfare , abortion , and other topics each generated less than one percent of all stories .
This is n't necessarily helped by the rise of cable talk shows , the strength of talk radio , or even bloggers , since most of these outlets have few or no reporting resources and instead devote their energies to rehashing the biggest ( and most controversial ) stories of the day .
Online news does stand out from more traditional sources by having a stronger international focus .
25 percent of the stories studied on major new web sites dealt with " foreign affairs that did not involve the US , " a number that is six times higher than cable news and four times higher than nightly TV news .
So who 's winning the online news war ?
Yahoo News MSNBC CNN AOL News New York Times Gannett ABC News Google News USA Today CBS News
While it 's generally a list of the usual suspects , entries like Google News do bring a bit of diversity by regularly linking up niche or international sources that readers might not regularly visit .
But as the rest of the list makes clear , traditional sources still dominate the conversation .
When it comes to blogs , signs of acceptance are a bit harder to come by .
A 2007 Zogby survey found that blogging was classed as an " important " news outlet by only 30 percent of Americans ( web sites were highest at 81 percent ) .
So we 're left with the online " oligarchy " and some elitist bloggers .
Does that match up with your own experience of trolling the web for news ?

When Sony announced that Gran Turismo 5 Prologue would be available for $ 40 in April , I could n’t help but have a knee - jerk reaction .
How could Sony get away with charging $ 40 for GT5 Reduced Lite Junior Prologue when the full version would sell for only $ 20 more ?
Here ’s how , the word is out today that the full blown version of Gran Turismo wo n’t be out for another year !
Is this a new business model for delayed games or just Sony trying to satiate the rabid Gran Turismo fans ?
Gran Turismo is arguably the most popular / prolific console racing series ever , and certainly one of the Playstation 3 ’s key exclusive titles ( second only to Metal Gear IMO ) .
Apparently , even Sony ca n’t get their key exclusive games out the door in any sort of timely fashion for the PS3 .
By the time the “ real ” GT5 comes out , the PS3 will have already been out for two and a half years !
That means that there will have been a four year span between the release of GT4 and GT5 .
To put that in perspective against another big console exclusive , look at Halo .
Each version only had three years or less after the preceding one , and Halo 1 was even a launch title .
Although , how well would have a Halo 3 Lite have done ?
Probably really well , unfortunately .
This could lead to more developers with deadline problems releasing partial versions of their game and then the full version only a year later , as they ’ll just cash in for a total of $ 100 instead of $ 60 without hardly any extra work .
This is n’t the first time the Gran Turismo series has seen a gimped Prologue version however ; the fourth installment had one too , and it came about four years after GT3 .
So I do n’t know how much can really be attributed to the much talked about development difficulties on the PS3 .
Perhaps Polyphony Digital ( the developer ) just ca n’t get their product out the door in general .
All I know is that this ca n’t be a welcomed trend for gamers .
Let ’s hope that the GT5 Prologue owners do n’t get stuck paying full price for what will essentially be a car and track pack .

‘ Tool ’ is a popular metaphor for a programming language but it ’s very limited .
‘ Rule ’ might be a better metaphor .
A language defines , quite literally , what you can and ca n’t do .
People who argue for languages with more power are actually arguing for less rules .
Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner is a must read for the programmer who has n’t dived into Python yet .
There ’s a reason Google endorses Python .
Find out why with this essential book : it introduces the language gently yet takes you as far as you want to go .

Is this really about “ more power ? ”
Or is this about whether a language has one obvious way to do things vs. more than one way to do things ?
Python is a considerably more powerful language than Java , but I would consider both languages to be firmly in the “ It ’s a good thing to impose rules on the programmer ” camp .
It ’s true that languages like Ruby permit programmers more freedom .
But is it because such languages give programmers the tools to turn boilerplate into abstractions ?
Or is it because these languages provide multiple programming paradigms and because they have cultures encouraging programmer responsibility ?
Java and Python are good languages to contrast .
Java began with the idea that removing programmer freedom would produce better programs .
Java was built by removing features from C++ , and the result is a language with little power ( whatever that means ) and little freedom .
Python was also built with the philosophy that removing certain programmer freedoms would produce better programs , however Guido has been careful not to reject features simply because programmers might misuse them .
Instead , he has been careful to design Python such that there are few features he deems unnecessary .
His definition of unnecessary is a feature where there already exists a perfectly serviceable way to do it in Python .
Guido has also tried to remove choice in things that do n’t matter , like indentation , while growing the language with features that fit within Python ’s style and design æsthetic .
The result is a language where programs are easy to read , where you do not have little dialects everywhere .
Yet , Python programmers rarely chafe that they are constrained from doing what they need to do .
Clearly , it is possible to impose rules and to gently guide programmers towards a standard way to express ideas without hobbling them .
Haskell is quite possibly the most extremely limiting language in common use : there is one way to do everything , mathematically pure functional programming .
You have strong , expressive static typing .
Would anyone argue that switching from Java to Haskell is an attempt to deal with fewer rules and fewer restrictions , an attempt to gain more freedom as a programmer ?
Likewise , the Factor programming language imposes a single , constraining set of rules on the programmer : programmers switching to Factor must relinquish their local variables to gain Factor ’s higher - order programming power .
Power and freedom are related ideas .
So it is easy to see why many languages that provide more power also provide more freedom than hobbled languages .
The trouble is that some languages are built as collections of unrelated features smooshed together , just as some programs are hotch potches of checkbox features .
Good design in every field accomplishes the “ antigravity ” trick of accomplishing more with less .
With poor design , adding new power requires adding more check boxes , more features , more ways to do things that interact with each other unexpectedly .
It is not surprising that some reasonable people resist growing languages that are not designed well , that cannot grow in power without throwing more features on top of the pile .
But languages can provide more power while also providing more rules and , paradoxically , less freedom .
It ’s just that they provide less freedom to do things that are unimportant to the language designer ( like fully unconstrained lambdas in Python ) or less freedom to do things that make it difficult to reason about a program ’s behavior ( like dynamic typing or state changes in Haskell ) .
This is accomplished through careful design from the outset , through having a guiding philosophy , and through building on sound foundations .
The issue is not that more power equals more freedom , just that more power ( whatever that means ) equals a certain kind of freedom denied to those who use less powerful languages .
It does not mean more freedom overall , it may mean less freedom overall .
I conclude that it is possible to argue for and against language “ power ” quite separately from arguing for and against constraining programmers with rules .
“ Collection of Rules ” is a decent metaphor for programming languages , and some languages have more rules than others .
But it is orthogonal to the metaphor of languages as tools and the discussion of to what extent providing programmers with more powerful tools leads to better programs .

Oil. Gold .
Cotton .
Brazil .
Those are a few of Byron Wien 's favorite things .
Wien is an influential Wall Street strategist who was at Morgan Stanley for two decades before moving to hedge fund Pequot Capital two years ago .
He helped draw a crowd of 450 investment analysts to the CFA Society of San Francisco 's third annual forecast dinner on Thursday night .
Other speakers included Christopher Ailman , chief investment officer for the $ 174 billion California State Teachers ' Retirement System , and Bruce Kasman , chief economist for JPMorgan Chase .
Wien was the gloomiest of the three .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Despite interest rate cuts - he sees the federal funds rate dropping below 3 percent this year and possibly below 2 percent - Wien says the United States will suffer a recession as housing remains soft and lenders avoid anyone with a whiff of risk .
He predicts the Standard & Poor 's 500 index will drop 10 percent this year , with the first half being rougher than the second .
Early last week , when stocks were in a freefall , he recommended buying , but " We 're not out of the woods yet , " he said .
Nevertheless , he predicts energy and material stocks will hold up well and agricultural commodities will remain strong .
Wien says oil prices will fall to $ 80 a barrel early in the year but will rise to $ 115 in the second half and to $ 125 before long as rising demand - especially from developing countries - outstrips declining production from " tired " wells .
The United States consumes 25 barrels of oil per person per year , compared with 2 barrels per person in China and less than 1 in India .
" If 2.5 billion people ( in China and India ) use a quarter of a barrel more per year , " he says , prices have to go up .
He does n't anticipate a decline in U.S. demand .
Even though oil prices have more than tripled since 2000 to around $ 90 a barrel , " We have no energy policy at all , " he says .
" We do n't want to sacrifice or suffer or even be realistic " about oil consumption .
When Wien asked how many people in the audience had a hybrid car , only a few hands went up .
Asked about the vast deposits of oil in the tar sands in places like Canada and Venezuela , Wien said it costs about $ 5 billion to extract oil from those fields and people are afraid to make that investment .
" If the price ( of oil ) goes to $ 60 , the guy who made the decision to develop the tar sands gets fired . "
He sees the price of gold , now around $ 900 per ounce , hitting $ 1,000 as investors worldwide become reluctant to hold paper currencies .
Another asset he likes a lot is cotton .
" The parts of the world that are getting richer are warm , " he says .
People there want new lightweight clothes made of cotton .
Meanwhile , a lot of cotton fields are being converted to corn and soybeans because richer people also want to eat beef and chicken .
Demand for cotton is going up and acreage is going down , Wien said .
But when he asked the audience how many people own cotton futures , nobody raised a hand .
Wien also encouraged investors to look outside the United States , which he says is on the verge of becoming " just another country " instead of the world 's economic leader .
About 60 percent of Pequot 's assets are invested overseas .
Wien is cautious about China 's overheated stock market but likes Brazil's .
Even though it was up 40 percent last year , he still considers it a bargain .
On the political front , Wien predicted that Barack Obama would beat Mitt Romney " in a landslide . "
Ailman , of CalSTRS , was more optimistic about the U.S. economy and market .
" I think we are in the middle of the tunnel ... where things look most bleak , " he said .
He said that monetary policy ( interest rate cuts ) and fiscal policy ( the proposed tax rebates ) " will coalesce in the spring " and stimulate the economy .
The big risk , he says , is that the Internal Revenue Service wo n't be able to issue checks until May through July .
" A $ 600 check in someone 's pocket in July is a heck of a long time to wait , " he says .
On the other hand , a delay might be good if people spend their check " three times over " before they get it .
Ailman says stocks seem reasonably priced today .
His pension fund has been underweighted in stocks since last summer , but was buying on dips last week .
He wants to shift some of the fund 's assets out of bonds into stocks , but gradually .
As the year progresses , election rhetoric " may cause Wall Street angst , " he says .
" We may find ourselves locked into a trading range until that is resolved . "
He says technology and health care stocks " will be OK . "
Kasman , of JPMorgan Chase , says the United States will avoid a recession this year , but " it will be a close call . "
His big fear is that if we do skirt a recession , the Fed 's drastic interest rate cuts could cause an inflation problem six to 12 months from now .
Partly in response to a big drop in foreign stock markets on Monday , when the U.S. markets were closed , the Fed early Tuesday slashed the federal funds rate by three - quarters of a percentage point to 3.5 percent .
The Fed left the door open for another rate cut - perhaps as much as half a percentage point - at its regular meeting this week .
If the economy is in a recession , " that 's a reasonable strategy , " Kasman said .
If it 's not in a recession , the Fed will have to " significantly adjust policy as we shift into 2009 , " and that could prove highly disruptive to the markets .
Kasman is not so sure the Fed will continue cutting rates after this week , for several reasons .
After the Fed 's big rate cut , Société Générale disclosed that a low - level employee engaged in fraudulent trades that cost the French bank $ 7.2 billion .
There is speculation that the bank 's unwinding of those trades on Monday and Tuesday might have contributed to the panic that in turn prompted the Fed to take action .
The Fed also was likely motivated by a big jump in the unemployment rate in December - to 5.0 percent from 4.7 percent in November .
Kasman says the January employment report wo n't come out until after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday .
It 's likely to be stronger than the December report , he predicts .
He also points out that the committee that meets this week will be different from the one that approved last week 's rate cut .
This committee , which sets interest rates , has 12 voting members , four of whom rotate at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the year .
( Two permanent positions are vacant . )
As a result of all these factors , Kasman predicts that the open market committee statement that comes out this week might look different from the last one .
It might say " that the balance of risk is not so clear - cut on the downside . "
After their prepared remarks , the panelists took questions from audience members .
One asked them to comment on Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke 's performance .
Wien criticized him for not reining in the mortgage and lending business .
He " should have imposed much stricter regulations on the banking system , " Wien says .
But " when you have a new job , you do n't do a lot of courageous things .
You build a political base . "
One exception , he says , he says , was Paul Volker , who was appointed Fed chairman in 1979 and quickly took painful steps to resolve stagflation .
Ailman said there 's a chance that the next U.S. president could appoint a new Fed chairman and blame the economy 's woes on Bernanke .
" He could be our first one - term chairman , " Ailman says .
But Kasman , a former Fed economist , had sympathy for Bernanke .
" Greenspan was much slower responding to events , " he says .
Asked to speculate on disasters that might strike , Wien said that an accelerated withdrawal of troops from Iraq could create an opening for Iran to move in , causing instability in the Middle East .
That would drive oil prices to $ 200 a barrel and cause U.S. and European recessions .
Ailman said there 's always a risk of a terrorist attack or a hedge fund growing broke .
" Saying that Hillary has Executive Branch experience is like saying Yoko Ono was a Beatle , " - Kos commenter , Jsn .

A Massachusetts company backed by Silicon Valley venture money said Tuesday that it has successfully conducted the first - ever demonstration of manufacturing solar cells by inkjet printing .
Rick Hess , president and CEO of thin film photovoltaic technology developer Konarka Technologies Inc. , called the demonstration a " milestone " for the company and an " essential breakthrough in the field of printed solar cells , " in a statement .
Inkjet printing is a commonly used technique for controlled deposition of materials in specific locations on a substrate , primarily used to make flexible electronic circuits .
By using the process in the development of solar cells , the need for " clean rooms " is eliminated , and manufacturers can work with a number of different substrates , including plastics , and different colors , according to company officials .
Last month , we made BBC iPlayer available on Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch devices , the first of many mobile platforms that we hope to support .
The theme for this month 's iPlayer release is " iPlayer in the living room " - i.e. , watching BBC on - demand programmes on your big - screen television set .
Today , most people watch iPlayer programmes on their computer .
That 's great - you can watch your favourite BBC programmes curled up in bed with your notebook PC , or on your study desk while you check your email , or ( if you downloaded our programmes ) on the plane or away abroad on holiday .
But have you tried hooking up your computer to your TV set ?
i Player programmes , particularly downloaded programmes , look great on a TV .
The video quality is usually even better when iPlayer programmes are played back on a TV than on your computer screen .
Most newish computers , particularly notebook computers , have an S - video output , which , with a suitable S - video to SCART cable , can connect to most modern TV sets .
If you have an LCD or plasma TV , chances are that it will have a Video Graphics Array input which will give even better picture quality when connected to the VGA output of your notebook PC .
( N.B. Picture of S - Video output courtsey of yum9me on Flickr . )
If you have a Nintendo Wii , it 's already connected to your TV , and now you can play iPlayer programmes directly on your Wii .
Mehdi Army fighters attacked police patrols in southern Baghdad , police said , further fraying a seven - month - old cease - fire called by Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr to rein in his militia .
The clashes in Baghdad 's Shurta district , which started late on Thursday and continued into Friday morning , follow outbreaks of violence in the southern Iraqi city of Kut in which Mehdi Army fighters battled US and Iraqi security forces .
The fighting took place on the same day that Iraq marked five years since the US - led invasion .
A US soldier died from wounds sustained on Friday from " indirect fire " , a term usually used to describe rocket or mortar fire , south of Baghdad the US military said .
Four other soldiers were also wounded .
Separately , a US soldier died earlier this week when his vehicle overturned in Mandali , a town about 100 kilometres north - east of Baghdad , the US military said .
The deaths bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the invasion to at least 3,993 according to website www.icasualties.org.
War critics are likely to seize on the grim milestone of 4,000 to renew calls for a U.S. troop withdrawal .

End the Two - Party Monopoly !
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
Before the US House of Representatives , July 15 , 2004
Mr. Speaker , political operatives across the country are using state ballot access laws to deny voters the opportunity to support independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader .
For example , one New York election lawyer publicly stated that partisan election lawyers should take advantage of New York ’s complex and costly ballot access procedures to keep Mr. Nader off the New York ballot .
Meanwhile , a state party chairman in Arizona has hired a team of lawyers for the sole purpose of keeping Mr. Nader off the Arizona ballot .
The effort to keep Mr. Nader off the ballot shows how ballot access laws preserve the two - party monopoly over the political system by effectively disenfranchising supporters of third parties and independent candidates .
While the campaign against Mr. Nader is an extreme case , supporters of the two - party monopoly regularly use ballot access laws to keep third party and independent candidates off ballots .
Even candidates able to comply with onerous ballot access rules must devote so many resources to simply getting on the ballot that their ability to communicate ideas to the general public is severely limited .
Perhaps the ballot access laws are one reason why voter turnout has been declining over the past few decades .
After all , almost 42 % of eligible voters have either not registered to vote or have registered as something other than Democrat or Republican .
The United States Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate the time , place , and manner of federal elections .
Thus , ballot access is one of the few areas where Congress has explicit constitutional authority to establish national standards .
In order to open up the political process , I have introduced the Voter Freedom Act ( HR 1941 ) .
HR 1941 established uniform standards for ballot access so third party and independent candidates can at last compete on a level playing field .
The blatant attempt by a major party to keep Ralph Nader off state ballots demonstrates how restrictive ballot access laws are used to preserve a political monopoly , limit voter choices , and deny the rights of millions of Americans who support third parties and independent candidates an opportunity to effectively participate in the political process .
I call upon my colleagues to remedy this situation by supporting my Voter Freedom Act .

Immediate Consumer Action is Needed to Stop Mothers Act .
The Mothers Act is pending legislation that will indoctrinate hundreds of thousands of mothers into taking dangerous psych drugs .
It is a great example of how the Big Pharma lobby controls Congress to the detriment of health , as well as needlessly and dramatically inflating the costs of our health care system for everyone .
Like any piece of legislation it purports to address a troubling issue – in this case the mood distress of mothers following birth known as postpartum depression .
It is true that 10 % – 15 % of women need some assistance in dealing with this topic – but the majority of them sure do n’t need it from Big Pharma .
That is the Big Lie .
The Mothers Act ( S. 1375 : Mom ’s Opportunity to Access Health , Education , Research , and Support for Postpartum Depression Act ) has the net affect of reclassifying the natural process of pregnancy and birth as a mental disorder that requires the use of unproven and extremely dangerous psychotropic medications ( which can also easily harm the child ) .
Urgent consumer action ( see below ) is needed to stop this atrocity , as the Senate could now vote any day .
It is my understanding that the process of birth , the intimate bonding of mother and child , and the placing of significant responsibility on the father is all part of a healthy culture and the backbone of the fabric that makes strong families and consequently our great nation .
I fail to see why we need laws that force health care professionals to emphasize the idea that the process is some type of mental illness affecting 80 % of all women – what a bogus pile of crap .
The Mothers Act proposes sweeping and dramatic changes in the delivery of pregnancy care by all health professionals .
It demands that health professionals indoctrinate pregnant women into mental health treatment options for mild depression - like symptoms experienced during or following pregnancy , including moderate symptoms they call “ baby blues ” which they say affects 80 % of pregnant women .
In other words , this is a massive federate health mandate to get the majority of pregnant and nursing mothers on psych drugs – a new target market for Big Pharma .
The bill was obviously written by the Big Pharma lobby and its passage into law would be considered laughable except that it is actually happening .
The bill seeks to require taxpayer - funded grants to treat postpartum mood and anxiety disorders , as defined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
For those of you who do n’t know , this is the manual of vaguely defined mental health issues used by Big Pharma to allow the sale of their expensive psych drugs and get payment from Medicare and Medicaid at taxpayer expense .
While some people certainly need help , this system racks up billions in fraudulent sales per year – including the sale of dangerous antipsychotic medications to our children .
The Big Pharma lobby last year spent tens of millions to ensure the government would continue to cover vulnerable children so they could capitalize on this blatant scam .
As far as the Mothers Act goers , how can taxpayers be expected to pay for drug treatments when the problem that is n’t even understood ?
As the bill freely acknowledges “ The causes of postpartum depression are complex and unknown . ”
In a mysterious leap of faith the bill says that this condition requires medication to treat it even though such medication has never been proven clinically effective and carries serious side effect risks for the mother and baby , including cardiovascular birth defects .
The bill goes on to set up a system of taxpayer - funded grants to pay for the treatments .
It even commits you the taxpayer to funding “ clinical research for the development and evaluation of new treatments for postpartum conditions , including new biological agents . ”
This means taxpayers will now foot the bill of Big Pharma drug development including the most dangerous new category of totally unproven pie - in - the - sky biological drugs that cost hundreds of billions of dollars to develop and can irreparably injure within minutes !
Yes , and once you have paid a fortune to develop these biological gene - altering agents then you will pay the drug companies price so that they can be freely dispensed to hundreds of thousands of pregnant and nursing mothers .
Taxpayers will be on the hook for tens of billions of wasted dollars .
Immediate Consumer Action is Needed
The Mothers Act has already passed the House ( H.R. 20 , the Melanie Blocker Stokes Postpartum Depression , Research and Care Act ) .
Word has it that it is being snuck out of the HELP committee on Thursday or Friday of this week and may be rammed through the Senate without any debate before the Easter break .
Rather unbelievably up to this point is that the cause of defeating this legislation has fallen onto the shoulders of one young mother , Amy Philo .
When she struggled with postpartum stress she was placed on the very same psych drugs advocated for use in the Mothers Act legislation .
She began having violent thoughts towards her child and suicidal thinking .
Her not very bright doctor had her double and then triple her dose , nearly killing her .
She is lucky to be alive today and wants to warn other mothers of the dangers inherent in the Mothers Act .
Click here if you would like to view her YouTube story .
Immediate consumer action is needed to stop the Big Pharma - crafted Mothers Act .
Here are the two action steps you can take right now to help make a difference :
1 ) Go to my CapWiz page and with two clicks of a mouse send an opposition letter to your Senators .
2 ) Sign this petition , which is being used to pressure Senators on the HELP committee .

The Soul of The Sims , by Will Wright
Macintosh HD:XmotiveHarness:src/Motive.c
Tuesday , January 28 , 1997 / 9:25 AM
This is the prototype for the soul of The Sims , which Will Wright wrote on January 23 , 1997 .
I had just started working at the Maxis Core Technology Group on " Project X " aka " Dollhouse " , and Will Wright brought this code in one morning , to demonstrate his design for the motives , feedback loop and failure conditions of the simulated people .
While going through old papers , I ran across this print - out that I had saved , so I scanned it and cleaned the images up , and got permission from Will to publish it .
This code is a interesting example of game design , programming and prototyping techniques .
The Sims code has certainly changed a lot since Will wrote this original prototype code .
For example , there is no longer any " stress " motive .
And the game does n't store motives in global variables , of course .
My hope is that this code will give you a glimpse of how Will Wright designs games , and what was going on in his head at the time !

Oh , Ohio .
Tonight ’s Democratic debate ( 9 p.m. E.T. , MSNBC ) will be the last face off between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama before the state ’s bellwether primary one week from today — and with none scheduled for the future , it could be the last one , period .
Mrs. Clinton is hanging on to her edge in the early polls in the Buckeye State despite recent gains made by her rival , who ’s looking to extend his primary winning streak to Texas and Ohio on March 4 . Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland supports Mrs. Clinton , but on Monday Mr. Obama picked up the endorsement of another Buckeye superdelegate , Mark Mallory , mayor of Cincinnati .
In other endorsements today , Senator Chris Dodd , former Democratic presidential candidate , is expected to endorse Mr. Obama .
Do n’t forget that Mr. Dodd had received the backing of the powerful firefighters union , yet another labor group that could swing to the Obama camp .
Mr. Dodd is expected to make the announcement in Cleveland , a place that the Associated Press reminds us housed the 1980 debate during which Ronald Reagan uttered his oft - quoted line “ There you go again ” to President Jimmy Carter , just a few days before the election and Mr. Reagan ’s victory .
In its debate primer , the Cleveland Plain Dealer suggests watching out for “ whether Clinton continues the tone she displayed Saturday in Ohio .
Upset by a flier depicting her health care and trade policies distributed by Obama , she accused her fellow U.S. senator of using Republican - style smear tactics .
Obama says the facts are on his side . ”
U.S. Rep. Dennis Eckart of Cleveland told the Columbus Dispatch that “ the stakes are much higher here than any other debate .
Obama can close it out on March 4 ( or ) Clinton can live to fight another day on March 4 . ”
Bill Carrick , a Los Angeles - based Democratic consultant who worked for former President Clinton ’s 1992 and 1996 campaigns , said the Cleveland debate “ is probably the last opportunity that Sen .
Clinton is going to have to make the case both for herself and against Sen .
Obama that will be unfiltered . ”
Carrick said Obama , who has defined himself as a candidate of hope and unity , “ would like to avoid a food fight ” but almost certainly will press Clinton on the contentious issue of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
Obama has criticized Clinton for supporting the trade agreement that he says has cost Ohio jobs .
Clinton has accused Obama of distorting her position on NAFTA .
Mrs. Clinton , who is losing ground nationally according to the latest New York Times / CBS News poll , is letting loose a five - point , “ kitchen sink ” attack on Mr. Obama , report Patrick Healy and Julie Bosman of The Times .
After denouncing Mr. Obama over the weekend for an anti-Clinton flier about the Nafta trade treaty , and then sarcastically portraying his message of hope Sunday as naïve , Mrs. Clinton delivered a blistering speech on Monday that compared Mr. Obama ’s lack of foreign policy experience to that of the candidate George W. Bush .
“ We ’ve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security , ” Mrs. Clinton said in a speech on foreign policy at George Washington University .
“ We ca n’t let that happen again . ”
Amy Chozick of The Wall Street Journal notes that the Clinton campaign “ has grappled for nearly a year with how negative it should go against Sen.
Obama as it has tried to portray Sen.
Clinton as both a strong commander in chief and a genuine and likable candidate , ” and tensions mounted yesterday when a photo of Mr. Obama dressed in Somali garb appeared on the Drudge Report .
The political Web site reported that the photo had been circulated by a Clinton campaign aide , prompting an angry response from the Obama campaign .
In an email to reporters , Obama campaign manager David Plouffe referred to an incident in Iowa when two Clinton volunteers resigned after it was revealed they had circulated an email claiming that the Illinois senator , a Christian , is a Muslim .
“ This is part of a disturbing pattern , ” Mr. Plouffe wrote .
Clinton campaign officials say that as far as they know , the photo did n’t come from anyone inside the campaign .
John McCain , who has the luxury of not being trapped in a heated nomination contest anymore , spoke about the general election on Monday .
The Iraq
War needs to be viewed as a success if he is to win , Michael Luo of The Times writes .
Senator John McCain said Monday that he needed to convince the American people that the troop escalation in Iraq was working and that American casualties there would continue to decline .
If he did not , he said , “ I lose ” the election .
“ Is there any doubt ? ” Mr. McCain said to reporters on his campaign bus .
But then he pulled back from his blunt assessment .
“ Let me not put it that stark , ” he said , explaining that he believed people would judge his candidacy on his ability to handle the economy , which has emerged as a pre-eminent voter concern , as well as on national security .
The Washington Post says the Democratic governors of some swing states are concerned that Mr. McCain ’s place on the general election ballot will make it hard for them deliver their states to their party .
“ To quote President Bush , McCain is never to be misunderestimated , ” said Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona , McCain ’s home state .
“ He ’s a tough campaigner . ” “ In some ways , ” said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania , a state that is considered a must - win for any Democratic nominee , “ he ’s the ideal [ Republican ] candidate for Pennsylvania . ”
With the debate tonight , the media focus is on Ohio , but the vast , varied Texas battleground still looms for Democrats .
The Los Angeles Times considers the Senate styles of Mr. Obama ( renegade Washington outsider ) and Mrs. Clinton ( smart , effective Beltway insider ) .
Regarding Ralph Nader ’s just - announced presidential candidacy , USA Today notes that Chris Lehane , Al Gore ’s press secretary during the 2000 campaign , considers himself a “ Nader hater ” : “ His being on the ticket in 2000 has caused the nation to go backward on each of those issues .
It just comes down to a guy who ’s a megalomaniac . ”

When Americans debate the " elections of change " of the 20th century , there are certain dates that immediately come to mind : 1932 , 1976 , 1980 .
Maybe even 1992 .
In each case , the definition is roughly the same .
" Elections of change " are moments of public rebellion .
The winning candidates are tapped as torchbearers , opponents of Old Washington and its insider customs .
They offer new direction , a way forward , a break with the past , and the voters offer their endorsement .
But the tendency to associate election - year frustration with actual political change can be misleading and inaccurate , for two simple reasons .
Rosy promises , as many Americans know , often vanish at the stump .
And real reform , perversely enough , has a long history of being unplanned and unintended .
As an example of the first scenario , there is President Ronald Reagan and the election of 1980 .
By many appraisals , Reagan was the architect of a smaller , more efficient form of government .
In his 1981 inaugural address , he spoke famously of curbing " the size and influence of the federal establishment . "
His re-election all but legitimized the claim .
But data suggest otherwise .
From 1981 to 1989 , according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management , the size of the federal civilian payroll grew by 40 percent and 200,000 people .
Flip - flop .
On the other side is a president like Franklin Delano Roosevelt , a man who dramatically expanded the federal government 's purview despite having no initial intention of doing so .
In his 1932 nomination speech , Roosevelt , sounding more like a prescient President Reagan , told the crowd , " For three long years I have been going up and down this country preaching that government — federal and state and local — costs too much .
I shall not stop that preaching . "
The deepening Depression changedhis mind .
[ lore ] Murphy 's Law Strikes Again : AS7007
Applications of Murphy 's Law : The " AS7007 Incident " Adrian Chadd
It was an average day in 1997 .
The Internet , fledging compared to today 's standards .
Internet operators ( mostly ! ) trusted one another .
SMTP servers would be open relays ; a number of open web proxies and anonymous dialout servers were available .
People were worried about running out of IP space .
Network Operators were worried about the CPU on their routers being taxed dealing with a full routing table of ~ 45,000 entries .
Then , suddenly , the internet stopped working .
Network Operators everywhere sprang into action to discover the cause of the lack of traffic .
And there it was .
As far as the routing protocols were concerned , the entire internet existed in one location - some crappy Bay Networks router in AS7007 .
The problem was fixed rather quickly - the misbehaving router was pulled from the network .
But this did n't solve the problem .
Routers were still crashing all over the internet .
Where were the announcements coming from ?
How could one stop it ?
Was the Internet , kept running by gaffa tape , IRC and sushi , finally coming to an end ?
Everything settled down a few hours later .
Network Operators around the globe began discussing the impact of this outage and how it could be prevented .
The Internet did fundamentally change - but unlike a lot of other changes , the general users knew nothing about it .
What is BGP ?
BGP is the protocol which networks on the internet announce to other networks two things .
That they exist , and which networks can be reached by them , and learning how to reach the other networks on the Internet .
Routers will receive BGP information , decide upon the " best " path to take to a destination network and update their routing table .
BGP uses a few metrics to determine the " best " path .
The most obvious metric is the number of networks between them and the destination network - the " AS Path length " .
A shorter AS path length is generally better .
This is n't the whole story but as you 'll see , it did n't matter .
The other metric is how specific the route is .
A more specific route is preferred over a more general route , regardless of AS path length or any other metric .
So if you see an announcement for 130.95.0.0/16 ( ie , 130.95.0.0 -> 130.95.255.255 ) via path A and an announcement for 130.95.0.0/24 ( ie , 130.95.0.0 -> 130.95.0.255 ) via Path B , traffic destined to any host inside 130.95.0.0/24 will flow via path B regardless of how much closer path A is .
So there 's this router in AS7007 .
It learnt the entire internet routing table via BGP .
It began converting most routes into / 24s - ie , routes which covered 256 IP addresses .
Somehow , and this part is fuzzy - it then managed to " leak " this table back into BGP and reannounced to the entire internet almost every network that was available .
Deaggregated down to /24's .
As originating from his AS number .
So the AS path was removed ( ie , every network on the internet looked like it was his ) and every announcement was very specific ( / 24 ) .
So , as far as the routers on the internet was concerned , every network everywhere could be reached by sending traffic to AS7007 .
And , they did .
The internet existed at the end of a 45 - mbit pipe , connected to AS7007 .
This was rectified quickly .
The port was shut off and the announcements ceased .
But the problem did n't go away .
Routers kept passing on this massive 250,000 - entry routing table and , in many cases , would then crash .
They 'd reboot ; re-learn all the routes from a peer , re-distribute them , and crash again .
Not only that , but routers worked in finite time over links which trasmitted at a finite data rate with a latency under the speed of light .
These announcements bounced around the internet for hours .
Many internet backbones solved the problem by turning off all their equipment , shutting off the ports , staging reloads of their equipment , adding route announcement filters to reject receiving the routes in the first place , and then turning on their network connectivity .
The aftermath ?
Network Operators began filtering route announcements from their peers and customers .
At a course level - customers could only announce networks originating from their AS numbers .
At a fine - grained level - some companies only accepted route announcments matching certain criteria .
This involved first registering your network inside the RADB - which you would describe your network , the networks you announced and how you connected to other networks .
Most networks did something in between .
Vendors began adding in " magic " into their routers to allow administrators to control how many announcements a peer could send before shutting that peer off or ignoring further announcements .
The usual talk of " crytographically signed " data popped up but nothing happened for a long while .
And the owner of AS7007 was never able to live it down .

I could be more specific but the article would be much , much longer .

Reports : GOP campaign treasurer embezzled up to $ 1 million Nick Juliano
Published : Friday March 14 , 2008

Print This Email This NRCC treasurer ' deceived and betrayed ' committee to funnel funds to personal accounts The National Republican Congressional Committee , already lagging behind its Democratic counterpart in fundraising this year , has nearly $ 1 million less in the bank than it thought because of an alleged embezzlement scheme from its former treasurer .
The FBI began an investigation in February to determine how much former treasurer Christopher J. Ward , who previously did work for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , embezzled from the NRCC .
On Thursday the committee released more details on the investigation , indicating he may have moved as much as $ 1 million from campaigns he ran into his own account .
" The evidence we have today indicated we have been deceived and betrayed for a number of years by a highly respected and trusted individual , " said Rep. Tom Cole ( R - Okla . ) , the NRCC chairman .
Over the last five years , Ward served as treasurer for 83 Republican committees that raised more than $ 400 million over the last 10 years , the Washington Post reported .
Rep. Peter T. King ( R - NY ) told the paper that Ward paid himself $ 6,000 from King 's political action committee last year .
The congressman thought he had already closed down the committee .
Thursday was the first time the NRCC acknowledged money was missing from its accounts .
The Post reports :
The committee also announced that it has submitted to banks five years ' worth of audits and financial documents allegedly faked by Ward , some of which were used to secure multimillion - dollar loans .
It is a violation of federal laws to obtain loans through false statements ; the crime is punishable by up to $ 1 million in fines and 30 years in prison .
Before yesterday , the committee , which raised $ 49 million in 2007 , had not acknowledged that any money was missing .
It announced on Feb. 1 that it had discovered " irregularities " that might involve fraud , dismissed Ward and called in federal investigators .
Robert K. Kelner , a lawyer with Covington & Burling , which has been hired to oversee an internal forensic audit , told reporters he is certain only that Ward had made " several hundred thousand dollars " in unauthorized money transfers since 2004 .
However , he said , the year - end report filed with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) in 2006 overstated the NRCC 's cash on hand by $ 990,000 .
That may be the upper level of what Ward allegedly skimmed from NRCC coffers , Kelner said .
But the total will not be known until forensic auditors finish " drilling down " to determine how much money might have been misappropriated and how much may be missing as a result of sloppy bookkeeping , he said .
According to Politico : A GOP source said that , in some cases , Ward cut checks , in small amounts , from a lawmakers campaign or leadership PAC directly to his own bank account .
At other times , the sources said , Ward used a dummy company as a go - between , but the money finally ended up in his account .
The source said that Ward issued a $ 4,208 check to himself in December from Rep. Jeb Hensarlings ( R - Texas ) PAC , although he returned that money in early February , after the NRCC accounting scandal became public .
Ward 's attorney declined requests for comment from several news outlets .
The Hill reports Ward apparently " went to great lengths " to conceal his alleged embezzlement .
At a Thursday afternoon briefing for reporters at NRCC headquarters , committee staff said Ward operated alone and unchecked for years as he allegedly falsified committee audits .
 As treasurer , Ward was in charge of coordinating the audit he was able to authorize transfers without anyone elses signature ,  said Robert Kelner , a partner at Covington & Burling who is outside legal counsel for the NRCC .
 In hindsight , it would have been better to have internal controls but its not terribly unusual to have less rigorous controls than you see at larger corporations . 
Kelner said Ward went through great lengths to conceal his activities , transferring sums into other committees he had access to and then shifting the funds into his personal accounts .
 We see hundreds of thousands of dollars leaving the NRCC to go to outside committees .
We see hundreds of thousands of dollars leaving the outside committees to go to Chris Wards accounts .
The numbers dont necessarily match - up perfectly .
The investigation into Ward 's apparently shady dealings is expected to continue for months , and it will create precisely the kinds of headaches Congressional Republicans do n't need heading into what 's widely expected to be a tough election year .
About two dozen GOP members of Congress are planning to resign after their term ends this year , significantly adding to the number of seats the party will have to commit resources to in November .
America vs. Sweden in the File - Sharing Debate RIAA ponders content filters while Sweden supports legal file - sharing Earlier this week we saw Cary Sherman of RIAA discussing the possibility of filtering content in your home through the use of anti-virus software .
In defense of the opposition that surfaced around this issue , Sherman is now saying that he was n’t actually proposing that this be done but was “ simply musing ” on an abstract concept that could theoretically be put into place .
While the RIAA ponders the ways that it can get into your home and stop you from illegal file - sharing ( or legal file - sharing for that matter ) , politicians in Sweden are pondering ways to make all file - sharing legal .
This is exemplified by the recent actions of the Swedish Green Party which has long supported allowing file - sharing .
They have recently made a new push in these efforts with the argument that file - sharing is not a form of theft and can actually be a key force in democracy today .

Good job !
Hopefully America follows .

You search for job postings using online classifieds websites .
You submit a cover letter and resume in response to a job that interests you .
You never hear back from anyone .
Finding a job using the Internet is kind of like playing the lottery .
I say this because after five years of consistently playing the game , I still have n’t won anything .
The process goes something like this :
I ’m exaggerating , of course .
I ’m sure that there are plenty of people who have successfully found a job using the Internet .
Maybe they ’ll read this and simply tell me I ’m “ doing it wrong . ”
Though that might be true , my point is that the majority of people who apply for jobs online must experience the same frustration that I do .
When I actually take a moment to think about it , I recognize how incredibly unsuccessful this process has been :
I ’ve used the Internet to apply for jobs — often casually , sometimes relentlessly — for at least five years .
I ’ve probably submitted my resume to over 1000 different employers in that time .
I estimate that I received callbacks at a ratio of 1 phone - screening per 20 submitted resumes .
I estimate that I received in - person interviews at a ratio of 1 interview per 5 callbacks .
I ’ve never actually been hired using this process .
Do n’t get me wrong — it ’s not like I ’ve never been hired before .
It ’s just that I ’ve always been hired as a result of some other process , such as :
Using my college ’s Career Services department .
They put me in touch with a business that “ hired ” me for an unpaid internship .
At the end of the internship , the business offered me a part time position .
Once I finished college , the business hired me full time .
department .
They put me in touch with a business that “ hired ” me for an unpaid internship .
At the end of the internship , the business offered me a part time position .
Once I finished college , the business hired me full time .
Taking advantage of People Networking .
I met a lot of people while working as a computer consultant .
Some clients liked working with me so much that they preferred to call my cell phone directly instead of phoning the main office .
When I continued receiving these direct calls after I was no longer employed at the consulting firm , I had to explain I was no longer working with “ Big Consulting . ”
In most cases , the former client asked if I ’d be interested in contract work .

Doing something Spontaneous and / or Unorthodox .
I once got a job just by walking into a restaurant between the lunch and dinner rushes and asking if I could work there .
I had no idea if they were hiring .
I had not prepared a copy of my resume to give to them .
Most importantly , I had no experience working in restaurants .
When the manager asked why I wanted to work there , I said “ Because every time I drive past here , the parking lot is PACKED . ”
He liked my response so much he offered me a job .
So if I ’ve had success using the above processes , why do I always end up returning to the online classifieds ?
Considering the fact that they ’ve consistently demonstrated a 0 % effectiveness rate for me , you ’d think that I ’d have the sense to explore other options .
The truth is , I gravitate towards online classifieds because even though they ’re ineffective , they ’re incredibly appealing .
Here ’s why :
Applying for jobs online is convenient .
You search for a job using keywords .
You find one that sounds promising .
You attach your resume to an email message , type a corresponding cover letter , and click “ Send . ”
The entire process involves maybe five minutes of effort .
If you ’re like me , you ’re easily able to apply to two or three jobs during your lunch break .
It makes me feel like I have options .
Job Category , Job Title , Job Description .
Keywords , Salary Range , the number of miles from your zip code …
When you apply for jobs online , you feel like the master of your own destiny .
You ’re selecting a future career on your own terms .
The more jobs I apply for , the better my chances .
Applying for a job online is like fishing .
Once you ’ve cast your lure out into the water , the next step requires a biting fish .
Since you do n’t know when or where the fish will bite , you cast another lure in a different direction .
You do this again and again and end up with dozens of potential chances to reel in an interested employer .
It helps me keep up appearances .
In some social settings , you may be asked “ What do you do for a living ? ” or “ Are you still looking for a job ? ” or “ Are you still ( doing some job where your talents are obviously being wasted ) ? ”
If you ’re applying for jobs online , then you can honestly respond with “ I ’ve applied to a few positions , but I ’m still waiting to hear back from them . ”
It ’s something you say to reassure yourself that it ’s not like you have n’t been trying .
It gives me hope .
I believe the main reason people browse through online classifieds is because they imagine that someday they ’ll stumble upon their perfect career opportunity .
You have a job — and although it ’s not awful , it ’s not wonderful either .
So you spend a fraction of every workday secretly visiting sites for job seekers , always hoping that today will be the day that your perfect job listing appears :
A job where you can do what you ’ve always dreamed of doing .
A job where you ’re finally being paid what you ’re worth .
A job where life ’s better .
In other words , the process of applying for jobs online is comforting .
It convinces me that I have n’t settled for life as is , and that I ’m striving for something better .
It would be nice , though , if the process resulted in employment ( for a change ) .
Until now , I ’ve only discussed the application process from the perspective of a hopeful job seeker .
While writing this article , I had an idea that would allow me to experience an alternate perspective .
Namely , the perspective of a Hiring Manager .
In order to get a taste of what a Hiring Manager sees , I did something that is admittedly unethical : Using a popular online classifieds website , I created a job posting for a job that did n’t actually exist .
Creating a believable - yet - fictional job posting was easier than I imagined .
I simply typed up a job title , job description , and required qualifications for a job that I myself might apply for .
To help aid my anonymity , the site automatically hid my newly - created Yahoo !
email address in the posting .
It read something like :
Computer Position Immediately Available Office in ( city ) seeks knowledgeable Computer Expert to join our experienced team .
Bachelor ’s Degree in Computer Science or Technical Degree required .
3 - years relevant experience required .
Certifications preferred .
$ 45,000 annually with advancement opportunities to $ 70,000 .
I mentioned that applicants should indicate their salary requirements in the subject of the message .
Within a few hours , my inbox looked like this :
I was amazed at the amount of people who applied to the position so quickly .
I was even more amazed at the amount of people who were willing to undercut the starting salary of $ 45,000 / year .
By the next morning , my inbox looked like this :
At this point , I felt extremely guilty about the number of people I was misleading .
I removed the job posting from the website before it got any worse .
50 inquiries in less than 24 hours , all of them roughly the same :
To Whom It May Concern : Dear Sir / Madame : Hello : I am writing you in response to the Computer Position .
I would be a generous asset to your organization .
Please see my attached resume .
Please contact me so we can arrange a mutually convenient time to meet .
Sincerely , Cookie - Cutter Applicant
Faced with an inbox of 50 such inquiries , what would you expect a Hiring Manager to do ?
Since most businesses are only interested in one thing —
The Bottom Line — I ’d wager the first person they ’d call would be whoever is cheapest .
In my small sample of applicants , that was the guy who wanted $ 16 / hour for his salary .
From a business standpoint , even if this applicant could only do the job half as well as some of the other applicants , it ’s still a good deal .
The business would be paying diddlysquat for a person to take on the responsibilities of the position .
At the very least , the business has hired a scapegoat to point a finger at if something goes wrong .
I had always heard that employers often spend less than 30 seconds per resume — and now I understand why .
When you provide such a convenient way for people to apply for jobs , you get an overwhelming response .
My posting was available for less than a day and I received 50 inquiries .
Most postings are available for much longer , and Hiring Managers most certainly have more than one job opening posted at any time .
Consequently , Hiring Managers receive hundreds ( if not thousands ) of inquiries each day .
It ’s unrealistic to believe that every applicant can be considered for the position , even if they ’re qualified for it .
Making matters worse is that the vast majority of applicants are qualified for the positions they apply to , making it difficult to differentiate between applicants .
It ’s interesting because I used to believe that applying to as many jobs as possible truly increased your chances of landing a job .
Now I understand that would only be true if you were the only person doing it .
The thing is , applying for jobs online is so simple that nearly every job hunter does it .
As a result , you ’re not only competing with people who are unemployed , but you ’re also competing against people who are working jobs they ’re unhappy with .
The overwhelming competition is a consequence of convenience .
Most interestingly , employers generally do n’t even like resumes .
The 2007 Edition of “ What Color is Your Parachute ? ” says that employers often prefer to find new hires based on recommendations from existing employees .
Not only does it save them time , employers also experience a higher rate of success when trying to match potential candidates with their business .
Statistically speaking , the needle - in - a - haystack process of sifting through resumes is often a “ last resort ” for most employers .
After having done the research , I ’m no longer surprised that I ’ve never gotten a job using this process .
It all depends on whether or not you can manage to impress a stranger in 30 seconds or less .
If you manage to do that , they ’ll call you to immediately ask about your salary expectations .
This fascinates me because in all of the “ mock interviews ” I had in high school , it was emphasized that you should save salary discussions until the second in - person interview .
My classmates and I were taught tactful responses such as “ Until we ’ve determined that I ’m a good match for this position , I believe that any discussion regarding salary would be premature . ”
If the interviewer persisted , then we were to turn the tables by saying “ Well since you ’re the ones who created the position , certainly you had some figure in mind ? ”
My teacher relentlessly reminded us that whoever mentions a figure first will almost always “ lose ” the negotiation .
It appears as if all of that preparation has gone to waste .
The information we were taught is no longer valid .
In today ’s competitive job market , you ca n’t hold out until a second interview before discussing salary .
Employers do n’t have the time or interest in playing games , which is why they often ask about salary requirements in phone interviews .
Which brings me to my last point .
There ’s a lot of information about what the “ right strategy ” is when it comes to job - hunting .
There are countless numbers of recommendations regarding “ How To Ace an Interview , ” “ How To Spruce Up Your Resume , ” or whatever else .
The only advice that seemed 100 % honest was given to me by a Hiring Manager .
I was invited to be interviewed for a position with her organization , but a different candidate was hired .
I followed up with a message thanking her for her time , and asking if she had any recommendations that might assist me in my job search .
All she said was :
“ Every recruiter and company has their own take on things . ”

Every Republican
I 've spoken to is mystified that John McCain has sewn up the Republican nomination .
For his entire career , he has been more statist on both domestic and foreign policy than even the typical Republican .
He has been considered a " liberal , " and not in a good sense .
He does n't share any of the values that are said to make up the Republican consensus on economics or culture or religion .
His personal baggage is heavy and a mile long .
He had no dedicated constituency within the party .
Of course I 'm not talking to the run -of - the - mill Republican .
There are vast hordes of these people who have never read a book and vote only by the most sordid political instinct known to man .
McCain is their candidate .
It comes down to one thing only : the simple - minded , unthinking impression that he is a war hero and , more than anyone else , has what it takes to smash the evil foreign peoples who want to kill us .
In short , he appeals to the militaristic , nationalistic impulses of the base Republican base .
The real question is why that one issue would trump every other concern alive among Republicans .
How is it that imperialist nationalism has come to trump every other issue ?
Murray Rothbard used to tell the story of speaking to conservative and Republican audiences in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
There would be large groups gathered for various talks on economics and politics .
He would give a lecture on the problem of price controls , or protectionism , or high taxes .
People really liked what he had to say .
They would clap , and learn from his lecture .
Then he would sit down .
At some point in the course of the conference , the appointed anti-Communist speaker would rise to the podium .
He would decry the evil of Russia and its atheistic system of government .
He would call for beefing up nuclear weapons and hint darkly of the necessity of war .
He would end with an apocalyptic statement about the need for everyone to completely dedicate themselves to eradicating the communists by any means necessary .
No talk of limiting or cutting government ; quite the opposite .
So how would these people , who clapped for Murray , respond to the warmonger ?
Insanely , wildly , uncontrollably .
They would stand and scream and yell and cheer , getting up on their chairs and putting their hands together high in the air .
The applause would go on for five minutes and more , and the speaker would be later mauled for autographs .
His books would sell wildly .
Meanwhile , poor Murray would stand there in alarm .
How could these same people cheer both a call for liberty and a call for empire , and , most notably , give their hearts over to the maniacal nationalist while being merely polite to a call for the same liberty that had led this party to oppose FDR 's domestic and foreign - policy ?
It was experiences like these that led him to write the most important dissection of the Republican party ever to appear : The Betrayal of the American Right .
It is here that Murray engages in a deep , soul - searching look at his own role in red-baiting in the 1950s .
He had hoped to use the anti-Communist movement to educate people about the need for freedom .
" It is clear that libertarians and Old Rightists , including myself , had made a great mistake in endorsing domestic red-baiting , a red - baiting that proved to be the major entering wedge for the complete transformation of the original right wing , " writes Murray .
Instead of supporting freedom , the anti-Communist movement ended up acculturating Republicans to the imperial mindset .
The moral priority of crushing a foreign government trumped every other issue .
At the same time , the libertarianism of the GOP 's domestic agenda was supplanted by a belief that " big government and domestic statism were perfectly acceptable , provided that they were steeped in some sort of Burkean tradition and enjoyed a Christian framework . "
Fiery individualism and radicalism were replaced by a longing for a static , controlling elite of the European sort .
Liberty was washed away .
That was fifty years ago .
Today the same priorities abound on the Right : first , nationalism and empire , and , second , longing for order in the domestic area .
The switch from anti-Communist militarism to anti-Islamic imperialism was not difficult .
They took a chapter out of Orwell , and merely changed the name of the enemy .
All of this laid the groundwork for McCain .
Each Republican presidential contender has been worse than the last : Nixon and Reagan felt the need to endorse some libertarian themes in their campaigns , and even the two Bushes used limited government and anti–big government rhetoric .
But that has evaporated , replaced now by the most virulent jingoism combined with domestic statism .
Many of my Republican friends criticize McCain as a leftist .
I can see the point .
But we ought not be too quick to believe that all forms of antilibertarian ideology are leftist .
We need to recognize that there is a form of nonleftist statism of a very distinct kind .
It is not socialist in the traditional sense .
It believes in a corporate state , combined with protectionism and belligerence in foreign policy .
The right - wing predecessors here are Mussolini , Franco , and Hitler , and the name of the ideology is fascism .
For more on this , see John T. Flynn 's As We Go Marching .
He listed some points of the fascist program .
It is a form of social organization " in which the government acknowledges no restraint upon its powers , " is managed by the " leadership principle , " and in which " the government is organized to operate the capitalist system and enable it to function — under an immense bureaucracy . "
In fascism , " militarism is used as a conscious mechanism of government spending , " and " imperialism is included as a policy inevitably flowing from militarism . "
" Wherever you find a nation using all of these devices , " he wrote , " you will know that this is a fascist nation . "
Republicans are prepared to push this agenda , altered to fit the American political context , in this election .
Their number one tactic to retain power is impugning the patriotism of Barack Obama .
It seems like a puzzle , but an opinion piece by William Kristol in the New York Times offers a clue into the basis of the Republican campaign .
He first makes a big deal out of the fact that Obama used to wear an American flag pin on his coat , but now no longer does so .
He drags this up as if to accuse him of disloyalty to the American cause .
It is hard to imagine a more brainless and low - level tactic than to harp on such things .
It compares only to the periodic campaigns by Republicans on the issue of flag burning , as if whether a person burns a privately owned flag has any bearing at all on the well - being of the country .
But then Kristol goes further into the depths of depravity by attempting to paint Obama 's wife as guilty of treason for saying that she is proud of America " for the first time in my adult lifetime . "
By citing these words , he is implying that she is an America hater .
Now , what buttons is Kristol trying to push here ?
It is the now familiar fascist theme : loyalty to the nation state and its wars must be the first and only test of worthiness to serve in public office .
Folks , this is a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand that is very likely to mutate into a full storm .
Sad to say , the Republican faithful , the same people that were stupid enough to vote for McCain , will probably go for it .
How I recall those heady days of the 1970s , when everyone said that the move of the neoconservatives into the Republican party portended a raising of the intellectual level .
Quite the reverse .
These people are taking things straight into the gutter , where they had already been tending since the late 1950s .
Widmark made more than 70 films between 1947 and 1992 Hollywood star Richard Widmark has died at the age of 93 after a long illness , his wife has announced .
The prolific actor , who often portrayed killers and gunslingers , made a memorable big - screen debut in 1947 as a giggling psychopath in Kiss of Death .
He went on to star in such 50s classics as Night and the City , Pickup on South Street and the western Broken Lance .
The craggy - faced actor died at his home in Connecticut on Monday , according to his wife Susan Blanchard .
His last film role came in the 1991 thriller True Colors , although he made occasional appearances afterwards in TV documentaries .
' Irritating ' " I now find the whole moviemaking process irritating , " he said in 1987 .
" I do n't have the patience any more . "
Born in Minnesota in 1914 , Widmark began his career in radio and theatre before playing cackling killer Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death .
His acclaimed movies included 1961 's Judgment at Nuremberg
The film landed him an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award for best newcomer - but he was not entirely enamoured with fame .
" That damned laugh of mine ! " he said in 1961 .
" For two years after that picture , you could n't get me to smile .
" I played the part the way I did because the script struck me as funny and the part I played made me laugh . "
Subsequent films included 1952's Don't Bother to Knock , in which he co-starred with Marilyn Monroe , and Cold War submarine drama The Bedford Incident , which he also produced .
Other notable roles included Judgment at Nuremberg in 1961 , How the West was Won the following year and Cheyenne Autumn in 1964 .
Detective Madigan , in which he played a loner detective , became a short - lived TV series in 1972 .
In the same decade , cinemagoers saw him murdered on the Orient Express and pursued by bees in The Swarm .
When not working , he and his second wife lived on a horse ranch in California or on their Connecticut farm .
His daughter from his first marriage - to writer Jean Hazlewood - became the wife of baseball star Sandy Koufax .

What are these ?
20,000 of these minuscule monsters could be in your duvet
Tests carried out on 10 duvets at the University of Worcester found they held up to 20,000 live house dust mites .
And a survey also revealed two - in - five Britons admitted to not washing duvets every six months .
The worst case was a duvet that had not been washed for 11 years and contained 45g of debris including skin scales and house dust mite faeces .
' Health implications '
" This content has serious implications for health as the contaminants can cause symptoms of asthma , rhinitis and conjunctivitis and irritate existing cases of eczema , " said Professor Jean Emberlin , director of the university 's national pollen and aerobiology research centre , which carried out the research .
Seven of the 10 duvets tested had never been washed - two of which were more than a decade old .
Most were synthetic and one was filled with feathers .
An additional survey of 1,000 people showed that 41 % did n't wash their duvet every six months .
Men appeared to be cleaner , with 36 % admitting they did n't clean their duvet every six months , compared to 51 % of women .
The research project was commissioned by Hotpoint Aqualtis .

Optimizing Ripples in Space - Time
While looking through the breakdown of nano warriors by strategy I noticed the absence of a decent 4 line paper , despite the success of 5 - liners like Fluffy 's Black Sun III .
I quickly hacked something up and added a quick - bomb to the beginning .
I tested with some hand - picked constants against Metcalf 's nano benchmark .
It scored 139.2 , or 129.8 with the quick - bomb removed .
; redcode - nano ; name hand coded paper ; author S.Fernandes ; strategy paper ; assert CORESIZE == 80 pstep equ 15 ipos equ 40 cpos equ - 5 dpos equ 35 mov > 60 , 10 paper spl # 0 , < pstep mov }paper , > paper mov >ipos , < cpos djn .f * pstep - 2 , < dpos end
Optimization
In the first round of optimization 400 warriors are generated with all constants randomized .
A small script is run over the source below replacing each exclamation mark with a random number .
The quick - bomb will be disabled until the final stage .
org paper pstep equ ( 4+!%73 ) ; range 4 - 76 ipos equ ( 2+!%70 ) ; range 2 - 71 cpos equ ( 8+!%70 ) ; range 8 - 77 dpos equ ( 7+!%70 ) ; range 7 - 76 mov > 27 , 54 paper spl # 0 , < pstep mov }paper , > paper mov >ipos , < cpos djn .f * pstep - 2 , < dpos end
I 've use modulo to restrict the range of random values to prevent self - bombing .
This reduces the search space by approximately 40 % .
While this may stop some interesting self - mutation or interaction being found , it 's really the author 's job not the optimizer 's to discover these .
The peak score is 139.5 .
Now we take a closer look at the top 10 results to compare the paper step .
- 17 occurs four times , - 18 twice and - 15 , - 22 , - 25 and 33 once .
For stage 2 we generate 100 warriors for each of the above paper steps with all other constants randomized .
The peak score is 145.8 with pstep - 22 followed by 145.0 with pstep - 17 .
The top two warriors from stage 2 are taken and their cpos optimized in stage 3 .
All 70 values are tested for each warrior .
The peak score for the warrior with pstep - 22 remains at 145.8 .
The score for the warrior with pstep - 17 improves to 145.7 .
In stage 4 we take the top warrior for each pstep from stage 3 and optimize dpos .
The scores increase to 146.2 ( pstep - 22 ) and 145.8 ( pstep - 17 ) .
In stage 5 we optimize ipos .
The scores go up to 146.8 ( pstep - 22 ) and 149.2 ( pstep - 17 ) .
Finally the quick - bomb is enabled and its two constants optimized .
400 random pair of quick - bomb constants are generated .
The final benchmark scores are 158.3 ( pstep - 22 ) and 159.2 ( pstep - 17 ) .
Submission to SAL's Nano Hill
Although the benchmark scores are impressive , the hill contains 50 completely different warriors .
If the benchmark reflects the hill well , the scores should be within 10 % .
The paper with pstep - 22 scores 146.2 and takes 6th place .
With pstep - 17 however the score is 152.3 and 4th place .
Here 's the final code :
; redcode - nano ; name ripples in space - time ; author S.Fernandes ; strategy paper ; assert CORESIZE == 80 pstep equ - 17 ipos equ 10 cpos equ - 33 dpos equ 36 mov >- 39 , 25 paper spl # 0 , < pstep mov }paper , > paper mov >ipos , < cpos djn .f * pstep - 2 , < dpos end

Sophie Lancaster had tried to protect her boyfriend
Blending in and staying anonymous in an age where gang mentality is increasingly commonplace seems the safer option .
Ade Varney , a Goth since the age of 17 , says that the reality is that the abuse aimed at Goths is alarmingly regular .
Following Sophie Lancaster 's killing in a Lancashire park , he is campaigning to have the definition of hate crime to include offences against people based on their appearance or subcultural interests .
A regular at the Whitby Goth weekend , which Miss Lancaster and her boyfriend Rob Maltby also attended , Mr Varney has also been among those who have helped put a memorial bench in place for Miss Lancaster .
He said : " We decided it only fitting that she had a memorial not only in the place where she and Rob had once enjoyed but also a place where Goths frequent , so they can pay their respects when there . "
Miss Lancaster , 20 , suffered fatal injuries when she and Mr Maltby were attacked in Stubbylee Park in Bacup in August last year .
Preston Crown
Court heard they were attacked by teenagers purely because they were dressed as Goths .
You have to search hard to find a Goth who is violent in nature and even harder still to find one who has not been targeted in some way
Ade Varney
Mr Varney said : " Among a bunch of young kids , who should n't even have been out at night , were some teenagers , who operated with an 'us and them ' gang mentality .
" We get verbal assaults every day , and not just from young people .
But now younger teenagers have the mentality of hardened criminals and I definitely sense this violent aspect getting worse .
" It 's often exacerbated by misconceptions about what Goths are .
" Goth teenagers can tend to be bookish , quiet and thoughtful .
As a result they can sometimes become distanced from the majority and become targeted .
" In my experience of over 20 years , as a general rule , you have to search hard to find a Goth who is violent in nature and even harder still to find one who has not been targeted in some way .
" These packs so often see a slightly built guy on his own , wearing make - up and to them , he is fair game , an easy target to bully .
It is happening to girls now , more than ever .
Robert Maltby was seriously injured
" Sophie and Rob were young and happy together and at that age , you sometimes think nothing bad can ever happen to you .
I 've been there myself .
" They may not have been able to conceive that anyone could be so cruel .
I 'm sure they had no idea what hit them at first .
It appears they had virtually no chance to react or defend themselves . "
The attack happened only moments after the pair had a " good - natured " conversation with other youngsters in the park .
Mr Varney started a petition to expand the definition of hate crime and has gathered more than 4,000 signatures .
" I would say I get some sort of abuse most days , whether alone or with friends .
Some might be light - hearted , but it 's never fully good - natured .
Memorial bench
" People think that we dress like this just to stand out .
We might stand out , but it 's not to shock .
It 's a choice and we like it - it 's more about what we want to be for ourselves , than anything else .
" Sophie 's death has made people think and I have heard of teenagers , especially girls , modifying the way they dress when they walk though certain areas . "

Rudy Giuliani has a new ad in New Hampshire and Florida , the only two January states left that he 's contesting .
The ad's message is simple , and shows just how blatant the Rudy campaign has become in their appeals to fear — that if we do n't vote for Rudy , we 'll be vulnerable to Osama Bin Laden , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the people who assassinated Benazir Bhutto , and every other radical Muslim villain out there ... read on
And why is n't Rudy criticizing Bush for not getting Osama ?
Is he afraid Condi might diss him too ?
Sometime after midnight on September 6 , 2007 , at least four low - flying Israeli Air Force fighters crossed into Syrian airspace and carried out a secret bombing mission on the banks of the Euphrates River , about ninety miles north of the Iraq border .
The seemingly unprovoked bombing , which came after months of heightened tension between Israel and Syria over military exercises and troop buildups by both sides along the Golan Heights , was , by almost any definition , an act of war .
But in the immediate aftermath nothing was heard from the government of Israel .
In contrast , in 1981 , when the Israeli Air Force destroyed Iraq ’s Osirak nuclear reactor , near Baghdad , the Israeli government was triumphant , releasing reconnaissance photographs of the strike and permitting the pilots to be widely interviewed .
Israel and the U.S. have avoided comment on press reports about a nuclear facility .
Illustration by Guy Billout
Within hours of the attack , Syria denounced Israel for invading its airspace , but its public statements were incomplete and contradictory — thus adding to the mystery .
A Syrian military spokesman said only that Israeli planes had dropped some munitions in an unpopulated area after being challenged by Syrian air defenses , “ which forced them to flee . ”
Four days later , Walid Moallem , the Syrian foreign minister , said during a state visit to Turkey that the Israeli aircraft had used live ammunition in the attack , but insisted that there were no casualties or property damage .
It was not until October 1st that Syrian President Bashar Assad , in an interview with the BBC , acknowledged that the Israeli warplanes had hit their target , which he described as an “ unused military building . ”
Assad added that Syria reserved the right to retaliate , but his comments were muted .
Despite official silence in Tel Aviv ( and in Washington ) , in the days after the bombing the American and European media were flooded with reports , primarily based on information from anonymous government sources , claiming that Israel had destroyed a nascent nuclear reactor that was secretly being assembled in Syria , with the help of North Korea .
Beginning construction of a nuclear reactor in secret would be a violation of Syria ’s obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and could potentially yield material for a nuclear weapon .
The evidence was circumstantial but seemingly damning .
The first reports of Syrian and North Korean nuclear coöperation came on September 12th in the Times and elsewhere .
By the end of October , the various media accounts generally agreed on four points : the Israeli intelligence community had learned of a North Korean connection to a construction site in an agricultural area in eastern Syria ; three days before the bombing , a “ North Korean ship , ” identified as the Al Hamed , had arrived at the Syrian port of Tartus , on the Mediterranean ; satellite imagery strongly suggested that the building under construction was designed to hold a nuclear reactor when completed ; as such , Syria had crossed what the Israelis regarded as the “ red line ” on the path to building a bomb , and had to be stopped .
There were also reports — by ABC News and others — that some of the Israeli intelligence had been shared in advance with the United States , which had raised no objection to the bombing .
The Israeli government still declined to make any statement about the incident .
Military censorship on dispatches about the raid was imposed for several weeks , and the Israeli press resorted to recycling the disclosures in the foreign press .
In the first days after the attack , there had been many critical stories in the Israeli press speculating about the bombing , and the possibility that it could lead to a conflict with Syria .
Larry Derfner , a columnist writing in the Jerusalem Post , described the raid as “ the sort of thing that starts wars . ”
But , once reports about the nuclear issue and other details circulated , the domestic criticism subsided .
At a news conference on September 20th , President George W. Bush was asked about the incident four times but said , “ I ’m not going to comment on the matter . ”
The lack of official statements became part of the story .
“ The silence from all parties has been deafening , ” David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post , “ but the message to Iran ” — which the Administration had long suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapon — “ is clear : America and Israel can identify nuclear targets and penetrate air defenses to destroy them . ”
It was evident that officials in Israel and the United States , although unwilling to be quoted , were eager for the news media to write about the bombing .
Early on , a former officer in the Israel Defense Forces with close contacts in Israeli intelligence approached me , with a version of the standard story , including colorful but , as it turned out , unconfirmable details : Israeli intelligence tracking the ship from the moment it left a North Korean port ; Syrian soldiers wearing protective gear as they off - loaded the cargo ; Israeli intelligence monitoring trucks from the docks to the target site .
On October 3rd , the London Spectator , citing much of the same information , published an overheated account of the September 6th raid , claiming that it “ may have saved the world from a devastating threat , ” and that “ a very senior British ministerial source ” had warned , “ If people had known how close we came to World War Three that day there ’d have been mass panic . ”
However , in three months of reporting for this article , I was repeatedly told by current and former intelligence , diplomatic , and congressional officials that they were not aware of any solid evidence of ongoing nuclear - weapons programs in Syria .
It is possible that Israel conveyed intelligence directly to senior members of the Bush Administration , without it being vetted by intelligence agencies .
( This process , known as “ stovepiping , ” overwhelmed U.S. intelligence before the war in Iraq . )
But Mohamed ElBaradei , the director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations group responsible for monitoring compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , said , “ Our experts who have carefully analyzed the satellite imagery say it is unlikely that this building was a nuclear facility . ”
Joseph Cirincione , the director for nuclear policy at the Center for American Progress , a Washington , D.C. , think tank , told me , “ Syria does not have the technical , industrial , or financial ability to support a nuclear - weapons program .
I ’ve been following this issue for fifteen years , and every once in a while a suspicion arises and we investigate and there ’s nothing .
There was and is no nuclear - weapons threat from Syria .
This is all political . ”
Cirincione castigated the press corps for its handling of the story .
“ I think some of our best journalists were used , ” he said .
A similar message emerged at briefings given to select members of Congress within weeks of the attack .
The briefings , conducted by intelligence agencies , focussed on what Washington knew about the September 6th raid .
One concern was whether North Korea had done anything that might cause the U.S. to back away from ongoing six -nation talks about its nuclear program .
A legislator who took part in one such briefing said afterward , according to a member of his staff , that he had heard nothing that caused him “ to have any doubts ” about the North Korean negotiations — “ nothing that should cause a pause . ”
The legislator ’s conclusion , the staff member said , was “ There ’s nothing that proves any perfidy involving the North Koreans . ”
Morton Abramowitz , a former Assistant Secretary of State for intelligence and research , told me that he was astonished by the lack of response .
“ Anytime you bomb another state , that ’s a big deal , ” he said .
“ But where ’s the outcry , particularly from the concerned states and the U.N. ?
Something ’s amiss . ”
Israel could , of course , have damning evidence that it refuses to disclose .
But there are serious and unexamined contradictions in the various published accounts of the September 6th bombing .
The main piece of evidence to emerge publicly that Syria was building a reactor arrived on October 23rd , when David Albright , of the Institute for Science and International Security , a highly respected nonprofit research group , released a satellite image of the target .
The photograph had been taken by a commercial satellite company , DigitalGlobe , of Longmont , Colorado , on August 10th , four weeks before the bombing , and showed a square building and a nearby water - pumping station .
In an analysis released at the same time , Albright , a physicist who served as a weapons inspector in Iraq , concluded that the building , as viewed from space , had roughly the same length and width as a reactor building at Yongbyon , North Korea ’s main nuclear facility .
“ The tall building in the image may house a reactor under construction and the pump station along the river may have been intended to supply cooling water to the reactor , ” Albright said .
He concluded his analysis by posing a series of rhetorical questions that assumed that the target was a nuclear facility :
How far along was the reactor construction project when it was bombed ?
What was the extent of nuclear assistance from North Korea ?
Which reactor components did Syria obtain from North Korea or elsewhere , and where are they now ?
He was later quoted in the Washington Post saying , “ I ’m pretty convinced that Syria was trying to build a nuclear reactor . ”
“ Maybe this is n’t the right heartless monolithic corporation for you . ”

Shopping
When I asked Albright how he had pinpointed the target , he told me that he and a colleague , Paul Brannan , “ did a lot of hard work ” — culling press reports and poring over DigitalGlobe imagery — “ before coming up with the site . ”
Albright then shared his findings with Robin Wright and other journalists at the Post , who , after checking with Administration officials , told him that the building was , indeed , the one targeted by the Israelis .
“ We did not release the information until we got direct confirmation from the Washington Post , ” he told me .
The Post ’s sources in the Administration , he understood , had access to far more detailed images obtained by U.S. intelligence satellites .
The Post ran a story , without printing the imagery , on October 19th , reporting that “ U.S. and foreign officials familiar with the aftermath of the attack ” had concluded that the site had the “ signature , ” or characteristics , of a reactor “ similar in structure to North Korea ’s facilities ” — a conclusion with which Albright then agreed .
In other words , the Albright and the Post reports , which appeared to independently reinforce each other , stemmed in part from the same sources .

Yep , the shame of custody is par for the course in Amurkan elections now .
And John Dean ( not the sausage dude ) points out that of the last 9 recessions in the US , republican preznits presided over 8 of them .
Those 8 - 1 odds are about what I give for election reform of the meaningful kind to take place in Amurka anytime soon .
No more money left to waste on junk machines .
The congress and preznit blush are over tazzering the cadaver of the Amurkan economy hoping it will magically transform into the American economy they inherited .

Buck -
It does n't matter .
Both Sally Castleman and Kathy Greenwell got video of the seal on the door peeling of like a post -it .
And apparently this kind of sham seal is not new in elections - They used it in San Diego in the presidential primary in 2004 .
The producers of " Hacking Democracy " have footage of this in a preliminary 30 - minute film they put out called " Votergate . "
I would like to challenge you to go to your local office supply store --- forget special security seal distributors --- and just buy any old printable label stock .
Stick it on a box as gently as you wish , and you 'll see you can't peel it up that way .
These so - called " seals " were made to be easy to reaffix .
Note that the tape does n't even wrinkle or adhere to itself when you peel it off .
Just as the secretary of state 's office KNEW of Ken Hajjar 's criminal record when they allowed his firm , LHS Associates , a sole source vendor status to code every memory card in New Hampshire , they KNEW of this issue with the seals .

It 's time to go after that New Hampshire SOS , and other SOS's , ROV's , and bad legislation in EVERY state .
Time is ticking , and barely anything has been solved since HAVA .
( except for in a few places )
So really non action and continued arguing is only going to slow everything down long enough for bad counts , and the wrong candidates sworn in .
If that 's what you want keep fighting the people that are fighting for your rights .
Cause the corruption ain't gonna stop until they ruin the rest of America .
And the rest of America is looking for someone else to do the work to protect them .
They do n't realize that person to protect America is looking at them in the mirror .
But just like all the rest of the news , you 'll probably forget all this in an hour or two when the American version of the Central American " deathsquads " go out ( American style ) on broadcast tv know as " time wasting sitcoms " , and " other junk news like Britney . "

Look a lot more closely at David Scanlan , who handles ballot chain of custody .
I have just learned that it was Scanlan who decided to delay and shut down the recount next week , and this was apparently done WITHOUT the knowledge of Gardner .
Bill Gardner has reportedly reinstated the recount .
I think Gardner got boxed in .
Question is , by whom ?

Before the next November election , the US people must take back control of their OWN system of elections to ensure that the candidate who wins the most votes of their election is actually the person who takes the oath of office .
The American people need to abolish all electronic computer voting machines that are all hackable as well as permanently eliminate computer voting companies who count the US votes in secrecy .
Currently , a computer voting company assumes complete and total control of counting the electronically cast votes and without any oversite at all .
Forget about the old electoral college for now .
Except for the handicapped vote , we need paper ballot trails and full transparency of the vote counting process with any age Americans allowed to view as long as they 're not disruptive .
Paper ballots should be kept in special US safety containment boxes that are locked up and stored at an approved state voting storage facility for safe keeping .
Even transportation of the ballot boxes should be by an armored car voting transport vehicle to protect the chain of custody in case a recount is required .
America needs to have a new national holiday every 2 years to ensure democracy and it can be called Voter 's Day .
No one has to die to get honored for it 's celebration , just the death of how US elections are run until these changes occur .
If you 're American , you vote , you get the day off with pay !
If it takes a new domestic revolution to force the corrupted in power to fix the broken US election system this summer then i will fight .
I will fight for the unknown American soldier giving his life in bush 's Imperialistic illegal conflicts to protect my American constitutional rights and values in Afganistan and Iraq .

John Y , In my opinion , A hava compliant machine only needed to assist the disabled print a paper ballot .
It did n't need to tabulate votes electronically .
Say the military want 's a part built .
They give specs , specific instructions of what they want .
The slightest deviance and the part will be rejected .
But in at each polling precinct ( a plethora of chaos ) there were no specific instructions , no specs .
Just an open market full of the cheapest junk garbage without the slightest plan about security , until forcibly tacked on half - measured as an after thought .
What this nation needs is a team that has the power of authority oversight over all these ( plethora of chaos nonsense precincts ) and to assemble a team that will produce standards for ALL polling places .
With chain of custody and security considered first and where cost of no concern or tacked on as an after thought .
Every application on your windows ( or linux ) desktop does n't need to have email and automatic updates built into it .
Sol does n't need email capability , and neither does etherape on linux .
Voting machines do n't have to have electronic tabulation .
They just needed to be a glorified printer for someone having trouble voting .
Beyond these machines , as we are seeing now , is the chain of custody of the paper , and the fast tracking of the swearing in of a candidate based on counts either reported by the media or unvalidatable altogether .
Mix that up with election fraud , caging , the lack of any common sense to deal with it like nullifying a corrupted election .
And we are where we are .
Both democrats and republicans are guilty of the same .
It 's like we need a citizen oversight taskforce with the power of the cops behind US or something .
Then say when some issue like this nonsense with these seals comes up , they ( all parties in the taskforce agree ) to use some damn superglue !
Or when ballots are not being put into a secure vault , ( The taskforce agrees ) and says NO , were putting these ballots in a vault , and it will be guarded 24/7 by the taskforce .
This is just nuts man .
We have lost our right to vote .
It 's no wonder I get angry at times .
Enough time has passed to fix this problem .
If I had to hold elections for the BLOCK on my neighborhood , I could do it without ANY money !
And it would be 100 % accurate and there 'd be no need for all this nonsense .
I mean come on .
A lot of disabled folks have their OWN computer , why can't we use that to print a ballot ?!
Plug in a damn printer on their USB / parallel / 1394 whatever port .
We just need a printer that can print and wo n't fail if the power goes out .
This is stupid .
These people buying these machines are stupid , if the law was bad , the second they saw that it should have been nullified .
Come on man we are not enemies , WE ARE AMERICANS .

We have much less time to accomplish this goal than most people have been led to believe .
The good news is we still can save over 1 million species from extinction if we quickly pull together as a team to lower these harmful greenhouse gases heating up the planet .
For example , if we took the attitude that moving forward , we are going to immediately give business incentives and create jobs to get people to start changing the way they use and create energy , we could mandate a plan to lower carbon dioxide emissions that melted the North Pole 3 times the size of Texas last year .
We want change and we want it now !
We want to end the US pre-emptive war for oil and prosecute the bush administration for many treasonous crimes such as selling nuclear secrets to Pakistan .
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds named 25 high level officials involved and while this story has experienced a complete BLACKED OUT by all US mass media sources , it has been front page new around the world since reported in the British Times .
Traitors in the US government have used the corporate mass media as their personal tool to repeatedly lied and mislead the American people , therefore , must be charged with high crimes and misdemenors .
We want to end the US occupation of Iraq and change our direction to keeping peace , promoting conservation , and habitat preservation .
Once America changes it stance from aggressor to defender , we can begin to repair our relationship with all world countries .
Strong charasmatic leadership and vigilance will rid the world of nuclear weapons although we must acknowledge that the work of the bush government has caused some massive irreversable damage to our country and world in crisis .
I just want to ad a plug for Dennis Kusinich for President because while I did n't get the lowdown on his campaign from his website , I 'm totally for waving the white flag to become the great defender once again .

The Romney Whisper heard on MSNBC debate :
That voice heard whispering is none other than Mitt's .
Now the MSM needs to admit for a FACT that all of the candidates are provided with the questions IN ADVANCE .
Clearly he was provided the questions in advance , and this was his own prepared reminder - played back to him when he wanted to hear it .
Mitt likely had a wireless ear piece and a transmitting device in his hand that he alone could activate - which contained prerecorded brief prompts to get him heading in the right direction with his answers .
His own wireless microphone channel ( on the podium ) picked up the signal that was transmitted from his recorded answer to his ear piece as a digital audio signal and it played through the house speakers and on television .
That whispered voice IS Mitt Romney .

I 've never spent much time at DU but I 'm appalled the rest of the netroots like DKOS is also so vehement in their defense of the SOS and the way they run their elections in NH .
They regurgitate his statements and articles from the Manchester Union Leader without even factchecking them .
They call that the reality based community ?
Bev I know you 've been abrasive in the past .
I remember reading one of your accounts of trying to get election officials in a FL jurisdiction after 2004 to provide info and it sounded like you were driving them batshit crazy .
A lot of confrontation rather than cooperation right from the start .
Ca n't say I blame them or you .
Nobody wants outsiders coming in telling them how to do their jobs .
It 's hard to politely tell someone they 're incompetent or worse .
I did n't see any of that antagonism in this video with the zombified , stonewalling Gardner .
There has to be some way to get this news out there .
Every time I engage people and point them to the videos on Bradblog , or invoke Bev Harris 's name there 's a whole hoard of them ready to pounce as if I 'm citing a Dick Cheney speech .
I have n't kept up much with the blog battles about this stuff but it does n't look like we 're winning them .
I just went thru one with DHinMI , MarkinHudsonValley , and another guy at Kos and it 's frustrating .
They closed their minds , locked themselves into their positions before Kucinich even called for a recount and wo n't even bother to look at the evidence .
For the life of me , after FL
2000 , OH 2004 , Fl again in 2006 I can't figure out why .
You do n't have to believe goofy stuff like Gardner is secretly a Republican or even someone threw the NH election to Hillary to know just by looking at the evidence that NH runs a crappy election on the cheap , and that their recount procedures are a joke .

Theoretically , is n't it possible to force a hand count in every state if someone ( a brave hacker patriot ? ) would admit ( lie ) that he / she hacked the voting system somehow ?
If they can't disprove it , then they can't ignore it completely and they 'll have to recount the votes by hand .
I simplified it a little , but am I wrong ?
A good person goes to jail , but saves the world .
Well , one for each state actually .

I believe the Senator from CA was - can't remember her name - was the only one , maybe Conyers too ( I can't remember ! ) made exception .
For 2008 , for crying out loud , if the election smells like fraud - do n't certify it !!!

sadunkal on 9/11/2006 of all dates I was finally able to meet with my Republican congresswoman Judy Biggert along with the Illinois exec director of Votetrust USA after bugging her office for a month .
We were there to try to convince her to support Rush Holt 's election reform bill .
My argument was that she could get on board his bill as a co sponsor or wait til we took over congress and deal with a Stubbs Jones bill she really hated .
I told her that there was a very real fear that these machines were so insecure that someday just to make a point a hacker would see to it that a Denny Hastert would lose to Mickey Mouse and not a John Laesch .
Advocating breaking the law by hacking the machines is not only wrong it 's self defeating .
Any such action would give this issue to the Republicans .
If you like what they did with emergency disaster management after Katrina you 'll love how they handle election reform .

Which Holt bill ?
The fatally flawed and literally unworkable H.R.811 ?
Or his improved but still flawed H.R.5036 ?

I 'm sure the Holt noise machine is still screaming at someone ... somwhere ... that terrible bills will be passed if Holt 's bill is n't passed " NOW !

Of course there really are bills in committee that are actually worse than Holt 's efforts ... but that 's still not a good reason for making bad law on matters that are so vital to this country .
As for myself ?

Holt strikes out again ?
1 . Audits are only conducted at the whim of the jurisdiction .
2 . Audits are to cover fixed percentage of votes [ 3 % ] .
So jurisdictions afflicted with fraudsters do n’t audit .
And innocent jurisdictions do not get a really robust audit plan .
Fixed percentage designs are considered worst when elections are close ...
It is true that the bill requires NIST to approve proposed alternative audit plans submitted by jurisdictions .
But jurisdictions needing more robust plans will not necessarily [ a ] realize it [ there are 180,000 , remember ; and many are uncomfortable with statistics and especially with arguing about them with politicians ] or [ b ] wish to set a higher standard .

Yeah but ...
1 . ) Holt has insisted that H.R. 811 is " waiting in the wings " ( as I 've said elsewhere , it 's more like a crazed thespian being restrained by stagehands ) ... in other words he insists that Holt 's Fiasco is good to go as far as he 's concerned , and he seems to have learned nothing from its failure to pass so far .
Not a good sign for anything else he may write on this particular subject .
2 . ) Holt 's new bill H.R.5036 , while a definite improvement over 811 , does not supercede or supplant his old bill and some of 5036's flaws are actually designed to blend it in with the eventual passage of the old , unacceptable , bill .
So when people talk about endorsing Holt 's Fiasco , even in passing , without debate or acknowledging its many documented flaws ... the board lights up red and alarm klaxons start going off .
It 's not that I , myself , would discourage mention of the old bill at all ... it's that the severe reality disconnect imbedded in the supporters of the bill by Holt 's deliberate ( and documented ) gaming of the election integrity movement hangs like a pall over mention of anything connected to the bill .
And that disconnect is something to be corrected and discouraged , I believe .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -

Analysis of seized samples of marijuana and hashish showed that more of the cannabis on the market is of the strongest grade , the White House and National Institute for Drug Abuse said .
They cited data from the University of Mississippi ’s Marijuana Potency Project showing the average levels of THC , the active ingredient in marijuana , in the products rose from 7 percent in 2003 to 8.5 percent in 2006 .
The level had risen steadily from 3.5 percent in 1988 .
National Institute on Drug Abuse Director Dr. Nora
Volkow fears the problem is not being taken seriously because many adults remember the marijuana of their youth as harmless .
“ It ’s really not the same type of marijuana , ” Volkow said in a telephone interview .
“ This could explain why there has been an increase in the number of medical emergencies involving marijuana . ”
The pharmacy department at Mississippi has compiled data on 59,369 samples of cannabis , 1,225 hashish samples , and 443 hash oil samples confiscated since 1975 .
“ The highest concentration of ( THC ) found in a cannabis ( marijuana ) sample is 33.12 percent from Oregon State Police , ” the report reads .
‘ THIS IS POT 2.0 ’
Hashish and hash oil concentrations are far higher , as they consist of processed plant product .
“ Researchers and treatment experts have argued for some time that today ’s more powerful marijuana has more harmful effects on users .
This report underscores that we are no longer talking about the drug of the 1960s and 1970s -- this is Pot 2.0 , ” John Walters , director of National Drug Control Policy , said in a statement .
Volkow said demand has driven growers to cultivate the stronger stuff .
“ It is the market , ” she said .
“ Like in the market you favor the best tomatoes .
When people buy marijuana , they do n’t want a weak cigarette . ”
Volkow ’s institute has been studying the effects of cannabis , whose active ingredients are very similar to important brain chemicals called endogenous cannabinoids .
“ It clearly is addictive , ” she said .
If children and adolescents use marijuana , it could affect their still - developing brains , she said .
The report said more than 60 percent of teens receiving treatment for drug abuse or dependence report marijuana as their primary drug of abuse .
“ Although the overall number of young people using marijuana has declined in recent years , there is still reason for great concern , particularly since roughly 60 percent of first - time marijuana users are under 18 years old , ” Volkow said .
According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 4.1 million Americans , or 1.7 percent of the population , report they use marijuana .
Several years ago in Johannesburg I met a Jewish woman whose mother and sister were murdered in Auschwitz .
After their deaths , she was forced into a gas chamber , but by some miracle that bout of killing was called off .
Vera Reitzer survived the extermination camp , married soon after the war and moved to South Africa .
Reitzer joined the apartheid Nationalist party ( NP ) in the early 1950s , at about the time that the new prime minister , DF Malan , was introducing legislation reminiscent of Hitler 's Nuremberg laws against Jews : the population registration act that classified South Africans according to race , legislation that forbade sex and marriage across the colour line and laws barring black people from many jobs .
Reitzer saw no contradiction in surviving the Holocaust only to sign up for a system that was disturbingly reminiscent in its underpinning philosophy , if not in the scale of its crimes , as the one she had outlived .
She vigorously defended apartheid as a necessary bulwark against black domination and the communism that engulfed her native Yugoslavia .
Reitzer let slip that she thought Africans inferior to other human beings and not entitled to be treated as equals .
I asked if Hitler had n't said the same thing about her as a Jew .
She called a halt to the conversation .
Reitzer was unusual among Jewish South Africans in her open enthusiasm for apartheid and for her membership of the NP .
But she was an accepted member of the Jewish community in Johannesburg , working for the Holocaust survivors association , while Jews who fought the system were frequently ostracised by their own community .
Many Israelis recoil at suggestions that their country , risen from the ashes of genocide and built on Jewish ideals , could be compared to a racist regime .
Yet for years the bulk of South Africa 's Jews not only failed to challenge the apartheid system but benefited and thrived under its protection , even if some of their number figured prominently in the liberation movements .
In time , Israeli governments too set aside objections to a regime whose leaders had once been admirers of Adolf Hitler .
Within three decades of its birth , Israel 's self - proclaimed " purity of arms " - what it describes as the moral superiority of its soldiers - was secretly sacrificed as the fate of the Jewish state became so intertwined with South Africa that the Israeli security establishment came to believe the relationship saved the Jewish state .
Afrikaner anti-semitism
Apartheid sought to segregate every aspect of life from the workplace to the bedroom , even though whites in practice were dependent on black people as a workforce and servants .
Segregation evolved into " separate development " and the bantustans - the five nominally " independent " homelands where millions of black people were dumped under the rule of despots beholden to Pretoria .
When the Nationalist party government first gained power in Pretoria in 1948 , the Jews of South Africa - the bulk of them descendants of refugees from 19th - century pogroms in Lithuania and Latvia - had reason to be wary .
A decade before Malan became the first apartheid - era prime minister , he was leading opposition to Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany entering South Africa .
In promoting legislation to block immigration , Malan told parliament in 1937 : " I have been reproached that I am now discriminating against the Jews as Jews .
Now let me say frankly that I admit that it is so . "
South African anti-semitism had grown with the rise of Jews to prominence in the 1860s , during the Kimberly diamond rush .
At the turn of the century , the Manchester Guardian 's correspondent , JA Hobson , reflected a view that the Boer war was being fought in the interests of a " small group of international financiers , chiefly German in origin and Jewish in race " .
Fifty years later , Malan 's cabinet saw similar conspiracies .
Hendrik Verwoerd , editor of the virulently anti-semitic newspaper , Die Transvaler , and future author of " grand apartheid " , accused Jews of controlling the economy .
Before the second world war , the secret Afrikaner society , the Broederbond - which included Malan and Verwoerd as members - developed ties to the Nazis .
Another Broederbond member and future prime minister , John Vorster , was interned in a prison camp by Jan Smuts 's government during the war for his Nazi sympathies and ties to the Grey Shirt fascist militia .
Don Krausz , chairman of Johannesburg 's Holocaust survivors association , arrived in South Africa a year after the war , having survived Hitler 's camps at Ravensbrück and Sachsenhausen when much of his extended family did not .
" The Nationalists had a strongly anti-semitic platform before 1948 .
The Afrikaans press was viciously anti-Jewish , much like Der Stürmer in Germany under Hitler .
The Jew felt himself very much threatened by the Afrikaner .
The Afrikaner supported Hitler , " he says .
" My wife comes from Potchefstroom [ in what was then the Transvaal ] .
Every Jewish shop in that town was blown up by the Grey Shirts .
In the communities that were predominantly Afrikaans , the Jews were absolutely victimised .
Now the same crowd comes to power in 1948 .
The Jew was a very frightened person .
There were cabinet ministers who openly supported the Nazis . "
Helen Suzman , a secular Jew , was for many years the only anti-apartheid voice in parliament .
" They did n't fear there would be a Holocaust but they did fear there might be Nuremberg - style laws , the kind that prevented people practising their professions .
The incoming government had made it clear that race differentiation was going to be intensified , and the Jews did n't know where they were going to fit into that , " she says .
Many South African
Jews were soon reassured that , while there would be Nuremberg - style laws , they would not be the victims .
The apartheid regime had a demographic problem and it could not afford the luxury of isolating a section of the white population , even if it was Jewish .
Within a few years many South African Jews not only came to feel secure under the new order but comfortable with it .
Some found echoes of Israel 's struggle in the revival of Afrikaner nationalism .
Many Afrikaners saw the Nationalist party 's election victory as liberation from bitterly hated British rule .
British concentration camps in South Africa may not have matched the scale or intent of Hitler 's war against the Jews , but the deaths of 25,000 women and children from disease and starvation were deeply rooted in Afrikaner nationalism , in the way the memory of the Holocaust is now central to Israel 's perception of itself .
The white regime said that the lesson was for Afrikaners to protect their interests or face destruction .
" What the Nats were trying to do was protect the Afrikaner , " says Krausz .
" Especially after what was done to them in the Boer war , where the Afrikaner was reduced almost to a beggar on returning after the war , whether it was from the battlefield or some sort of concentration camp .
They did it to protect the Afrikaner , his predominance after 1948 , his culture . "
There was also God .
The Dutch Reformed Church , prising justifications for apartheid out of the Old Testament and Afrikaner history , seized on the victory over the Zulus at the battle of Blood River as confirming that the Almighty sided with the white man .
" Israelis claim that they are the chosen people , the elect of God , and find a biblical justification for their racism and Zionist exclusivity , " says Ronnie Kasrils , South Africa 's intelligence minister and Jewish co-author of a petition that was circulated amongst South African Jewry protesting at the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory .
" This is just like the Afrikaners of apartheid South Africa , who also had the biblical notion that the land was their God - given right .
Like the Zionists who claimed that Palestine in the 1940s was ' a land without people for a people without land ' , so the Afrikaner settlers spread the myth that there were no black people in South Africa when they first settled in the 17th century .
They conquered by force of arms and terror and the provocation of a series of bloody colonial wars of conquest . "
Anti-semitism lingered , but within a few years of the Nationalists assuming power in 1948 , many Jewish South Africans found common purpose with the rest of the white community .
" We were white and even though the Afrikaner was no friend of ours , he was still white , " says Krausz .
" The Jew in South Africa sided with the Afrikaners , not so much out of sympathy , but out of fear sided against the blacks .
I came to this country in 1946 and all you could hear from Jews was ' the blacks this and the blacks that ' .
And I said to them , ' You know , I 've heard exactly the same from the Nazis about you . '
The laws were reminiscent of the Nuremberg laws .
Separate entrances ; ' Reserved for whites ' here ; ' Not for Jews ' there . "
For decades , the Zionist Federation and Jewish Board of Deputies in South Africa honoured men such as Percy Yutar , who prosecuted Nelson Mandela for sabotage and conspiracy against the state in 1963 and sent him to jail for life ( in the event , he served 27 years ) .
Yutar went on to become attorney general of the Orange Free State and then of the Transvaal .
He was elected president of Johannesburg 's largest orthodox synagogue .
Some Jewish leaders hailed him as a " credit to the community " and a symbol of the Jews ' contribution to South Africa .
" The image of the Jews was that they were following Helen Suzman , " says Alon Liel , a former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria .
" I think the majority did n't like what apartheid was doing to the blacks but enjoyed the fruits of the system and thought that maybe that 's the only way to run a country like South Africa . "
The Jewish establishment shied away from confrontation with the government .
The declared policy of the Board of Deputies was " neutrality " so as not to " endanger " the Jewish population .
Those Jews who saw silence as collaboration with racial oppression , and did something about it outside of the mainstream political system , were shunned .
" They were mostly disapproved of very strongly because it was felt they were putting the community in danger , " says Suzman .
" The Board of Deputies always said that every Jew can exercise his freedom to choose his political party but bear in mind what it is doing to the community .
By and large , Jews were part of the privileged white community and that led many Jews to say , ' We will not rock the boat . ' "
Common aims
Israel was openly critical of apartheid through the 1950s and 60s as it built alliances with post - colonial African governments .
But most African states broke ties after the 1973 Yom Kippur war and the government in Jerusalem began to take a more benign view of the isolated regime in Pretoria .
The relationship changed so profoundly that , in 1976 , Israel invited the South African prime minister , John Vorster - a former Nazi sympathiser and a commander of the fascist Ossewabrandwag that sided with Hitler - to make a state visit .
Leaving unmentioned Vorster 's wartime internment for supporting Germany , Israel 's prime minister , Yitzhak Rabin , hailed the South African premier as a force for freedom and made no mention of Vorster 's past as he toured the Jerusalem memorial to the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis .
At a state banquet , Rabin toasted " the ideals shared by Israel and South Africa : the hopes for justice and peaceful coexistence " .
Both countries , he said , faced " foreign - inspired instability and recklessness " .
Vorster , whose army was then overrunning Angola , told his hosts that South Africa and Israel were victims of the enemies of western civilisation .
A few months later , the South African government 's yearbook characterised the two countries as confronting a single problem : " Israel and South Africa have one thing above all else in common : they are both situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples . "
Vorster 's visit laid the ground for a collaboration that transformed the Israel - South Africa axis into a leading weapons developer and a force in the international arms trade .
Liel , who headed the Israeli foreign ministry 's South Africa desk in the 80s , says that the Israeli security establishment came to believe that the Jewish state may not have survived without the relationship with the Afrikaners .
" We created the South African arms industry , " says Liel .
" They assisted us to develop all kinds of technology because they had a lot of money .
When we were developing things together we usually gave the know - how and they gave the money .
After 1976 , there was a love affair between the security establishments of the two countries and their armies .
" We were involved in Angola as consultants to the [ South African ] army .
You had Israeli officers there cooperating with the army .
The link was very intimate . "
Alongside the state - owned factories turning out materiel for South Africa was Kibbutz Beit Alfa , which developed a profitable industry selling anti-riot vehicles for use against protesters in the black townships .
Going nuclear
The biggest secret of all was the nuclear one .
Israel provided expertise and technology that was central to South Africa 's development of its nuclear bombs .
Israel was embarrassed enough about its close association with a political movement rooted in racial ideology to keep the military collaboration hidden .
" All that I 'm telling you was completely secret , " says Liel .
" The knowledge of it was extremely limited to a small number of people outside the security establishment .
But it so happened that many of our prime ministers were part of it , so if you take people such as [ Shimon ]
Peres or Rabin , certainly they knew about it because they were part of the security establishment .
" At the UN we kept saying : we are against apartheid , as Jewish people who suffered from the Holocaust this is intolerable .
But our security establishment kept cooperating . "
So did many politicians .
Israeli cities found twins in South Africa , and Israel was alone among western nations in allowing the black homeland of Bophuthatswana to open an " embassy " .
By the 1980s , Israel and South Africa echoed each other in justifying the domination of other peoples .
Both said that their own peoples faced annihilation from external forces - in South Africa by black African governments and communism ; in Israel , by Arab states and Islam .
But each eventually faced popular uprisings - Soweto in 1976 , the Palestinian intifada in 1987 - that were internal , spontaneous and radically altered the nature of the conflicts .
" There are things we South Africans recognise in the Palestinian struggle for national self - determination and human rights , " says Kasrils .
" The repressed are demonised as terrorists to justify ever - greater violations of their rights .
We have the absurdity that the victims are blamed for the violence meted out against them .
Both apartheid and Israel are prime examples of terrorist states blaming the victims . "
There are important differences .
Israel faced three wars of survival , and the armed struggle in South Africa never evolved to the murderous tactics or scale of killing adopted by Palestinian groups over recent years .
But , from the 1980s , the overwhelming superiority of Israeli military power , the diminishing threat from its neighbours and the shift of the conflict to Palestinian streets eroded the sympathy that Israel once commanded abroad .
White South Africa and Israel painted themselves as enclaves of democratic civilisation on the front line in defending western values , yet both governments often demanded to be judged by the standards of the neighbours they claimed to be protecting the free world from .
" The whites [ in South Africa ] always saw their fate in a way related to the fate of the Israelis because the Israelis were a white minority surrounded by 200 million fanatic Muslims assisted by communism , " says Liel .
" Also , there was this analysis that said Israel is a civilised western island in the midst of these 200 million barbaric Arabs and it's the same as the Afrikaners ; five million Afrikaners surrounded by hundreds of millions of blacks who are also assisted by communism . "
When Israel finally began to back away from the apartheid regime as international pressure on the Afrikaner government grew , Liel says Israel 's security establishment balked .
" When we came to the crossroads in ' 86 - ' 87 , in which the foreign ministry said we have to switch from white to black , the security establishment said , ' You 're crazy , it 's suicidal . '
They were saying we would n't have military and aviation industries unless we had had South Africa as our main client from the mid-1970s ; they saved Israel .
By the way , it 's probably true , " he says .
Forgetting the past
Shimon Peres was defence minister at the time of Vorster 's visit to Jerusalem and twice served as prime minister during the 1980s when Israel drew closest to the apartheid government .
He shies away from questions about the morality of ties to the white regime .
" I never think back .
Since I cannot change the past , why should I deal with it ? " he says .
Pressed about whether he ever had doubts about backing a government that was the antithesis of what Israel said it stood for , Peres says his country was struggling for survival .
" Every decision is not between two perfect situations .
Every choice is between two imperfect alternatives .
At that time the movement of black South Africa was with Arafat against us .
Actually , we did n't have much of a choice .
But we never stopped denouncing apartheid .
We never agreed with it . "
And a man like Vorster ?
" I would n't put him on the list of the greatest leaders of our time , " says Peres .
The deputy director general of Israel 's foreign ministry , Gideon Meir , says that while he had no detailed knowledge of Israel 's relationship with the apartheid government , it was driven by a sole consideration .
" Our main problem is security .
There is no other country in the world whose very existence is being threatened .
This is since the inception of the state of Israel to this very day .
Everything is an outcome of the geopolitics of Israel . "
When apartheid collapsed , the South African Jewish establishment that once honoured Percy Yutar - the prosecutor who jailed Mandela - now rushed to embrace Jews who were at the forefront of the anti-apartheid struggle , such as Joe Slovo , Ronnie Kasrils and Ruth First .
" I received these awards from international Zionist organisations claiming that it was my Judaic roots that had driven me , " says Suzman .
" When I said I did n't have a Jewish upbringing and that I went to a convent which did n't influence me either , they said it was not actively but instinctively . "
For Kasrils , the embrace was short - lived .
" They spent years denouncing me for ' endangering the Jews ' and then suddenly they pretend they 've been at my side all through the struggle .
It did n't last long .
As soon as I started criticising what Israel is doing in Palestine they dropped me again , " he said .
Nowadays , the language of the anti-apartheid struggle has found favour with the Jewish establishment as a means of defending Israel .
South Africa 's chief rabbi , Warren Goldstein , has called Zionism the " national liberation movement of the Jewish people " and invoked the terminology of Pretoria 's policies to uplift " previously disadvantaged " black people .
" Israel is an affirmative - action state set up to protect Jews from genocide .
We are previously disadvantaged and we can't rely on the goodwill of the world , " he said .
Rabbi Goldstein declined several requests for an interview .
In 2004 , Ronnie Kasrils visited the Palestinian territories to assess the effect of Israel 's assault on the West Bank two years earlier in response to a wave of suicide bombings that killed hundreds of people .
" This is much worse than apartheid , " he said .
" The Israeli measures , the brutality , make apartheid look like a picnic .
We never had jets attacking our townships .
We never had sieges that lasted month after month .
We never had tanks destroying houses .
We had armoured vehicles and police using small arms to shoot people but not on this scale . "
Petition of conscience
More than 200 South African Jews signed a petition that Kasrils co-authored with another Jewish veteran of the anti-apartheid struggle , Max Ozinsky , denouncing Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians and drawing a parallel with apartheid .
The document , called A Declaration of Conscience , prompted a furious debate within the community .
Arthur Goldreich - one of Mandela 's early comrades - in - arms who also fought for Israel 's independence - was among those who signed but he attached an addendum recognising the impact of the suicide bombings on how Israelis view the Palestinians .
Kasrils acknowledges the effect of the bombers but says that Israel 's " apartheid strategy " was under way long before the suicide attacks began .
He notes the resemblance of the occupied territories to South Africa 's patchwork of homelands - the bantustans - that were intended to divest the country of much of its black population while keeping the best of their land .
Today , about six million Israelis live on 85 % of the area that was Palestine under the British mandate .
Nearly 3.5 million Palestinians are confined to the remaining 15 % , with their towns and cities penned between Israel 's ever - expanding settlement blocks and behind a network of segregated roads , security barriers and military installations .
You might say that Israel and the old South Africa were caught out by history .
The world of 1948 into which the Jewish state was born and the Afrikaners came to power cared little about the " dark peoples " who stood in the way of grand visions .
Neither government was doing very much that others - including British colonists - had not done before them .
And if Israel was fighting for its life and forcing Arabs out of their homes at the same time , who in the west was going to judge the Jews after what they had endured ?
But colonialism crumbled in Africa and Israel grew strong , and the world became less accepting of the justifications in Pretoria and Jerusalem .
South Africa 's white leadership eventually accepted another way .
Israel now stands at a critical moment in its history .
With Ariel Sharon in a coma , it is unlikely that we will ever know how far he intended to carry his " unilateral disengagement " strategy after the withdrawal from Gaza and a part of the West Bank .
Like FW de Klerk , who initiated the dismantling of apartheid , Sharon might have found he had set in motion forces he could not contain - forces that would have led to a deal acceptable to the Palestinians .
But to the Palestinians , Sharon appeared intent on carrying through a modified version of his longstanding plan to rid Israel of responsibility for as many Arabs as possible while keeping as much of their land as he could .
While Tony Blair was praising the Israeli prime minister for his political " courage " in leaving Gaza in August last year , Sharon was expropriating more land in the West Bank than Israel surrendered in Gaza , building thousands of new homes in Jewish settlements , and accelerating construction of the 400 - plus miles of concrete and barbed wire barrier that few doubt is intended as a border .
Palestinians said that whatever emasculated " state " emerged - granted only " aspects of sovereignty " with limited control over its borders , finances and foreign policy - would be disturbingly reminiscent of South Africa 's defunct bantustans .
Take the roads .
Israel is rapidly constructing a parallel network of roads in the West Bank for Palestinians who are barred from using many existing routes .
B'Tselem , the Israeli human rights group , describes the system as bearing " clear similarities to the racist apartheid regime that existed in South Africa " .
The army , which describes roads from which Palestinians are forbidden as " sterile " , says the policy is driven solely by security considerations .
But it is evident that the West Bank road system is a tool , along with the 400 - plus miles of barrier , in entrenching the settlement blocks and carving up territory .
" The road regime is not by legislation , " said Goldreich .
" It 's by political decision and military orders .
When I look at all of those maps and I look at the roads , it 's like Alice in Wonderland .
There are roads that Israelis can go on and roads Palestinians can go on , and roads Israelis and Palestinians can go on . "
The roads , the checkpoints , the fence - all " by edict .
I look at it and ask , what is the thinking behind this ? "
Three years ago , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported the former Italian prime minister , Massimo D'Alema , as telling dinner guests at a Jerusalem hotel that , on a visit to Rome a few years earlier , Sharon had told him that the bantustan model was the most appropriate solution to the conflict with the Palestinians .
When one of the guests suggested to D'Alema that he was interpreting , not repeating , Sharon 's words , the former prime minister said not .
" No , sir , that is not interpretation .
That is a precise quotation of your prime minister , " he said .
With Sharon out of politics , his successor Ehud Olmert has pledged himself to carrying through the vision of carving out Israel 's final borders deep inside the West Bank and retaining all of Jerusalem for the Jewish state .
So is it apartheid ?
Stepping into modern Israel , anyone who experienced the old South Africa would see few immediately visible comparisons .
There are no signs segregating Jews and non-Jews .
Yet , as in white South Africa then and now , there is a world of discrimination and oppression that most Israelis choose not to see .
Israeli soldiers routinely humiliate and harass Palestinians at checkpoints and settlers paint hate - filled slogans on the walls of Arab houses in Hebron .
The police stop citizens who appear to be Arabs on West Jerusalem streets to demand their identity cards as a matter of routine .
Some Jewish communities refuse to allow Arabs in their midst on the grounds of cultural differences .
One Jewish settlement mayor tried to require Arabs who entered to wear a tag that identified them as Palestinians .
In the 1990s , rightwingers menaced shopkeepers into sacking Arab workers .
Those who complied were given signs declaring their shops Arab - free .
Sometimes the hatred is explained away as religious discrimination , but the chants at the football matches go " Death to Arabs " not " Death to Muslims " .
The Israeli press largely ignores the routine of occupation despite the fearless reporting of some journalists on the disturbing number of children who die under Israeli guns ( more than 650 since the second intifada broke out in September 2000 , of which a quarter were younger than 12 years old ) ; the abuse of Palestinians by settlers , and the humiliations meted out at the checkpoints .
The eight - metre - high wall driven through Jerusalem is almost invisible to residents of the Jewish west of the city .
Because of the geography , most of the city 's Jews do not see the concrete mammoth dividing streets and families , and the demolished homes - just as most of South Africa 's whites steered clear of the townships and were blind to what was being done in their name .
Shortly after arriving in Jerusalem , I was invited for dinner at the home of a liberal Israeli family .
The guests included an American magazine publisher , a prominent historian and political activists .
The conversation turned to the Palestinians and degenerated into a discussion of how they do not " deserve " a state .
The intifada and suicide bombings were seen to justify 37 years of occupation and offset whatever crimes Israel may have committed against the Arabs under its rule .
It was all very reminiscent of conversations in South Africa , and indeed the popular Israeli view of Palestinians is not so far from how many white South Africans thought about black people .
Opinion polls show that large numbers of Israelis regard Arabs as " dirty " , " primitive " , as not valuing human life and as violent .
Sharon recruited into his government men who openly called for wholesale ethnic cleansing that would more than match apartheid 's forced removals .
Among them was the tourism minister , Rehavam Ze'evi , who advocated the " transfer " of Arabs out of Israel and the occupied territories .
Even the Israeli press called him a racist .
Ze 'evi was shot dead in 2001 by Palestinians who said his policies made him a legitimate target .
But Ze 'evi 's views did not die with him .
An influential member of the Likud central committee , Uzi Cohen , said Israel and its western allies should demand that a part of Jordan be carved off as a Palestinian state and that Arabs in the occupied territories should be given 20 years to " leave voluntarily " .
" In case they do n't leave , plans would have to be drawn up to expel them by force , " Cohen told Israel radio .
" Many people support the idea but few are willing to speak about it publicly . "
Cohen is among 70 Israeli MPs who have backed a bill to establish a national memorial day for Ze'evi and an institute to perpetuate his ideas .
In 2001 , Sharon appointed Uzi Landau as his security minister , a position from which he openly advocated that Palestinians should be forced to move to Jordan because they were in the way of Israeli expansion in the West Bank .
" For many of us , it 's as though they [ the Palestinians ] are encroaching on our very right to be there [ in the occupied territories ] , " he said .
Sharon rarely objected to the expression of such views , and when he did it was not because they were racist or immoral .
The prime minister told Likud party members who pressed him to expel Palestinians that he could not do so because the " international situation would n't be conducive " .
" We 've always had the fanatics talking of greater Israel , " says Krausz , the Holocaust survivor in Johannesburg .
" There are blokes who say it says in the Bible this land is ours , God gave it to us .
It 's fascism . "
Colonial dispossession
Yossi Sarid , a leftwing Israeli MP , said of a cabinet minister who agitated for the forced removal of Arabs : " His remarks are reminiscent of other people and other lands which ultimately led to the annihilation of millions of Jews . "
They are also reminiscent of comments by PW Botha , who went on to become South Africa 's president .
Speaking to parliament in 1964 as minister for coloured affairs , he said : " I am one of those who believe that there is no permanent home for even a section of the Bantu in the white area of South Africa and the destiny of South Africa depends on this essential point .
If the principle of permanent residence for the black man in the area of the white is accepted then it is the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it in this country . "
There was a time when large numbers of Israelis agreed with Ze'evi and Cohen , but over the past decade they have come to support the creation of a Palestinian state as a means of ridding themselves of responsibility from the bulk of Arabs .
Separation .
Apartheid .
But South African apartheid was more than just separation .
" Apartheid was all about land , " says John Dugard , the South African lawyer and UN human rights monitor .
" Apartheid was about keeping the best parts of the country for the whites and sending the blacks to the least habitable , least desirable parts of the country .
And one sees that all the time here [ in the occupied territories ] , particularly with the wall , now , which is really a land grab .
One sees Palestinians dispossessed of their homes by bulldozers .
One can draw certain parallels with respect to South Africa that , during the heyday of apartheid , population relocation did result in destruction of property , but not on the same scale as the devastation in Gaza in particular , [ or in ] the West Bank . "
Arthur Goldreich resists the temptation to use the comparison .
" It is a viable , even attractive , analogy .
I have in the past been very reluctant , and still am , to make the analogy because I think it 's too convenient .
I think there are striking similarities in all forms of racist discrimination , " he says .
" I think to describe , let us say , the bantustanism which we see through a policy of occupation and separation : they all have their own words and their own implications and it is not necessary to go outside to find them . "
Kasrils agrees .
" Yes , there are enormous parallels with apartheid , but the problem with making comparisons is it actually distracts from the Palestinian context , " he says .
" We have to look for another definition .
What struck me is dispossession , colonial dispossession .
Most colonial dispossession took place over centuries through settlers and forced removals .
In South Africa , that was a 300 - year process .
Here , it 's taken place in 50 years ; 1948 , 1967 and the present in terms of the heightened nature of militarism in the West Bank and Gaza leading to the wall , which I do n't see as a wall of security but a wall of dispossession . "
Hirsh Goodman emigrated to Israel three decades ago after his national service in the South African army .
His son moved to South Africa after completing his conscription in the Israeli military .
" The army sent him to the occupied territories and he said he would never forgive this country for what it made him do , " says Goodman , a security analyst at Tel Aviv university .
He says Israel has a lot to answer for but to call it apartheid goes too far .
" If Israel retains the [ occupied ] territories it ceases to be a democracy , and in that sense it is apartheid because it differentiates between two classes of people and separates and creates two sets of laws which is what apartheid did .
It creates two standards of education , health , of dispensing funds .
But you can't call Israel an apartheid state when 76 % of the people want an agreement with the Palestinians .
Yes , there 's discrimination against the Arabs , the Ethiopians and others , but it 's not a racist society .
There 's colonialism , but there 's not apartheid .
I feel very strongly about apartheid .
I hate the term being abused . "
Daniel Seidemann , the Israeli lawyer who is fighting Jerusalem 's residency and planning laws , says that he used to reject the apartheid parallel out of hand but finds it harder to do so nowadays .
" My gut reaction : ' Oh , no !
Our side ?
My goodness , no ! '
I think there 's a good deal to be said for that reaction to the extent that apartheid was rooted in a racial ideology which clearly fed social realities , fed the political system , fed the system of economic subjugation .
As a Jew , to concede the predominance of a racial world view of subjugating Palestinians is difficult to accept , " he says .
" But , unfortunately , the fact of the absence of a racial ideology is not sufficient because the realities that have emerged in some ways are clearly reminiscent of some of the important trappings of an apartheid regime . "
So perhaps the better question is how Israel came to a point where comparisons with apartheid could even be contemplated .
Is it a victim of circumstances , forced into oppression by its need to survive ?
Or was the hunger for land so central to the Zionist project that domination was the inevitable result ?
Krausz worked in Israel for several years soon after the birth of the state .
" I recognised the conflict in trying to take land that the Palestinians had lived on for centuries .
I realise the 1948 war of independence was n't a right - and - wrong situation : a lot of Arabs not only fled voluntarily but were also encouraged to do so .
What they would have done if there had n't been a war , I do n't know , " he says .
" I know that where I drilled for oil was the site of an Arab village .
Being South African , I used to go and visit family and friends on a kibbutz that was started by South Africans , including my cousin .
I used to go roaming about the countryside there and I went through one abandoned and blown up Arab village after another . "
States of fear
In Israel , at least until the late 1970s , the threat from its Arab neighbours was all too real .
But fear also played a role among white South Africans , who watched with growing horror , and then terror , the tide of empire receding and black rule sweeping Africa .
The accounts of white women raped in newly independent Congo and , years later , the scenes of whites fleeing Angola , Mozambique and Rhodesia , were used by South Africa to terrify its white citizens into accepting increasingly oppressive measures against black people .
Nevertheless , the fear among whites was real .
They , like Israelis , saw themselves as in a struggle for their very existence .
Israel 's critics say that as the threats to the Jewish state receded it came more and more to resemble the apartheid model - particularly in its use of land and residency laws - until the similarities outweighed the differences .
Liel says that was never the intent .
" The existential problems of Israel were real , " he says .
" Of the injustice we did , we 're always ashamed .
We always tried to behave democratically .
Of course , on the private level there was a lot of discrimination - a lot , a lot .
By the government also .
But it was not a philosophy that was built on racism .
A lot of it was security - oriented . "
Goldreich disagrees .
" It 's a gross distortion .
I 'm surprised at Liel .
In 1967 , in the six day war , in this climate of euphoria - by intent , not by will of God or accident - the Israeli government occupied the territories of the West Bank and Gaza with a captive Palestinian population obviously in order to extend the area of Israel and to push the borders more distant from where they were , " he says .
" I and others like me , active after the six day war on public platforms , tried desperately to convince audiences throughout this country that peace agreements between Israel and Palestine [ offer ] greater security than occupation of territory and settlements .
But the government wanted territory more than it wanted security .
" I am certain that it was in the minds of many in the leadership of this country that what we needed to do was make this place Arab - free .
Mandela said to me once at Rivonia , ' You know , they want to make us unpeople , not seen . ' "
But , as ordinary Israelis discovered , such a system cannot survive unchallenged .
Apartheid collapsed in part because South African society was exhausted by its demands and the myth of victimhood among whites fell away .
Israel has not got there yet .
Many Israelis still think they are the primary victims of the occupation .
For Seidemann , the crucial issue is not how the apartheid system worked but how it began to disintegrate .
" It unravelled because it could n't be done .
Apartheid drained so much energy from South African society that this was one of the compelling reasons beyond the economic sanctions and pressures that convinced De Klerk that this was not sustainable .
This is what is coming to Israel . "
Or perhaps the conflict will evolve into something worse ; something that will produce parallels even more shocking than that with apartheid .
Arnon Soffer has spent years advising the government on the " demographic threat " posed by the Arabs .
The Haifa university geographer paints a bleak vision of how he sees the Gaza strip a generation after Israel 's withdrawal .
" When 2.5 million people live in a closed - off Gaza , it 's going to be a human catastrophe .
Those people will become even bigger animals than they are today , with the aid of an insane fundamentalist Islam .
The pressure at the border will be awful .
It 's going to be a terrible war .
So , if we want to remain alive , we will have to kill and kill and kill .
All day , every day , " he told the Jerusalem Post .
" If we do n't kill , we will cease to exist .
The only thing that concerns me is how to ensure that the boys and men who are going to have to do the killing will be able to return home to their families and be normal human beings . "
The writing was on the wall for Robert Mugabe last night .
It was pinned to the side of polling tents , posted on school fences and written on the walls of community halls .
The election results that Zimbabwe 's president had made every effort to rig were coming in against him .
First to go were his chief lieutenants as , one by one , they lost their parliamentary seats .
The list read like a Who 's Who of corruption , fraud , intimidation and robbery : Joyce Mujuru , the vice - president and mistress of a vast confiscated estate outside the capital ; Patrick Chinamasa the man who perverted the justice system to serve the regime ; and Didymus Mutasa the man who amassed millions of pounds worth of stolen farms .
At least nine of Mr Mugabe 's politburo , his inner circle , were out of a job according to official results posted at polling stations in their own constituencies .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As evidence emerged of what appeared to be a landslide for opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's electoral commission – Mugabe placemen all – were hiding out in the capital , refusing to release results of the presidential poll .
What nobody could stop were independently verified , lawfully reported parliamentary and senate results as the count finished at each of the 9,000 polling stations nationwide .
And the early results were stunning .
Provisional findings , leaked to The Independent last night by a senior source at the electoral commission , indicated that Mr Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change had taken 191 of 210 parliamentary seats , with the remainder split between the ruling Zanu - PF and the smaller MDC faction backing the ruling party defector Simba Makoni .
Were those results to be reflected in the presidential contest , as expected , it would deliver a resounding first round victory to Mr Tsvangirai , a former union leader , and bring down the curtain on the only president Zimbabwe has ever known .
There was not a word from the man who turned one of Africa 's most promising economies into an impoverished , intimidated and emptying country .
Or from the man who withstood beatings , imprisonment and death threats but who , last night , appeared set to replace him .
For that to happen , Mr Tsvangirai would need to collect at least 51 per cent of the vote , otherwise the two leading candidates would go to a run- off in three weeks ' time .
Throughout the day , state television ignored the most important election since independence in 1980 , broadcasting a bizarre mixture of cartoons , church sermons and 1970s football matches .

At the MDC headquarters in Zimbabwe 's second city , Bulawayo , the excitement was palpable as the whiteboards covering the flaking walls began to fill up with poll counts – numbers that could finally amount to change .
Into the middle of the melee was Dorcas Sibanda , a single mother with four young children , and also one of the newly elected MDC MPs for Bulawayo .
" In my constituency , [ Mugabe ] got nothing , " she said .
" We knew people had made up their mind , we went door to door , and people said he had to go .
If he wo n't go , it will cause chaos , people know what has happened .
He needs to pack his bags and leave the State House . "
Pausing for hugs and high - fives with colleagues , she continued : " They 're going into the garbage dump of history where they belong . "
Outside , a crowd began to gather and a pick - up truck with speakers parked near by to provide the soundtrack .
Activists waved flags and one of them shouted : " This is what we wanted , the country has come back to its owners . "
Passing drivers honked their horns as people in MDC T - shirts danced in the traffic .
An elderly white couple in a 4x4 rolled down their windows to wave at the dancers who saluted them in unison with their arms raised .
A truck full of riot police rolled by showing little interest , with one officer even smiling at the party that was starting .
The head of the city 's riot police later returned to ask officials to tone down celebrations , promising an announcement later in the afternoon .
By nightfall , there was still no word .
The official silence on the result was stoking tension in the capital , Harare , where police were deployed in the poor townships .
Security chiefs gave their full backing to the octogenarian president in the run-up to Saturday 's vote and warned that they would not accept an opposition victory .
Even the limited observers that the Mugabe regime had allowed to monitor the election were yesterday declaring serious problems in its conduct .
The head of the Pan - African Parliament observer mission said he was sure most results were known and warned against a delay in releasing them .
" We are trying to exercise as much constraint as possible so as not to contribute to the deteriorating security situation , " said Noel Kututwa , explaining why his Zimbabwe Elections Support Network , an independent monitoring organisation , was not releasing any results .
" Clearly the delay is fuelling speculation that something might be going on . "
The silence was filled with wild rumours : the " old man " had left the country ; the military had convened an emergency council ; Mr Tsvangirai would declare victory .
One report that could be confirmed was that a senior ruling party member , Elliot Manica , had shot and killed at least one person at a polling station and had been placed under arrest .
Previous elections have followed a similar pattern with early results from urban centres appearing to favour the opposition before returns from rural voters who make up three quarters of the electorate have gone to the ruling party .
David Coltart , who won a senate seat for the smaller MDC faction that was backing Mr Makoni , a Zanu defector and former finance minister , sounded a note of caution .
" It looks like a landslide for Morgan but Mugabe is unpredictable , " said Mr Coltart , a respected white Zimbabwean lawyer .
And yet everywhere yesterday , people were convinced that this time it would be different .
They ignored Mr Mugabe 's divide and rule on racial lines and on seeing a white face on the streets , smiling people would stand up at bus stops or wave from windows , all saying the same thing , " We are winning " .
* Results of the parliamentary election began trickling out on Monday , 36 hours after polls closed , but no official details were available on the presidential vote .
Latest results showed the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and Mugabe 's ZANU - PF running neck - and - neck , with 12 seats each from a total parliament of 210 constituencies , according to figures issued by the electoral commission .

There is nothing new about such invasions .
The first recorded case dates to 1245 , when Norse voyagers brought a soft - shelled clam to the shores of the North Sea on the sides of their wooden ships .
What is new is the rate of introduction and the extent of impact  80 percent of world trade is conducted by ship , and a new marine invader is now recorded in the Mediterranean every four weeks .
Zebra mussels have to be power - hosed from the intake pipes of Great Lakes electric companies , and sea squirts form dense colonies that smother the scallops and clams of Georges Bank .
According to one estimate , invasive species in the United States cause major environmental damage and losses totaling about $ 137 billion per year .
There is an easy solution , however : if cargo ships were required to empty and refill their ballast tanks at sea , rather than in harbors and estuaries , marine invasions could be brought to a near standstill .
( High - seas ballast water exchange is already mandatory for ships entering the Great Lakes , and will be required next year for vessels mooring in California . )
Unfortunately changing ballast water at sea takes time  and time in the shipping industry is money .
So far , ship owners the world over have blocked laws seeking to limit shipping ’s role in spreading bio-invaders .
In the absence of any concrete action by the shipping industry , I would like to make a modest proposal .
To save our oceans and lakes from their apparently inexorable slide back to the Archaean Eon  when all that was moving on the face of the waters was primitive cyanobacteria  it is high time we developed a taste for invasive species .
Diners in Asia , where sesame - oil - drenched jellyfish salad has long been considered a delicious , wholesome dish , are way ahead of us .
On the Yangtze River , the Three Gorges Dam , the world ’s largest hydroelectric project , has increased the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in the waters off China , creating an ideal breeding ground for Nomura ’s jellyfish , a monstrous 450 - pound creature that can tear apart fishing nets .
In the summer of 2005 , a half - billion were estimated to be floating from the shores of China to the Sea of Japan every day , forming a ring of slime around the entire nation .
The citizens of Fukui , a northern Japanese island , coped by marketing souvenir cookies flavored with powdered jellyfish .
Returning from a fact - finding mission to China , a professor from Japan ’s National Fisheries University offered up 10 different recipes for preparing Nomura ’s jellyfish .
“ Making them a popular food , ” he told a Japanese newspaper , “ is the best way to solve the problem . ”
Precisely .
And if we want to forestall our looming carp quagmire , this is the kind of attitude we need to adopt on our shores .
Sports fishermen are already doing their part by angling for the pests ( as the presence of such titles as International Carper , TotalCarp , and Carpology on magazine racks attests ) .
Restaurateurs from Tupelo to Toronto could pitch in by replacing the bland - fleshed channel catfish on their menus with equally bland - fleshed Asian carp .
It seems only fair : it was catfish farmers in the South who imported the fish to filter algae from their ponds in the 1970s and allowed them to escape into the wild during the Mississippi floods of 1993 .

When replayed at normal speed , time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing .
Time - lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of high speed photography .

3 : The Customer Is Always Wrong
It is hard for French merchants to admit they are wrong , and seemingly impossible for them to apologize .
Instead , the trick is to somehow get the offended party to feel the mistake was his or her own .
I ’m convinced the practice was learned in the strict French educational system , in which teachers are allowed to tell pupils they are “ zeros ” in front of the entire class .

A doctor I know told me he once bought a coat at a small men ’s boutique only to discover that it had a rip in the fabric .
When he tried to return it , the shopkeeper gave him the address of a tailor who could repair it  for a large fee .
They argued , and the doctor reminded the shopkeeper of the French saying , “ The customer is king . ”
“ Sir , ” the shopkeeper replied , “ We no longer have a king in France . ”
4 : Make Friends With a Good Butcher
With food as important as it is here , one of the most important men in your life should be your butcher .
Mine , Monsieur Yvon , is more than a cutter of meat .
He is a playful spirit in a rather sober neighborhood  and the exception to the customer - is - always - wrong rule .
In his tiny shop on the Rue de Varenne , between the Luxembourg Gardens and Les Invalides in the Seventh Arrondissement , Monsieur Yvon has donned a necklace of his homemade sausages to get a conversation going .
At Christmas , he and his team of butchers put on elves ’ hats with blinking lights .
He offers passers - by free charcuterie and glasses of Beaujolais nouveau every fall .
He is so deeply trusted that when avian flu struck France , his poultry sales went up , not down .
Monsieur Yvon has cooked my Thanksgiving turkey when it was too big for my oven and taught me how to make the perfect pot - au - feu .
I have watched him lovingly choose just the right pair of center - cut lamb chops for an elderly client .
Were they to be cooked today or tomorrow ?
Grilled or sautéed ?
Even when he bears bad news , his explanations are delicious .
Once I ordered a 16 - pound turkey and got an 11 - pound bird instead .

4/7/2009 Jesse Ventura Interview With Steve colbert April.7 , 2008
An extremely awkward interview here .
I was very disappointed in Ventura not rebutting Colbert 's comedic description of Ron Paul
Protesters in Tibet 's capital Lhasa burnt shops and vehicles and yelled for independence today as the region was hit by its biggest protests for nearly two decades , testing China 's grip months before the Olympics .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Peaceful street marches by Tibetan Buddhist monks over previous days gave way to bigger scenes of violence and resentment in the remote , mountainous region .
The US Embassy said it had received reports of gunfire in Lhasa and advised its citizens to stay indoors .
" Now it 's very chaotic outside , " an ethnic Tibetan resident said by telephone .
" People have been burning cars and motorbikes and buses .
There is smoke everywhere and they have been throwing rocks and breaking windows .
We 're scared . "
Another ethnic Tibetan resident said there were " protests everywhere " .
" It 's no longer just the monks .
Now they have been joined by lots of residents , " the man said .
The eruption of anger comes despite China 's repeated claims the Tibetan people are grateful for improved lives , and it threatens to stain preparations for the Beijing Olympics .
" We feel that this very heavy - handed response is not commensurate with the very moderate approach of the demonstrators peacefully expressing their aspirations , " said Thupten Samphel , a spokesman in Dharamsala in India for the Central Tibetan Administration , the Tibetan government - in - exile .
" We appeal to the international community to persuade the Chinese authorities to deal with these demonstrations moderately .
We believe to address their grievances is much more important than to physically suppress them . "
Chinese rule in remote , Buddhist Tibet has become a focus for critics in the run-up to the August Games , with global marches this week to mark the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Communist rule spilling into Tibet itself .
Those marches apparently emboldened Buddhist monks to take to Lhasa 's streets , defying a heavy police presence and reports of lockdowns on several monasteries , sources with knowledge of the region said .

Today , 300 to 400 residents and monks demonstrated in Lhasa , a source cited a witness as saying , capping the protests that echoed the anti-government demonstrations that rocked neighbour Burma last year .
" Some are angry and some are scared .
The security forces are checking houses to see if any monks are hiding , " said the source , who is in touch with Tibetan residents .
More than 10 monks had been arrested and tanks were patrolling the square near the Potala Palace , the source said , referring to one of the architectural wonders of the world once the winter residence of Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
Witnesses said a number of shops were set on fire , and a report from China 's Xinhua news agency said the Tromsikhang Market in central Lhasa was also in flames .
Residents spoke of general chaos around the city , and one Tibetan man said Tibetans and minority Hui Muslim traders from other parts were fighting each other with rocks and knives .
A Han Chinese resident said the protests were being directed at the city 's Chinese population .
" The Han Chinese are really scared , " the resident said .
" We have been told not to go outside . "
" It is very chaotic ...
There is lots of smoke and police around , " said another Han Chinese man .
An editor at the Lhasa Evening News said staff were staying inside .
Two residents reached by telephone referred to martial law .
But that could not be confirmed and China 's State Council Information Office declined to comment , referring only to remarks made yesterday by a Foreign Ministry spokesman who said the protesters were " seeking to spark social turmoil " .
The demonstrations in Lhasa earlier also spilled into at least one other ethnic Tibetan area of China .
Hundreds of monks from the Labrang monastery in the northwestern province of Gansu led a march through the town of Xiahe , the Free Tibet Campaign said , citing sources in Dharamsala , home to Tibet 's government - in - exile .
Whilst one site may have closed its doors thanks to the MPAA , after continuous legal pressure , another has prevailed today in court .
Torrent.is has won in court over the Association of film rights - holder in Iceland ( SMÃÃS )
The case is a study in classic big business bullying .
Like similar cases in the US , SMÃÃS complained to the court about alleged copyright infringement activities on the BitTorrent site , and got a preliminary injunction , blocking the site .
However , justice works swifter in Iceland than it does in the US , and after only 4 months , the case has been to court .
The decision , however , was as surprising as it was swift .
Instead of deciding for or against the defendants , the court simply dismissed the case .
It is likely , however , that the plaintiffs will appeal the decision to the Icelandic ‘ Supreme Court ’ ( HÃ¦stirÃ©ttur ) .
The verdict , ( available in Icelandic here ) seems to hinge on the fact that under Icelandic laws , searching for files , or providing accessibility to them , is legal , as long as the files provided by the service are not themselves copyrighted .
Torrent files , are not themselves copyrighted , but are instead metadata , data about data - describing copyrighted material , as indeed are reviews .
Svavar LÃºthersson , owner of torrents .is , told Torrent Freak in a response to the court ruling “ I ’m very glad they came to this decision although it came as a surprise for myself and the plaintiffs .
I will have to consult with my lawyer as to what this decision means regarding the preliminary injunction but currently it ’s still in effect . ”
The preliminary injunction seems likely to stay in effect until an appeal is heard , so the site wo n’t be back up yet .
However , the plaintiffs were ordered to pay the court costs of Istorrent ehf ( Pltd ) , the company behind Torrent.is , and its owner Svavar LÃºthersson in the amount of 500,000 Icelandic Krona ( approx Â£ 3320 UK / $ 6700 US / â‚ ¬4250 Euro )
SMÃÃS was asked for their comment on the ruling , but their contact email address was automatically bouncing as failed .
On Dec. 11 , H.R. 847 was passed in the House of Representatives
" Whereas Christmas , a holiday of great significance to Americans , " it begins , " is celebrated annually by Christians throughout the United States . . . . "
It goes on to state , among other things , that " Christianity [ is ] the religion of over three - fourths of the American population , " that " American Christians observe Christmas , the holiday celebrating the birth of their savior , Jesus Christ , " and that " Christmas is celebrated as a recognition of God 's redemption , mercy , and Grace . "
" Now , therefore be it Resolved , that the House of Representatives . . . expresses continued support for Christians in the United States . . . acknowledges and supports the role played by Christians and Christianity in the founding of the United States . . . rejects bigotry and persecution directed against Christians , both in the United States and worldwide ; and expresses its deepest respect to American Christians . "
. . .
Among those voting for the resolution was a Jewish member of Congress who has asked me not to print his name .
He was outraged and appalled by the bill , he told me .
But he was also afraid .
He thought it would hurt him with his mostly Christian constituency if he voted against it .
He told some of his colleagues about his anguish .
They advised him not to be stupid .
It would be better for him politically if he voted for it .

Provigil ( AKA modafinil ) has been called a wonder drug : it can keep you awake and alert for hours without side - effects , and it 's even recommended as " the professor 's little helper " by neuroscience researchers writing in the prestigious journal Nature .
Provigil , approved by the US food and drug administration for the treatment of narcolepsy , is often prescribed " off label " for ailments like severe jet lag , ADHD , and even problems with sleep cycles .
But this drug , which is supposed to be a non-addictive stimulant because it does n't get you high , turns out to be potentially as euphoria - inducing and addictive as cocaine .

In March 2006 , researcher Stefan Kruszewski wrote in The American Journal of Psychiatry :
Modanifil is reinforcing , as evidenced by its self - administration in monkeys previously trained to self - administer cocaine .

And back in 2002 , an article published in Behavioral Pharmacology states :
Modafinil and cocaine dose - dependently increased heart rate and blood pressure .
The results of the present study suggest that modafinil has minimal abuse potential , but should be viewed cautiously because of the relatively small sample size .
Future studies should further characterize the abuse potential of modafinil using other behavioral arrangements , such as drug discrimination or drug self - administration .
A full characterization of the abuse potential of modafinil will become important as the use of this drug increases .

Other reports suggest that Provigil is n't addictive at all , and would in fact work well as a cure for methamphetamine addiction .
Here 's a snippet from a 2006 article from Current Psychiatry Reports :
In early trials , several candidate medications — bupropion , modafinil , and , to a lesser extent , baclofen — have shown promise in treating aspects of methamphetamine dependence , including aiding memory function necessary to more effectively participate in and benefit from behavioral therapies .

With more and more people getting prescriptions for Provigil , and the drug fast catching up with Viagra for most spammy ads online , should n't someone be investigating just how addictive it is ?
If your grandfather was the founder of the first Islamic Republic of Iran , you would probably expect to have a very comfortable life in the land of ayatollahs , where Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is president and Khomeini ’s successor has absolute power .
But you would be wrong .
" No recreation is available to us .
Arrests are the order of the day .
Students are secretly arrested and imprisoned in droves , " the granddaughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , Zahra Eshraghi , told IPS in a telephone interview from Tehran .
In 1979 , Eshraghi ’s grandfather sent shock waves around the world by leading the last great revolution of the 20th century .
Nearly 30 years later , she feels that Iran is in peril .
" The whole country is under pressured silence , begging to ask questions , but , unfortunately , no one in the regime is protesting , " she said .
" It may take many years for a person to destroy a country , but [ hard - liners ] have managed to accomplish this in a just a few . "
On a sunny day back in the spring of 2004 , she invited this reporter to her office to discuss a blog she was hoping to create .
At that time , blogging was a new phenomenon in Iran , and government officials were exploring it as a way to reach out to the youth in a country where 69 percent of the population is under 29 .
The blog run by Mohammad Abtahi , a cleric and former vice president , was becoming extremely popular , and many , like Eshraghi , were eager to jump on the bandwagon .
Eshraghi was then an adviser to the deputy minister of the interior , Ashraf Boroojerdi .
Her husband , Reza Khatami , was the deputy parliamentary spokesman , and her brother - in - law was the president himself , the reform - minded Mohammad Khatami .
Unlike most religious women in Iran , who are uncomfortable speaking with a man one - on - one , she welcomed the visitor with a warm smile .
Eshraghi , now 44 , was fashionably dressed , reminding me that she had once lived in London while her husband was studying dentistry .
Today , her situation is very different .
Her husband has been disqualified from running a reelection campaign ; her brother - in law is out of power ; and she has been asked by her family , who she says fear her forthright opinions , to refrain from speaking to the media .
Her last interview , with New York Times correspondent Elaine Sciolino in April 2003 , sparked controversy when she was quoted as saying that she felt trapped by her family history and hated wearing the black veil known as the chador .
Eshraghi , responding to protests initiated in the Iranian religious center of Qom , later denied making the remarks .
Her family also advised her not to pick fights with conservative hard - liners , and she has put aside the idea of creating a blog .
She granted this interview shortly after the Ministry of the Interior announced the disqualification of most of the reformist hopefuls for the March 14 parliamentary elections , in which conservatives won about three - quarters of the 290 seats in parliament .
This sweeping disqualification even included current members of parliament , prompting the European Union to criticize the polls as " not fair or free . "
Since coming into office in 2005 , Ahmadinejad has used the prospect of foreign threats  including the so - called " regime change " policy that has been pursued by the George W. Bush administration  as a pretext to suppress his opponents and critics .
This has been done through arrests of journalists , activists , and students .
In addition , Iran ’s Guardian Council has halted Ahmadinejad ’s potential rivals from running for office by hand - picking the candidates .
The Guardian Council is comprised of influential hard - liner clerics and lawmakers .
Half of its members are appointed by the supreme leader and the other half by the parliament , both of which are conservative .
Ahmadinejad has also tried to portray himself as a man with a personal connection to higher powers .
This , Eshraghi says , is a " delusion . "
" The government suffers from delusions , believing that it can eliminate everyone , [ believing that ] uniform thinking and restricting choices for voters can help it confront foreign threats , should they emerge , " she said .
Ahmadinejad ’s claims about his connection to God first surfaced after he addressed the UN General Assembly in September 2005 .
He said that someone present in the audience told him that a light surrounded him while he was delivering his speech .
He added that he , too , had sensed it .
Eshraghi believes Ahmadinejad is losing support from his base .
She believes this is due to his " delusion of receiving messages from above , and his delusion that the people support hardliners fully and will appreciate any opinions they may have . "
She , on the other hand , thinks the cabinet no longer enjoys the same support it did at the time of the presidential elections in 2005 .
" The current situation is highly undesirable both from a security and a foreign relations viewpoint , " Eshraghi said .
She believes that the UN Security Council ’s multiple sanctions against Iran have harmed the economy and the lives of ordinary people .
" Sanctions on Iran have already started showing their effects , putting Iran in an extremely precarious position .
There are signs of these effects today , but by next summer the effects will be devastating do we need more problems ? " she asked .
On Feb. 22 , Ahmadinejad responded to the possibility of a new sanctions resolution in an interview with state television , stating that the UN Security Council " could spend 100 years passing resolutions , but it would n’t change anything . "
Ahmadinejad ’s foreign policy is now the focus of his opponents ’ criticism .
His stance on Iran ’s nuclear program , coupled with his unprecedented statements on Israel and his challenging of the accuracy of Holocaust scholarship , has led to three rounds of sanction resolutions by the UN Security Council .
To illustrate how the hard - liner government has also failed to do its job domestically , Eshraghi cited the fuel shortages that have plagued the Iranian people this winter , in a country that has the second largest gas reserves in the world after Russia .
" With the modest snowfall , the country was shut down .
The government is not sufficiently well - connected to the people to see what they want , " she said .
During the past two and a half years , more than 50 economists and academics have sent joint letters to Ahmadinejad criticizing his populist economic policies , which have raised inflation to 18 percent , the highest rate since 1990 .
But does this dire situation affect the family of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran like it does ordinary people ?
Yes , says Khomeini ’s granddaughter .
" This situation affects everyone .
Many might believe us to belong to more comfortable classes , but [ it is hard ] even for us .
I know of many workers  and even many of my relatives and friends around me  who voted for Mr. Ahmadinejad , but they regret it now and say that their economic situation has worsened a lot . "
Very good !
And a bit scary ...

Oakland cops shoot , kill boy , say he was armed OAKLAND Officers allege he pointed sawed - off rifle at three cops
Oakland police shot and killed a boy who aimed a sawed - off rifle at them Wednesday as they were patrolling an East Oakland neighborhood known for gang activity , a police spokesman said .
The boy was shot at about noon on the 7900 block of Rudsdale Street , said Officer Roland Holmgren , a department spokesman .
Relatives identified him as Jose Luis Buenrostro and said he was 15 years old and lived in Oakland .
The shooting was the second fatal officer - involved shooting in Oakland since Friday , when police shot and killed a 70 - year - old man pointing a replica pistol at them near the Eastmont police substation on 73rd Avenue .
" Any time an officer has to use deadly force it 's extremely serious , " Holmgren said .
Three officers from the Oakland police gang unit were in a patrol car in the neighborhood not far from the Oracle Arena and McAfee Coliseum when they noticed a young man walking on the sidewalk attempting to conceal a large object in his sweatpants , Holmgren said .
" He looked in their direction and they could see it was a gun , " Holmgren said .
" He got the gun from his pants and pointed it at the officers , who in turn used their firearms to subdue him , striking him multiple times . "
The youth was taken to a local hospital , where he died from his wounds .
The police declined to confirm the young man's age or identity Wednesday evening , saying his next of kin still needed to be notified .
Relatives , friends and neighbors of Buenrostro who gathered Wednesday evening at 79th Avenue and Rudsdale Street , gave a starkly different account of the incident and questioned officers ' level of force .
They set out candles , roses and spilled beer on the sidewalk as part of a makeshift memorial for the 15 - year - old whose blood still stained the sidewalk .
Neighborhood children rode by on scooters and mothers pushed babies in strollers .
" He was walking down the street and the cops stopped and ' bam - bam ' shot him up without even telling him anything , " said Jesse Gonzalez , who said he was Buenrostro 's cousin .
" We want to see the gun he supposedly had , " said Claudia Zepeda , another cousin , whose voice faltered with emotion .
" I want to see his thumbprints on it .
Why did n't they talk to him , why did they have to kill him ? "
Holmgren said officers appeared to act the way they were supposed to when dealing with an armed assailant .
" There 's a common misconception about the use of force , especially with all the crime - related TV shows , that you can shoot an armed suspect in a leg or arm , " Holmgren said .
" Officers are trained to aim for the center mass , to use force that will immediately stop the threat .
If they shot him in the hand , he still could have fled or , for all officers knew , sprayed a residential area with bullets . "
Buenrostro was a student at an Oakland charter school focused on aviation and wanted to become a pilot , Gonzalez said .
He said he did n't know Buenrostro to have any affiliation with gangs , nor to carry any weapons .
" He was a calm guy , " Gonzalez said .
Buenrostro lived in the neighborhood with his parents and several siblings .
The three officers who fired shots were placed on paid administrative leave , pending the outcome of the investigation , which is standard procedure in officer - involved shootings .
The shooting occurred in a working - class predominantly black and Latino neighborhood less than three blocks from Acorn Woodland Elementary School .
" This happened in broad daylight right around the corner from an elementary school , " Holmgren said , adding that no one else was injured .
" Who knows what would have happened had the officers not been there ?
They put themselves in these situations not because they want to go out and take somebody 's life , but because they are trying to prevent some of the madness on the streets we 've been seeing lately . "
But nothing takes away the fact that a tragedy occurred , Holmgren said .
" A young person has lost his life , " he said .
" It 's a tragedy for a neighborhood , for a family .
It 's also a tragedy that a teenager was walking around in the middle of the day with a rifle .
I can understand the pain and anger right now . "
Dottie Harnell , who has lived for 55 years in the neighborhood where Wednesday 's shooting happened and is known by neighborhood children as " Granny , " said she was saddened to come home Wednesday to learn one of her charges was dead .
" They could have shot him in the leg , " said Harnell , who knew Buenrostro .
" A life is gone now for his family and his siblings . "
It 's bad enough when a Democrat abandons the party to do something like support Bush and the Protect AT&T
Act , but it 's really bad when he lies to his constituents about his vote and the legislation .
To wit , an e-mail from Rep. Jim Cooper to Kossack jnhobbs .
Here 's the full text of the e-mail :
Dear [ jnhobbs ] :
Thank you for contacting me about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Balancing our safety and the safety of our children against our liberties while enforcing accountability of the Bush administration is a difficult endeavor .
But that is what Congress must do in this case .
I voted against the House version of the FISA bill last Friday because I do not think we can risk our national security any longer .
The House version accepted nearly all of the provisions contained in its Senate counterpart .
It does not achieve more than the Senate version , but is instead the product of a partisan political contest .
This contest does not make us safer and it does not protect our liberties .
We should put this false dispute behind us and accept the Senate 's language .
The House version may not use the words " retroactive immunity " for telecom companies , but it does let these companies off the hook .
Likewise , it will also not bring the Bush administration 's wiretapping activities of the last six years out into the open .
Anything the administration provides may only be reviewed in closed , secret court proceedings .
I recognize your concerns and hope you will support me in my decision .
I believe I did what is best for our nation .
I will continue to work to hold the administration accountable as we try to change the discourse in Congress .
Sincerely ,
Jim Cooper
Member of Congress
Could he sound more like Joe Lieberman in whining about partisanship ?
But at least Joe did n't just lie about what the bill does .
In no way does the House 's FISA update " let these companies off the hook . "
Nor does it close the book on the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which along with the ACLU has brought suit against AT&T certainly does n't think that the legislation lets the telcos off the hook :
..." We applaud the House leadership for taking a courageous stand against the president and refusing to grant amnesty to lawbreaking telecoms .
The House bill would represent a true compromise on the amnesty issue : customers whose privacy was violated would get their day in court , while the companies would be allowed to defend themselves despite the Administration 's broad demands for secrecy , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" Immunity proponents have been claiming on the Hill for months that these companies had a good faith belief that the NSA program was legal .
Under this bill , the companies could do what they should have been able to do all along : tell that story to a judge . "
EFF represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecommunications company of violating their rights by illegally assisting the National Security Agency in widespread domestic surveillance .
The Hepting case is the leading case aimed at holding telecoms responsible for knowingly violating federal privacy laws with warrantless wiretapping and the illegal transfer of vast amounts of personal data to the government ....
The legislation puts the decision on whether the cases go forward where it belongs : in the hands of a judge instead of the administration or the Congress .
But Cooper is not just lying about that , he 's lying about the legislation letting the administration off the hook .
One of the provision of the legislation would create a Commission on Warrantless Wiretapping :
To find the underlying cause of the President ’s warrantless surveillance program , the House bill creates a bipartisan Congressional Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance Activities .
This Commission will take evidence and conduct hearings in order to examine all programs and activities pertaining to the TSP .
Like the 9/11 Commission , the Commission will make pertinent findings and recommendations in both classified and unclassified reports .
Jim Cooper is defending his bad vote by lying to his constituents .
Do n't let him get away with it .
Believe it or not , the photo above is of a train interior in Japan !
With the results looking nicer than most nurseries , the Japanese have taken the idea of ‘ child - friendly public transport ’ to the next level with these 2 beauties , both designed by eiji mitooka .
He was the artistic force behind ‘ omoden ’ ( toy train ) and ‘ ichigo ec’ ( strawberry train ) , a couple of regional trains which travel on a daily basis on the 14.3 km kishigawa line in japan .
The Japanese are intent on making train travel a more comfortable experience for everyone , women and children especially , and the results are incredible .
Both trains contain hundreds of toys , TV screens showing cartoons , immaculately clean wooden flooring and cots for younger children .
Call me cynical but I can’t imagine anything like this emerging in India unless it was an attraction at a theme park .
and here ’s the ’ strawberry train ’ which runs on the same line …
Editor 's Note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
CNN 's Jonathan Wald reports on a U.S. sergeant who helps Iraqi businesses with much - needed cash .
Sgt. Grant Ray 's role has changed from combat to an attempt to rebuild Iraq 's economy .
TAJI , Iraq ( CNN ) --
In Iraq , even being a Good Samaritan can prove deadly .
Before heading back to base , the 25th Infantry Division platoon must complete a patrol along Route Tampa .
Tampa is the code name for a well - traveled convoy route between Balad and Baghdad .
Coalition vehicles are regularly on the road and often the target for insurgents .
So it surprised everyone when the only incident we came across was a traffic accident .
A tire burst on a truck carrying cigarettes and butane lighters .
The truck flipped , and much of the merchandise spilled out and caught fire .
Another driver , seeing a man trapped in the overturned vehicle surrounded by flames , pulled over and ran to help release him .
Iraqi Army members converged on the scene as the butane lighters began to burst in the heat .
Believing the sound to be gunfire coming from the man running toward the truck , they shot him in the face , killing him instantly .
The man in the overturned truck survived with minor injuries .
It turned out he , too , was an Iraqi Army captain .
" It just goes to show , " a soldier says to me , " how easily and quickly things can get out of control here . "
The platoon from Camp Taji , a U.S. military base about 20 miles north of Baghdad , was accompanying Sgt. First Class Grant Ray .
CNN first caught up with Ray at his U.S. - based barracks in 2004 , back when he was Staff Sgt. Ray .
He had just returned from his first tour of duty in Iraq , during which he was part of Thunder Run , the coalition 's charge across the Iraqi desert to strike Baghdad .
Ray lost the tops of two fingers and almost his life when a routine patrol turned deadly and he was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade .
Three of his comrades were killed in the ambush , and Ray earned a medal for bravery in recovering their bodies .
Five years later , Ray 's role is radically different -- moving from combat in 2003 to an attempt to rebuild a shattered economy .
He 's something of a contradiction .
" I work non-lethal effects along with lethal effects into our area of responsibility , " Ray explains .
He is armed and ready to kill at all times , but his main purpose is to hand out " microgrants " of $ 50 to $ 5,000 to support Iraqi businesses .
Platoon leaders return from the field and suggest businesses to Ray that they feel deserve his and ultimately the American taxpayer 's money .
Ray assesses the different needs , calculates how much it costs to fulfill them and seeks financial approval from his commander .
He acts as a consultant and a bank -- except to carry out his work , Ray must be under the protection of about 20 soldiers .
Armed with an M - 4 and a black nylon briefcase filled with cash , Ray ventures out in the back of a Stryker armored vehicle into territory that straddles the Sunni -Shia divide .
A year and a half ago , coalition troops in the region suffered heavy casualties amid 150 attacks a week .
Today , the number has dwindled to the point where Ray can do his job .
Watch a profile of Ray »
Main roads and then dust tracks lead to the village of Rikia , made up of about 500 Shia and 300 Sunnis .
Ray and his security detail pile out of the Strykers to be greeted by Adnan , a local sheikh .
Adnan is a modest - looking man in his 50s with perfectly pressed trousers and a striped , short - sleeved shirt .
Waste and colorful plastic bags cover the neighboring fields as if they were placed there for decoration .
The first stop is Nasser , the butcher .
Soldiers shoo away gathering children .
" Imshi ! " ( " Go ! " in Arabic ) they snap , mindful that any crowd is a tempting target for an attacker .
Nasser 's butcher shop is a small , windowless shack with a table .
Flies hover above a patch of dried blood on top of a tree stump that serves as Nasser 's cutting board .
Business at the butcher 's is brisk .
Speaking through a translator , Ray asks Nasser to sign contracts in Arabic and English , before dispensing $ 1,100 from his case to pay for a generator and fridge .
Nasser , a 42 - year - old father of eight , is beside himself .
" I need that money so bad , " he says .
" I 'll have a fridge , I 'll have a freezer , I used to sell the meat for eight dollars , now I 'm going to sell it for seven dollars , and they 're all going to come here and buy clean meat . "
Ray moves over the road to the village pharmacy and asks for Wassan Hussein .
The pharmacist , a woman in her 40s with a neat head scarf , raises her hand .
Ray counts out $ 1,515 for Wassan to pay for shelves , a fridge and a generator .
It 's not enough .
She also wants a patient table and air conditioning .
Ray says he will put in a request but cannot make any guarantees .
Everyone has a need in Rikia .
An elderly woman pleads with a soldier to help funnel water from a neighboring field to her home .
Children beg for candy .
Some are more ambitious than others .
" Give me this , " a girl demands , pointing to a soldier 's binoculars .
" Give me that , " a boy says as he eyes up the soldier 's penknife .
The gunner on a Stryker showers the ground with handfuls of chocolates .
A dozen children flock to the sweets like pigeons to scattered bread crumbs .
Nasser the butcher needs something else , too .
He leads the soldiers to two of his children , a young girl holding a younger boy .
As she places the boy on the ground , he falls backward .
" He can't walk , he 's sick , " Nasser says .
" I can't fix that , " a soldier replies .
The cash Ray doles out is part of a program authorized by the U.S. Congress to give American commanders across Iraq discretionary spending power for relief to Iraqi communities .
When Ray returned from Rikia he declared his mission a success .
Yet even he admits the system is imperfect .
Ray says his microgrants benefit the Iraqi economy , but he also says about 10 percent of the money handed out is used to buy weapons to attack him and other troops .
Ray hopes businesses gain the impetus they need to flourish .
He fears a rise in violence could make the work he does impossible .
" I can't see it lasting for a long period of time , especially if it does flare up again , " Ray says .
" How much can we do to help them , if they do n't want the help ?
Or if they 're saying they want the help just because they want the money to buy bombs or rockets ? "
For the time being Ray 's role continues to be non-lethal .
But in a place where things can get out of control so easily and so quickly , he could easily and quickly become lethal again .

A new , highly drug - resistant strain of the “ flesh - eating ” MRSA bacteria is being spread among gay men in San Francisco and Boston , researchers reported on Monday .
In a study published online by the journal Annals of Internal Medicine , the bacteria seemed to be spread most easily through anal intercourse but also through casual skin - to - skin contact and touching contaminated surfaces .
The authors warned that unless microbiology laboratories were able to identify the strain and doctors prescribed the proper antibiotic therapy , the infection could soon spread among other groups and become a wider threat .
The new strain seems to have “ spread rapidly ” in gay populations in San Francisco and Boston , the researchers wrote , and “ has the potential for rapid , nationwide dissemination ” among gay men .
Deep packet inspection ( DPI ) , a technique for identifying the contents of individual data packets running across IP networks , has wound up at a messy intersection of competing interests .
Content providers love it , as it might enable ISPs to block pirated material flowing across their networks .
ISPs have their own reasons for using DPI , as P2P traffic can account for over 90 percent of the bandwidth usage under some circumstances .
But implementing DPI could be a necessary step for the creation of a non-neutral ' Net , which creates a number of issues .
Lost in all of the debate is the question of how well DPI works at the implementation level .
If the hardware either severely restricts bandwidth or fails to recognize the traffic it's supposed to throttle , then all the arguing is a bit irrelevant .
Recently , Internet Evolution and the French equivalent of the RIAA attempted to perform lab tests on DPI hardware from a variety of vendors , and their effort produced a clear conclusion : most hardware vendors do n't want you to know how well their equipment works .
The groups identified 28 different hardware makers and sent invites to all of them , allowing them to send engineers to ensure that the tests were performed fairly .
All but five declined , and those that agreed reserved the right to refuse publication of the test results .
Three of those vendors ultimately exercised that right .
In the end , that meant that the test results for a grand total of two pieces of hardware wound up being published .
The brave companies were Arbor / Ellacoya and ipoque GmbH .
Obviously , the companies were n't all that brave — had the test results been bad , they probably would n't have appeared .
It seems almost redundant to report that the hardware performed well .
The Ellacoya E30 handled slightly higher bandwidth and added a smaller latency , while the ipoque PRX - 5G seemed to do slightly better at recognizing P2P traffic and did n't bog down as much under load .
Neither seemed susceptible to false positives .
Although both were good with the most popular P2P protocols , they were to varying degrees blind to some of the more obscure ones , and fared worse when the traffic was obscured by encryption .
If these two vendors produce hardware that 's representative , then DPI appears ready for primetime .
Only P2P traffic was throttled , and the remaining traffic was only minimally delayed .
The biggest concern identified by the tests were the blind spots to some protocols and encryption techniques .
The nature of P2P traffic has the ability to turn on a dime with a single software update , so the vendors may find their abilities challenged by the changing landscape .
All of these conclusions , however , are predicated on the " if " that started this paragraph , which is a very significant conditional .
One could imagine that other tests results were suppressed by the vendors for lack of decent performance or overzealous filtering .
( CNN ) -- South Carolina Highway Patrol officers have been caught on dash - cam video hitting African - American suspects with patrol cars , and using a racial epithet during at least one pursuit , a U.S. attorney said .
Dash - cam video captures a suspect running away from a patrol car that is chasing him .
One officer is heard on tape saying he intentionally hit a suspect , Kevin McDonald , acting U.S. attorney for South Carolina , said Thursday .
The FBI is looking into the allegations , he said .
" I felt it was important the FBI look further into it .
And because of the nature of the tapes , I thought it was important for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to be brought into it , " McDonald said .
The South Carolina Department of Public Safety welcomes the investigation , spokesman Sid Gaulden said .
" I think any investigation will clearly show there 's no systemic pattern of misconduct , " he said .
" I am not defending these incidents , but the number is small .
If there was a pattern of misconduct , it would have come to light . "
In one video , dated June 24 , 2007 , Lance Cpl. Steven Garren strikes a suspect running away during a pursuit at night .
The man slides onto the hood of the car before landing on the roadside .
In an exchange with another officer afterward , Garren is heard saying , " I nailed the f --- out of him .
He went flying up into the air . "
Someone is heard asking , " You hit him ? "
Garren responds , " Yeah , I hit him .
I was trying to hit him . "
Watch men being chased and an officer saying he intentionally hit a man »
In another video , dated April 28 , 2007 , Lance Cpl. Alexander Richardson chases a suspect through an apartment complex .
Richardson drives his car over the sidewalk , across the grass and through a common area as other people scramble to get out of the way .
At one point , Richardson briefly strikes the man with his car , causing him to stumble before he resumes running .
Gaulden said both troopers violated department policy by using cars to chase suspects who were on foot .
Garren , he said , received a three - day suspension , which he has completed but is appealing .
Richardson was reprimanded and completed a stress management course .
Two highway patrol bosses left their jobs after a third video emerged of a December 2004 incident .
In that video , Lance Cpl. Daniel Campbell can be heard telling a running suspect , " You better run , [ racial epithet ] , because I 'm fixing to kill you . "
Campbell was reprimanded , suspended and ordered to undergo anger and diversity training , Gaulden said .
But South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford believed stronger action should have been taken .
Sanford released a statement saying his administration " has always been about setting a higher bar and a higher standard for how state government goes about the business of protecting and serving the people of South Carolina . "
" When someone disregards that standard -- or , worse yet , exhibits behavior that is absolutely intolerable , no matter the situation -- we expect the leaders we 've appointed to take swift and meaningful steps to correct it . "
McDonald said Thursday that he could not say whether the federal investigation would focus only on the troopers in the newest videos or extend to last month 's departures .
He said the Justice Department and federal prosecutors would wait to hear from the FBI before deciding whether charges would be filed .
Highway patrol tapes are routinely reviewed , Gaulden said .
Disciplinary action is taken when inappropriate behavior occurs , he said .
" You want to stop it , " Gaulden said .
" One time is too many .
Action is designed to get the individual 's attention and change behavior . "

The turf roof gives the £ 4,000 property a distinctive look
But just how much would they have to spend to build their own home ?
The answer could be as little as £ 4,000 .
That is the estimated price tag attached to a property which has been built in southern Scotland over the past four years .
The walls are made of straw , the roof out of turf and much of the rest of the building from items other people threw away .
The end product is a warm and watertight cottage which gets its water supplies by gathering rainfall and its electricity from a car battery .
It is something that anybody could easily learn to do most of , with help
Steve James
In Pictures : The £ 4,000 house
Plans are also in place for a water wheel to provide power for the property later this year .
According to 52 - year - old software engineer Steve James , who built the Galloway home , there was a dual motivation behind his " grand design " .
Firstly , he has always enjoyed manual labour and the idea of building a home with his own hands appealed to him .
" I have never built a house before but I have done a bit of joinery and have done a lot of practical work , " he said .
" Most of my life I have been a hands - on worker .
WHERE THE MONEY WENT £ 600 supplies for volunteers £ 500 sarking £ 400 floorboards £ 400 pond liner £ 300 straw £ 200 plumbing £ 150 reclaimed joists £ 150 plywood £ 150 equipment hire £ 150 glass £ 100 quicklime £ 100 wiring £ 100 tarpaulin £ 100 paint / varnish £ 100 batteries £ 100 fixings £ 100 miscellaneous £ 100 fuel for power tools £ 70 water pump £ 50 water heater £ 50 stove chimney £ 30 cooker
" So , first of all there is the personal satisfaction of putting my skills to making a house . "
However , the project may also help to highlight wider issues of housing space and land availability .
He believes a three - bedroom family home could easily be built for £ 10,000 .
" It is something that anybody could easily learn to do most of , with help , " he said .
" The real cost of a house is fairly small .
It is always the land that makes about 85 % of the cost .
" Adding the compound interest to the final cost of a mortgage reduces the actual house price component of the total to as little as 2 % . "
The Galloway project has taken about 10 months of actual building time to complete .
The operation started four years ago when the foundations were put down and a first set of walls put up .
However , these had to be demolished after the rain soaked them through when tarpaulins failed .
A second set were put up in 2005 , when the roof was also added .
A year later it was time to render , floor , plumb and wire the building .
Cubicle doors
In 2007 a stove , decoration and internal fittings were put in place .
Local forestry like larch , spruce and elm were used to construct much of the property .
Sand , gravel , rock and turf from nearby fields and burns were also a part of the build .
And straight out of other people 's rubbish came a roof velux , shower tray , front window , front door and an oval bedroom window .
The stove chimney for the home cost just £ 50
Mr James 's favourite pieces of reclamation work include the Tudor - style panelled timber ceiling .
It was made out of solid pine changing cubicle doors salvaged from old Victorian public baths in Govan .
A traditional Belfast sink was constructed out of items from a decommissioned primary school .
And worktops and windowsills came from a Cedar of Lebanon in Pollok Park in Glasgow which was felled by a storm .
They have all been brought together to create a home which aims to be both ecologically and economically friendly .
At last estimate the average house price in Scotland stood at about £ 158,000 .
Mr James believes 40 home owners could build their own properties for that money .
And you would also be guaranteed a home which looked nothing like your neighbour's .
WE'VE gone on a bit about the distinction between different kinds of mistakes a politician can make speaking .
This is probably worth a bit of elaboration in the wake of Hillary Clinton 's campaign announcing that she " misspoke " about her harrowing landing under sniper fire in Bosnia , an event that appears to have been , in videotaped fact , as phsyically dangerous as a taping of Prairie Home Companion .
Footage showed that Mrs Clinton calmly listened to a poem being read by an eight - year - old girl on that terrifying Bosnian tarmac .
A " typo " is a mere garbling , like saying " Canadia " when you 've just said the word " Canadian " several times and the fake country name slips out .
Probably every person alive makes a handful of such production errors in speech every day .
We produce several thousand words a day , and a few are bound to go wrong , even for careful speakers .
There is no use focusing on these things at all .
But we also have the lovely word " thinko " : a mistake that betrays a flawed or nonexistent understanding of a topic being discussed .
When George Bush referred to the citizens of Greece as " Grecians " , we can legitimately worry : has he heard so little of the Greeks , ancient or modern , in his lifetime that he does n't know the English name for them ?
Or was he just tired , perhaps producing a typo ?
Indeed , we could probably separate thinkos into two kinds : one of which involves not knowing enough about something ( Bush and the Greeks ) , and another of which involves " knowing " wrong things .
( Mark Twain : " It ai n't what you do n't know that gets you into trouble .
It 's what you know for sure that just ai n't so . " )
Perhaps " knowing wrong things , and spouting them " could , in honor of the over - optimistic architects of the Iraq war , be called a Wolfowitz - o or a Chalabi-o .
Unfortunately , few of the relevant names lend themselves comfortably to this coinage .
Feith - o , anyone ?
But it appears now we need a new category beyond typos and thinkos , since Mrs Clinton has gone so far as to invent a new kind of speech stumble .
So what would we call a misstatement that involves embellishing your record with wholly invented stories of personal bravery , all the while being so foolish as not to remember that camera crews taped the incident you described , and then repeating and further embellishing the story ; and then when confronted with video evidence , insulting voters ' basic intelligence by insisting you produced a mere " typo " or perhaps a very mild " thinko " , when really you 've just plain lied to their faces ?
Readers are invited to name this new kind of linguistic slip - up .

I Wanna Be The Guy : The Movie : The Game is a sardonic loveletter to the halcyon days of early American videogaming , packaged as a nail - rippingly difficult platform adventure .
Players fill the role of The Kid , a youthful , vaguely Megaman - esque protagonist on a quest to become The Guy .
This inscrutable plot , however , is just a vehicle for a wide variety of inventive , well - designed and frustrating jump - and - shoot challenges that pay homage to many of the games you loved as a child .
The ever - fragile Kid explodes in a shower of red pixels at the slightest brush from the game 's many obstacles , from traditional spikes and bottomless pits to more unconventional killers , such as plantlife and puzzle pieces .
Using a multiroute layout not unlike a Metroidvania , the game grants a degree of deadly exploration , without those extraneous upgades meant to make life easier .
The game provides players with a choice in terms of their deathrate , thanks to a variable difficulty setting that changes the number of save points from frequent to nonexistent .
IWBTG is open to all players ; knowledge of videogaming history is optional , and may not help against the frequently ironic and always sadistic deathtraps located herein .
And so , the question is left up to you ...
Do YOU have what it takes to be The Guy ? --

A Ugandan mother has been separated from her breastfeeding son and young daughter for two weeks , whilst awaiting deportation in Yarl ’s Wood ( one of the detention centres where failed asylum - seekers are held before being removed from the country ) .
It is also reported that the woman has been denied breast pumps whilst in detention .
This means that she is in constant pain , and runs the risk of her milk stopping before she is reunited with her son .
This is just one of many cases , despite Home Office guidelines stating that breastfeeding children should not be removed from their mothers .

Dean says attacks getting too personal , wants closure by July 1 David Edwards
Published : Friday March 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democratic Party chief Howard Dean says Barack Obama , Hillary Rodham Clinton and their supporters should beware of tearing each other down , demoralizing the base and damaging the party 's chances of winning the White House in November .
In an interview with The Associated Press , Dean also said he hopes the Democratic nominee will be determined shortly after the voting ends in early June and that he will encourage the superdelegates who will play a role to make up their minds before the August convention in Denver .
The 2004 presidential candidate told CBS News that he wants closure by the first of July .
Dean said the charges and countercharges between Clinton and Obama have gotten too personal at times .
He declined to say how they have crossed the line , but he said he 's made it clear privately when it has happened .
" You do not want to demoralize the base of the Democratic Party by having the Democrats attack each other , " he said Thursday during the interview in his office a t Democratic National Committee headquarters .
" Let the media and the Republicans and the talking heads on cable television attack and carry on , fulminate at the mouth .
The supporters should keep their mouths shut about this stuff on both sides because that is harmful to the potential victory of a Democrat . "
Superdelegates - the nearly 800 party and elected officials who can support whomever they choose at the convention , regardless of what happens in the primaries - should make up their minds before August to avoid a fight at the convention , Dean said .
" There is no point in waiting , " he said .
The Democratic political organization " is as good or better as the Republicans , ' and we have n't been able to say that for about 30 years .
But that all does n't make any difference if people are really disenchanted or demoralized by a convention that 's really ugly and nasty . "
Dean commented during a wide - ranging , 40 - minute interview about his leadership during a nominating season that has lasted longer than most expected and that has left the party with some tough issues to resolve .
Among them : Florida and Michigan Democrats brazenly violated party rules by holding primaries ahead of schedule and lost their delegates to the convention as punishment .
Both states are now demanding that they not be shut out of the decision - making process because of it .
Since neither Clinton nor Obama are likely to secure the nomination with just the delegates won in the primaries and caucuses , the nominee will probably be determined by the superdelegates .
That has some activists objecting that insiders could overturn the will of the voters .
Dean has raised record amounts of money - the $ 51.5 million the DNC brought in in 2007 was a record for a non-election year .
And he 's spent it , too , on trying to build organizations in the 50 states .
Campaign finance reports this month show the party with $ 4.5 million after accounting for debt , compared with $ 25 million for the Republican National Committee - and the Democrats have no nominee to help replenish the coffers .
Not to mention that Clinton 's and Obama 's campaigns spend every day trying to tear each other down - and are unlikely to stop anytime soon - while Sen.
John McCain of Arizona , the certain Republican nominee , is busy preparing for the general election .
Even Dean said he does n't expect the campaign to end until the last nominating contest is held in June .
Dean , the former governor of Vermont and 2004 presidential candidate , said he knows his critics say he should take a bigger leadership role in resolving some of these disputes .
But he said that 's not his role .
Rather , he thinks of himself as a referee who enforces the rules in a close basketball game .
" Somebody is going to lose , " Dean said .
" My job is to make sure the person who loses feels like they have been treated fairly so that their supporters will support the winner . "
Dean said the massive numbers of people showing up to participate in Democratic nominating contests across the country gives him encouragement that the eventual nominee will be well - positioned to win the White House .
He said it is good for the candidates to debate controversies like the incendiary sermons by Obama 's pastor and Clinton 's different accounts of danger on a trip to Bosnia as first lady .
If Democrats did n't deal with them now , he said Republicans will surely make use of them in the fall .
Dean also reflected the concerns of many Democrats who worry about Obama and Clinton tearing each other down .
" What I do n't want to do is have the Democrats make a stupid mistake in April and then be sorry they said that in October and end up with some more right - wing extremists on the Supreme Court , " he said .
Dean 's supporters say he 's working behind the scenes to resolve some of the issues .
He 's been consulting with party stalwarts about how to wrap up the nomination quickly after the voting ends in June , including former Vice President Al Gore , former presidential candidate John Edwards , former Sen.
George Mitchell , former President Carter , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo .
" There 'll be some nasty fights if it goes to convention , and people will walk out , " Dean said .
" But I 've also been talking to a fairly significant number of , by and large , nonaligned people about how we might resolve this . "
Dean would n't talk in detail about what the plan is , but it likely involves encouraging superdelegates to pick a candidate shortly after the voting ends .
He said he will not encourage any delegate to vote one way or another .
" I am going to stand up for the rules , and I know I 'm doing the right thing most of the time because I 've got both Clinton people and Obama people mad at me , " he said .
For instance , while Obama 's campaign has been encouraging superdelegates to support the candidate with the most pledged delegates - which almost certainly will be Obama - Dean says the rules do n't require that and superdelegates are free to chose who they want .
On the other side , Clinton has been arguing lately that even pledged delegates - awarded to a candidate based on the outcome of state contests - are n't bound to vote for that candidate at the convention .
Dean called that " a very technical argument . "
" You are n't going to get pledged delegates to move unless something really shocking happens , " he said .
And he thinks it unlikely the superdelegates would support a candidate who did not have the most pledged delegates .
Dean also said the Michigan and Florida delegates will be seated at the convention .
But he wo n't force a resolution because he said there 's nothing the Obama and Clinton campaigns can support at this point .
" You bring both sides together and say , ` Do n't you think it 's time that the two campaigns made a deal on how we 're going to do this ? ' "
Dean said .
" Let me just say that the campaigns believe that kind of a deal is premature right now . "
Politico's Ben Smith reports : A potential game - changer from CBS News and " The Early Show . "
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean says he wants superdelegates to make a decision by JULY 1 -- the most specific he has been in his effort to prod the party to decide between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton before the Democratic National Convention in late August .
Harry Smith asked if after the nominating contests end with the South Dakota and Montana primaries on June 3 , " Do you want the superdelegates to have some sort of vote immediately so that you 'll know months in advance of the convention what the outcome is ?
Dean replied :  Well , I think the superdelegates have already been weighing in .
I think that there 's 800 of them and 450 of them have already said who they 're for .
I 'd like the other 350 to say who they 're at some point between now and the first of July so we do n't have to take this into the convention . 
An aide explains that July 1 is not a drop - dead deadline : " The point is before the convention , ideally in June . " ( with wire reports )

newswire article announcements united states government | political theory FALSE FLAG ALERT -- APRIL 7- 11 author : Captain Eric H. May
Two military officers of high conscience and courage , Marine Major William B. Fox and Army Captain Eric H. May , have posted a critical worldwide alert on false flag prospects for this week , April 7 - 11 .
As they point out , there are too many indicators of a possible war with Iran not to be concerned .

All officials and media : please forward , print and broadcast . --
FALSE FLAG ALERT -- APRIL 7-11
Attention : Federal Bureau of Investigation
This alert is issued in accordance with a mission of conscience by two former military officers : Major William B. Fox , USMCR , Publisher , America First Books ; and Captain Eric H. May , former Army intelligence officer , Military Correspondent , The Lone Star Iconoclast .
We consider our actions to be consistent with the oath we took to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
This week , April 7 - 11 , there is a heightened possibility of a foreign or domestic false flag attack , used to trigger a war with Iran .
We believe that the most likely false flag events would be either an attack on a US ship abroad ( e.g. , the Israeli 1967 false flag attack on the USS Liberty ) , or a false flag terror attack on the US domestic target .
The most likely patsies would be Iranian military forces or Hezbollah .
Captain May's March 31 article in the Lone Star Iconoclast Spring Fling in Iran ? --
Updating World War III describes several significant intelligence indicators for commencement of war with Iran :
1. Israel will conduct the largest domestic defense exercise in its history this week .
2. Admiral William " Fox " Fallon , who vigorously opposed an attack on Iran , was sacked as CENTCOM commander on March 11 .
3. Senator John McCain has recently made repeated statements that Iran is connected with Al Qaeda .
4. General David Petraeus has recently made the claim that Iran is responsible for destabilizing Iraq , particularly in the matter of recent attacks on the US Green Zone in Baghdad .
Since that article 's publication , top Bush administration members have held meetings with key foreign leaders , which may have been used to reach an accord prior to an attack on Iran :
1. George Bush met with Russian President Vladimir Putin this weekend .
2. Dick Cheney recently met top leaders in Saudi Arabia .
3. Robert Gates visited the Sultanate of Oman .
Numerous mainstream news articles from mainstream sources support possibility of war with Iran in the near future .
All articles listed below were written in April :
Exclusive : Iran , Syria , Lebanon on military alert
Israel : Full - scale War - Drill on April 6 - 10 , 2008
British fear US commander is beating the drum for Iran strikes
Ritter says White House preparing for war in Iran
Alarmed ' As US Readies April Nuclear Attack On Iran
Israel to Redistribute Gas Masks Amid Fears of War with Iran
Another American War Crime in the Making
Israel conducts War Games directed against Iran and Syria
The author archive page that Major Fox created for Captain May 's previous work explains in great detail why the false flag attack threat is very real .
W. Leon Smith , publisher of The Lone Star Iconoclast , has endorsed Captain May 's select methodology in his March 3 editorial " Time to Investigate Houston is Now " and his March 26 editorial " Lone Star Lone Ranger . "
Mr. Smith has called for a Congressional investigation based upon Captain May 's accuracy in issuing alerts that were borne out by later events .
We believe that an informed public is our best defense against the possibilities we have raised in this alert .
We considered the absence of substantial mainstream media attention to the war indicators we have mentioned above in itself to be an indicator that a lapdog press corps is enabling the possibility of war .
Serious discussion will remove an extremely serious threat , and it is our name to inform the American people so that they can initiate that discussion .
Respectively submitted ,
Major William B. Fox
Captain Eric H. May

The Basics
Typography for the Web has come a long way since Tim Berners - Lee flipped the switch in 1991 .
Back in the days of IE 1.0 , good web typography was something of an oxymoron .
Today things are different .
Not only do we have browsers that support images ( gasp ! ) , but we have the opportunity to make our web pages come to life through great typography .
First , it ’s worth noting that Typography is not just about choosing a font , or even distinguishing one typeface from another .
In recent experiments , trained monkeys were able to correctly identify Helvetica 90 % of the time .
Today we ’re going to talk about web typography in terms of a recipe of four fundamental ingredients .
If you ’ve ever tried to cook a soufflé , you ’ll know how important the recipe is .
Follow this recipe and your typography will rise up like … that ’s enough of the culinary metaphors , let ’s cook :
Contrast
Pale pink text on a pale blue background , might match your t- shirt , but it just does n’t read well .
Text exists to be read ; make sure that it contrasts enough with the background to achieve that .
If you ’re ever unsure about contrast , then take a screen dump of your page , open up your image editing software and reduce the image to grey - scale .
You ’ll soon see if you have enough contrast .
Robert Bringhurst , the consummate typographer writes , typography exists to honor content .
Are we honouring the content , if we design our pages in such a way that the text , the content , is difficult to read ?
Personally I dislike reading long stretches of reversed out text ( i.e. light text on a dark background ) ; how often do we see books set like this ?
It may well be appropriate for shorter stretches of text on - screen , but I find it very tiring to read for any length of time .
Size
With the birth of Web 2.0 I noticed a rather annoying trend ; namely small type .
I ’ve even emailed site authors and kindly suggested that they increase the default font size .
I ’ve received mixed replies from , tough , get yourself some glasses to thanks , I ’d never even considered that my type might be too small for the average reader .
I ’ve even heard tiny body text defended with , “ it matches my minimalist design ” , or similar .
It most likely reflects a small something else .
Unless Super Man and 20/20 Vision Girl ( Marvel Comics , keep your hands off , she ’s mine ) are your only readers , then small type is just not on .
Do n’t set body text below 10 or 12px and , if possible , make it bigger .
Remember , what ’s legible on your 65 inch High Definition Plasma monitor , might not be so on a 15 inch MacBook .
If in doubt , make it bigger .
The body text on ILT is set at 16 px .
Hierarchy
Varying type size is one of the best ways to differentiate content .
Colours and pretty boxes might help , but different sizes of type , used consistently throughout your pages , will signal loud and clear to your readers the relative importance of your pages ’ elements .
It also means that if your readers are in a hurry , they can quickly pick out the important bits — and that could mean that they stay longer and read on .
Hierarchy can be achieved in other ways too .
We ’ve just mentioned using different sizes of type to achieve it , but we can also use different styles ; for example , all - caps , or using italic for sub - headings .
Serif and sans serif faces can also be mixed to good effect .
Space
Let your type breathe .
Do n’t be afraid to leave blank spaces in your pages .
This negative or white space will help focus attention on the text–and it ’s the text that speaks loudest , so let it be heard .
Next , remember the line - height CSS property ; a good rule of thumb is line - spacing that ’s at least 140 % of your text size ( remember , I ’m writing about web typography here ) .
Good type designers put a whole lot of effort into the micro white space that sits inside type .
They spend countless hours attempting to achieve a balance between the black of the type and negative or white space that it envelops .
Likewise , we should take time to consider the macro white space , the ‘ voids ’ that shape our blocks of text .
Remember , these are not rules , but rather guidelines .
However , follow them–contrast , size , hierarchy , and space–and your typography will rise like one of Gordon Ramsay ’s Soufflés .
Oh , and I was only kidding about the monkeys .
In a future three - part series on the fundamentals of typography , I ’ll look at all of the above in more detail .
I ’ll also be discussing numerous things ( details ) that will go a long way to improving your typography both on - and off - screen .

Do you have some tips you ’d like to share ?
As I watched the talking heads in the last week try to justify and rationalize that horrifying milestone of 4,000 casualties in Iraq and Dana Perino trying to convince us that Bush truly grieves for each loss , the anonymity of it all started to niggle at me .
Four thousand is such an antiseptic number that marks how many lost loves , and children who will miss their mommy or daddy 's guidance and love ?
How many lost hugs and kisses ?
How many games of basketball with buddies from back in the day ?
How many future plans , both grandiose and small , have vanished ?
These men and women sacrificed for some amoral ideological notions of profit and hegemony all had lives that have been cut needlessly short and deprived their loved ones of their companionship forever .
My buddy , Bob Geiger tried to put a face and a life behind that milestone number .
The Agonist ( cross posted at HuffPo ) :
We know that 96 percent of the Americans killed in Iraq have died since Bush boasted that our mission was accomplished and we know with sickening assurance that we have hit the hideous milestone of 4,000 of our own dead in the Bush administration 's war of choice .
We arrived at that number on Sunday and we 've seen it replayed in all its sterility throughout the media this entire week .
And to be sure the numbers of dead and wounded while astounding in generalities have sadly begun over the last five years to lose their specificity , to render us unable to grasp the individual stories of lives lost for no reason and so many families left with interminable grief .
But I want to tell you about number 4,000 , because he has a name and he had a wonderful life to come .
His name is Christopher M. Hake .
He was a U.S. Army Staff Sargent .
More importantly , he was a husband to wife Kelli and a father to 1 - year - old son , Gage .
He was from Enid , Oklahoma -- and he was 26 years old .
We can't say for sure that Hake was number 4,000 of our Iraq dead because Pvt. George Delgado , 21 , of Palmdale , Calif. , Pfc. Andrew J. Habsieger , 22 , of Festus , Mo. and Spc. Jose A. Rubio Hernandez , 24 , of Mission , Texas all died in a horrible blast earlier this week when , according to the Defense Department , " their vehicle encountered an improvised explosive " in Baghdad .
Science fiction is full of fascist governments , especially in the decades after World War II , but some of them just seem like more fun than others .
But some scifi fascists do n't seem like they would govern that well — for example , the BBC series Doctor Who clearly uses the cyborg Daleks as a metaphor for the Nazis , but you never see the Daleks making the trains run on time .
Others , like Battlestar Galactica 's Admiral Cain , seem as though they 're actually quite efficient .
If you had to live under a fascist regime from SF , which one would you prefer ?

" He did what he did because he was who he is . ''
Auvinen shot himself in the head following the massacre , having first signalled his intentions in a video posted on YouTube .
Witnesses described chaos and panic as Auvinen killed his headmistress , five boys and two girls , and wounded a dozen others as they tried to flee the carnage .
A pupil , Terhi Vayrynen , 17 , told the Associated Press that her brother Henri , 13 , witnessed the killing of the headteacher through his classroom window .
The girl said the gunman came into Henri 's class shouting : " Revolution .
Smash everything . "
He shot at a television and windows , but not at pupils , and ran off down the corridor .
Extremist movements
A teacher , Kim Kiuru , told a local radio station the gunman had been keenly interested in war history and extremist movements .
" He was moving systematically through the school hallways , knocking on the doors and shooting through the doors , '' said Mr Kiuru , who was teaching an eighth - grade class when the gunfire started .
" It felt unreal , '' he added .
" A pupil I have taught myself was running toward me , screaming , a pistol in his hand . ''
Local police said the gun used was legal and Auvinen had been issued a permit through a gun club three weeks ago .
Mr Kiuru said the headteacher announced the danger over the public address system just before midday and ordered all children to remain in their classrooms .
" After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small calibre handgun in his hand through the doors toward me , after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction . ''
" Then my pupils shouted at me out of the windows to ask what they should do and I told them to jump out of the windows ... and all my pupils were saved . "
" We heard the shots and then we broke the windows and jumped out , " said Franz Andersin , 14 , who was in the school when the shooting spree started .
' Always smiling ' " I knew the guy .
He was always smiling .
I wonder why he did it , " he said .
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described the shooting , the worst in the Nordic country 's history , as " a great tragedy " .
" This is an awful day ...
The shooting has deeply undermined the sense of security in society ...
Nobody had expected such things , " he said .
The rampage began at 11.43 am on Wednesday ( 8.43 pm AEDT ) inside a classroom at Jokela High School in the small town of Tuusula .
The secondary school has about 450 pupils .
Auvinen had posted a video , entitled Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007 , on YouTube in the past two weeks .
The video zooms in on the school with heavy metal music blaring in the background and shows a young man against a red background pointing a gun at the camera .
Within hours of the shooting , the video had been downloaded more than 200,000 times .
' Prepared to fight '
In his profile on YouTube , Auvinen , calling himself Sturmgeist89 , says : " I am prepared to fight and die for my cause .
" I , as a natural selector , will eliminate all who I see unfit , disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection .
" You might ask yourselves , why did I do this and what do I want ?
Well , most of you are too arrogant and closed - minded to understand , " he added .
He was pronounced dead at 10.14 pm ( 7.14 am Thursday AEST ) after being treated for a single gunshot wound to the head at Helsinki University Hospital .
" He died at 22.14 of a one - bullet injury in the head , " Eero Hirvensalochief , a traumatology physician at the hospital , said .
Police and school pupils alike were at a loss to explain why Auvinen had committed such a terrible act .
Normal family
" He comes from a very normal family of four people , he has one brother .
He had no problems in school , " police officer Jan-Olav Nyholm said .
One of Auvinen 's classmates , told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that the gunman , who was a sports shooter , had recently been acting " strange ' ' and had begun making drawings of gun massacres .
He had logged into his YouTube account on Wednesday morning .
Other videos posted under his name hail the perpetrators of school shootings in the US and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .
According to media reports , he had repeatedly expressed admiration for Hitler and Stalin and he names Nietzsche as a favourite author on his YouTube account .
The US - style shooting sent shockwaves through Finland , where such violence is extremely rare .
While there have been several stabbings at Finnish schools in recent years , Wednesday 's was the first shooting since a 14 - year - old shot dead two classmates in a school in the coastal city of Rauma in 1989 .
" It 's incredible that something like this has happened in Finland , " said Jokela High School history and psychology professor Kim Kiuru .
Finland has one of the world 's highest gun ownership rates , ranking third behind the US and Yemen , according to a recent study by the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva .
Most of the registered weapons in Finland are hunting rifles .

Why do Earthlings sleep in clothes every night ?
Even if your pj's are from Victoria Secret , what is the point ?
We aliens do not wear clothing to cover our beautiful bodies when on our beautiful home planet .
Save money by sleeping naked .
If you are naked or nude , you can keep your temperature on your thermostat higher in the summer .
This will enable you to save energy and save money .
We heard through the tabloid press that David Beckham and Victoria Beckham sleep naked .
Well , that is good enough for us .
If they sleep naked , then everyone else should .
Sleeping naked is natural for your body as well .
But that is not the best reason .
Yes , you probably guessed it .
Sleeping naked allows you to have more sex with your mate , guaranteed .
When we conducted our own studies ( these studies were not paid for by Victoria Secret ) , we found out we had more sex when we slept naked than when we wore our
Question :
Why in God 's name would you ever want to create a video dating profile ?
The Internet , in its boundless generosity , has given people ( specifically those who might be considered " not traditionally beautiful " ) the slimmest ray of hope at having marginally normal sex lives .
The Internet is ripe for deception : misleading usernames ( " buffjuggernaut25 " ) , misleading incomes ( " $ 100,000 + , if you count my life insurance premium ) , and shockingly flattering photos taken from angles that no human will even be seen from in a naturally occurring situation .
An e-relationship could last for two months on carefully researched e-mails , filled with opinions copied and pasted from hip trade publications and the latest Yahoo news headlines .
It 's the perfect opportunity to fake your own success and convince a person to send you a few dirty e-mails and suggestive instant messages before the cover gets blown and they met you -- and you were animated and ruined it .
Hey , here 's an idea : Instead , let 's skip the fun part and ruin it right off the bat .
Great job , guys .

Also , having " perfectprofile " as your MySpace page kinda sets him up for failure .
Conclusion :
No girl wants a guy who 's going to make them wear a mask of his ex-girlfriend 's face while they have sex , especially when you know it will end with a tearful orgasm and mumbled whispers of regret .
And if she does she 's probably fat .

No one 's saying that some people do n't deserve love .
But for some people you just get the feeling that given the opportunity they might squeeze love a little too tight and kill it .
Although it 's admirable to be so forthcoming about yourself ( " What 's important to me is my health " ) , and what you 're looking for ( " The thing I love about women are they got a nice attractive legs , nice body , and . . . nice hair " ) , sometimes it 's better to play to your strengths .

Good afternoon .
Let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti-war rally , I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances .
The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history , and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword , the sacrifice of multitudes , that we could begin to perfect this union , and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil .
I do n't oppose all wars .
My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed , fought in Patton 's army .
He saw the dead and dying across the fields of Europe ; he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered Auschwitz and Treblinka .
He fought in the name of a larger freedom , part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil , and he did not fight in vain .
I do n't oppose all wars .
After September 11th , after witnessing the carnage and destruction , the dust and the tears , I supported this administration 's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance , and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again .
I do n't oppose all wars .
And I know that in this crowd today , there is no shortage of patriots , or of patriotism .
What I am opposed to is a dumb war .
What I am opposed to is a rash war .
What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair , weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats , irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne .
What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured , a rise in the poverty rate , a drop in the median income - to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression .
That 's what I 'm opposed to .
A dumb war .
A rash war .
A war based not on reason but on passion , not on principle but on politics .
Now let me be clear - I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein .
He is a brutal man .
A ruthless man .
A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power .
He has repeatedly defied UN resolutions , thwarted UN inspection teams , developed chemical and biological weapons , and coveted nuclear capacity .
He 's a bad guy .
The world , and the Iraqi people , would be better off without him .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors , that the Iraqi economy is in shambles , that the Iraqi military a fraction of its former strength , and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until , in the way of all petty dictators , he falls away into the dustbin of history .
I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences .
I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East , and encourage the worst , rather than best , impulses of the Arab world , and strengthen the recruitment arm of Al Qaeda .
I am not opposed to all wars .
I 'm opposed to dumb wars .
So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children , let us send a clear message to the President today .
You want a fight , President Bush ?
Let 's finish the fight with Bin Laden and Al Qaeda , through effective , coordinated intelligence , and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism , and a homeland security program that involves more than color - coded warnings .
You want a fight , President Bush ?
Let 's fight to make sure that the UN inspectors can do their work , and that we vigorously enforce a non-proliferation treaty , and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material , and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession , and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe .
You want a fight , President Bush ?
Let 's fight to make sure our so - called allies in the Middle East , the Saudis and the Egyptians , stop oppressing their own people , and suppressing dissent , and tolerating corruption and inequality , and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education , without prospects , without hope , the ready recruits of terrorist cells .
You want a fight , President Bush ?
Let 's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil , through an energy policy that does n't simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil .
Those are the battles that we need to fight .
Those are the battles that we willingly join .
The battles against ignorance and intolerance .
Corruption and greed .
Poverty and despair .
The consequences of war are dire , the sacrifices immeasurable .
We may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom , and pay the wages of war .
But we ought not -- we will not -- travel down that hellish path blindly .
Nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice , who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood , to make such an awful sacrifice in vain .
EARLY WARNING / State Department memo warned of terrorist threat
Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday that he was " startled " by a little - noticed State Department memo that was issued a week ago and warned that Americans " may be the target of a terrorist threat . "
The memo , issued just four days before the attacks on New York and Washington , identified the threat as coming from " extremist groups with links to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda organization . "
" I have not idea what intelligence lies behind the warning , " Shultz said , " but they put this out because they had some sort of intelligence . "
Shultz , who served as secretary of state under President Reagan , said he received a copy of the Sept. 7 " worldwide warning " in his San Francisco office on the day before the fatal attacks .
The memo addressed concerns for Americans overseas and made no mention of any possible attack on U.S. soil .
Reached last night , U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said this was the first she had heard anything about the State Department warnings .
" Everyone should have been ( alerted ) , but then you would have to ask whether they would have known what to look out for , " Feinstein said .
" Of course , " Feinstein said , " today is a different world , and I think a lot of things are going to change .
" Bin Laden 's people had made statements three weeks ago carried in the Arab press in Great Britain that they were preparing to carry out unprecedented attacks in the U.S. , " she said .
" Whether that was the derivation of this ( State Department ) bulletin , I do n't know . "
The warning dealt primarily with military bases in Japan and Korea .
But as Shultz pointed out , the mere fact that a warning was issued indicates that " something was cooking . "
And indeed , in the one - page alert , the State Department said it had received information in May 2001 " that American citizens may be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist groups with links to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda organization . "
" Such individuals have not distinguished between official and civilian targets , " the report said , adding , " As always , we take this information seriously .
U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain on heightened alert . "
" They had some sort of rumbling of something , " Shultz said , " even if they did n't pinpoint it in the right direction . "
U.S. State Department representative Julie Reside in Washington downplayed the significance of the bulletin yesterday , saying it was only the latest in a series of " periodically " issued public warnings by the department .
Reside said warnings are available to media organizations and on the state department 's Web page .
" If it was based on intelligence , we cannot , of course , provide any details , " Reside said .
It 's not the first time this year that the bin Laden organization was mentioned in a " worldwide caution . "
The first warning came in May , and was later updated on Sept. 7 to include the threats to U.S. military personnel in Asia .
Officials at San Francisco International Airport said they were n't aware of the State Department warning - but someone in the airport security section knew of it and passed word of the warning onto Mayor Willie Brown when he called to check on the status of flight he was planning to take to New York .
" I did n't give it much thought at the time , " Brown said .
" It was n't until after the attacks that I even remembered the call . "
Whether U.S. military installations around the world were aware of the memo and took extra precautions is a bit unclear .
Department of Defense spokesman Glenn Flood said his agency would have received a copy of the bulletin .
But , he added , " There was no order from the Pentagon for every base to go on heightened alert , because that 's up to the commands in each theater , and some are on alert anyway . "
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made mention of the bulletin at a routine -- and sparsely attended -- media briefing last Friday .
He explained that the department was revising a June 22 notice to include warnings about threats to the military in Japan and Korea and " to ensure that the general American public is aware of this potential danger to their safety . "
Boucher declined to say whether the threat in Asia was directly linked to bin Laden .

Amazing Memory Man Brain Being Tested By Scientists University of California at Irvine doctors are studying Brad Williams ' memory .
Jan. 15 , 2008  --
Imagine being able to recall just about anything , your mind functioning as a nearly endless encyclopedic scrapbook of names , pictures , dates and events .
Wisconsin resident Brad Williams ' total recall makes him a personified version of Google .
His extensive memory allows him to recall almost any news event and anything he has experienced , including specific dates and even the weather .
" I was sort of a human Google for my family .
I 've always been able to recall things , " the 51 - year - old said on " Good Morning America " in his first television interview .
Williams ' type of detailed , exhaustive memory is called hyperthymesia and few known cases exist .
Brad 's brain scans are now being studied by neuroscientists at the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at the Univeristy of California , Irvine .
Initially , the drive - time radio broadcaster did n't think his ability to recall so much was anything special .
Gradually over the years other people noticed how much he was able to remember in detail about the same events , Williams said .
Then in 2006 , he read an article about a woman whom scientists called AJ , which prompted Williams to come forward .
AJ is an anonymous subject of a medical journal and the only scientifically documented case of superior memory .
" When I read about AJ my immediate thought was , ' Oh my God .
That 's Brad , " said Williams ' brother Eric Williams .
Eric Williams ' is intrigued about the inner workings of his brother 's mind .
Eric Williams is in the process of making a documentary about Brad , appropriately titled " Unforgettable . "
In the film , which has n't been completed yet , Williams takes on a person who is Googling answers to 20 questions .
He answered 18 of them correctly and was 11 minutes faster than the searcher .
" All of us have the ability to store all this information and the difference with Brad is he can retrieve it , " Eric Williams said .
Williams remembered a grade he got in grade school , when anchor Chris Cuomo quizzed him about it today on " GMA . "
" I try to forget that , " Williams quipped .
But he gave the correct answer : B .
" If there 's an association with that date something immediately comes to mind , " Williams said .
When it 's something like a family vacation or an event or something big happened that occurred in his life , the memories come quickly , Williams added .

Obama Pastor Jeremiah Wright - Inflammatory or Provocative ?
holds a close place in presidential candidate 's heart .
Wright is the newly retired pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ on the south side of Chicago .
He officiated at Barack and 's wedding , baptized their two daughters and influenced the title of the politician 's latest book , The Audacity of Hope .
Jeremiah Wright is not without controversy .
The outspoken cleric has raised many an eyebrow from the pulpit with some strong assertions regarding the treatment of black Americans and 9/11 .
He told his congregation on the Sunday following the terrorist attacks that the U.S. had brought on the al Qaeda attacks because of it's own acts of terrorism , reminding his congregation of the horrific bombings on Japan by the U.S. during WWII .
Wright further asserted that we should not be signing God Bless America but rather God Damn America for the continued poor treatment of black American 's by the U.S. government .
Asked about the remarks made by his pastor and close friend , Sen. Obama told the New York Times he was not at the church on the day of Rev. Wright 's 9/11 sermon .
" The violence of 9/11 was inexcusable and without justification , " Obama said in a recent interview .
" It sounds like he was trying to be provocative , " Obama told the paper .
Rev.
Wright , who announced his retirement last month , is considered one of the country 's 10 most influential black pastors , according to members of Obama 's campaign .
Wright has built a large and loyal following at his church with his spirited sermons , intertwined with his own views on contemporary issues .
Apparently Obama cherry picks from his friend 's sermons and has praised Rev. Wright 's focus on Africa .
Senator Obama declined to comment on Rev. Wright 's denunciations of the United States .
Campaign aide Bill Burton said :
" Sen . Obama has said repeatedly that personal attacks such as this have no place in this campaign or our politics , whether they 're offered from a platform at a rally or the pulpit of a church .
Sen .
Obama does not think of the pastor of his church in political terms .
Like a member of his family , there are things he says with which Sen.
Obama deeply disagrees .
But now that he is retired , that does n't detract from Sen.
Obama 's affection for Rev. Wright or his appreciation for the good works he has done . "
During a campaign stop recently , Obama told a Jewish group that Rev. Wright is like an old uncle who says things that are sometimes controversial .
He does n't always agree with his minister put he continues to hold him in high regard .
NPR host : Many can ' relate ' to Rev. Wright 's words David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Sunday March 16 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Michele Norris , host of NPR's All Things Considered , told a panel of guests on Meet the Press that the tone used by Obama 's former pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright , is not uncommon in many churches .
Norris noted that many Americans find some agreement with Rev. Wright 's sermons .
She said , " When Jeremiah Wright makes these statements the Amen chorus in that church was very loud .
His words resonate with a large number of African Americans and the blunt language that he used makes people uncomfortable .
You know , when he talks about America 's inglorious record on race .
And yet , many people find something that they relate to in those words . "
Another panelist , David Broder of The Washington Post , said " [ Rev. Wright 's ] tone seems so far removed from the tone that Obama has tried to strike , not just in this campaign , but throughout his political career , that it raises the question in my mind , what was it about Reverend Wright that attracted Obama when he had as a newcomer to Chicago he had any number of churches or pastors to go to ? "
Norris responded by saying , " You 're talking about a tone and not his words .
The sort of ' fire from the pulpit ' is not something that is unusual in an African - American church .
That is something -- in fact in many churches in america . "
She continued , " It 's not all together different from what many people are hearing at this moment in churches all across America . "

Transcript via closed captions :: david broader , talk about events happening , you had the situation with geraldine ferraro that i talked with nita lowey and bill bradley with reverend jeremiah wright , tony rezko , the fund - raiser for barack obama .
on friday , senator obama went to " chicago tribune " and chicago sun times and sat down with both editorial boards and reporters for an hour and a half at each place and went through his relationship and the money he raised .
here 's one of the headlines , " obama says rezko played a bigger fund - raiser role . " with reporters and editors obama disclosed rezko raised more for obama 's earlier political campaigns than known , gathering as much as $ 250,000 for the three offices he sought , state senate , house of representatives and senator .
obama collaborated on previous statements about his private real estate transactions with rezko saying they were not mistakes of judgment because rezko was under a grand jury investigation , mistake was not just engaging in the transaction with tony rezko because he was having legal problems , the mistake because he was a contributor and somebody who was involved in politics .
david broader , does that issue create difficulty for barack obama ? :: i think it 's not a big issue at this point .
but this trial is in the very early stages and we do n't know what will come out .
it appears that mr. rezko's real connections were down in springfield with governor rather than with obama , but the one thing we know for sure , tim , is that between now and the first day of the democratic convention , there will be events and they will impact on these candidates . :: we have bill bradley calling for bill clinton to release the list of $ 500 million in contributions to his library and foundation .
the clinton tax returns post - presidency , which will be some significant income , and the archives information about hillary clinton 's role in the clinton white house .
all that might be fertile ground for journalists , perhaps for voters . :: this is a campaign that 's not about policy .
it 's about the personalities involved .
it 's become about race and gender and the sort of more fis idea of preparedness for crisis .
it 's not about what they stand for , congresswoman lowey was saying let 's talk about health care and the economy .
not a lot of difference between them on that and voters will not make up the minds about the question of mandate on health care .
you have to watch john mccain .
he's in the position to begin running his general election campaign against the both of them in front of the democratic primary voters who will look and say , well , let 's see how mccain is running against obama , standing up on the issue of reverend wright , standing up on the issue of rezko , does he look tarnished ?
it 's the republicans who the democrats will say we have to worry about and that may work to senator clinton 's benefit . :: michele , you have geraldine ferraro , reverend wroits , gender , race , must each of those candidates address these issues in bigger deal tail in terms of the impact on society and culture ? :: i think they have no escape from this .
it keeps coming up .
barack obama dealt with this directly yesterday , saying that this is sort of a generational shift .
that certain people who are -- come out of the 1960s and talking about jeremiah wright carry with them -- he said ferocious intelligence who came out of the 1960ss with whose ambitions were stymied and trying to explain some of the rhetoric there .
jeremiah wright is concerned , it 's interesting , if you introduced him for the first time based on the clips that were showed on this program , you do n't get the full measure of this man who and who he is and why barack obama may have been attracted to him .
barack obama is in a difficult position because he has said repeatedly words count .
he can't diminish these words or easily step away from them .
but if you just focus on the words , it seems that you ignore something very important .
when jeremiah wright makes these statements , amen core russ in that church was very loud .
his words resonate with a large number of african - americans .
and the blunt language that he used makes people uncomfortable .
when he talks about america 's inglorious record on race , and yet , many people find something that they relate to in those words and that 's what barack obama and hillary clinton may want to start focusing on , is the both fer regard ra dust up and the jeremiah wright seems to point to . :: many african - americans have said to me the last 48 hours , that their concern was that obama be seen not as a new kind of african - american leader , and willen caught up -- will be caught up in those comments which will frighten white americans and create difficulty for obama . :: that 's why he was fresh and new , a voice without anger . :: i said to michele a moment ago , what 's striking to me is that i do n't know reverend wroits , except for these clips , and that 's not a basis for judging his whole approach or personality .
but , his tone seems so far removed from the tone that obama has tried to strike , not just in this campaign , but throughout his political career , that it raises a question in my mind , what was it about reverend wright that attracted obama when he had as a newcomer to chicago , choice of any number of churches or pastors to go to ? :: when you talk about tone , though , it 's interesting .
you 're talking about a tone and not his words .
the sort of fire from the pulpit is not something that is unusual in an african - american church .
that is something -- in fact n many churches in america .
what you 're dealing with the these statements is in part the words , but also in the way that they were delivered .
you 're right in noting that is very different from what barack obama hears .
it 's not all together different from what many people are hearing at this moment in churches all across america .
A couple of years ago , Michael T. Arnold landed at the Los Angeles International Airport after a 20 - hour flight from the Philippines .
He had his laptop with him , and a customs officer took a look at what was on his hard drive .
Clicking on folders called “ Kodak pictures ” and “ Kodak memories , ” the officer found child pornography .
The search was not unusual : the government contends that it is perfectly free to inspect every laptop that enters the country , whether or not there is anything suspicious about the computer or its owner .
Rummaging through a computer ’s hard drive , the government says , is no different than looking through a suitcase .
One federal appeals court has agreed , and a second seems ready to follow suit .
There is one lonely voice on the other side .
In 2006 , Judge Dean D. Pregerson of Federal District Court in Los Angeles suppressed the evidence against Mr. Arnold .
“ Electronic storage devices function as an extension of our own memory , ” Judge Pregerson wrote , in explaining why the government should not be allowed to inspect them without cause .
“ They are capable of storing our thoughts , ranging from the most whimsical to the most profound . ”

If someone asked you what the most important thing in your life is , what would you say ?
Some people say it ’s their health but their actions prove otherwise – often due to misinformation or simple lack of knowledge .
Here are some health and fitness tips that should be common knowledge but are n’t .
( Please note that while various health resources and professionals were consulted , this article should not be construed as medical / health advice . )
1. Alcohol is not a food group .
The way so many people consume potent potables , you ’d think it was the secret elixir of life .
When you drink excessively you eat less because the caloric intake of alcohol keeps hunger at bay .
This of course means that outwardly you may stay relatively trim , but inwardly you ’re starving your body of appropriate nutrients .
Not to mention , you ’re damaging brain cells and shrinking your brain , creating water and electrolyte losses , and doing a variety of other damaging things .
There is a very good reason why studies in the U.S. , Canada , Britain , etc. have listed alcohol as one of the most dangerous drugs in the world .
2 . You deserve a break right now .
Taking a break from work once in a while does not put you behind , despite popular opinion .
It helps by letting your mind and body rest , thus preserving your health and sanity .
The alternative is to keep working and burn out , which weakens your immune system and eventually sets your work back .
3 . Stress will kill you .
Actually , it ’s not so much the stress that will kill you , but your reaction to it and your way of dealing with it .
It ’s been estimated that somewhere between 75 and 90 per cent of all visits to health care providers are for stress - related ailments .
Life is full of stress .
There is no getting around it , but there are ways of dealing with it and finding outlets for it .
Everyone is different in this respect .
Some people need to find ways to let it out , others channel stress into activities , and still others need techniques that lessen it .
Regardless of what works for you , the most important thing you can do is to not ignore stress and think you ca n’t do anything about it .
Find time to deal with it ; find a starting point .
4 . Most people do n’t know the symptoms of a heart attack .
It ’s surprising but a U.S. report shows that about one in four adults know the symptoms of a heart attack .
With the incidence of heart problems in both sexes growing due to stress , poor diet , and thyroid disorders , it ’s important to be aware of all the symptoms .
5 . Having a pet can reduce stress .
It ’s not a new belief that having a pet such as a dog or a cat can be good for us , especially if we ’re single and lonely .
That might stave off depression .
New research shows that having a cat might be more beneficial than having a dog , and that this might reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke .
( The fact is , dogs are also more work to take care of in general , and . )
6 . Sex can help relieve stress .
People sometimes say “ no ” to their partners if they ’re feeling stressed or have a headache .
Some people have other reasons for not having sex .
But because orgasm causes an all - body relaxation , having sex can actually help you through headaches and stress .
So be like Madonna and have lots of sex .
Just not with Guy Ritchie , or you might end up talking like Brad Pitt ’s mumbling Mickey O’Neil character in Snatch .
7. Thyroid disorder can reduce libido .
If you are saying “ no ” to sex because you just do n’t feel the urge , you might have a thyroid problem .
This can reduce your libido and fertility , male or female .
( Obviously , this is not a problem that Hollywood is having , considering all occupied celebrity vajayjays out there . )
8. Thyroid disorder can cause depression and debilitate you .
In addition to lowering libido ( mentioned above ) , thyroid disorder can also cause weight fluctuations , hair loss , severe depression , heart problems and numerous other problems .
While having any of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have a thyroid problem , it is a growing health issue – possibility due to accumulated fluoride use .
9. Depression can cause heart disease .
This is tied in with thyroid disorders ( above ) , but depression can come from other sources as well , and is now being tied to potential heart disease , heart attacks and stroke .
10 .
Happiness does lead to good health .
Seems pretty obvious , right ?
And , I can hear many of you saying that if you had more luck , more money , less stress , etc. , you ’d be happy .
Wrong !
You would n’t , not necessarily .
Being happy is a way of looking at life .
The happiest people in the world are not always the luckiest , they are the ones who are able to deal with whatever comes their way and not let it get to them .
Have you ever noticed that you actually feel better when you ’re happy ?
That ’s because your body ’s systems respond to your emotional state .
11 . There is no quick way to get fit .
One dangerous development in the area of health over the last 20 years has to be the proliferation of pseudo - health professionals .
This includes annoying celebrity spokespeople spouting inane gibberish about how easy some idiotic new workout is , and how it will quickly and easily get you fit without ever having to change your lifestyle .
Bull !
Nothing in life is easy .
Well , except maybe avoiding the truth .
Getting fit requires hard work , dedication , time , and consistency .
It does get easier once it becomes part of your lifestyle , but it ca n’t ever be truly easy or it would have no actual benefit .
There is an old saying that you cannot get to “ there ” by standing where you are .
If you want to become something else , you cannot hold on to what you are right now .
Getting fit requires giving up old habits and replacing them with healthy new ones that will continue on throughout your life – something no fad workout you see on TV can do , because you ’ll get bored with it just in time for the next new craze .
12 . There is no easy way to lose weight .
This is not the same as the last tip .
Getting fit and losing weight are two completely different things .
In fact , if you want to get fit , throw out your weigh scale .
You ’ll never need it again because you ’ll be forever enraged to discover that you ’ll probably be heavier as you get fitter .
( Note : this tip only relates to those people who are within about 10 % of their target weight , not for people who really do need to lose large amounts of weight ) .
Muscle weighs more than fat , even lean , toned muscle .
Losing weight has absolutely nothing to do with getting fit .
That ’s why you hear all those fad drugs , diets , etc. , talking about losing weight without exercising .
They are all part of the group of people who feed your misconception that thin is healthy , or if you ’re not thin , you ’re ugly and worthless .
13 .
The term “ diet ” is often misused .
A diet is the entire scope of the food you consume , not a quick way to lose weight or get healthy .
If you learn nothing else in respect to your health , learn this : fad diets are harmful and will end up making you fatter and less healthy .
In fact , changing your diet to “ lose weight , ” without adding in the appropriate amount of exercise , will likely reduce the amount of muscle mass you have ( and may even raise the amount of fat ) .
So you might weigh less , but it ’s not exactly the result you ’d want .
Getting healthy requires changing bad habits , including the way you eat , and the amount and kind of exercise you get .
This method may take longer , but it will also last longer – mainly because it is a permanent , positive change in the way you do things .
14 . Being thin does not mean you ’re fit .
Just because you ’re thin does n’t mean you ’re fit or healthy .
Case in point , many alcoholics and drugs addicts are very thin , but you ’d never call them healthy or fit .
Genetics , body structure , and the amount of fat cells you developed as a child will determine just how thin you can become , it has nothing to do with how fit a person is .
Fitness is cardiovascular fitness , muscle stamina and strength , flexibility , etc .
Learn to accept your body type and concentrate on getting or staying healthy enough to do the things you want to do , and should be able to do for your age group .
15 . Extra pounds does not mean you ’re unfit .
If you ’re carrying a few extra pounds , it does n’t mean you ’re not fit .
It ’s human nature to get hung up on one thing and ignore all the rest .
If you ’re an active person who eats well , and looks after themselves in other respects but still can’t lose those last few pounds , do n’t discount all the good things you ’re doing to stay healthy .
The worst thing you can do is look in the mirror or weigh yourself and become discouraged .
Do n’t give up all the good you ’re doing .
16 . Celebrity beauty is often an illusion .
Models , actors , and other celebrities do n’t necessarily look that beautiful without makeup .
Jamie Lee Curtis did an incredible photo shoot a few years ago where she allowed herself to be deconstructed on camera .
She wanted to show how she looked all made up , tucked in , etc. , versus how she looked for real underneath it all , in a bra and panties , with no make - up , no cinchers , no help of any kind .
She wanted to show men and women that Hollywood and fashion are a world of make - believe .
No one really looks the way you see in magazines , theatres , or television .
Even in the days before digital technology , no photo of a model was ever shown to the public that had n’t been retouched in some way by a very skilled artist .
17 . Obesity is becoming an epidemic .
It ’s all over the news but some people just are n’t getting it .
It might be “ your body ” to do with as you please , but loading up on the wrong food can trigger Type 2 diabetes – which is as terrible and painful a disease as any other .
This applies to both school - aged kids and adults .
Even several celebrities of late , including Russell Crowe and Val Kilmer , have been photographed bearing a lot more weight than you ’d ever see them with onscreen .
18 . Just a little exercise goes a long way .
A thirty - year U.S. study shows that moderate aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of stroke .
Just 30 minutes of daily brisk walking or something equivalent can cut risk by almost 40 % .
19 .
Dance , little sister , dance .
Guys , too .
If you do n’t like exercise , try dancing .
It ’s and an aerobic exercise that does n’t feel like one .
And unless you ’re a total grinch , dancing is fun and social besides .
One health network held a dance for health event in late February that over 60 U.S. cities participated in .
20 .
Do n’t treat your body like a forklift .
Whether you ’re lifting weights while working out , or heavy objects at work or around your home , knowing proper technique is essential – especially if you ’re stressed out .
Do you know your limits , and know what equipment and supports you can utilize to help you , especially when your body is in an awkward position ?
Consider weight belts ( even if you ’re not working out ) , wrist straps , motorized dollies .
Carry smaller amounts in repeated trips to minimize the stress and strain you put on your body .
21 . Damage is cumulative and subtle .
It ’s easy to get caught up in our busy lives and do things to our body that we know is wrong .
Nothing may appear wrong .
At least not for years to come .
Those aches and pains you ’re suffering from right now might actually be due to events from years ago .
Whatever you ’re doing now , you may not feel the repercussions today , but months or years from now , when you have a noticeable injury , you ’ll wonder what happened .
Maybe it was that day in high school or college when you and your buddies tried to carry the teacher ’s car and high - sided it on a concrete barrier .
Also , damage is cumulative .
That one event may not have caused you any serious damage , but what it did do was teach you a bad lesson that you could get away with doing stupid things so that each successive stupid thing built on the damage the first one created .
22 . Keep active medical records and family histories .
Even thought this seemingly benign tip can stir up heated debate , the core of what it does is never really in dispute .
The idea that every patient should keep an active record of their medical conditions , treatments , and family histories , is not a new one , but with technology , changes in lifestyle , treatment options , etc. , it has become a very important one .
With people traveling more and seeing a variety of health care providers , these records would not only aid in diagnosis and treatment , but would help reduce incidences of “ medical misadventure . ”
23 .
Going to a doctor does not make you look like a weenie .
Men in particular seem to have a hang up about looking weak , which is odd since most men look up to their favorite athletes .
Athletes see doctors almost daily .
They have to because the stress and strain of their job requires it .
So , if athletes are not weenies for getting every ache and pain checked , why are you ?
You ’ve heard this before : an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .
Just make sure you follow it .
24 . Pharmaceutical drugs are not always the answer .
As much as society and many allopathic physicians have fallen into the trap of having a pill for every ailment , many doctors will tell you that they ’d rather not prescribe medication unless it ’s absolutely necessary .
Pharmaceuticals , even the most benign and necessary ones , have side effects and can cause long - term issues that occasionally surpass the illness they were trying to resolve .
Worse , they become a crutch and absolve the patient of having to address the issue that caused their ailment in the first place .
Like someone who eats twice as much of a “ light ” food , patients often continue or worsen their bad habits when they know a pill will “ cure ” them .
Pharmaceuticals also complicate a doctor ’s life because it can mean there are fewer options for treatment when a patient develops a condition that really can be effectively and safely treated by a drug , but that drug ca n’t be used because it contraindicates another drug the patient has been taking .
25 . Give yourself a starting point for change .
With our lives so busy these days , it ’s often frustrating trying to find time to do something we want to do .
That includes exercising , eating right , lessening stress , and so on .
If you wait until you “ have the time , ” you ’ll never have the time and you will never start .
Set aside the time today to start doing things that improve your health and wellness .
Start small so there is less chance for failure , but start somewhere .
That small success will build and allow you to take a bigger step tomorrow , and the next day , and the next .

There is a particular narrative about science that science journalists love to write about , and Americans love to hear .
I call it the ' oppressed underdog ' narrative , and it would be great except for the fact that it 's usually wrong .
The narrative goes like this :
1 . The famous , brilliant scientist So - and - so hypothesized that X was true .
2. X , forever after , became dogma among scientists , simply by virtue of the brilliance and fame of Dr. So-and - so .
3 . This dogmatic assent continues unchallenged until an intrepid , underdog scientist comes forward with a dramatic new theory , completely overturning X , in spite of sustained , hostile opposition by the dogmatic scientific establishment .
We love stories like this ; in our culture we love the underdog , who sticks to his or her guns , in spite of heavy opposition .
In this narrative , we have heroes , villains , and a famous , brilliant scientist proven wrong .
I 'm sure you could pick out instances in science history where this story is true , but more often it is not .
You would n't know this from the pages of our major news media though ; in fact you 'd probably get the impression that the underdog narrative is the way science works .
And many journalists may think that too ; after all , most of them read ( or misread ) Thomas Kuhn when they were in college , and Kuhn brought this kind of narrative to a new high .
The impression this narrative leaves is that science only progresses by the efforts of brave individuals who are willing to weather the wrath of the scientific establishment .
Why is this narrative about science wrong ?
Let me illustrate with the nearest example I have at hand right now : a piece out of the 2007 Best American Science and Nature Writing : " The Effeminate Sheep " , by Jonah Lehrer , a piece that was originally published in Seed magazine .
The piece is about Joan Roughgarden , a writer here at Scientific Blogging , an accomplished Stanford Biologist , and the transgendered author of the book , Evolution 's Rainbow , about the sexual diversity that we find in nature .
As we learn in her book , gay sex is quite popular in the animal world - bonobos , fish , giraffes , whales , and big - horn sheep make humans look incredibly prudish .
This raises a question : being gay has obvious evolutionary fitness consequences - without modern medicine , you have to have heterosexual sex to have offspring .
So is homosexuality in nature just a freak occurrence , a case of bad genes ; or is it something that is in some way adaptive and therefore under selective pressure ?
Does this mean that there are problems with our current understanding of sexual selection in evolutionary theory ?
( Important aside : let 's make it clear right now that my intention is not to knock Dr. Roughgarden or her research , or her book - I 'm talking here about how science is presented to the public .
In fact I feel a little school pride in Roughgarden 's accomplishments - she and I both spent some of our educational careers at the University of Rochester , though obviously not at the same time . )
Getting back to our underdog narrative , take a look at how Lehrer sets up the story .
After giving a very brief introduction to Darwin 's ideas about sexual selection , using the classic example of peacock tails , he writes :
" Darwin 's theory of sex has been biological dogma ever since he postulated why peacocks flirt .
His gendered view of life has become a centerpiece of evolution , one of his great scientific legacies . "
There you have the classic start of the narrative : Darwin , our brilliant scientist , came up with a theory about evolutionary sexual selection , which has been dogma among biologists ever since .
But this story is n't true : Darwin 's theories about selection took some time before they were widely accepted ( in fact , Darwin 's claim that all living species share a common ancestry was accepted before his ideas about selection ) .
And even then , they were n't taken as dogma ; researchers have been actively studying the subject for a long time .
The theory of sexual selection has undergone heavy scrutiny and extensive modification , including an effort to put it within the mathematical framework of game theory - a development which did n't take place until 100 years after Darwin proposed sexual selection .
Biological dogma ever since Darwin ?
Hardly !
( Take a look at this book on the development and status of theories of sexual selection . )
But Lehrer does n't bother to tell his readers any of this ; it would spoil the underdog narrative .
It 's time to introduce the underdog scientist ready to overturn it all :
" Despite this new evidence [ of gay sex among animals ] , sexual selection theory is still stuck in the nineteenth century .
The Victorian peacock remains the standard - bearer .
But as far as Roughgarden is concerned , that 's bad science : ' The time has come to declare that sexual theory is indeed false and stop shoehorning one exception after another into a sexual selection framework ...
To do otherwise suggests that sexual selection theory is unfalsifiable , not subject to refutation . ' "
Roughgarden is the underdog against the scientific establishment - an establishment stuck in the nineteenth century , so willing to protect its pet theory that it will go so far as to make it unfalsifiable .
What is this revolutionary idea that the establishment is hostile towards ?
Roughgarden believes that homosexual behavior is an adaptive trait , one preserved by natural selection to play an important role in group cohesion , or as Lehrer puts it , " gayness is a necessary side effect of getting along . "
To support this , Roughgarden marshals examples of unorthodox sexual arrangements in many different species , and explains that these arrangements actually promote evolutionary fitness in complex animal societies .
She has presented this evidence in a popular book , Evolution 's Rainbow , and in a review article in the journal Science ( subscription required ) .
Her ideas are unquestionably bold .
She and her co-authors set themselves an ambitious task to replace the current theory of sexual selection :
" We think that the notion of females choosing the genetically best males is mistaken .
Studies repeatedly show that females exert choice to increase number , not genetic quality , of offspring and not to express an arbitrary feminine aesthetic .
Instead , we suggest that animals cooperate to rear the largest number of offspring possible , because offspring are investments held in common .
We therefore propose replacing sexual selection theory with an approach to explaining reproductive social behavior that has its basis in cooperative game theory . "
They go on to present their new mathematical formalism for their ideas .
This is how science is supposed to work , incidentally .
Roughgarden wrote a popular book , but did n't expect that to be a substitute for genuine scientific papers .
She knows she has to convince her scientific peers , and to do that , she wrote a technical paper , spelling out the mathematical basis for her novel ideas .
The next step is for the people who understand those mathematical details to check them out , work them over , and see how persuasive they are .
But that 's not how the underdog narrative goes .
According to Lehrer , by this point it should have been an open - and - shut case , if it were n't for the hostile scientific establishment :
" Despite Roughgarden 's long list of peer - reviewed articles in prestigious journals , most evolutionary biologists remain skeptical of her conclusions ...
In the absence of something conclusive , most scientists stick with Darwin and Dawkins . "
In the underdog narrative , it is wrong for the establishment to remain skeptical , which in reality is exactly the opposite of how science is supposed to work .
It is not like a courtroom where innocence is the presumption ; in science , a novel idea is unfounded until proven otherwise .
And Roughgarden 's publication record , impressive as it is , is not evidence that her hypothesis is correct .
Nor is the fact that her review article was published in Science evidence that her idea is true .
It does mean though that she 's put something together serious enough to deserve a hearing .
( One more nitpicking point - " scientists are sticking with Dawkins " ?
Dawkins may be the authority on the subject to someone like Lehrer who has probably read only popular books on evolution .
Dawkins has done some professional work in this field , but he 's not the reigning authority . )
Our underdog narrative is almost complete : we have a reigning scientific authority , Darwin , whose ideas are entrenched dogma among an establishment that is skeptical of our underdog scientist , whose ideas are so obviously true that they would have been accepted if it were n't for the closed - mindedness of the defenders of orthodoxy .
And closed - minded they are : Lehrer , instead of summarizing the real critiques that Roughgarden 's paper generated ( those with access to Science can read them here and here ) , suggests that biologists are unwilling to abandon their dogma of sexual selection and view homosexuality as anything but " sexual deviants " and " statistical outliers . "
That 's not exactly what Roughgarden 's critics are saying .
The responses to her Science review included two major criticisms : that Roughgarden did not correctly characterize sexual selection as it is currently understood , and that some of her assumptions in her game theory model were wrong .
Most writers did think that she had offered something interesting , although not something which completely negates the theory of sexual selection ; several writers suggested that current theories could be modified to incorporate Roughgarden 's ideas .
Lehrer does quote one scientist who basically says just that .
He quotes PZ Myers , a University of Minnesota biologist :
" I think much of what Roughgarden says is very interesting .
But I think she discounts many of the modifications that have been made to sexual selection since Darwin originally proposed it .
So in that sense , her Darwin is a straw man .
You do n't have to dismiss the modern version of sexual selection in order to explain sexual selection of homosexuality . "
Our narrative would not be complete without a final look at our persevering underdog :
" Roughgarden remains defiant , " Lehrer writes .
And we learn the real source of the establishment 's skepticism .
" I think many scientists discount me because of who I am , " the transgendered Roughgarden says .
" The theory is becoming Ptolemaic .
It clearly has the trajectory of a hypothesis in trouble . "
We are left with the impression of scientists hanging on to a sinking theoretical ship , unable to move forward in their understanding because they have something personally against the underdog of the narrative .
It 's amazing science makes any advances at all , with such closed - minded people in control of the field !
But that 's not really how things work .
The real story is an example of science operating the way it is supposed operate : a researcher comes up with new and very interesting observations that seem to challenge our current understanding of an important problem .
She works to put those observations under some sort of theoretical framework , and presents the results in a paper to her scientific peers .
Her fellow scientists think the work is interesting , but remain unconvinced because the evidence or theoretical development is not yet sufficient to support the hypothesis .
What should happen next is that our researcher should go out and collect more evidence , correct any mistakes in the analysis or make a persuasive reply to her critics , and try again .
A major new idea , one which overturns an existing , well - supported theory , does not get established in one paper .
There has to be follow up and debate , and if the idea holds up to scrutiny it will be accepted .
Beware the underdog narrative in science journalism .
This narrative severely misrepresents how science really works .
It 's designed to elicit our sympathy for a not - yet - established theory , maybe one that is socially attractive , and to arouse our indignation against the staid community of eggheaded scientists .
This underdog narrative plays on our emotions , it makes for a good read , and helps us feel good about ourselves when we stand up for our convictions .
What gets lost is the scientific method , the idea that novel proposals need to be thoroughly vetted and tested , no matter how intuitively attractive they are .
That vetting process is done by a dynamic community of smart , educated , competitive people , who care passionately about science .
It 's a community where everyone wants to come up with the next big theory that overturns long - held beliefs .
But that 's hard to do , especially in fields where all the low - hanging fruit has been picked over by really talented people for decades or centuries .
If a new theory is being presented in the media as the centerpiece of an underdog narrative , you can bet the farm that this theory is not yet sufficiently substantiated by the evidence .
That does n't mean it 's wrong necessarily , but it does mean that the hypothesis has not yet met the rigorous standards of evidence that have served science well for centuries .
I said I was n't writing this to knock Dr. Roughgarden , but I 'm going to renege on that promise just a little : based on how she 's quoted in the piece , she does seem to be feeding the narrative .
She 's not giving her colleagues enough credit for giving her ideas a hearing .
What non-heterosexual behavior among vertebrates implies about evolution is a fascinating question , one many biologists would be happy to know more about .
I think the idea that homosexual behavior could be adaptive is intriguing , and its widespread occurrence in nature is a worthwhile scientific subject .
But it 's an issue that 's only going to be settled by more evidence .
The figure was revealed ahead of China 's annual parliamentary session , which begins on Wednesday .
Just before the announcement , the US released a report criticising China 's military spending , and voicing concern over advances in space and cyberspace .
China rejected the Pentagon report as a " serious distortion of facts " that could harm its relations with the US .
" It breaks international norms ...
We do not pose a threat to any country .
The US should drop its Cold War mentality , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
In the report , Washington claimed that the real Chinese defence budget for 2007 was at least double the stated amount .
And other nations have also expressed concern about China 's growing military power , and say Beijing is not open enough about what it is spending its money on .
' Solely defence '
Most of this year 's military increase will be spent on increasing salaries and accommodating higher oil prices , according to Jiang Enzhu , a spokesman for China 's National People 's Congress , which begins its annual meeting on Wednesday .
Mr Jiang said spending on armaments would rise only moderately .

" China 's limited military capability is solely for the purpose of safeguarding independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity , and does not pose a threat to any other country . "
He added that China spent less on defence , as a proportion of GDP , than the US , UK , France and Russia .
But the international community remains concerned .
This year 's rise in military spending " will mark the 20th consecutive year that the Chinese military budget has increased by double digits , " Japan 's defence ministry said in a statement .
It called on China to " address the concerns of the international community " .
US officials are particularly worried that China 's growing military might could be aimed at Taiwan , a self - governing island which Beijing sees as part of its territory .
Beijing has threatened military attack if Taiwan declares independence , and the island 's 22 March presidential election will be watched closely by the authorities on the mainland .
Cyberspace concerns
The US defence department released its annual report on Chinese military power on Monday evening .
The report said China was developing weapons that would disable its enemies ' space technology - such as satellites - in the event of a conflict .
It expressed concern about China 's decision to shoot down a defunct weather satellite in a test in January 2007 .
China is adding a new class of nuclear submarine to existing stock
David Sedney , a senior China specialist at the Pentagon , told reporters there was no call for US alarm , but he said that Washington was keen for Beijing to be clearer about the reasons behind its expanding military costs .
" I think the biggest thing for people to be concerned about , really , is the fact that we do n't have that kind of strategic understanding of the Chinese intentions , " he said .
" And that leads to uncertainty . "
In its report , the Pentagon estimated that China 's total military spending in 2007 was between $ 97bn and $ 139bn .
Last month , the Bush administration requested $ 515 bn for the next US fiscal year , not including extra spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There has recently been some progress in US - Chinese military relations , including the installation of a joint telephone hotline .
Russia delivers nuclear fuel to Iran .
Russia and China sign multi-billion dollar contracts to develop Iran 's oil and gas fields , the auto and telecommunications sectors .
Both do so within two weeks of the U.S. intelligence agencies announcing that Tehran does not have a nuclear weapons program .
After six years of sabre rattling , George W. Bush 's Iran policy is in shambles .
It is so for the same reason his Iraq policy has been .
It 's fundamentally dishonest .
The U.S. does not want Iran to develop a bomb but it wo n't reduce its own huge nuclear stockpile , as called for under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
It bullies Iran for allegedly doing what Israel , India and Pakistan have done : develop nuclear bombs covertly .
Far from penalizing them , Bush has been courting each for strategic reasons .
Nor would he support a call by the International Atomic Energy Agency for a nuclear - free Middle East , including Israel .
Do what I say , not what I do .
Iran 's nuclear program was started by the pro-U.S. Shah in the 1970s , with Washington 's full backing .
The power plant at Bushehr lay dormant after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Since the Russians resumed work on it in 1995 , the IAEA has kept an eye and will monitor the fuel that Russia has just shipped .
This is all legit work .
It is at another plant , at Natanz , that Iran is enriching uranium .
That , too , is legit , under the non-proliferation treaty , of which Iran is a member .
So what 's the problem ?
The U.S. and its allies do not want Iran to have the know - how to enrich uranium , which can also be used to make a bomb .
But Iran says it is not making one and does not want to .
We do n't believe you , says the U.S. , because you 've cheated in the past .
Iran was indeed not forthcoming about all its activities , as required by the non-proliferation treaty .
It 's now working with the IAEA to explain its 1988 - 2003 record .
The issue boils down to deciphering Iran 's " intentions . "
Bush says : " They can play like they got a civilian program and pass the knowledge to a covert military program . "
But all nuclear nations built their bombs that way .
So , his stance becomes : Okay , we did it but you can't .
And you can't because you hate Israel and the U.S. , and help Hamas and Hezbollah .
That 's why we must stop you , never mind the IAEA .

Hence the parallel American track at the UN Security Council , which passed two resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran .
Bush was trying for a third when his own intelligence agencies pulled the rug from under him .
If Iran has no weapons program , as the IAEA also says , the basis for the UN resolutions is gone .
And there 's no basis to bomb Iran .
Enter the Russians with the fuel , and they and the Chinese with the contracts to sign .
We are seeing a repeat of a historic American mistake .
In the 1950s , Dwight Eisenhower sent Egypt into the Soviet fold , from which it could n't be pried for decades .
Bush needs to engage Tehran , not order it around .
He wants to talk to Iran about Iraq but not Iran itself .
You help us in Iraq but we wo n't help you anywhere .
The clerics in Tehran wo n't crumble under such coercion .
But they do respond pragmatically , as they did against the Taliban , both pre- and post - 9/11 .
They want the U.S. to stop being belligerent , abandon its policy of regime change and respect Iran 's territorial integrity .
That 's not a bad starting point to demand , in return , the suspension of the uranium enrichment program and a constructive Iranian role in Lebanon and in the peace talks in the Middle East .

( A talk given on the First of March 2008 at Invitation to Learn ’s weekend retreat )
They ( the Palestinians ) will bring upon themselves a bigger holocaust because we will use all our might to defend ourselves .
— Matan Vilnai , Israeli Deputy Defence Minister , 29 February 2008
It is clear beyond any doubt that the Israeli Deputy Defence Minister was far from being reluctant to equate Israel with Nazi Germany when revealing the genocidal future awaiting the Palestinian people , yet , for some reason , this is precisely what Western media outlets refrain from doing .
In spite of the facts that are right in front of our eyes , in spite of the starvation in Gaza , in spite of an Israeli official admitting genocidal inclinations against the Palestinians , in spite of the mounting carnage and death , we are still afraid to admit that Gaza is a concentration camp and it is on the verge of becoming a deadly one .
For some peculiar reason , many of us have yet to accept that as far as evil is concerned , Israel is the world champion in mercilessness and vengeance .
Liberty and Authority
In his invaluable text On Liberty , John Stuart Mill argued that struggle always takes place between the competing demands of liberty and authority .
In other words , freedom and hegemony are set to battle each other .
However , Western egalitarian liberal ideology is there to introduce a political alternative .
It is there to nourish the myth that ‘ authority ’ and ‘ freedom ’ could be seen as two sides of the same coin .
Today , I will try to elaborate on the structural dynamic of liberal discourse and the different elements that are involved in maintaining the false image of ‘ freedom ’ , ‘ freedom of speech ’ and ‘ freedom of thought ’ .
I will try to argue that it is our alleged ‘ freedom ’ that actually stops us from thinking freely and ethically .
As you may notice I said ‘ false image of freedom ’ because I am totally convinced that , as far as Liberal discourse is concerned , freedom is nothing more than a mere image .
In practice , there is no such a thing .
The image of ‘ freedom ’ is there to fuel and maintain our righteous self - loving discourse so we can keep sending our soldiers to kill millions in the name of ‘ democracy ’ .
Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Thought
I would like to introduce this with an elaboration of the distinction between ‘ freedom of speech ’ and ‘ freedom of thought ’ .
Freedom of speech can be realised as one ’s liberty to expresses one ’s own thoughts .
Bearing in mind that humans are expressive creatures , there is no easy policing method to guarantee the silencing of the dissident voice .
Since speaking is inherent to human nature , any exercise of litigation to do with the curtailing of such an elementary right is rather complicated :
You ban one ’s books ?
One would then spread leaflets in the streets .
You confiscate one ’s flyers ?
One would then agitate over the net .
You cut one ’s power , confiscate one ’s computer ?
One may start to shout one ’s head off .
You chop off one ’s tongue ?
One would then nod in approval when others are repeating one ’s manifesto .
You are then left with no other option but chopping one ’s head off , but even then , all you do is make one into a martyr .
Two available methods are used by liberals to silence the dissident :
a. prohibition ( financial penalty and imprisonment ) ;
b. social exclusion .
However , it is crucial to mention that within the so - called liberal discourse , any attempt to ban an idea or a dissident voice is counter - effective , if anything it reflects badly on the liberal authority and the system .
This is why liberals try to facilitate some rather sophisticated methods of censorship and thought policing that would involve very little authoritarian intervention .
As we will see soon , in liberal society , censorship and thought policing is mostly self - imposed .
As much as it is difficult to curtail freedom of speech , suppressing freedom of thought is almost impossible .
Freedom of thought could be realised as the liberty to think , to feel , to dream , to remember , to forget , to forgive , to love and to hate .
As difficult as it may be to impose thought on others , it is almost unfeasible to stop people from seeing the truth for themselves .
Yet , there are some methods to suppress and restrain intuitive thinking and ethical insight .
I am obviously referring here to guilt .
Guilt , inflicted mostly via a set of axioms conveyed as ‘ political correctness ’ , is the most effective method to keep society or any given discourse in a state of ‘ self - policing ’ .
It turns the so - called autonomous liberal subject into a subservient , self - moderated , obedient citizen .
Yet , the authority is spared from making any intervention .
It is the liberal subject who curtails oneself from accepting a set of fixed ideas that support the egalitarian image of freedom and ecumenical society .
However , at this point I see the necessity to suggest that in spite of the liberal claim for peace seeking , liberal societies in general and the Anglo - American ones in particular are currently involved in crimes against humanity on a genocidal scale .
Consequently , the more horrid the West is becoming , the greater is the gap between ‘ freedom of thought ’ and ‘ freedom of speech ’ .
This gap can easily evolve into a cognitive dissonance that in many cases mature into some severe form of apathy .
It is said that ‘ all it takes for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing ’ .
This summarizes perfectly well the apathetic negligence of the Western masses .
Not many care much about the genocide in Iraq that is committed in our name or the mass murder in Palestine that is committed with the support of our governments .
Why are we apathetic ?
Because when we want to stand up and say what we feel , when we want to celebrate our alleged freedom and to equate Gaza with Auschwitz , or Baghdad with Dresden , something inside us stops us from doing so .
It is not the Government , legislation or any other form of authority , it is rather a small and highly effective self - inflicted ‘ guilt microchip ’ acting as policing regulator in the name of ‘ political correctness ’ .
I will now try to follow the historical and philosophical evolution that leads us from the liberal - egalitarian - utopia to the current ethical and intellectual self - castration disaster .
The Harm Principle
John Stuart Mill , the founder of modern liberal thinking , tells us that any doctrine should be allowed the light of day no matter how immoral it may seem to everyone else .
This is obviously the ultimate expression of liberal thinking .
It ascribes absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects , practical or speculative , scientific , ethical , political , religious or theological .
Though Mill endorsed the fullest form of liberty of expression , he suggested a limitation attached to freedom set by the prevention of ‘ harm to others ’ .
It is obviously very difficult to defend freedom of speech once it leads to the invasion of the rights of others .
The question to ask is therefore , “ what types of speech may cause harm ? ”
Mill distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate harm .
According to Mill , only when speech causes a direct and clear violation of rights , can it be limited .
But then , what kind of speech may cause such violation ?
Feminists , for instance , have been maintaining that pornography degrades , endangers , and harms the lives of women .
Another difficult case is hate speech .
Most European liberal democracies have limitations on hate speech .
Yet , it is debatable whether a ban of pornography or hate speech can be supported by the harm principle as articulated by Mill .
One would obviously have to prove that such speech or imagery violates rights , directly and in the first instance .
Consequently , Mill ’s harm principle is criticised for being too narrow as well as too broad .
It is too narrow for failing to defend the right of the marginal .
It is too broad because when interpreted extensively , it may lead to a potential abolishment of almost every political , religious or socially orientated speech .
The Offense Principle and Free Speech
Bearing in mind the shortcomings of the ‘ harm principle ’ , it did n’t take long before an ‘ offence principle ’ had been called into play .
The offence principle can be articulated as follows :
‘ One ’s freedom of expression should not be interfered with unless it causes an offence to others . ’
The basic reasoning behind the ‘ offence principle ’ is trivial .
It is there to defend the rights of the marginal and the weak .
It is there to amend the hole created by the far - too - broad harm principle .
The offence principle is obviously pretty effective in curtailing pornography and hate speech .
As in the case of violent pornography , strictly speaking , the offence that is caused by a Nazi march through a Jewish neighbourhood cannot be avoided and must be addressed .
However , the offence principle can be criticized for setting the bar far too low .
Theoretically speaking , everyone can be ‘ offended ’ by anything .
The Jewish Lobbies and the Liberal Discourse
There is no doubt that the vast utilization of the offence principle ascribes a lot of political power to some marginal lobbies in general and Jewish lobbies in particular .
Counting on the premise of the ‘ offence principle ’ , Jewish nationalist ethnic activists claim to be offended by any form of criticism of the Jewish state and Zionism .
But in fact it goes further , in practice it is n’t just criticism of Zionism and Israel which we are asked to avoid .
Jewish leftists insist that we must avoid any discussion having to do with the Jewish national project , Jewish identity and even Jewish history .
In short , with the vast support of the offence principle , Jewish ethnic leaders both on the left and right have succeeded in demolishing the possibility of any criticism of Jewish identity and politics .
Employing the offence principle , Jewish lobbies right , left and centre , have managed to practically silence any possible criticism of Israel and its crimes against the Palestinians .
More worryingly , Jewish leftist political activists and intellectuals outrageously demand to avoid any criticism of the Jewish Lobby in the USA and in Britain .
As we can see , the ‘ offence Principle ’ regulates and even serves some notorious Zionist as well as Jewish leftist political lobbies at the heart of the so - called liberal democratic West .
In practice we are terrorized into submission by a group of gatekeepers who limit our freedom via an elastic dynamic operator that is there to suppress our thoughts before they mature into an ethical insight .
Manipulation set by political correctness is the nourishing ground of our shattering cognitive dissonance .
This is exactly where freedom of expression does n’t agree with freedom of the thought .
Auschwitz Versus Gaza in the Light of Political Correctness
We tend to agree that marginal discourses should be protected by the offence principle , so the marginal subject maintains his unique voice .
We obviously agree also that such an approach must be applicable to the manifold of Jewish marginal discourses ( religious , nationalist , Trotskyite , etc. ) .
Seemingly , Jewish political lobbies want far more than just that , they insist upon delegitmising any intellectual reference to current Jewish political lobbying and global Zionism .
As if this is not enough , any reference to modern Jewish history is prohibited unless kosherly approved by a ‘ Zionist ’ authority .
As bizarre as it may be , the Jewish Holocaust has now been intellectually set as a meta- historical event .
It is an event in the past that wo n’t allow any historical , ideological , theological or sociological scrutiny .
Bearing in mind the offence principle , Jews are entitled to argue that any form of speculation regarding their past suffering is “ offensive and hurtful ” .
Yet , one may demand some explanations .
How is it that historical research that may lead to some different visions of past events that occurred six and a half decades ago offends those who live amongst us today ?
Clearly , it is not an easy task to suggest a rational answer to such a query .
Plainly , historical research should n’t cause harm or an offence to the contemporary Jew or any other human subject around .
Unless of course , the Holocaust itself is utilized against the Palestinians or those who are accused as being the ‘ enemies of Israel ’ .
As we learn from Matan Vilnai recently , the Jewish State would n’t refrain from bringing a Shoah on the Palestinian people .
The Israelis and their supporters do not stop themselves from putting the holocaust into rhetorical usage .
Yet , the Jewish lobbies around the world would do their very best to stop the rest of us from grasping what Shoah may mean .
They would use their ultimate powers to stop us from utilizing the holocaust as a critical tool of Israeli barbarism .
As one may predict by now , in order to censor historical research into Jewish history and a further understanding of current Israeli evil , political correctness is called into play .
Political correctness is there to stop us from seeing and expressing the obvious .
Political correctness is there to stop us realising that truth and historical truth in particular is an elastic notion .
Yet , you may wonder what exactly political correctness is .
Political correctness , for those who failed to understand it , is basically a political stand that does n’t allow political criticism .
Political correctness is a stand that cannot be fully justified in rational , philosophical or political terms .
It is implanted as a set of axioms at the heart of the liberal discourse .
It operates as a self - imposed silencing regulator powered by self - inflicted guilt .
Political correctness is in fact the crudest assault on freedom of speech , freedom of thought and human liberty , yet , manipulatively , it conveys itself as the ultimate embodiment of freedom .
Hence , I would argue as forcefully as I can that political correctness is the bitterest enemy of human liberty and those who regulate those social axioms and plant them in our discourse are the gravest enemies of humanity .
I would argue as forcefully as I can that since the Palestinians are facing Nazi - like State terrorism , the holocaust narrative and its meaning belongs to them at least as much as it belongs to the Jews or anyone else .
I would argue as forcefully as I can that if the Palestinians are indeed the last victims of Hitler , then the holocaust and its meaning do belong to them more than anyone else .
Bearing all that in mind , equating Gaza with Auschwitz is the right and only way forwards .
Questioning the holocaust and its meaning is what liberation of humanity means today and in the near future .
We ’re absolutely delighted to announce this morning that the traditional drunken spirit of Xmas is most certainly not dead down at 41 - 44 Great Windmill Street , London W1 , as the following email proves :

Subject : Extra Curricular Activities
Good Morning Everyone ,
This morning the Office Manager from Sthree ( company that occupies the 2nd floor ) informed me that last night two people were caught enjoying ‘ relations ’ on one of their desks .
The member of staff from Sthree was working late and heard something going on around the corner , after deciding to investigate he discovered the couple having sex and to his astonishment they noticed that he had noticed , but decided to continue anyway .
Once ‘ finished ’ the lady in high boots asked the member of staff if there was a toilet she could borrow .
Classy !
Ok , this does raise a few questions .
If a horny couple decided to enter the office from the street they would have had to get past the main street doors without a fob and into Sthree ’s offices without a fob , which is a bit tricky .
Sthree ’s main reception door in situated in the main atrium and is always open .
Therefore , there is a good chance that they were already in the building .
The member of staff describes them as dressed casually , pretty much like we are dressed most days .
Also they appeared to be under the influence of alcohol…oh , that ’s right we have a free bar on the 5th floor .
So , the message here is quite clear , please make sure you know who is coming in the door behind you , make sure you can trust your friends when they visit the bar and make sure all office staff have gone home !
Thanks
Mark
P.S. If anyone does know who the copulating couple were , you can drop me a little email to save me the task of trailing through a whole evenings worth of CCTV !
Thanks

E urope is fairly well equipped with tax havens .
Swiss bank secrecy is not what it used to be , due mostly to the rashness of Swiss bankers establishing substantial operations in the US which laid them open to arm - twisting by the Internal Revenue Service and banking regulators .
The Channel Islands gave up part of their banking secrecy under pressure from the British government .
But this still leaves tax havens in Austria , Belgium , Luxemburg , Liechtenstein and Monaco ( for non-French residents ) .
Among them , Liechtenstein is perhaps the most exclusive and has long been regarded as the safest .
Early in 2006 , contact was made in the most elaborate spy novel manner between the BND , Germany intelligence service , and a dismissed employee of LGT , Liechtenstein ’s top bank that is fully owned by the princely family , chaired by the reigning prince ’s brother and managed by his second son .
After what seem to have been difficult and very involved transactions , the BND paid 4.2 million euros to the employee for a list of about 1,400 clients of LGT holding accounts worth a total of between 4 and 5 billion euros .
Some 600 of the clients were Germans , the rest French , British , Italian , Spanish and Swedish .
The German authorities passed their names on to the respective countries ’ tax services , and started audits into the affairs of the German residents , going public with the whole matter in February 2008 .
Prosecution was started against the first 200 or so suspects , many confessed and threw themselves on the fisc ’s mercy in exchange for restitution of the funds that had escaped German tax .
Some names were disclosed , the political repercussions were deafening , the Left marched triumphantly up the moral high ground , the Right was deeply embarrassed , and the German government threatened Liechtenstein with the most severe though unspecified retaliation for its complicity with immoral German tax fraudsters .
There was also a loud chorus of demands from many governments and the media for redoubled efforts to do away with tax havens by forcing the guilty countries to lift bank secrecy and provide data on foreign holders of accounts .
The OECD and the European Union had for many years exerted maximum pressure to this effect and it is not clear what more they could do short of bombarding Luxemburg , Vaduz and Vienna .
But agitation is bound to continue .
This is how matters stand or rather this is how they swirl , at present .
It may be noted in passing that when bullied to show more “ transparency ” , banks in tax havens say that it is not part of their duty to assist the work of foreign tax collectors .
The OECD replies that “ transparency ” is required for fighting money laundering , a criminal offence .
The banks retort that they only accept new customers after exhaustive cross-examination ( which is certainly the case of the reputable banks ) and that they are ready to provide information on clients ’ affairs if there is presumption of criminal activity .
It is also the case that as pressure on European tax havens is kept up , fugitive accounts tend to move to banks in the Caribbean , certain Pacific islands and ( for really borderline customers ) to the Ukraine and Russia .
Nevertheless , as long as they exist , tax havens undoubtedly facilitate tax evasion , and this is where questions of morals arise .
Some are simple , others are not .
Different societies pass different moral judgments on tax evasion .
In Britain , it is still “ not done , ” at least not by the “ right sort ” of people .
On most of the Continent , it is widely done and freely admitted among close friends and relatives .
In some circles , it counts as an exploit and in others an act of resistance against Leviathan .
The main deterrent is , of course , the risk of being caught , although public education and the media try to inculcate the idea that paying one ’s taxes is a moral duty that springs from solidarity with others , and not paying them is free riding on those who do .
Whether this is all that needs be said depends both on the uses the tax is put to , and the demand for tax made upon the individual taxpayer .
The tax may be financing the reasonable provision of public goods and services that are arguably to the benefit of all , even if the benefit to each cannot be interpersonally compared .
However , it may well happen that far too much public expenditure is skewed in favour of hare - brained schemes the individual taxpayer considers absurd ( the Common Agricultural Policy or Galileo might rank high on the list of monstrosities he is furious to have to finance ) .
It also may be that taxation is too blatantly redistributive , benefiting only one group or class while financed almost wholly by another .
Finally , it may be that the “ ability to pay ” or the “ we must take the money where we find it ” principles of taxation are pushed too far for even the docile taxpayer to take them lying down .
We can only have subjective opinions on when , taxation is just ( or whether it ever is ) and when it is abusive .
Most people are ready to tell the well - to - do that he must play by the democratic rules and submit to the tax laws of his country .
It is in their manifest interest to say so .
But it is not shocking that the well - to - do is left unimpressed by the argument that it is a moral duty for the minority to pay for the good ideas of the majority .
If tax evasion were unfeasible or impossibly risky , the majority could go further to exploit the minority .
In that sense , facilities for tax evasion are safety valves against taxation becoming more abusive than it is at present .
Tax havens are one such facility .
This is not to say that their operations are just .
But they do fulfil a useful function in tempering the democratic juggernaut .
It has always been a function of the state to protect the property of its subjects against all comers except against itself .
Confiscation was a prerogative of the early state , though it usually had to practice it selectively .
Among modern states , dictatorships felt free to carry on the practice , restrained only by what they deemed inopportune .
Democratic states have forsworn confiscation ; they expropriate or , more prettily still , “ nationalise ” and provide “ due ” and “ fair ” compensation for the owners .
Arguably , it is an oxymoron to call a price “ fair ” if it is paid in a forced exchange .
Legislation , including what passes for “ international law ” regulating how sovereign states must compensate expropriated owners , including foreign ones , is largely shaped by the expropriators themselves .
Its caricature image would be a conference of thieves adopting rules regulating how fair thieving is to be conducted .
Musing about this leads again to tax havens .
Tax havens are not just instruments that facilitate tax evasion .
They are also safe havens , or believed to be such .
Anyone who knows what happened to all noble and bourgeois property except personal chattels in Russia in 1917 - 19 and to peasant property a decade or so later , to all Jewish property in Nazi Germany after 1934 and in the Nazi satellites before and during World War II , to nearly all property in the Soviet satellite states after 1947 or to most large industrial and financial firms in Labour Britain after 1945 and in two waves under Presidents de Gaulle and Mitterrand in France , might go to some lengths to shift at least his mobile assets to some Liechtenstein or other .
States , taken as a class , are morally in no position to accuse the Liechtensteins of this world of immorality and of not playing the game .
They have asked for it , they are not trustworthy and have only themselves to blame .
There have been too many black sheep among them , and new ones may well be born any day .
MS causes problems with balance and bouts of localised paralysis
Comparison of 2,538 proteins from MS patients with those from healthy brains showed damage in two proteins not before linked to the disease .
In mice blocking the effects of the proteins led to reversal of symptoms , the study in Nature reported .
There are about 85,000 people with MS in the UK .
The condition is caused by a defect in the body 's immune system , which turns in on itself , attacking the fatty myelin sheath which coats the nerves , leading to symptoms including blurred vision , loss of balance and , in some cases , paralysis .
This points the way to a new area of MS research of considerable interest , and which could well lead in the future to new lines of treatment
Professor Neil Scolding , University of Bristol
Study leader Professor Lawrence Steinman said this was the first large - scale study to search for defective proteins in MS lesions in the brain .
They found a few proteins peculiar to MS brain lesions .
But two in particular - tissue factor and protein C inhibitor - showed signs of damage during the chronic active stage of the disease .
These normally participate in the control of blood clotting and in anti-inflammatory pathways .
The researchers guessed that the damaged proteins might be helping the progression of MS and , by using inhibitors of the proteins found they could successfully ameliorate the disease in mice .
Treatment
Professor Steinman , from Stanford University School of Medicine in California , said the finding opened up the way for new treatments .
However , using existing drugs which interfere with the control of blood clotting would be dangerous because of an increased risk of bleeding .
Professor Neil Scolding , from the University of Bristol Institute of Clinical Neurosciences , said : " From the scientific perspective , the exciting thing is that it 's pretty much the first time that proteomics has directly yielded a candidate molecule that is both unexpected and novel on the one hand and has therapeutic potential .
" From the clinical perspective , showing that treatment approaches predicted by this proteomic interrogation of MS tissue do have a clear impact in experimental models of MS is extremely promising .
" This points the way to a new area of MS research of considerable interest , and which could well lead in the future to new lines of treatment . "
Dr Laura Bell , Research Communications
Officer at the MS Society , said she looked forward to seeing how the research progressed .
" This is early research but provides an interesting insight into some of the potential players that cause different types of damage to the central nervous system in people with MS .
" Understanding how MS develops is vital to target therapies for the condition . "

Olbermann : Bush ' panoramic invasion of privacy ' is terrorism David Edwards and John Byrne

In a scathing commentary against President George W. Bush , MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann declared Bush guilty of terrorism for playing what he sees as the fear card in an attempt to get the House to pass retroactive immunity for telecommunication companies that illegally helped the US government in its warrantless wiretapping program Thursday evening .
" You are a liar , Mr. Bush , and after showing some skill at it , you have ceased to even be a very good liar , " he declared .
" The lot of you , " he said , speaking of those who sought to pass immunity , " are the symbolic descendants of the despotic middle managers of some banana republic , to whom ' Freedom ' is an ironic brand name , a word you reach for , when you want to get away with its opposite . "
Mocking the president , he said that Bush is predicting " plagues of locusts and stuff " should the House fail to reauthorize his warrantless eavesdropping program .
The Senate passed immunity for the telecommunications ' companies participation in the program earlier this week by 68 - 29 -- they are facing myriad lawsuits -- though the House appears less likely to support the provision and has stalled on reauthorizing the bill .
The bill had been reauthorized under a temporary basis .
Olbermann called Bush a " liar " several times during his broadcast .
He also called Bush a ' fascist . '
" If you believe in the seamless mutuality of government and big business  come out and say it ! " he said .
" There is a dictionary definition , one word that describes that toxic blend .
You re a fascist  get them to print you a t- shirt with fascist on it !
What else is this but fascism ? "
" It is bad enough , sir , that you were demanding an Ex Post Facto law , which could still clear the AT&Ts and the Verizons from responsibility for their systematic , aggressive , and blatant collaboration with your illegal and unjustified spying on Americans under this flimsy guise of looking for any terrorists who are stupid enough to make a collect call or send a mass e-mail , " he added .
Speaking of AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , who alleged secret call centers where the firm funneled data to the National Security Agency , he noted Klein 's declaration of Bush as " Big Brother . "
" And if theres one thing we know about Big Brother , Mr. Bush , is that he is  you are  a liar , " Olbermann averred .
Later , he added , " You are a liar , Mr. Bush , and after showing some skill at it , you have ceased to even be a very good liar . "
Olbermann noted that President Bush has promised to veto any bill that did not include telecom immunity .
He asserted that Bush was siding with " terrorists " if he vetoed his own bill .
" You would not merely be guilty of siding with the terrorists , " he said .
" You would not merely be guilty of prioritizing the telecoms over the people
You would not merely be guilty of treason , sir
You would be personally , and eternally , responsible . "
He concluded by accusing Bush of being a terrorist himself , in his alleged fealty to violating civil liberties under the guise of protecting Americans from terrorist attacks .
" We will not fear the recognition of the manipulation of our yearning for safety  we will call it what it is : terrorism , " the MSNBC host said .
This video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast February 14 , 2008 .
Quotes compiled from a transcript by Crooks and Liars .
After being blown off by the Norwegian police , MPAA lawyer Espen Tondel is now demanding that ISPs disconnect Norwegian file - sharers from the Internet .
According to IKT Norway , an interest group for ISPs , the lawyer has sent a letter to Norwegian ISPs on behalf of The Norwegian branch of the MPAA .
In the letter , Tondel asks the ISPs to notify customers who share copyrighted content , and threaten to disconnect them from the internet .
Tondel also attached a document that supposedly links the IP - addresses of seeders to copyrighted works .
It seems that Norway is not alone in this , Jim Williams , the MPAA ’s senior vice president opted for a similar disconnection policy in the US yesterday .
IKT Norway is not too happy about the letter though .
“ In a constitutional state , the police and the prosecuting authority have the job of investigating and indicting , not lawyers and communication engineers ” , says Hallstein Bjercke from IKT Norway , in a press release .
“ Most of the big ISPs in Norway are members of IKT Norway and we will support the various ISPs as best we can against what we see as a preposterous demand from Simonsen ” , Bjercke adds .
He asks the ISPs to contact IKT Norway instead of answering the law firm ’s letter .
“ In our opinion , Tondel asks the ISPs to assist them in their private investigation on filesharers .
Tondel ’s law firm asks the ISPs to use personal information about their customers in a way that would be a breach on the Norwegian laws on personal information and personal privacy , in addition to breaching the contract between individual customers and their respective ISP . ”
“ What Simonsen is actually asking for is confessions from the alleged filesharers , which can be used against them if Simonsen decides to sue ” , Bjercke said .
IKT Norway makes it clear that the Norwegian ISPs will not take the role of investigator and judge against their own customers .
“ To give that kind of responsibility to the ISPs is like asking the mailman to control the contents of every letter and package he delivers , ” Bjercke says .
IKT Norway is now checking into the legality of the law firms private investigation and the legality of connecting personal information to the customers of Norwegian ISPs .

Tuesday , December 29 , 1998 Aleister Crowley
The Greatest Magician of the 20th Century ?
by Wes Penre , Dec 29 , 1998 Last Updated : Sunday , November 06 , 2011 11:58:19 AM
Aleister Crowley is probably the Black Magician whom is the most popular foreground figure in Hollywood and the Music Industry today .
He is " accused of " being the one who invented backward messages on music recordings ( used by The Beatles , Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones to name a few ) , although it has not been proven that it was Crowley who originated this and his organization , the OTO , denies this .
Backmasking , some people claim , was originated by Anton LaVey , founder of the Church of Satan .
However , a great percentage of the rock / rap / hip hop musicians of the 50’s , 60’s , 70’s , 80’s and 90’s are highly influenced by this occult , black magician named Aleister Crowley .
You will learn more about this as we go along .
So now , let me introduce the most popular black magician ( together with L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of the Church of Scientology ) of today .
Crowley has had a significant influence on the young peoples ' minds from the 50’s up to this date , particularly through pop and rock music ...
Wes Penre , 1998
A PRESENTATION
Wes Penre leister Crowley is the occultist and Satanist that is perhaps the most well known .
His works “ The Book of the Law ” , “ Magick in Theory and Practice ” and “ The Book of Thoth ” are broadly used in occult circuits .
His perhaps most important book is " The Book of the Law , which Crowley himself did n’t take much credit for have written , as he stated it was written by automatic handwriting , being channeled from a higher being called Aiwaz ( or Aiwass ) .
This being said he had lived in Caldea during the reign of Hammurabis ( around 1750 BC ) , but later , in his book “ Magick in Theory and Practice ” , Crowley identified Aiwaz as his own genius .
He was actually very proud of this book , which he used as a Bible for his own religion – Thelema .
Crowley looked at man as a sleeping god who gradually started to understand what powers he possesses .
He also taught that Satan was identical with the Sumerian devil / god Shaitan , who he stated had been worshiped in the Egyptian deserts long before the ages of the Pharaohs .
He was also a drug - and sex addict and was addicted both to opium , hashish , cocaine , mescaline , amphetamines and heroin , in order to perceive higher states of beingness ( drug abuse is very common to occultists in general ) .
When he discovered mescaline , he developed seven rituals , Rites of Eleusis , and rented Caxton Hall to demonstrate them .
Later , he opened up a Temple of Satan in London , where many high society ladies became his pupils .
By that time Crowley had shaved his head and filed his canine teeth so sharp that he could initiate every new woman with a “ kiss of the snake ” , as he gave them a bite either on the wrist or in the throat .
“ Do what thou will shall be the whole of the Law ” [ The work of the OTO ... is geared towards the achievement of a world - spanning empire ...
The Law “ Do what thou wilt ” is the law of this new state – a One World Government ] was his motto for the OTO , which was the secret order he himself was the Grandmaster of .
He rejected traditional morality in favor of the life of a drug addict and brutal womanizer ( “ I rave ; and I rape and I rip and I rend ” is a line from one of his poems ) .
He even enjoyed being called the “ wickedest man in the world ” .
He was married twice , and both his wives went insane .
Five of his mistresses committed suicide .
Although the above is true , Crowley found great amusement in trying to shock his environment , the sleeping population , and when the newspapers named him “ The Wickedest Man in the World ” , he was very pleased .
Due to his nature of wanting to shock people , he also sometimes exaggerated to create an effect .
People who met Crowley verified that he had occult powers , and as an example William Seabrook tells the following story : Seabrook wanted a demonstration of Crowley ’s powers , so the latter chose a man at random out on the street and followed him , imitating his walk .
Suddenly Crowley fell , but was rapidly on his feet again .
At the same time the other man fell on the sidewalk .
Crowley and his companion helped the man up , and he looked confused , trying to find the banana peel .
Crowley is often credited as the man who came up with the idea of putting backwards messages into musical recordings .
On Beatles , the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin albums these messages can be heard ( all those three rock bands are / were Crowley disciples ) .
There are , for example , infamous backward satanic messages on the mega hit “ Stairway to Heaven ” ( “ Here ’s to my sweet Satan ” is one of many messages that appear ) .
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant , the two front figures in the band deny this , but the messages clearly appear when the song is played backwards .
Page also bought Crowley ’s mansion in Scotland and he does n't make a secret of that he is a long time disciple of Crowley's , as was the late drummer John Bonham from the same group .
Beatles also had backwards messages like “ Paul is dead ” on their albums and Crowley ’s head is present on the cover of “ Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band ” .
When asked why all those people were portrayed on cover of the album , the Beatles replied and said those were people they admired .
Aleister Crowley was born in Warwickshire where he revolted against a strict religious childhood .
He left his studies and became initiated into the secret order of the Golden Dawn in 1898 .
After some time he came into conflict with its leaders and went to Mexico .
From there he traveled a lot , to India and Ceylon , where he studied yoga and Buddhism .
Buddhism replaced his occult interests for a while , until he got a strange experience in Cairo , Egypt in 1904 .
By curiosity his wife Rose asked him to do an occult ritual .
She then went into a state of trance and brought down a message from some strange being .
“ He ’s waiting for you ” , she told Crowley .
“ Him ” , she said , was Horus , the God of wars and the son of Osiris in the old Egyptian mythology .
At first , Crowley did n’t believe her , so he started asking her a few questions to reveal her as a fraud .
But Rose , who did n’t know very much about the occult , gave the correct answers .
The message that was sent to Crowley , told him to sit down by his desk a certain time three days in a row .
He obeyed and in these three days he wrote “ The Book of Law ” with automatic writing .
This means his hand was moving by another force than his own .
Crowley ’s messenger taught that the old Age of Osiris soon would follow by the new Age of Horus .
But first Earth must bathe in blood .
There should be a World War .
The Book of Law told about a race of Superhuman and condemned the old religions , the pacifism , democracy , compassion and humanity .
“ Let my servants be few and secret , they shall reign over the many and the known ” , the Superhuman continued .
The rest of the message goes in the same spirit .
The lower races should be humiliated and condemned and even killed .
It taught “ no mercy ” .
[ Long before the Roswell incident , where a flying saucer crashed in the desert and dead aliens were found , Crowley made a drawing of one of his “ messengers ” called Lam – the drawing is almost identical with the Grey Aliens , who nowadays are so broadly mentioned and used in movies and among abducted ] .
The messenger also declared that Crowley was the Beast 666 from the “ Book of Revelations ” ( 13:18 ) , who had come to destroy Christianity .
He tried to forget the whole thing , but from 1909 and forwards , he started taking the messages seriously .
Crowley then left his former occult teacher MacGregor Mathers , who by that time was a broken man .
Mathers started a psychic war against Crowley .
They called up demons with whom they attacked each other , and Mathers lost .
Such demonic warfare is very common today among the Brotherhood .
Long after his death , Crowley became a hero for many young people within the flower - power movement .
The irony in all this is that these young people cried for peace and love .
Crowley in his turn welcomed the First World War , as necessary to sweep away the old age and start the new one .
Since he revealed his revelations , he became the head of the OTO ( Ordo Templi Orientis ) in Germany , which gave him a great influence over similar people in Germany .
It ’s also well known that Hitler was influenced by him and that Crowley himself tried to contact Hitler during the 2nd World War .
CROWLEY AND FREEMASONRY
In his book “ Confessions ... ” , Crowley claimed that he had been initiated as a 33rd Degree Mason in the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Masonry ( A&AR ) .
He probably did this in Mexico , where he went after breaking up with the Golden Dawn .
At this time ( around 1900 ) there was a lot of Masonic activity in South America .
However , there is some confusion regarding this , as you have to be a Master Mason to be initiated on the Higher Grades , and by this time Crowley had n’t gone through the grades required , so either he made it up or was granted the 33 degree without prerequisites necessary .
In his own words he received the initiation after he had helped an individual with another mystical order called LIL .
No one seems to know for sure what the real truth of the matter is .
It looks though , as if he at one point or another was initiated , as a copy of his recognition still exists .

Though it is beyond doubt that Crowley had connections with Freemasonry , he did n’t seem to have a high opinion of their teachings .
He used some of their techniques in his own OTO later , but most of his own grades in that order was and is quite different from Freemasonry .
The following is taken from his book Confessions , page 700 et seq .
regarding his motives of using Freemasonic knowledge within his own order :
“ What is Freemasonry ?
I collated the rituals and their secrets , much as I had done the religions of the world , with their magical and mystical bases .
As in that case , I decided to neglect what it too often actually was .
... I proposed to define freemasonry as a system of communicating truth – religious , philosophical , magical and mystical ; and indicating the proper means of developing human faculty by means of a peculiar language whose alphabet is the symbolism of ritual .
Universal brotherhood and the great moral principles , independent of personal , racial , climatic and other prejudices , naturally formed a background which would assure individual security and social stability for each and all .
” The question then arose , ‘ What truths should be communicated and by what means promulgated ? ’
My first object was to eliminate from the hundreds of rituals at my disposal all exoteric elements .
Many degrees contain statements ( usually inaccurate ) of matters well known to modern schoolboys , through they may have been important when the rituals were written .
... I saw no point in overloading the system with superfluous information .
” Another essential point was to reduce the unwieldy mass of material to a compact and coherent system .
I thought that everything worth preserving could and should be presented in not more than a dozen ceremonies , and that it should be brought well within the capacity of any officer to learn by heart his part during the leisure time at his disposal , in a month at most . ”
Crowley , who had the idea that he stood above everybody else on this planet , chose other ways to accomplish his magical goals .
So he took over another secret society , the OTO , and changed its rituals dramatically .
OTO symbol :
Represents the vagina .
The Pyramid with the Eye is the male ( phallos ) , the dove is the semen , and the Grail is the female .
THE OTO
In the beginning of the 20th century , a manufacturer from Vienna , Dr. Karl Kellner , and a German theosophist , Dr. Franz Hertmann , founded a secret occult lodge which they named “ Ordo Templi Orientis ” ( O.T.O. ) .
Soon after , Theodore Reuss ( 1855 - 1923 ) who had connections with many lodges joined the Order .
It was he who led Rudolf Steiner , the founder of anthroposophy , into such a group .
Reuss , whose lodge - name was “ Brother Merlin ” , contacted Aleister Crowley in 1912 and he became a member of this additional lodge receiving the name “ Brother Baphomet ” .
Baphomet , the symbol of the satanic goat , usually portrayed as a half - human , half - goat figure , with a goat ’s head .
It is often misinterpreted as a symbol of witchcraft in general .
The origin of the name Baphomet is unclear .
It may be a corruption of Mahomet ( Mohammed ) .
The English witchcraft historian Montague Summers suggested it was a combination of two Greek words , baphe and metis , meaning “ absorption of knowledge . ”
Baphomet has also been called the Goat of Mendes , the Black Goat and the Judas Goat . )
The O.T.O. developed its sexual rites quickly under Reuss and later broadened them under Crowley .
Not long after , Crowley took over the leadership of the lodge .
Like other secret lodges , members may not disclose their knowledge .
( Baphomet ) CROWLEY , HITLER AND WORLD WAR II Aleister ( Alexander was his birth name ) Crowley , the self - proclaimed Magus of the Aeon , was destined from his inception to be an exception .
His father , a preacher , hounded him relentlessly to “ Get right with God ” ; his mother , equally obsessed with biblical lore , referred to him repeatedly as a “ beast , ” and beyond doubt all this left its mark on young Alexander , the great beast to be .
For years later , he did indeed assume the title — or station — of “ To Mega Therion , ” The Great Beast , signing all his correspondences in later life not with a name but a number — 666 , all in his continued quest for supreme significance in the eyes of a hostile , if not plain indifferent , world .
Infamy , Crowley reasoned , was every bit as valid as fame , and that much easier to claim ; in this , as in countless other ways , he was far ahead of his time , one of the first con-artists to realize that “ all publicity is good publicity . ”
Both amount to influence , which amounts to power .
From the very first of his reinventions ( the name change ) his purpose was plain : whatever games Crowley played with the perceptions of the world , he was undoubtedly a master , though after a fashion wholly his own .
Never a dabbler , he applied himself to a number of diverse disciplines and excelled in them all : chess , literature , languages ( ancient and modern ) , philosophy , poetry , espionage , mountain climbing , wild - game hunting , yoga , drug - taking , sex magick , and so forth .
His claims to fame , indeed , are as many and myriad as his names —
Hitler ’s guru , self - made Messiah , Babe of the Abyss , and let us not forget , Prophet of the New Age !
His greatest claim of all was what he himself termed , “ crossing the abyss , ” being what is known nowadays ego - death , or being “ born again . ”
It was by this accomplishment , highly esteemed in all magickal circles , that Crowley assumed , or pretended , his role as “ Magus of the Aeon . ”
Crowley was notoriously perverse in both his personal and professional life .
But , though he was to all intents and purposes a sort of inspired lunatic , he did practice all he preached , a rare enough commodity these days to command respect .
The central event in his life was undoubtedly the writing of “ The Book of the Law ” , an event that was to give him the most grief but also the most gratification in his long and fruitful career .
Apart from anything else , it fulfilled his fantasies , from the most exalted to the basest and most abominable .
The Book of the Law , or Liber Al vel Legis ( Liber Al for short ) is a text considered by many to contain the profoundest secrets of magick , as well as the keys to the inauguration of the long - promised ( and long - delayed ) New Aeon .
For what it ’s worth , it is a book that claims to have been written ( passive voice ) , rather than one which Crowley ( or anybody ) actually wrote .
Nowadays , we ’d call it a “ channeled work , ” but in this case one channeled with such a degree of precision as to entirely separate it from the vast mass of “ automatic writings ” so popular today , and which amount to little more than the wishful free - associations or mystical ramblings of the supposed “ channelers . ”
In distinction , Crowley claimed that , on the 8th of April 1904 — in Cairo at 12 noon exactly and for the following two days at the exact same time — he actually heard a voice in his ear , dictating the words of the text ( as if through some transmitter in his brain ) , and that he transcribed them faithfully .
It was not “ inspired , ” then , so much as received .
The voice itself claimed to be that of Aiwass , or Aiwaz , “ the minister of Hoor - paar - kraat , ” or otherwise , Horus — the god of force and fire , child of Isis and Osiris , and self - appointed conquering lord of the New Aeon , officially announced through his chosen scribe , “ the prince - priest the Beast . ”
This much of Crowley ’s controversial life and claims is more or less confirmed .
It is , as promised , to be found there in the writings themselves .
Anyone who has read the work , and suffered the resulting conflictive feelings of admiration and disgust , will not doubt that there is something about the “ little red book ” that puts it in a class on its own .
It might be argued that it is simply the work of a poetic genius , were it not for the fact that Crowley was to prove again and again in subsequent works that , for all his magickal prowess and philosophical brilliance , he was anything but a poetic genius .
It seems rather as though the book partakes not of the qualities of Crowley , but that , conversely , Crowley himself grew over time to partake of the qualities of the book .
And this he did , by his own admission , with boundless reluctance and distaste .
The work itself , not for its artistic merit so much as its sheer intensity and relevance to our times , is perhaps the most substantial evidence for the much - insisted upon ( by Crowley ) greatness of its puppet - author .
Yet Crowley also claimed to revile and disdain the work ( particularly the third chapter ) for many years , above all for its barbaric and warlike diatribes , and its ruthless rejection of all philosophies and creeds previous to it , its utter savage as it let fly its war cry and word of the Aeon ( be it anarchy or be it harmony ) : Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law !
These characteristics of ruthlessness , arrogance and blasphemy were of course , rightly or wrongly , traits for which Crowley himself would become most commonly and widely known in the public mind , while there is a fair case , in conventional history alone ( Crowley ’s claims aside ) , to be made for the fact that — besides the “ secret four - fold word , the blasphemy against all gods and men ... Do What Thou Wilt ” — Adolf Hitler whole - heartedly adopted many of the central tenets of Liber Al .
Whether or not he actually embraced “ the Law of Thelema , ” as such , there can be no doubt at all that Hitler was aware of the Book , and probably derived a certain demonic inspiration from it .
The third part of the Book , pertaining to Horus , begins :
Now let it first be understood that I am a god of war and vengeance .
I shall deal hardly with them ...
I will give you a war - engine .
With it ye shall smite the peoples ; and none shall stand before you .
Lurk !
Withdraw !
Upon them !
This is the Law of the Battle of Conquest : thus shall my worship be about my secret house . ”
( I:3,7- 9 ) [ It continues : ]
“ Mercy let be off : damn them who pity !
Kill and torture ; spare not ; be upon them ... ( 18 ) Argue not ; convert not ; talk not overmuch !
Them that seek to entrap thee , to overthrow thee , them attack without pity or quarter ; and destroy them utterly .
Swift as the trodden serpent turn and strike !
Be thou deadlier than he !
Drag down their souls to awful torment : laugh at their fear : spit upon them !
Certainly such sentiments , if taking at face value , would have appealed to the young monomaniacal Austrian bent upon leaving history in ruins .
As he had done with Nietzsche , however , Hitler was wont to twist and distort the text to his own ends , and to pervert the whole by taking what were perhaps ( one hopes ) as much metaphorical expressions as literal commands .
Nevertheless , between Nietzsche and Hitler , it seems , came Crowley .
Crowley himself made no bones about it : “ Before Hitler was , I am , ” he boasted , in imitation of Christ , who said the same about Abraham .
( It might be fair to reply , however : “ Before Crowley is — Aiwaz ! ” )
Crowley ’s involvement in espionage on both sides of the first and second world wars ( he worked for both US and British intelligence writing deliberately “ absurd , ” i.e. , counter - productive , German propaganda during the first ) is well known and presumably well - documented .
Nevertheless it is extremely difficult to find any author anywhere who will admit to Crowley ’s involvement with Hitler , despite the fact that Crowley himself confessed , or more accurately bragged , about it to his associates .
Yet , Hitler ’s interest , nay obsession , with the occult is well - known and there are dozens of books upon the subject , of varying degrees of ludicrousness and sensationalism ( it even served for the plot of the pulp action movie Raiders of the Lost Ark ) .
It is a well - known fact that he set out either to recruit or to persecute all practicing occultists in Germany , and Crowley eventually found himself on the “ shitlist ” too , which by no means refutes the possibility of their working together .
( The apparent vilification of Crowley might have been simple cover , or even genuine but as a result of a “ falling out ” between the two men . )
The fact remains that at the deepest , most occult level , and behind the political facades and the theatre of war performed for the public , the most powerful factions — occult and economic — of both Germany and Britain were not enemies but allies , bound together in the one great war for the conquest of men ’s souls and minds .
This in itself makes it highly probable that Hitler and Crowley would have met , and that some relationship existed between the two men of such different characters , but sharing so similar an obsession .
Perhaps even it was a relationship similar to that shared by Rasputin and the Tsar and Tsaress of Russia at roughly the same time — the one priest , the other king , and each equally benefiting from the favors of the other ?
We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit : let them die in their misery .
For they feel not .
Compassion is the vice of kings : stamp down the wretched and the weak : this is the law of the strong : this is our law , and the joy of the world .
— Book of the Law , II :21 In order to qualify such off - the - wall remarks , we need to take a brief excursion into the philosophy of war :
All warfare must be understood , first and foremost , as internal warfare — hidden , domestic and “ cold , ” of which the external , overt and heated warfare between nations is no more than an outburst , a brief orgasm , if you will , after years of foreplay .
Wars are never won or lost , they are merely negotiated , and World War II might best be seen as the greatest business deal ever accomplished .
As a battle between “ good and evil , ” or justice against crime , it was but one more in a long series of hollow dramas , engineered expressly for the hoodwinking of the masses .
It seems likely , however , that Hitler , in his bid for world - domination ( or destruction ? ) , lost his head and alienated the very “ powers ” that put him in place to begin with : he became an unmanageable element , if not an actual embarrassment , and so had to be removed .
It ’s possible even that he was as guilty of “ betraying ” Chamberlain and later Churchill , as much as he was Stalin — by setting his sights on the whole of Europe , and so banishing all possibility of an unholy alliance between the two powers .
Ideologically they were perfectly compatible , however , and the same might be said of the US , which also only entered the fray when it became completely unavoidable .
Hence , victory was denied Hitler , by his own excess of zeal and lust for power .
At the same time , however , and all appearances aside , his “ defeat ” was anything but total .
In truth , Nazism was as much a global phenomenon as was Christianity 2000 years before ( though it required considerably less time and effort to take hold ) , and there was little likelihood that a minor setback such as the collapse of the Third Reich in 1945 would quench the raging ideological pseudo - religious thirst and fervour of such a movement .
The explosion of rage might be checked and contained — and so postponed — but the collective psyche which had spawned it could by no means be so easily satisfied : Because Nazism was no aberration , but rather the NATURAL AND LOGICAL development of a global wave of systemized , ritualized and economized warfare .
It was the realization of an age - old political dream — the perfected face of tyranny .
Hence , while to all the world it appeared as if Nazism suffered a mortal defeat at the end of the war , in reality , it merely underwent a sophisticated facelift .
Behind the wholesale destruction of Germany and Hiroshima , and the empty facade of the Nuremberg trials , another , occult agenda was being pursued — that of establishing a secret treaty between the Nazis and the Allies — specifically the American Intelligence community — through which Hitler ’s goals and dreams would be subtly resumed , albeit in a mutated form , and continue to manifest over the years in only thinly disguised ways .
Jim Keith writes extensively on the subject in Casebook on Alternative 3 : As can be seen by the activities of US and British business , statecraft , occult groups , and “ aristocracy , ’ the Nazis were no isolated phenomenon , only one expression of a multi- faceted and murderous world wide game ...
Shortly after the collapse of the Third Reich ... General Reinhard Gehlen , Nazi spymaster and Knight of Malta - to - be , began negotiations with Allan Dulles and the American O.S.S.
Using Nazi intelligence networks as a hole card to provide for his own survival and the survival of his huge spy network , Gehlen made a separate peace with Dulles , resulting in the clean grafting of Nazi spy apparatus to the American clandestine services .
This was the birth of the C.I.A , and part of a nexus of betrayal that continues to this day .
Regardless of whether one bothers to research all this however ( and there is an ever - growing amount of literature on the subject ) , the evidence seems to speak for itself .
The CIA alone ( one of the smaller of countless similar US intelligence organizations ) , which built itself around a nexus of ex-Nazis , has been responsible for as much havoc and wholesale slaughter in Central and South America as the Nazis ever accomplished during their brief “ reign of terror ” in Europe .
The Art of War then , like that of business , has been to make itself as smooth and as efficient as possible , as silent , secret and sustained an affair as the explosive , unpredictable nature of the work itself will allow .
The ultimate war - machine , mili-medical - industrial complex ( established in ’ 47 and consolidated in ’ 63 ) , is designed to “ serve ” man in just precisely the manner which McDonalds has been “ serving ” cows for the last few decades .
All the unpleasantness is under the counter .
War itself — as a commodity — must be rendered as appealing as any other “ product , ” not only to be propagated and disseminated to the populace , but to be advertised and glorified , until it is coveted and consumed willingly , hungrily , as if it were manna from heaven itself , and not poisoned rain from polluted sky .
Above all , it must be made to seem an intrinsic — however undesirable and inexplicable — feature of existence : an indispensable element of human nature .
Thus war becomes not a single condition but the primary nature of life , and of mankind , be it ever a state of fear and loathing , empty of growth but full of decay , all of savagery and none of noblesse .
For he who is ignorant until the end is a creature of oblivion , and he will vanish along with it .
— The Gospel of Truth , Nag Hamadi Librar
The war - like nature of many of the passages in Liber Al would seem to be a direct response to this .
It seems to treat of this condition as a disease that must be purged , like a boil brought to a head , in order that it might be squeezed finally out of existence .
To read many of his other writings , however , leaves one in little doubt that Crowley , like Nietzsche before him , was a kind of proto - Nazi ( though he abhorred all forms of fascism , just as Nietzsche despised anti-Semitism ) .
On the other hand , Hitler himself doubtless aspired to both immortality as a world - avatar and invulnerability as the chosen “ Savage Emperor ” of the New Aeon : his Fourth Reich / Millenium of peace , prosperity and perfection is illustrative of this insane mix of the best intentions with the very worst of methods .
There seems little doubt that , for his part , Hitler believed that worldwide destruction was a necessary process , by which to pave the way for a new evolutionary step for mankind .
He did not acknowledge any god or saviour , as such , but was firmly persuaded of the existence of “ the superman ” : “ The new man is living amongst us now .
He is here !
I have seen the new man .
He is intrepid and cruel .
I was afraid of him . ”
Whether or not Hitler was referring to Crowley here — it seems doubtful — or , as seems more likely , to some incorporeal force or preterhuman entity , conjured by his own demented will , it is impossible to say , nor does it much matter .
Hitler ’s preoccupation with the Superman seems to be parallel to Crowley ’s own claims of affiliation ( through Aiwaz ) with the “ Secret Chiefs ” — namely , the preterhuman intelligences previously mentioned which “ rule occultly over the destiny of mankind . ”
Crowley himself also considered contact with these beings the next , inevitable , evolutionary step for mankind as a whole , and it is an indisputable fact that the SS — and Nazism as a whole — was established upon an occult basis , and that its inner structures and purposes were not merely political , but also magickal .
The whole apparatus of ceremonial magick ( as conceived and adapted by the Golden Dawn and its offshoots , many of which were directly influenced by Crowley ) that formed the true inner protocol of Nazism ( originally spawned by the Thule Society ) is dedicated — in theory — to the one single end and purpose of : contact with preterhuman or extraterrestrial forces .
To achieve this end , the aspirant must prepare himself vigorously , mind , body and soul , for the contact , lest he be driven mad ( like Hitler ? ) , diseased , or even destroyed , by the catastrophic nature of the encounter .
And yet Hitler was — to look at least , and all his considerable accomplishments aside — an ordinary , even mediocre person .
It seems as though he knew little or nothing of the forces which possessed him , and was at most a low - grade medium with a deranged sense of self - importance .
If so , then he was perfectly chosen to embody and so fulfill the demonic will of the mass , which he himself so despised .
John Symmonds has Crowley remarking : I never met ... someone as demonic as Herr Hitler .
Why do you think I spend so much time with him ?
And come when he bids me ?
I tell you only the universe can prevail against Hitler .
But the universe for the present does n’t seem to be interested ; though Hitler is the enemy of the universe , that is to say of God ; for the universe is only God ’s instrument .
It is as if God said , “ Let mankind learn a lesson ; they need to open their eyes a little wider .
Hitler will do that for them .
Just wait .
They will see things that men have never seen or heard before — such horrors that there will be no word in the German or any other language to describe them . ’
That is what the demonic is when it appears in a very ordinary person , a man of the people , someone the intellectuals are contemptuous of but not the masses .
With an uncanny instinct , they know who he is . ”
Crowley was one of the most terrible and formidable shit - stirrers in recent history : he wrote for example about the traditional “ black magickal ” practice of child or animal sacrifice ( also referred to in AL ) , and almost certainly performed it occasionally himself , even if only in a symbolic fashion ( shedding of one ’s own blood or the spilling of semen , for example ) .
He enjoyed the thought of his words being misconstrued by the unwitting masses , and of all the mischief and grief that it would cause them .
Hitler , on the other hand — in many ways a common
Thug with an incredibly high intelligence but extremely low imagination — took the whole thing to its literal , appalling extreme , and set about to construct actual factories , complete with cages and showers and ovens and gas chambers , all with this single purpose in mind — of feeding — and thereby appeasing — the powers that would otherwise devour him .
This is nothing new , of course : the Mayans and Aztecs performed similar rites of mass sacrifice ( holocaust ) , and Jehovah of the Old Testament apparently has Moses perform the same basic “ rites ” by sending him and his men into city after city to butcher the populations therein and burn the bodies .
Hitler was simply upholding an ancient tradition , and taking it to new extremes of post - Industrial , technological efficiency .
There seems no reason to doubt that , directly or indirectly , Crowley was responsible — at least partially — for feeding Hitler ’s dark fantasies and lustful ambitions as a “ black messiah ” and “ scion of darkness . ”
Crowley , a true Magician and Trickster , would have taken no sides in any battle , but deliberately and consciously played both sides against one another , in good Machiavellian fashion .
His goals , however ( even when evil ) , would have always been spiritual , never temporal .
In Symmonds ’s work , we have the following exchange : Hitler : “ And are you an angel of darkness ? ” Crowley : “ You ’ll find out in good time all about me .
For the present , I ’ll say this : if I were an angel of light , you would n’t want to know me . ”
This has been a fable from the age of paradoxes — a fairy tale about a “ good war ” that never was , that still rages and has yet to be fully understood — or divulged — by history .
Myth logically speaking , it does n’t seem an excessively arbitrary or irresponsible leap of the imagination then to propose the following : that if Adolf Hitler was — archetypal if not in actual “ fact ” — this century ’s “ Antichrist ” ( and few would dare deny it ) , then Aleister Crowley — the man in the shadows — qualifies ( even as he so carefully fashioned himself to ) as its corresponding “ Beast . ”
For when men assume the temerity and audacity to play the roles of the gods , the mischief they make can indeed shake the foundations of the Earth ; we are still shackled to the power of myth , even if we now prefer to call it history , and still caught under the spell of magick , even if we choose to call it politics .
One shudders , then — or perhaps marvels — to think that this myth - story has yet to be completed ; and that the prophecy , as yet , remains unfulfilled .
( from “ The Medusa ’s Head ” by John Symmonds )
HYMN TO LUCIFER
by Aleister Crowley Ware , nor of good nor ill , what aim hath act ?
Without its climax , death , what savour hath
Life ?
An impeccable machine , exact
He paces an inane and pointless path
To glut brute appetites , his sole content
How tedious were he fit to comprehend
Himself !
More , this our noble element
Of fire in nature , love in spirit , unkenned
Life hath no spring , no axle , and no end .
His body a blood - ruby radiant
With noble passion , sun-souled Lucifer
Swept through the dawn colossal , swift aslant
On Eden ’s imbecile perimeter .
He blessed nonentity with every curse
And spiced with sorrow the dull soul of sense ,
Breath life into the sterile universe ,
With Love and Knowledge drove out innocence
The Key of Joy is disobedience .
A. CROWLEY : 33° MASON WHO KNEW ABOUT HUMAN SACRIFICE
( The following section to THE REAL " ROCKET MAN " IS LOST IN THE SHADOWS OF HISTORY
replicated from http://www.illuminaticonfessions.webfriend.it)
33° Mason , Aleister Crowley would definitely get some votes in the " most wicked man who ever lived contest " and is the clear cut favorite for the title of " The Father of Modern Satanism " .
Crowley 's wicked life and his intimate association with Freemasonry are both well known .
Crowley himself was terribly decadent .
A happily heroin - addicted , bisexual Satan worshiper , he asked people to call him " The Beast 666 . "
Crowley believed that he was literally the antimessiah of the apocalypse .
During the first World War , Crowley transferred his activities to America .
The press proclaimed him " the wickedest man in the world . "
He also spent time in Italy , but was expelled because Italian authorities accused his disciples of sacrificing human infants in occult rituals .
According to one source , Crowley resided in the Abbey of Thelema near Cefalu Sicily , and revived ancient Dionysian ceremonies .
During a 1921 ritual , he induced a he - goat to copulate with his mistress , then slit the animal 's throat at the moment of orgasm .
WAS ALEISTER CROWLEY JUST A 'CLOSET ' FREEMASON ?
Aleister Crowley was very proud of all his accomplishments and connections .
He bragged about all of the Masonic medals and insignia that he was entitled to wear .
This view was confirmed when The Arcane Schools of John Yarker came to me for review .
I wrote to the author , who recognized my title to the 33° and conferred on me the grades of 95° Memphis and 90° Mizraim .
It seemed as if I had somehow turned a tap .
From this time on I lived in a perfect shower of diplomas , from Bucharest to Salt Lake City .
I possess more exalted titles than I have ever been able to count .
I am supposed to know more secret signs , tokens , passwords , grand words , grips , and so on , than I could actually learn in a dozen lives .
An elephant would break down under the insignia I am entitled to wear .
Aleister Crowley in all of his Masonic regalia :
PAST GRAND MASTER ALEISTER CROWLEY
FRATER SUPERIOR BAPHOMET XI°
CROWLEY'S DOCTRINE
We find in the next quotes , the ' doctrine ' of Aleister Crowley from MAGICK in Theory and Practice , by The Master Therion ( Aleister Crowley ) :
" But the bloody sacrifice , though more dangerous , is more efficacious ; and for nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best .
The animal should therefore be killed within the Circle , or the Triangle , as the case may be , so that its energy cannot escape .
An animal should be selected whose nature accords with that of the ceremony -- thus , by sacrifcing a female lamb one would not obtain any appreciate quantity of the fierce energy useful to a Magician who was invoking Mars .
In such acase a ram would be more suitable .
And this ram should be virgin -- the whole potential of its original total energy should not have been diminished in any way .
For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force .
A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim . "
From The Book of the Law , by Aleister Crowley :
" With my Hawk 's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross ......
There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt . "
From SATANIC EXTRACTS , by Aleister Crowley :
The Oath of Fealty
I bind my blood in Satan 's hands ,
All this that lieth betwixt my hands
To thee , the Beast , and thy control ,
I pledge me ; body , mind , and soul .
Pledge
I swear to work my Work abhorred ,
Careless of all but one reward ,
The pleasure of the Devil our Lord
ALEISTER CROWLEY WAS AN INTERNATIONAL MASON
Crowley was truly an international Mason .
He received his 33° in Mexico City and spoke of participating in Masonic rituals in the United States and also was involved in other rites of Freemasonry .
Not only was Crowley a 33° Grand Inspector General of Scottish Rite Freemasonry , but he was also involved in other rites of Freemasonry that went even deeper into the occult .
The Rite of Memphis contained Masonic rituals with a definite Egyptian flavor .
By the end of 1910 , thanks to my relations with the Grand Hierophant 97° of the Rite of Memphis ( a post held after his death by Dr. Gerard Encausse [ ' Papus ' ] , Theodor Reuss [ ' Merlin ' ] , and myself ) , I was now a sort of universal inspector - general of the various rites , charged with the secret mission of reporting on the possibility of reconstructing the entire edifice , which was universally recognized by all its more intelligent members as threatened with the gravest danger .
Even for a man like Crowley who was obsessed with the occult , the rituals of Freemasonry provided a profound occult thrill .
I supposed myself to have reached the summit of success when I restored the Secret Word of the Royal Arch .
In this case , tradition had preserved the Word almost intact .
Were Aleister Crowley and his followers or perhaps a similar group capable of performing acts and rituals that are comparable to what are described by satanic ritual abuse survivors .
The following quotes are from a book entitled , Secrets of the German Sex Magicians .
This book talks about the ritual use of pain and attributes to Crowley the most perverted of practices such as bestiality and the ritual consumption of body fluids .
The ritual use of pain and agony as an access mode to trance and magical power does have its limits , though .
For one thing , physical pain tends to dull the senses in the long run , so that stimuli have to be increased incessantly .
This may quite easily lead to grave bodily harm , not to mention the fact that it can become downright addictive and lead to a kindled frenzy not very easily mastered .
Crowley , in fact , trod in his practice a path similar to that of the more materialistic authorities .
Although he positively encouraged ejaculatory orgasm in his sex magic , he always made a point of consuming what he called the " elixir " afterwards .
He understood this elixir to be the mixture of the sexual fluids of both partners or , in the masturbatory act , as just the semen .
He entered very carefully in his the magical diaries a description of the elixir 's consistency and taste , and he even recorded the prophecies which he deduced from these data .
And Crowley 's practices go on to be even more disgusting .
Coprophagia , which means consumption of excrement , here also includes consumption of other secretions such as urine and sweat .
It was ritually practiced from early times on the sympathetic - magic principle that the secretions of any entity contain part of its magis .
Crowley , for example , occasionally offered his disciples in Cefalu the excretement of a goat .
This frequently met with no small disapproval !
Crowley performed a similar ritual in his Sicilian Abbey of Thelema , during which his Scarlet Woman was to be mounted by a goat which would be beheaded during the climax .
There exists today a secret society that dedicates itself to carrying on the teachings of Aleister Crowley .
This group is called the O.T.O. .
The O.T.O. was founded earlier this century by high grade Austrian Freemason Karl Kellner and German Freemason Theodor Reuss .
The O.T.O. became a major force in the occult world when Aleister Crowley became its leader .
Crowley learned ritual magic from the man who was renown as the master of his day , MacGregor Mathers .
The pupil - student relationship soon turned into a bitter rivalry and resulted literally in a Black Magic war .
When Mathers died in 1918 many of his friends were convinced that Crowley was responsible for his death .
Mathers , also a Freemason , introduced Crowley to an occult organization called the " Golden Dawn " and helped Crowley along his dark walk on the Egyptian Masonic road .
Mathers and his wife Moina , the sister of the philosopher Henri Bergson , lived in Paris .
( Mathers tried to convert Bergson to magic , but without success . )
Their house was decorated as an Egyptian temple and they celebrated ' Egyptian Masses ' , invoking the goddess Isis .
Mathers officiated in a long white robe , a metal belt engraved with the signs of the zodiac , bracelets round his wrists and ankles , and a leopard - skin slung across his shoulders .
He was convinced that he was descended from the Scottish clan MacGregor and took to calling himself MacGregor Mathers , Chevalier MacGregor and Comte de Glenstrae .
W. B. Yeats , whose magical name in the Golden Dawn was Daemon est Deus Inversus ( The Devil is God Reversed ) , was a frequent visitor to the Mathers household in Paris .
One of the most talked about Satanic groups in recent years has been The Temple of Set headed by Michael Aquino .
The brand of Satanism that is practiced by Michael Aquino and the Temple of Set is thoroughly Egyptian .
In the book , The Book of Coming Forth by Night ( 1985 ) Aquino describes what seems to be a call to start the Church of Satan and speaks in the first person as Set , the Egyptian Satan .
The Equinox has succumbed to my Solstice , and I , Set , am revealed in my Majesty .... I am the ageless Intelligence of this Universe ... and from my manifest semblance , which alone is not of Earth .
Known as the Hebrew Satan , I chose to bring forth a Magus , according to the fashion of my Word .
He was charged to form a Church of Satan , that I might easily touch the minds of men in this age they had cast for me .
The accusation of child abuse and molestation against Aquino was made in 1988 by Sandi Gallant of the San Francisco Police Department , thus placing another link between Egyptian style Satanism and Satanic Ritual Abuse .
The accusations surfaced concerning the day care center at the Presidio military installation and were as follows :
Children said they were taken by day to private homes , including two on army property , where they had been sexually molested ............
Other children talked about a " googoo " game in which they were urinated and defecated on by a " Mr. Gary " ....
Pencils were used to doodle on the skin and genitals of the children and were also inserted in a child anus .....
A gun was pointed at the head of another adult in front of the children .....
There were five confirmed cases among the children of chlamydia , a sexually transmitted illness .
Although no formal charges were filed against Aquino , there were certainly some interesting twists to the case .
His repeated claims of innocence to many were hollow cries .
There are some similarities in the accusations against the day care center when compared to the recent disclosures of children that we have been in contact with .
It is not clear how long the army has known about Aquino 's peculiar genus of satanism .
But the San Francisco police have been exceptionally interested since about 1980 .
The interest crested in November 1987 when police raided a house where a three - year - old girl told police she had been molested by a sinister - looking man named " Mickey " who snapped pictures of her in the bathtub and sexually mistreated her in a room with black walls and a cross etched on the ceiling .
The girl later spotted " Mickey " in the PX at the Presidio army base in San Francisco , where Aquino was stationed .
The girl said she thought " Mickey " was Aquino .
The girl also said she recognized Mrs. Aquino .
Meanwhile , authorities had found evidence of ongoing child abuse at the Presidio day care center .
A three - year - old had also been molested , and the cops turned up six cases of sexually transmitted infection in fifty - eight other charges at the center .
A thirty - four - year - old civilian day - care worker at the Presidio facility , who was also a Southern Baptist minister was arrested .
At first , the charges were dismissed .
But subsequently , Hambright was indicted anew on twelve counts of sodomy , oral copulation , and lewd conduct .
Hambright later died of AIDS .
Albert Churchward in his book , The Arcana of Freemasonry , confirms that Set is the Egyptian name for Satan .
That Sut or Set was first primary god of the Egyptians , but was god of the South Pole , or Southern Hemisphere , is amply proved and borne out by the monuments as well as the Ritual .
Set or Sut , according to Plutarch , is the Egyptian name of Typhon -- i.e. Satan of the Christian Cult .
THE REAL " ROCKET MAN " IS LOST IN THE SHADOWS OF HISTORY
Written by : Mr. Smith
What is the connection between UFOs , the Roswell Incident , Grey aliens , Robert Heinlein , L. Ron Hubbard , Ozzy Osbourne , Jimmy Page , The Beatles , backward messages hidden in music , solid rocket fuel , and a fatal explosion ?
The common thread , you are wondering ?
It might take a bit of a stretch , but here it is , in no particular order .
The Beatles ’ epic
” Sergeant Pepper’s
Lonely Hearts Club Band ” The Beatles , Ozzy Osbourne , and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page are all in the music biz .
The backward message issue comes in to play here as well .
Musicians ( those Satan worshipping loonies ) have used hidden messages to coerce young people to kill their parents , bite heads off of animals , and otherwise justify insane acts of violence .
Just kidding .
But the accusations fly , and have for a long time .
Ozzy Osbourne ( the Black Sabbath frontman who went solo , then rejoined Black Sabbath after sobering up ) has a song called “ Mr. Crowley , ” which refers to none other than Aleister Crowley .
Jimmy Page owns Crowley ’s old mansion , as well as a grandiose collection of all things Crowley .
It seems Jimmy has a bit of an Aleister fetish .
The Beatles have the backward tunes and a picture of Crowley on the cover of one of their albums .
No big deal , you say .
Lots of musicians , especially the hard rockers and metalheads , try to work some of Crowley into their works and images , if for no other reason than to associate their images with an icon of “ evil . ”
True enough .
But that ’s entertainment .
Another connection to Aleister Crowley is one of his disciples – a self - taught chemist named John Whiteside Parsons ( a.k.a . “ Jack ” ) .
Werner von Braun called Jack Parsons the “ true ” father of American rocketry .
Parsons was one of the original scientists involved in early rocket technology , specifically the chemical formulations for solid rocket fuel .
He also did a great deal of work with jet assisted takeoffs , thereby allowing aircraft to take off from shorter runways .
The group he worked with at the California Institute of Technology eventually morphed into the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) .
It is curious , then , why Parsons ’ story is so foggy , to say the least .
It is widely known that Parsons was a follower of Aleister Crowley .
Crowley was an English poet , magician , Satan follower , and a member ( later the leader ) of the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , or “ Order of the Eastern Temple , ” which was originally a cult of high ranking Freemasons .
Crowley wrote several books that influenced many later cults and rock bands , and claimed himself as the “ wickedest man in the world . ”
Crowley ’s involvement with O.T.O. functioned as his means of disseminating his beliefs and practices , as well as his books .
His work to promote the spiritual philosophy , “ Thelema , ” ( a Greek word meaning “ will ” or “ intention ” ) was done largely via the O.T.O .
A great deal of complexity surrounds the ideas and beliefs of Thelema , as well as Crowley ’s life , but his influence remains significant , and was especially for Parsons .
Crowley died in 1947 .
Robert Heinlein’s
Stranger in a
Strange Land
Although he was n’t a musician and probably did n’t play his music backwards , Parsons was involved with two rather famous writers – L. Ron Hubbard ( Dianetics , Scientology , Battlefield Earth ) and Robert Heinlein .
Hubbard and Heinlein were both friends of Parsons and they shared his occult interests in magic , as well as inspirations from Crowley and “ Thelema . ”
Parsons and his group attempted to create an incarnation of the goddess Babalon .
The purpose of the Babalon Working , according to Parsons , was to create this entity , thus ushering in the Aeon of Horus .
Some argue that this being manifested in the form of an Grey alien being , possibly in Roswell , New Mexico .
Heinlein ’s involvement is further supported through Stranger in a Strange Land , where the concept of Thelema is illustrated , but cleverly coded in the text .
Evidence from the Church of Scientology suggests that Hubbard was sent in by the government to dismantle the group of “ black magicians , ” including Parsons .
Another Church of Scientology statement claims that Hubbard actually broke up the group , as though he completely opposed Parsons and never participated in what happened .
It seems the church tried to clear Hubbard of any involvement with Parsons , his entourage , or any of the “ black magic ” going on in that group .
Jack Parsons
In 1950 , the FBI investigated Parsons for having classified documents from his work with the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena ( GALCIT ) .
This explains why but a trace of information available from “ official ” sources , like the Web sites of NASA and the JPL , regarding the contributions of Parsons .
For a man who was considered so significant in rocketry ( and thus , to the space program and national defense ) , who has a statue at JPL , and a crater on the dark side of the moon in his name , it seems odd that Parsons is “ lost ” in history .
His interest and activity in the O.T.O. is what keeps his spirit alive today , but the double - edged sword is that is also got him “ accidentally ” dead .
( Parsons died in an “ accidental ” explosion while moving volatile chemicals from his home laboratory in 1952 ) .
This also leads to the UFO connection .
Some UFO researchers believe that the first flying saucer and Grey alien incidents , particularly Roswell , stemmed from the creation of the entity envisioned by Crowley and later , by Parsons .
A sketch of an Enochian entity ( from Crowley ) looks strikingly similar to the quintessential Greys – the iconic extraterrestrial beings .
Parsons had some kind of contact in a New Mexico desert , too , at this time , with a being from Venus .
The timing of this also lends to the mystery because it all happened in 1946 , just prior to the Roswell incident of 1947 .
There are a number of other interesting connections with this group and the things that went on in Jack Parsons ’s life and how they relate to the events of that time .
Jack Parsons put the “ JP ” in JPL with his contributions to the science of solid rocket fuels and jet assisted take - off , but his other life pursuits effectively shadowed those contributions in a haze of mystery .
His death , accident or not , automatically raises the skeptic ’s eyebrow simply because his associations with certain people at that time , coupled with his knowledge of a sensitive subject , made him a target .
Parsons ’s story is a conspiracy theorist ’s “ land of opportunity ” with all the coincidences involved and all the connections to prominent people at such a significant time .
The further this gets explored , the more questions arise .
What did Parsons really know about UFOs and Ets if anything , and was his death the possible result of him knowing too much ?
Intentional or not , the story of Jack Parsons creeps into too many areas not to NOT be considered significant .
Feedback on this article : June 03 , 2006 : Dated June 01 , 2006 , I received this particular email from a member of one of Crowley 's foundations .
I hereby copy and paste the whole letter into this article :
Concerning your page : http://www.illuminati-news.com/aleister_crowley1.htm
Greetings to all at illuminati-new.com :
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law .
This letter concerns this webpage of yours :
http://www.illuminati-news.com/aleister_crowley1.htm
This page ; all be it naive and incomplete does mention Us ; which is appreciated very much ; and We thank you .
On this page you neglect to take note that LIL is the oldest of Aleister Crowley 's organizations ; even older than the puny O.T.O. .
Here are our website thus far : http://www.geocities.com/lovemexico/
http://www.angelfire.com/va/LIL/
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Bridge/9143/index.html.
We are the only true Illumati [ sic ] or rather Illuminators if you check Liber Aleph ; for all other mystical lights are false elite currents .
As for the O.T.O. ; there are so many branches ; one can't decide which is one is the more legitimate .
We laugh at there office politics for power ; for We are the Lamp of the Invisible Light , Supreme and All Powerful .
Let them bow before Us ; as We bathe the world in blood .
I have spoken !
Love is the law , love under will

Only a handful of scientists have security clearance to access the laboratory at 1600 Clifton Road in Atlanta , Georgia , home to the US government 's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
Before entering , they must pull on a protective hood , don breathing apparatus and pass through electronic fingerprint and retina scanners to prove their identity .
Inside the lab lies a batch of a virus , designated a " select agent " , that more than justifies the extreme level of security .
Resurrected nearly 90 years after it spread around the globe , leaving an estimated 50 million people dead , it is a replica of the 1918 Spanish flu virus .
The recreation of the virus , which was driven by an urge to unravel why the 1918 pandemic was so devastating , has raised as many fears as it has hopes .
While the researchers argue the work will hugely improve protection against natural flu viruses , critics say there is a real danger the virus will escape , with potentially disastrous consequences .
The recreation process was laborious .
Scientists collected fragments of the virus from lung tissue taken from victims at the time and preserved in formalin or , in one case , isolated from the lungs of a woman victim whose body had later become frozen in the Alaskan permafrost .
Using the fragments , they painstakingly pieced together and read the complete genetic code before using the sequence to rebuild the virus from scratch .
By injecting it into mice , the team led by Dr Jeffery Taubenberger at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Maryland was able to establish just how ferociously effective it was , compared with more common flu strains .
All the mice infected died within a few days ; all infected with contemporary strains recovered .
" I did n't expect it to be as lethal as it was , " Dr Terrence Tumpey , a scientist on the project from the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention , told the journal Nature .
By creating flu strains with only certain parts of the 1918 virus , researchers investigated which of the eight genes that make up the virus were most responsible for its virulence .
They discovered that rather than being caused by one or two genes , they all played a part , which suggests that the virus had completely adapted to cause disease in humans , something they say could happen again with avian flu strains .
In a second paper , published in Nature today , Dr Taubenberger and colleagues at the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection analysed the genetic make - up of the recreated virus .
Surprisingly , they found it had no similarities to any of the human viruses in circulation , suggesting that the Spanish strain had jumped from birds to humans , and did n't mix with a human virus first , as had been believed .
The finding that Spanish flu came straight from birds has raised concerns among scientists .
Previously , a pandemic was only thought likely if an avian strain merged with a human flu virus .
" For me , it raises even more concern than I already had about the pending potential of a flu pandemic , " said Professor Ronald Atlas , co-director of the centre for the deterrence of biowarfare and bioterrorism at the University of Louisville in Kentucky .
" It looks as though an avian strain evolved in 1918 and that led to the deadly outbreak , in much the same way as we 're now seeing the Asian avian flu strains evolve . "
According to Dr Taubenberger , knowing what mutations gave rise to the 1918 Spanish flu virus will help scientists check viruses to work out which , if any , are evolving to the point where a pandemic is possible .
The H5N1 strain of bird flu in Asia is already mutating to make it more suited to humans , he said .
Despite the new insights given by the project , many scientists were alarmed at the recreation itself and particularly that the full genetic sequence was to be made public on an online genetic database .
" Assuming this is a replicant of the 1918 flu strain , if it got out , it could initiate disease in humans and given the work they 've done , one had to say it would be infectious , " said Prof Atlas .
Viruses have escaped from high - security labs before .
During the recent Sars outbreak the virus escaped at least twice , once in Taiwan and once in Singapore , when researchers became contaminated .
Other scientists warned that the 1918 virus 's genetic code could easily be misused .
Such has been the pace of progress in genetic science that companies now build genes to order for customers who send in details of sequences they want .
" If the genetic sequence is out there on a database , then that is a clear security risk , " said Dr John Wood , a virologist at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , in Potters Bar .
According to Dr Julie Gerberding , director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection , a pandemic is unlikely even if the virus escapes because of most people 's natural immunities and the availability of antiviral drugs and flu vaccines .
Publication of the research still raises questions about the powers of academic journals who take ultimate responsibility for publishing the papers , said Dr Wood .
" That is some responsibility , " he said .
The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity concluded at an emergency meeting last week to discuss the possible publication of the papers that their benefits outweighed their risks .
FAQ : 1918 flu pandemic
Why was the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic so lethal ?
The worst pandemic in human history , the 1918 strain killed an estimated 50 million people .
Because flu viruses were unknown at the time , no isolates of the pathogen were made , making it impossible for scientists to study .
Scientists believe the virus was originally found only in birds but jumped to humans and evolved to become very infectious
Whom did the 1918 flu virus kill ?
Most flu viruses kill the very young , the old and the infirm .
But the Spanish flu was unusual in striking young , fit people extremely hard .
Even with good healthcare , up to one third of those who picked up the infection died , many within days
What is a select agent ?
Its designation as a ' select agent ' by US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention puts it on a list of controlled pathogens and toxins including ricin , smallpox virus , anthrax and ebola
How secure is the virus ?
It is held in a biosafety level 3 enhanced laboratory , kept at a negative pressure to prevent air escaping .
Workers must wear protective clothing , breathing apparatus and gain entry via fingerprint and retina scans
