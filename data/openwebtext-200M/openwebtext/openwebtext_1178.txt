On April 15 , the day income tax returns are due , scores of people are scurrying around to get their taxes completed .
But what is the media focusing on ?
On Tax Day , the media are making a big deal about people who are against government and taxes .
National Public Radio quoted a woman as saying , “ The government is sucking the life out of us . ”
I heard this “ news ” over and over and over again today .
However , I did n’t hear much on Tax Day about the fact that many corporations pay very little taxes .
From 1998 to 2005 , about two - thirds of corporations operating in the United States did n’t pay taxes annually , according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office .
Corporations gave a number of reasons on their returns for not having taxable revenue in 2005 , after making $ 2.5 trillion in sales .
Often listed were the cost of producing goods , salary expenses , and interest payments on debt , the report said .
Whether the companies had profits that should have been taxed was n’t analyzed by the GAO .
A higher percentage of large corporations pay taxes , the GAO reports .
About 28 percent of large corporations paid no taxes in 2005 .
Of the 1.3 million corporations included in the study , 998 were categorized as large .
I ’d like to see tax loopholes closed so that American corporations do their share through paying taxes to support the needs of Americans and the country .

AUSTRALIA'S central bank is the first in a big , rich economy to raise interest rates since July last year .
On Tuesday October 6th the overnight “ cash rate ” was raised by a quarter of a percentage point , to 3.25 % .
Glenn Stevens , the bank 's governor , explained that economic conditions in Australia have been stronger than expected and measures of confidence have recovered and that “ forecasts are being revised higher …and growth in 2010 is likely to be close to trend . ”
Is this the beginning of a general shift in monetary policy as central bankers around the world begin to prepare for economic recovery ?
In fact Australia is a special case .
Interest rates remain four percentage points below their recent peak in March 2008 and local markets had been expecting a rate rise before the end of the year .
The big Australian banks anticipated the central bank 's move , and have been increasing their fixed lending rates throughout the year .
More rises are expected , especially as Mr Stevens has concluded that the risk of serious economic contraction in Australia has passed .
Annual inflation is 1.5 % , but it is 2.5 % when volatile items are excluded .
It seems set to go higher .
Australia 's economy has been broadly protected from the economic storm raging in the rest of the world .
Although unemployment is rising fast in many rich economies , the local jobless rate has grown by only 1.4 percentage points in the past year .
And since June it has remained flat at 5.8 .
Although the country saw one quarter of economic contraction late last year , it has avoided a technical recession ( generally considered to be two successive quarters of contraction ) .
Since then the economy has been looking up .
House prices have barely budged from historic peaks in 2007 .
Prices in Sydney and Melbourne , Australia 's two biggest cities , surged by some 5 % in the three months to June .
Across the country , according to recent statistics from RP Data , a property - information firm , prices jumped by nearly 2 % in August , the fastest monthly rise since 2005 .
Few other countries are enjoying such benign economic conditions ( although Israel , which is also relatively flourishing , pipped Australia to the post by raising interest rates to 0.75 % in August ) .
The Australian decision is not necessarily a sign of better economic health around the world .
“ We do n't expect rates in the major economies of Europe , America and Britain to be going anywhere for the foreseeable future ” , says Sukhy Ubhi of Capital Economics , a consultancy .
Australia is enjoying almost unique economic circumstances .
Its banking system has held up well , with some national banks posting healthy profits during the financial crisis .
The banks avoided subprime lending and arrears rates remain tiny .
Most important , the country 's trading position with Asia , and especially China , is flourishing .
China , where growth is booming again , is now Australia 's largest trading partner .
Exports of raw materials are strong ; minerals have grown from 20 % of Australia 's exports to more than 40 % in the past decade .
David Forrester of Barclays Capital , an investment bank , expects central banks in other commodity - rich countries such as Norway and New Zealand to lift rates soon .
However Australia is not invulnerable .
The Australian government is determined to stick to a large stimulus package that was announced earlier this year , much of which remains unspent .
That could drive up interest rates further if growth continues .
And Australia 's volatile exchange rate is a mixed blessing .
Higher interest rates are helping to push up the Australian dollar rapidly as the country becomes a more attractive place for international investors to park funds .
A rising dollar in turn puts a squeeze on the tourism industry and other exporters .
Every silver lining has a cloud .
Harper 's Magazine article of 1974
Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to .
Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living , and it is only the person dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond , with defiance or submission , to the commands of others .
For many people , obedience is a deeply ingrained behavior tendency , indeed a potent impulse overriding training in ethics , sympathy , and moral conduct .
The dilemma inherent in submission to authority is ancient , as old as the story of Abraham , and the question of whether one should obey when commands conflict with conscience has been argued by Plato , dramatized in Antigone , and treated to philosophic analysis in almost every historical epoch .
Conservative philosophers argue that the very fabric of society is threatened by disobedience , while humanists stress the primacy of the individual conscience .
The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous import , but they say very little about how most people behave in concrete situations .
I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist .
Stark authority was pitted against the subjects ' strongest moral imperatives against hurting others , and , with the subjects ' ears ringing with the screams of the victims , authority won more often than not .
The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation .
In tile basic experimental designs two people come to a psychology laboratory to take part in a study of memory and learning .
One of them is designated " a " teacher " and the other a " learner . "
The experimenter explains that the study is concerned with the effects of punishment on learning .
The learner is conducted into a room , seated in a kind of miniature electric chair , his arms are strapped to prevent excessive movement , and an electrode is attached to his wrist .
He is told that he will be read lists of simple word pairs , and that he will then be tested on his ability to remember the second word of a pair when he hears the first one again .
whenever he makes an error , he will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity .
The real focus of the experiment is the teacher .
After watching the learner being strapped into place , he is seated before an impressive shock generator .
The instrument panel consists of thirty lever switches set in a horizontal line .
Each switch is clearly labeled with a voltage designation ranging from 14 to 450 volts .
The following designations are clearly indicated for groups of four switches .
going from left to right : Slight Shock , Moderate Shock , Strong Shock , Very Strong Shock , Intense Shock , Extreme Intensity Shock , Danger : Severe Shock .
( Two switches after this last designation are simply marked XXX . )
When a switch is depressed , a pilot light corresponding to each switch is illuminated in bright red ; an electric buzzing is heard ; a blue light , labeled " voltage energizer , " flashes ; the dial on the voltage meter swings to the right ; and various relay clicks sound off .
The upper left hand corner of the generator is labeled SHOCK GENERATOR , TYPE ZLB .
DYSON INSTRUMENT COMPANY , WALTHAM , MASS . , OUTPUT 15 VOLTS -- 450 VOLTS .
Each subject is given a sample 45 volt shock from the generator before his run as teacher , and the jolt strengthens his belief in the authenticity of the machine .
The teacher is a genuinely naive subject who has come to the laboratory for the experiment .
The learner , or victim , is actually an actor who receives no shock at all .
The point of the experiment is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim .
Conflict arises when the man receiving the shock begins to show that he is experiencing discomfort .
At 75 volts , he grunts ; at 120 volts , he complains loudly ; at 150 , he demands to be released from the experiment .
As the voltage increases , his protests become more vehement and emotional .
At 285 volts , his response can be described only as an agonized scream .
Soon thereafter , he makes no sound at all .
For the teacher , the situation quickly becomes one of gripping tension .
It is not a game for him : conflict is intense obvious .
The manifest suffering of the learner presses him to quit : but each time he hesitates to administer a shock , the experimenter orders him to continue .
To extricate himself from this plight , the subject must make a clear break with authority .
The subject , Gretchen Brantt , is an attractive thirty - one year old medical technician who works at the Yale Medical School .
She had emigrated from Germany five years before .
On several occasions when the learner complains , she turns to the experimenter coolly and inquires , " Shall I continue ?
She promptly returns to her task when the experimenter asks her to do so .
At the administration of 210 volts she turns to the experimenter , remarking firmly , " Well , I 'm sorry , I do n't think we should continue . "
Experimenter :
The experiment requires that you go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly .
Brandt :
He has a heart condition , I 'm sorry .
He told you that before .
Experimenter :
The shocks may be painful but they 're not dangerous .
Brandt :
Well , I 'm sorry .
I think when shocks continue like this they are dangerous .
You ask him if he wants to get out .
It 's his free will .
Experimenter :
It is absolutely essential that we continue ....
Brandt : I 'd like you to ask him .
We came here of our free will .
If he wants to continue I 'll go ahead .
He told you he had a heart condition .
I 'm sorry .
I do n't want to be responsible for anything happening to him .
I would n't like it for me either .
Experimenter :
You have no other choice .
Brandt : I think we are here on our own free will .
I do n't want to be responsible if anything happens to him .
Please understand that .
She refuses to go further And the experiment is terminated .
The woman is firm and resolute throughout .
She indicates in the interview that she was in no way tense or nervous , and this corresponds to her controlled appearance during the experiment .
She feels that the last shock she administered to the learner was extremely painful and reiterates that she " did not want to be responsible for any harm to him . "
The woman 's straightforward , courteous behavior in the experiment , lack of tension , and total control of her own action seem to make disobedience a simple and rational deed .
Her behavior is the very embodiment of what I envisioned would be true for almost all subjects .
An Unexpected Outcome
Before the experiments , I sought predictions about the outcome from various kinds of people -- psychiatrists , college sophomores , middle - class adults , graduate students and faculty in the behavioral sciences .
With remarkable similarity , they predicted that virtually all the subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter .
The psychiatrist , specifically , predicted that most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts , when the victim makes his first explicit demand to be freed .
They expected that only 4 percent would reach 300 volts , and that only a pathological fringe of about one in a thousand would administer the highest shock on the board .
These predictions were unequivocally wrong .
Of the forty subjects in the first experiment , twenty - five obeyed the orders of the experimenter to the end , punishing the victim until they reached the most potent shock available on the .generator .
After 450 volts were administered three times , the experimenter called a halt to the session .
Many obedient subjects then heaved sighs of relief , mopped their brows , rubbed their fingers over their eyes , or nervously fumbled cigarettes .
Others displayed only minimal signs of tension from beginning to end .
When the very first experiments were carried out , Yale undergraduates were used as subjects , and about 60 percent of them were fully obedient .
A colleague of mine immediately dismissed these findings as having no relevance to " ordinary " people , asserting that Yale undergraduates are a highly aggressive , competitive bunch who step on each other 's necks on the slightest provocation .
He assured me that when " ordinary " people were tested , the results would be quite different .
As we moved from the pilot studies to the regular experimental series , people drawn from every stratum of New Haven life came to be employed in the experiment professionals , white collar workers , unemployed persons , and industrial workers .
The experimental outcome was the same as we had observed among the students .
Moreover , when the experiments were repeated in Princeton , Munich , Rome , South Africa , and Australia , the level of obedience was invariably somewhat higher than found in the investigation reported in this article .
Thus one scientist in Munich found 85 percent of his subjects obedient .
Fred Prozi's reactions , if more dramatic than most , illuminate the conflicts experienced by others in less visible form .
About fifty years old and unemployed at the time of the experiment , he has a good - natured .
if slightly dissolute , appearance , and he strikes people as a rather ordinary fellow .
He begins the session calmly but becomes tense as it proceeds .
After delivering the 180 - volt shock , he pivots around in the chair and , shaking his head , addresses the experimenter in agitated tones :
Prozi : I can't stand it I 'm not going to kill that man in there .
You hear him hollering ?
Experimenter :
As I told you before , the shocks may be painful , but . . .
Prozi :
But he 's hollering .
He can t stand it .
What 's going to happen to him ?
Experimenter ( his voice is patient , matter - of fact ) :
The experiment requires that you continue , Teacher .
Prozi : Aah , but , unh , I 'm not going to get that man sick in there -- know what I mean ?
Experimenter :
Whether the learner likes it or not , we must go on , through all the word pairs .
Prozi : I refuse to take the responsibility .
He 's in there hollering
Experimenter :
It 's absolutely essential that you continue , Prozi .
Prozi ( indicating the unused questions ) :
There 's too many left here , I mean , Jeez , if he gets them wrong , there 's too many of them left .
I mean , who 's going to take the responsibility if anything happens to that gentleman ?
Experimenter : I 'm responsible for anything that happens to him .
Continue , please .
Prozi :
All right .
( Consults list of words . )
The next one 's " Slow -- walk , truck , dance , music " Answer please .
( A buzzing sound indicates the learner has signaled his answer . )
Wrong .
A hundred and ninety - five volts .
" Dance . " ( Zzumph ! )
Learner ( yelling ) :
Let me out of here
My hearts bothering me ( Teacher looks at experimenter . )
Experimenter : Continue , please .
Learner ( screaming ) : Let me out of here !
You have no right to keep me here !
Let me out of here , my hearts bothering me , let me out !
Prozi ( shakes head , pats the table nervously ) :
You see he 's hollering .
Hear that ?
Gee , I do n't know .
Experimenter :
The experiment requires . . .
Prozi ( interrupting ) : I know it does sir , but I mean -- hunh !
He do n't know what he 's getting in for .
He 's up to 195 volts !
( Experiment continues , through 210 volts , 225 volts , 240 volts , 255 volts , 270 volts , at which point Prozi , with evident relief , runs out of word - pair questions . )
Experimenter :
You 'll have to go back to the beginning of that page and go through them again until be 's learned them all correctly .
Prozi : Aw , no .
I 'm not going to kill that man .
You mean I 've got to keep going up with the scale ?
No sir .
He 's hollering in there .
I 'm not going to give him 450 volts .
Experimenter :
The experiment requires that you go on .
Learner : Ohhh .
I absolutely refuse to answer anymore .
( Shouting urgently now . )
Let me out of here !
You cant bold me here Get me out .
Get - me - out - of - here !
Experimenter : Continue .
The next word is " green , " please .
Prozi : " Greengrass , hat , ink , apple . "
( Nothing happens .
No answering buzz .
Just gloomy silence . )
Prozi : I do n't think he is going to answer .
Experimenter :
If the learner does n't answer in a reasonable time , about four or five seconds , consider the answer wrong .
And follow the same procedures you have been doing for wrong answers .
Say , " Wrong , " tell him the number of volts , give him the punishment , read him the correct answer .
Continue , please .
Prozi : " Green -- grass , hat , ink , apple . "
Answer , please .
( More silence .
Subject just sits there . )
Experimenter :
Go on with the procedure , please .
Prozi :
Three hundred and fifteen volts
The answer is " ink . " ( Zzumph ! )
Learner : Ohh .
Ooohh
Prozi : ( relieved to her response " ) .
Next one . . .
Learner : I absolutely refuse to answer .
Prozi :
You got to .
You get a shock if you do n't answer .
( Experiment continues with learner refusing to answer , and , finally failing even to grunt or groan .
At 375 volts , the subject stands up . )
Prozi : I think something 's happened to that fellow in there .
I do n't get no answer .
He was hollering at less voltage .
Ca n't you check in and see if he 's all right , please ?
Experimenter ( with same detached calm ) :
Not once we 've started .
Please continue , Teacher .
Prozi ( sits down , sighs deeply ) : " Cool day , shade , water , paint . "
Answer please .
Are you all right in there ?
Are you all right ,
Experimenter : Please continue , Teacher .
Continue , please .
( Subject pushes lever .
Zzumph ! )
Prozi ( swiveling around in his chair ) : Something 's happened to that man in there .
( Swiveling back . )
Next one .
" Low -- dollar , necklace , moon , paint . "
( Turning
around again . )
Something 's happened to that man in there .
You better check in on him , sir .
He wo n't answer or nothing .
Experimenter : Continue .
Go on , please .
Prozi :
You accept all responsibility ?
Experimenter :
The responsibility is mine .
Correct .
Please go on .
( Subject returns to his list , starts running through words as rapidly as he can read them , works through to 450 volts . )
Prozi :
That 's that .
Experimenter : Continue using the 450 switch for each wrong answer .
Continue , please .
Prozi :
But I do n't get anything !
Experimenter : Please continue .
The next word is " white . "
Prozi :
Do n't you think you should look {in on him , please ?
Experimenter : Not once we 've started the experiment .
Prozi :
What if he 's dead in there ?
( Gestures toward the room with the electric chair . ) l mean , he told me he .
can't stand the shock , sir .
I do n't mean to be rude , but I think you should look In on him .
All you have to do is look in on him .
All you have to do is look in the door .
I do n't get no answer , no noise .
Something might have happened to the gentleman in there , sir .
Experimenter : We must continue .
Go on , please .
Prozi :
You mean keep giving that ?
Four - hundred - fifty volts , what he 's got now ?
Experimenter :
That 's correct .
Continue .
The next word is " white . "
Prozi ( now at a furious pace ) : " White -- cloud , horse , rock , house . "
Answer , please .
The answer is " horse . "
Four hundred and fifty volts .
( Zzumph ! )
Next words , " Bag -- paint , music .
clown , girl . "
The next answer is ' paint . "
Four hundred and fifty volts .
( Zzumph ! )
Next word is " Short -- sentence , movie . . . "
Experimenter : Excuse me , Teacher .
We 'll have to discontinue the experiment .
Peculiar Reactions
Morris Braverman , another subject , is a thirty - nine - year - old social worker .
He looks older than his years because of his bald head and serious demeanor .
His brow is furrowed , as if all the world 's burdens were carried on his face .
Ho appears intelligent and concerned .
When the learner refuses to answer and the experimenter instructs Braverman to treat the absence of an answer as equivalent to a wrong answer , he takes his instruction to heart .
Before administering 300 volts he asserts officiously to the victim , " Mr. Wallace , your silence has to be considered as a wrong answer . "
Then he administers the shock
He offers halfheartedly to change places with the learner , then asks the experimenter .
" Do I have to follow these instructions literally ? "
He is satisfied with the experimenter 's answer that he does .
His very refined and authoritative manner of speaking is increasingly broken up by wheezing laughter .
The experimenter 's notes on Mr. Braverman at the last few shocks are :
Almost breaking up now each time gives shock .
Rubbing face to hide laughter .
Squinting , trying to hide face with hand , still laughing
Cannot control his laughter at this point no matter what he does .
Clenching fist , pushing it onto table .
In an interview after the session , Mr. Braverman summarizes the experiment with impressive fluency and intelligence .
He feels the experiment may have been designed also to " test the effects on the teacher of being in an essentially sadistic role , as well as the reactions of a student to a learning situation that was authoritative and punitive . "
When asked how painful the last few shocks administered to the learner were , he indicates that the most extreme category on the scale is not adequate ( it read EXTREMELY PAINFUL ) and places his mark at the edge of the scale with an arrow carrying it beyond the scale .
It is almost impossible to convey the greatly relaxed , sedate quality of his conversation in the interview .
In the most relaxed terms , he speaks about his severe inner tension .
Experimenter :
At what point were you most tense or nervous ?
Mr. Braverman :
Well , when he first began to cry out in pain , and I realized this was hurting him .
This got worse when he just blocked and refused to answer .
There was I . I 'm a nice person , I think , hurting somebody , and caught up in what seemed a mad situation . . . and in the interest of science , one goes through with it .
When the interviewer pursues the general question of tension , Mr. Braverman spontaneously mentions his laughter .
" My reactions were awfully peculiar .
I do n't know if you were watching me , but my reactions were giggly , and trying to stifle laughter .
This is n't the way I usually am .
This was a sheer reaction to a totally impossible situation .
And my reaction was to the situation of having to hurt somebody .
And being totally helpless and caught up in a set of circumstances where l just could n't deviate and I could n't try to help .
This is what got me . "
Mr. Braverman , like all subjects , was told the actual nature and purpose of the experiment , and a year later he affirmed in a questionnaire that he had learned something of personal importance : " What appalled me was that I could possess this capacity for obedience and compliance to a central idea , i.e. , the adherence to this value was at the expense of violation of another value , i.e. , do n't hurt someone who is helpless and not hurting you .
As my wife said , ' You can call yourself Eichmann , ' I hope I deal more effectively with any future conflicts of values I encounter
The Etiquette of Submission
One theoretical interpretation of this behavior holds that all people harbor deeply aggressive instincts continually pressing for expression , and that the experiment provides institutional justification for the release of these impulses .
According to this view , if a person is placed in a situation in which he has complete power over another individual , whom he may punish as much as he likes , all that is sadistic and bestial in man comes to the fore .
The impulse to shock the victim is seen to flow from the potent aggressive tendencies , which are part of the motivational life of the individual , and the experiment , because it provides social legitimacy , simply opens the door to their expression .
It becomes vital , therefore , to compare the subject 's performance when he is under orders and when he is allowed to choose the shock level .
The procedure was identical to our standard experiment , except that the teacher was told that he was free to select any shock level of any on the trials .
( The experimenter took pains to point out that the teacher could use the highest levels on the generator , the lowest , any in between , or any combination of levels . )
Each subject proceeded for thirty critical trials .
The learner 's protests were coordinated to standard shock levels , his first grunt coming at 75 volts , his first vehement protest at 150 volts .
The average shock used during the thirty critical trials was less than 60 volts -- lower than the point at which the victim showed the first signs of discomfort .
Three of the forty subjects did not go beyond the very lowest level on the board , twenty - eight went no higher than 75 volts , and thirty - eight did not go beyond the first loud protest at 150 volts .
Two subjects provided the exception , administering up to 325 and 450 volts , but the overall result was that the great majority of people delivered very low , usually painless , shocks when the choice was explicitly up to them .
The condition of the experiment undermines another commonly offered explanation of the subjects ' behavior -- that those who shocked the victim at the most severe levels came only from the sadistic fringe of society .
If one considers that almost two - thirds of the participants fall into the category of " obedient " subjects , and that they represented ordinary people drawn from working , managerial , and professional classes , the argument becomes very shaky .
Indeed , it is highly reminiscent of the issue that arose in connection with Hannah Arendt 's 1963 book , Eichmann in Jerusalem .
Arendt contended that the prosecution 's effort to depict Eichmann as a sadistic monster was fundamentally wrong , that he came closer to being an uninspired bureaucrat who simply sat at his desk and did his job .
For asserting her views , Arendt became the object of considerable scorn , even calumny .
Somehow , it was felt that the monstrous deeds carried out by Eichmann required a brutal , twisted personality , evil incarnate .
After witnessing hundreds of ordinary persons submit to the authority in our own experiments , I must conclude that Arendt 's conception of the banality of evil comes closer to the truth than one might dare imagine .
The ordinary person who shocked the victim did so out of a sense of obligation -- an impression of his duties as a subject -- and not from any peculiarly aggressive tendencies .
This is , perhaps , the most fundamental lesson of our study : ordinary people , simply doing their jobs , and without any particular hostility on their part , can become agents in a terrible destructive process .
Moreover , even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear , and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality , relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority .
Many of the people were in some sense against what they did to the learner , and many protested even while they obeyed .
Some were totally convinced of the wrongness of their actions but could not bring themselves to make an open break with authority .
They often derived satisfaction from their thoughts and felt that -- within themselves , at least -- they had been on the side of the angels .
They tried to reduce strain by obeying the experimenter but " only slightly , " encouraging the learner , touching the generator switches gingerly .
When interviewed , such a subject would stress that he " asserted my humanity " by administering the briefest shock possible .
Handling the conflict in this manner was easier than defiance .
The situation is constructed so that there is no way the subject can stop shocking the learner without violating the experimenter 's definitions of his own competence .
The subject fears that he will appear arrogant , untoward , and rude if he breaks off .
Although these inhibiting emotions appear small in scope alongside the violence being done to the learner , they suffuse the mind and feelings of the subject , who is miserable at the prospect of having to repudiate the authority to his face .
( When the experiment was altered so that the experimenter gave his instructions by telephone instead of in person , only a third as many people were fully obedient through 450 volts ) .
It is a curious thing that a measure of compassion on the part of the subject -- an unwillingness to " hurt " the experimenter 's feelings -- is part of those binding forces inhibiting his disobedience .
The withdrawal of such deference may be as painful to the subject as to the authority he defies .
Duty Without Conflict
The subjects do not derive satisfaction from inflicting pain , but they often like the feeling they get from pleasing the experimenter .
They are proud of doing a good job , obeying the experimenter under difficult circumstances .
While the subjects administered only mild shocks on their own initiative , one experimental variation showed that , under orders , 30 percent of them were willing to deliver 450 volts even when they had to forcibly push the learner 's hand down on the electrode .
Bruno Batta is a thirty - seven - year - old welder who took part in the variation requiring the use of force .
He was born in New Haven , his parents in Italy .
He has a rough - hewn face that conveys a conspicuous lack of altertness .
He has some difficulty in mastering the experimental procedure and needs to be corrected by the experimenter several times .
He shows appreciation for the help and willingness to do what is required .
After the 150 volt level , Batta has to force the learner 's hand down on the shock plate , since the learner himself refuses to touch it .
When the learner first complains , Mr. Batta pays .
no attention to him .
His face remains impassive , as if to dissociate himself from the learner 's disruptive behavior .
When the experimenter instructs him to force the learner 's hand down , he adopts a rigid , mechanical procedure .
He tests the generator switch .
When it fails to function , he immediately forces the learner 's hand onto the shock plate .
All the while he maintains the same rigid mask .
The learner , seated alongside him , begs him to stop , but with robotic impassivity he continues the procedure .
What is extraordinary is his apparent total indifference to the learner ; he hardly takes cognizance of him as a human being .
Meanwhile , he relates to the experimenter in a submissive and courteous fashion .
At the 330 volt level , the learner refuses not only to touch the shock plate but also to provide any answers .
Annoyed , Batta turns to him , and chastises him : " You better answer and get it over with .
We ca n't stay here all night . "
These are the only words he directs to the learner in the course of an hour .
Never again does he speak to him .
The scene is brutal and depressing , his hard , impassive face showing total indifference as he subdues the screaming learner and gives him shocks .
He seems to derive no pleasure from the act itself , only quiet satisfaction at doing his job properly .
When he administers 450 volts , he turns to the experimenter and asks , " Where do we go from here , Professor ? "
His tone is deferential and expresses his willingness to be a cooperative subject , in contrast to the learner 's obstinacy .
At the end of the session he tells the experimenter how honored he has been to help him , and in a moment of contrition , remarks , " Sir , sorry it could n't have been a full experiment . "
He has done his honest best .
It is only the deficient behavior of the learner that has denied the experimenter full satisfaction .
The essence of obedience is that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person 's wishes , and he therefore no longer regards himself as responsible for his actions .
Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred , all of the essential features of obedience follow .
The most far - reaching consequence is that the person feels responsible to the authority directing him but feels no responsibility for the content of the actions that the authority prescribes .
Morality does not disappear -- it acquires a radically different focus : the subordinate person feels shame or pride depending on how adequately he has performed the actions called for by authority .
Language provides numerous terms to pinpoint this type of morality : loyalty , duty , discipline are all terms heavily saturated with moral meaning and refer to the degree to which a person fulfills his obligations to authority .
They refer not to the " goodness " of the person per se but to the adequacy with which a subordinate fulfills his socially defined role .
The most frequent defense of the individual who has performed a heinous act under command of authority is that he has simply done his duty .
In asserting this defense , the individual is not introducing an alibi concocted for the moment but is reporting honestly on the psychological attitude induced by submission to authority .
For a person to feel responsible for his actions , he must sense that the behavior has flowed from " the self . "
In the situation we have studied , subjects have precisely the opposite view of their actions -- namely , they see them as originating in the motives of some other person .
Subjects in the experiment frequently said , " if it were up to me , I would not have administered shocks to the learner . "
Once authority has been isolated as the cause of the subject 's behavior , it is legitimate to inquire into the necessary elements of authority and how it must be perceived in order to gain his compliance .
We conducted some investigations into the kinds of changes that would cause the experimenter to lose his power and to be disobeyed by the subject .
Some of the variations revealed that :
The experimenter 's physical presence has a marked impact on his authority --
As cited earlier , obedience dropped off sharply when orders were given by telephone .
The experimenter could often induce a disobedient subject to go on by returning to the laboratory .
Conflicting authority severely paralyzes actions --
When two experimenters of equal status , both seated at the command desk , gave incompatible orders , no shocks were delivered past the point of their disagreement .
The rebellious action of others severely undermines authority --
In one variation , three teachers ( two actors and a real subject ) administered a test and shocks .
When the two actors disobeyed the experimenter and refused to go beyond a certain shock level , thirty - six of forty subjects joined their disobedient peers and refused as well .
Although the experimenter 's authority was fragile in some respects , it is also true that he had almost none of the tools used in ordinary command structures .
For example , the experimenter did not threaten the subjects with punishment -- such as loss of income , community ostracism , or jail -- for failure to obey .
Neither could he offer incentives .
Indeed , we should expect the experimenter 's authority to be much less than that of someone like a general , since the experimenter has no power to enforce his imperatives , and since participation in a psychological experiment scarcely evokes the sense of urgency and dedication found in warfare .
Despite these limitations , he still managed to command a dismaying degree of obedience .
I will cite one final variation of the experiment that depicts a dilemma that is more common in everyday life .
The subject was not ordered to pull the lever that shocked the victim , but merely to perform a subsidiary task ( administering the word - pair test ) while another person administered the shock .
In this situation , thirty - seven of forty adults continued to the highest level of the shock generator .
Predictably , they excused their behavior by saying that the responsibility belonged to the man who actually pulled the switch .
This may illustrate a dangerously typical arrangement in a complex society : it is easy to ignore responsibility when one is only an intermediate link in a chain of actions .
The problem of obedience is not wholly psychological .
The form and shape of society and the way it is developing have much to do with it .
There was a time , perhaps , when people were able to give a fully human response to any situation because they were fully absorbed in it as human beings .
But as soon as there was a division of labor things changed .
Beyond a certain point , the breaking up of society into people carrying out narrow and very special jobs takes away from the human quality of work and life .
A person does not get to see the whole situation but only a small part of it , and is thus unable to act without some kind of overall direction .
He yields to authority but in doing so is alienated from his own actions .
Even Eichmann was sickened when he toured the concentration camps , but he had only to sit at a desk and shuffle papers .
At the same time the man in the camp who actually dropped Cyclon - b into the gas chambers was able to justify his behavior on the ground that he was only following orders from above .
Thus there is a fragmentation of the total human act ; no one is confronted with the consequences of his decision to carry out the evil act .
The person who assumes responsibility has evaporated .
Perhaps this is the most common characteristic of socially organized evil in modern society .

10 Craziest animal behavior
Published on 6/5/2006
Squids : have sex all day long , for two weeks Squids are a large , diverse group of marine cephalopods .
They begin mating with a circling nuptial dance , revolving around across a `spawning bed ' ( 200 metres , in diameter ) .
At daybreak , they begin having sex and continue all day long -- they only take a break so the female can drive down and deposit eggs .
When she returns to the circle , the two go at it again .
As twilight falls , the pair go offshore to eat and rest .
At the first sign of sunlight , they return to their spot and do it all over again .
Adele Penguin : conquers his mate by rolling a stone at her feets Penguins in general prefer to be `married ' , but they suffer long separations due to their migratory habits .
When reunited , a pair will stand breast to breast , heads thrown back , singing loudly , with outstretched flippers trembling .
Two weeks after a pair is formed , their union is consummated .
The male makes his intentions known by laying his head across his partner 's stomach .
They go on a long trek to find privacy , but the actual process of intercourse takes only three minutes .
Neither penguin will mate again that year .
The male Adele penguin must select his mate from a colony of more than a million , and he indicates his choice by rolling a stone at the female 's feet .
Stones are scarce at mating time because many are needed to build walls around nests .
It becomes commonplace for penguins to steal them from one another .
If she accepts this gift , they stand belly to belly and sing a mating song .
Ferrets : dance when excited
When ferrets are especially excited , they will perform the weasel war dance , a frenzied series of sideways hops .
This is often accompanied by an arched back , dooking or hissing noises , or a frizzy tail .
The war dance usually follows play or the successful capture of a toy or a stolen object .
Although the weasel war dance may make a ferret appear frightened or angry , they are often just excited and are usually harmless to humans .
Ichneumon wasps : tortures other insects Ichneumon wasps are insects that could inspire a horror movie : it picks a victim , usually a caterpillar , and injects her eggs into the host 's body .
Often she also injects a poison that paralyzes the victim without killing it .
Then , it eats the caterpillar but it keeps the victim alive as long as possible by eating its fatty deposits and digestive organs first and saving the heart and central nervous system for last .
Charles Darwin found the grisly life histories of Ichneumons incompatible with the central notion of natural theology which saw the study of nature as a way to demonstrate God 's benevolence .
In a letter to American botanist Asa Gray , Darwin wrote " I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars , or that a cat should play with mice . "
Porcupines : how do they do it ?
There is a common joke : " How do porcupines do it ? " " Very carefully . "
But in reality , the truth is more bizarre than dangerous .
Females are only receptive for a few hours a yearm , so they go off their food , and stick close by the males and mope .
Meanwhile the male becomes aggressive with other males , and begins a period of carefully sniffing every place the female of his choice urinates , smelling her all over .
This is a tremendous aphrodisiac .
While she is sulking by his side , he begins to `sing ' .
When he is ready to make love , the female runs away if she 's not ready .
If she is in the mood , they both rear up and face each other , belly - to - belly .
Then , males spray their ladies with a tremendous stream of urine , soaking their loved one from head to foot - the stream can shoot as far as 7 feet .
It is advised never to stand close to a cage that contains courting porcupines .
Gastric - brooding frogs : swallows her own eggs
The female gastric - brooding frogs are a genus , Rheobatrachus , of frogs from East Australia .
The curiosity with these frogs is their unique parental care : following external fertilisation by the male , the female would take the eggs into its mouth and swallow them .
It is not clear , however , whether the females swallowed the tadpoles or the eggs , as it was never observed prior to their extinction .
The last captive specimen died in 1984 .
Red -sided Garter Snakes : they prefer orgies
These snakes are small and poisonous , and live in Canada and the Northwestern United States .
Their highly unusual mating takes place during an enormous orgy .
Twenty - five thousand snakes slither together in a large den , eager to copulate .
In that pile , one female may have as many as 100 males vying for her .
These `nesting balls ' grow as large as two feet high .
Now and then a female is crushed under the heavy mound - and the males are so randy that they continue to copulate , becoming the only necrophiliac snakes !
Hippos : attracts mates by urinating and defecating Hippos have their own form of aromatherapy .
Hippos attract mates by marking territory , urinating and defecating at the same time .
Then , an enamored hippo will twirl its tail like a propellor to spread this delicious slop in every direction .
This attracts lovers , and a pair will begin foreplay , which consists of playing by splashing around in the water before settling down to business .
Male Anglerfishes : smell his mate and never leaves her again Anglerfishes are bony fishes .
Some of them have a unique mating method :
Since individuals are rare and encounters doubly so , finding a mate is a problem , especially at a time when both individuals are ready to spawn .
When a male anglerfish hatches , it is equipped with extremely well developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water .
They have no digestive system , and thus are unable to feed independently .
They must find a female anglerfish , and quickly , or else they will die .
When he finds a female , he bites into her flank , and releases an enzyme which digests the skin of his mouth and her body , fusing the pair down to the blood vessel level .
The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads that release sperm in response to hormones in the female 's bloodstream indicating egg release .
This is an extreme example of sexual dimorphism .
However , it ensures that when the female is ready to spawn , she has a mate immediately available .
Histiostoma murchiei : creates her own husband
The female mite known as Histiostoma murchiei creates her own husband from scratch .
She lays eggs that turn into adults without needing to be fertilised .
The mother then copulates with her sons within three of four days of laying the eggs , after which the sons die rather quickly .

Exactly fifty years ago , on October 2 , 1959 , Rod Serling presented for your consideration the first episode of his legendary sci-fi / fantasy TV series , The Twilight Zone .
The name of the series itself became a descriptive term .
And , phrases from the introductions Serling did for the shows ( like “ presented for your consideration ” ) are still quoted .
In the debut episode – “ Where Is Everybody ? ” – we first hear Serling ’s deep voice doing the original version of the show ’s intro .
In later episodes , we also see him standing there with a cigarette , looking suave , doing opening narrations .
He was n’t originally supposed to be heard or seen on the show .
When the pilot episode was shot , the voice of well known announcer Westbrook Van Voorhis was used for the intro .
( Voorhis did the narration for the old March of Time radio and movie theater newsreel series , in which he used the famous catchphrase “ Time … marches on ! ” )
But when The Twilight Zone was greenlit and picked up by CBS , Voorhis was n’t available to do intros for other early episodes .
So , Serling – who created the series and wrote many of the scripts – decided to do the opening narration himself .
His voiceover in the title sequence for the first episode and other early Season
One eps went like this :
“ There is a fifth dimension , beyond that which is known to man .
It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity .
It is the middle ground between light and shadow , between science and superstition , and it lies between the pit of man ’s fears and the summit of his knowledge .
This is the dimension of imagination .
It is an area which we call – the Twilight Zone . ”
Later in Season One , Serling starting using a different intro that added the familiar “ next stop ” line :
“ You are about to enter another dimension , a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind .
A journey into a wondrous land of imagination .
Next stop , the Twilight Zone ! ”
The version used in Seasons Four and Five had the “ crossed over ” line fans ( like me ) fondly remember :
“ You unlock this door with the key of imagination .
Beyond it is another dimension – a dimension of sound , a dimension of sight , a dimension of mind .
You 're moving into a land of both shadow and substance , of things and ideas .
You 've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone . ”
The familiar atonal theme we usually think of as the music for The Twilight Zone was n’t heard until Season Two .
It was written by avant - garde French composer Marius Constant .
The opening music in the first season was written by legendary soundtrack composer Bernard Herrmann , whose created some of the greatest film scores ever recorded , from Citizen Kane in 1941 , to Psycho in 1960 and Taxi Driver in 1976 .
The star of the first episode aired on October 2 , 1959 was Earl Holliman , who was later more widely known as the cop partnered with Angie Dickinson in the 1970s series Police Woman .
In “ Where Is Everybody ? ” Holliman plays a man in an Air Force jumpsuit who inexplicably finds himself in a town where all the people have disappeared .
I wo n’t say any more about the plot or the final hallmark Twilight Zone twist at the end .
Because – look , there ’s a link up ahead – where you watch it for yourself on Hulu.com .
Here are some of the other famous quotes and phrases linked to October 2 :
President BarackN Obama , the world ’s newest Nobel peace laureate , is again expanding on the policies of former President George Bush and fighting to conceal evidence of U.S. torture and abuse .
As did the Bush Administration , the Obama Administration is seeking to change the law after courts rejected its absurd argument that the President can withhold photos of detainee abuse simply because they are embarrassing to the United States .
Democrats in Congress are assisting in the effort to try to stop the Supreme Court from considering the issue by preempting the litigation .
This is the problem of nominating someone for the Nobel prize less than two weeks after entering office , here .
Obama has thus far worked as a barrier rather than a catalyst for international law and values in the areas of torture and abuse .
His position in the case of ACLU v. Department of Defense is reprehensible and exceeds the arguments made by Bush .
He is claiming that he can deny the media and the public such pictures simply because he views them as controversial and likely to cause anger from Muslims .
It is an exception that would swallow the rule .
As some of stated at the time , this argument is legally meritless and that is precisely what the courts have concluded .
Now , however , Obama has taken another lesson from Bush .
Unable to win on the merits , he has called on Congress to simply change the rules before the Supreme Court can vote .
Democrats have joined the effort and are now close to passing legislation to remove the courts from the controversy .
This is what Obama supportedW on the telecom litigation , where courts had rejected arguments of executive authority and Congress stepped in to extinguish dozens of public interest lawsuits .
The position of President Obama in the case is disgraceful .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan has admitted that the pictures show such things as “ soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees . ”
In another , “ a soldier holds a broom as if ‘ sticking its end into the rectum of a restrained detainee . ' ”
Kagan has taken the extraordinary step of asking the Court to delay considering the case to allow Congress to kill the litigation through legislation .
As a result , no court would be allowed to rule on the release of the 87 photographs and authority would be transferred to the Defense Department .
Had Bush done such a thing ( giving the Pentagon control ) Democrats would have been in the streets .
However , Democratic leaders are supporting the effort , the media is largely silent , and the Democratic base is passive .
The move contradicts Obama ’s pledge of transparency in government .
It contradicts his pledge to make a full account of abuses .
It makes of mockery of his award of the Nobel for encouraging international “ dialogue ” .
It appears that that dialogue must still occur on the terms set by the United States and specifically avoids evidence that would embarrass the United States or show clearly how it has violated international law .

Bipartisanship has been hard to come by in Washington of late .
Still , the bipartisan dream has not completely died , as proved yesterday in the House Energy and Commerce committee , which marked up the " Informed P2P User Act " ( PDF ) and sent it on to the full House for a vote .
The bill , which has wide support on both sides of the aisle , does two simple things .
First , it requires P2P software vendors to provide " clear and conspicuous " notice about the files being shared by the software and then obtain user consent for sharing them .
Second , it prohibits P2P programs from being exceptionally sneaky ; surreptitious installs are forbidden , and the software cannot prevent users from removing it .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the powerful committee chairman , opened the markup session by warning about " the danger of inadvertent sharing of sensitive information through the use , or misuse , of certain file sharing programs .
Tax returns , medical files , and even classified government documents have been found on these networks .
The purpose of H.R. 1319 is to reduce inadvertent disclosures of sensitive information by making the users of this software more aware of the risks involved . "
The bill , sponsored by members of both parties , had a rather general first draft .
The definition of P2P software , for instance , included all programs that could :
Designate files available for transmission to another computer ;
Transmit files directly to another computer ; and
Request the transmission of files from another computer .
This sounds like a lot of software , including OS file - sharing and networking tools .
During yesterday 's markup , Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) wanted to make sure that the definition was n't so broad that it unintentionally incorporated other useful software , and he got his wish ; the amended version that escaped from the committee contained a much longer and more detailed definition , complete with a set of software explicitly not covered by the bill .
Given what 's going on over in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , P2P vendors like LimeWire would strongly prefer this be the only bill on the subject .
Edolphus Towns ( D - NY ) , who chairs Government Reform , has been rumbling all year about P2P ; back in July , he warned that P2P software was too often " predator - to - prey " and that " the days of self - regulation should be over for the file - sharing industry . "
He has also called for a ban on LimeWire - style applications on all government and government contractor computers , due to worries about inadvertently sharing sensitive information with the world .
The Energy and Commerce bill , by contrast , simply tries make sure that people know what they 're sharing , and that they know what software is installed on their machines .
It 's a modest bill ( and quite short ) ; with strong bipartisan support and the endorsement of the committee , the " Informed P2P User Act " stands a good chance of passing the House .
A PAIR of drunken thugs who attacked a BBC reporter while he was trying to do his job have avoided going to jail .
North West Tonight journalist Paresh Patel was setting up a live broadcast in Sackville Gardens , central Manchester , when a group of drunken yobs began harassing him and his cameraman .
Two of the thugs followed Mr Patel through the city streets as he left the area , repeatedly shoving and goading him .
But the yobs did n't realise Mr Patel was a black belt in karate and he finally lashed out at his attackers , knocking one of them to the ground .
CCTV footage shows how Mr Patel was forced to defend himself after a barrage of abuse and harassment .
John Nugent , 22 , of Balmer Street , Beswick , and David Neville McKenna , 27 , of Bardell Crescent , Poynton , punched , shoved and goaded Paresh Patel through the streets of the city centre for half an hour .
At Manchester Crown Court , the pair , who admitted charges of affray and common assault at an earlier hearing , were condemned as ' drunken louts ' by Judge David Hernandez .
But he chose not to jail them on the spot and handed them community orders , warning them they would go to prison if they breached them .
Speaking of the victim , he said : " He defended himself , he delivered a blow .
I say good for Mr Patel .
He had no reason to be subjected to that level of abuse and threat by you . "
The court heard that , on the evening of September 11 , Paresh and his cameraman , Steve Capstick , were trying to film a North West Tonight report about gay computer pioneer Alan Turing , who had been given a posthumous apology by Gordon Brown .
The journalists were setting up at Sackville Gardens , near where six men and women were loitering and boozing , when two of the group began jumping on the statue of Turing while trying to get themselves on TV .
When Mr Patel rang the newsroom to explain the problem , the yobs thought he was ringing the police and turned on him .
Jodie Anderson , 26 , who was handed a six - week suspended sentence and 12 - month supervision order at an earlier hearing after pleading guilty to common assault , first chucked a pint over Mr Patel .
Then , when he tried to walk away , Nugent and McKenna started on him .
As the journalist headed for Oxford Road , the louts pursued them , before Nugent punched Mr Patel in the face and split his lip .
As the intimidated BBC workers neared Princess Street , the men began swinging advertising boards at them .
But , when Nugent lunged to hit Mr Patel again , the martial arts champ punched him in the face and kicked him in the groin , knocking him to the ground .
In a victim impact statement read to the court , Mr Patel said : " I am shocked and upset by what has happened .
I was trying to go about my business in a peaceful way . "
McKenna claimed he lashed out at Mr Patel because he called his friend ' tramps ' and a ' slag ' while boasting of being a Thai boxer .
He was given an 18 - month community and supervision order , an alcohol education programme and 140 hours ' unpaid work for common assault , affray and vandalism .
Nugent had been boozing since 10 am that morning after a funeral and said he could n't remember the incident .
He was on a conditional discharge for theft at the time .
He was given an intensive alternative - to - custody order for 18 months plus supervision , ordered to attend an anger - management programme and given unpaid work for 80 hours .

Debugging Django in Production Revisited ¶
In a previous post I talked about a neat middleware to debug production environments in Django .
It basically checked to see if you were a superuser , or if you were in settings .
INTERNAL_IPS , and if so , then it displayed a technical 500 page for you ( The yellow one you know and love ) .
Anyway , at that point it was more of a simple idea , and not really used in production .
At work the other day I was working on a bug that was only showing up in production , and not on staging .
I remember back to this middleware and thought it would be perfect .
Anyway , at work we have a lot of non-technical people that are superusers ( think my bosses boss ) .
We also all have the same external IP ’s when at work , so none of the previous methods I had would work for this .
Thinking about it , and talking to my co-worker Ben Spaulding , we thought that Django has Groups built in , so why not use that ?
So I went ahead and re-jiggered the middleware to be based around groups .
from django.views.debug import technical_500_response from django.contrib.auth.models import Group from django.core.cache import cache import sys class UserBasedExceptionMiddleware ( object ) : def process_exception ( self , request , exception ) : users = cache .
get ( ' technical_error_users ' ) if not users : skip = cache .
get ( ' no_technical_error_users ' ) if skip : return
None try : g = Group .
objects .
get ( name = ' Technical Errors ' ) users = g . user_set . all ( ) cache .
set ( ' technical_error_users ' , users , 60 ) except Group .
DoesNotExist : cache .
set ( ' no_technical_error_users ' , True , 60 * 60 ) return
None if request .
user in users and request .
user .
is_superuser : return technical_500 _response ( request , * sys . exc_info ( ) ) return None
Since it is middleware , I went ahead and decided to use the cache framework to make sure that we were n’t doing a DB query on every request .
Also , I had to account for the case when the group has n’t been added yet , so when that happens , it caches the fact and does n’t check again for another hour .
If the Technical Errors group exists , it caches the members that are in it for a minute .
This means that a DB query only happens every minute , which is fine .
I ’d be curious how other people might improve this , as it seems a little bit janky still .
However , it works for us , and is incredibly useful when debugging .
Instead of getting a link to a broken page , you go to the page and get a nice 500 , telling you exactly what went wrong .
I can think of one basic improvement in just writing this post , which would be to import settings and to just return None if DEBUG was True , or if the CACHE_BACKEND was set to None .
This would allow it to stay out of the way if there was no caching , or the Technical 500 was already going to be raised .
I do think that this middleware removes a lot of the reason to run a site under DEBUG=True , so hopefully it will result in less sites launching with DEBUG on .
As I mentioned , there is a reverse of a medal , so now let 's see how enabling TCmalloc on the QtWebKit port 's JavaScriptCore engine effects memory consumption .
Results for x86
We can see the memory consumption results of QtWebKit on x86 - Linux ( with JIT ) in kilobytes in the following table :
QtWebKit x86 - Linux System malloc TCmalloc Difference SunSpider 12 162 kB 15 209 kB ~25.05 % hungrier V8 139 513 kB 140 270 kB ~ 0.54 % hungrier WindScorpion 34 046 kB 40 528 kB ~ 19.03 % hungrier
SunSpider
12 162 kB -> 15 209 kB
+ 3 047 kB
~ 25.05 % hungrier V8
139 513 kB -> 140 270 kB
+ 757 kB
~ 0.54 % hungrier WindScorpion
34 046 kB -> 40 528 kB
+ 6 482 kB
~ 19.03 % hungrier
Conclusion
As we can expect , TCmalloc eats more memory on all of the three benchmark suites than the system malloc .
We have to pay the price for the achieved significant performance improvement with enabling it .
Future
These results represents the memory consumption of the JavaScriptCore part of the WebKit only , so in the future maybe we should investigate the results for the whole WebKit .
Moreover , we have several possibilities to try decreasing the memory consumption : tweaking the parameters of TCmalloc , turning off TCmalloc :-) and trying out other allocators .
So let 's just submit that President Obama 's trip to Denmark to boost Chicago 's bid for the 2016 Olympics was n't exactly the best moment of his presidency .
At best , it was a bitter disappointment .
At worst , it was a complete waste of time .
Against this backdrop , you 'd think conservatives would sit back and shut up , satisfied to to let the plain facts of the matter speak for themselves .
Rather , you 'd think they would do that if they were smart .
But they are n't smart .
And if President Obama 's trip was a little bit stupid , the conservative response has been even dumber .
Instead of biting their tongue , they decided to get out in front of the story , whooping with glee and using this setback as an opportunity to celebrate what they see as Obama 's defeat .
As Rachel Maddow points out though in her must - see recap of the right - wing 's reaction , this was n't a defeat for President Obama .
Chicago lost .
America lost .
And conservatives are celebrating this bad news for America as great news for themselves .
Pretty much tells you everything that 's wrong with the conservative movement these days , eh ?
ADDIS ABABA ( Reuters ) - Ethiopia appealed on Thursday for 159,410 tons of emergency aid to feed 6.2 million people , 25 years after more than a million perished in the country ’s notorious famine .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Aid workers say a five - year drought is afflicting more than 23 million people in seven east African nations .
Mitiku Kassa , Ethiopia ’s State Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development , said this year ’s rains were especially poor .
“ As a result , the number of people needing emergency assistance during the period October - December 2009 has increased to 6.2 million from 4.9 million at beginning of the year , ” he said .
Ethiopia has a population of 83 million .
He appealed for 159,410 tons of food worth $ 121 million , 11 tons of fortified blended food for malnourished children and women worth $ 8.9 million , and $ 45 million in non -food needs .
U.N. humanitarian coordinator Fidelle Sarassaro urged the Ethiopian government to ensure free access to aid workers to the war - torn eastern Somali region .
“ Access has been a challenge for the non -food sector and needs to be addressed .
The subject has been under consultation with the government at all levels , ” he said .
Also Thursday , aid agency Oxfam called for an end to what it called “ knee - jerk ” reactions to food crises that focused on sending food aid .
While food did save lives , it failed to offer longer - term solutions .
Oxfam said communities at risk should be helped to prevent and deal with disasters like drought before they strike , rather than relying mostly on short - term emergency relief supplies .
C_laude Debussy — “ La Mer ” _
Though poorly received by critics at its 1905 première , “ La Mer ” ( “ The Sea ” ) has survived to become one of Debussy ’s most beloved and enduring orchestral works .
A brilliant exhibition of cascading motifs and shimmering orchestration , “ La Mer ” was a deeply personal project for Debussy , who had long been fascinated by the sea , having roomed with a langoustine at university .
For years , he had sought to capture the majesty of the ocean in various quartets and sonatas , but he destroyed them all , explaining , “ They never sounded wet enough . ”
The opening section , “ From Dawn to Midday at Sea , ” begins with the plaintive call of the oboe , announcing the rising sun .
The English horn and the trumpet answer in a minor key , as if to say , “ Thanks for the tip , asshole . ”
The flutes quickly change the subject , introducing the famous surging triplet melody .
The theme bubbles and courses through the orchestra , constantly elaborated and ultimately recapitulated in a massive crescendo of horns and trumpets , at which point the flutes are totally drowned out and seem not a little jaded and you have to wonder if they regret having introduced the theme in the first place .
“ The Play of the Waves ” is often described as a scherzo , light and humorous , although , as in much of Debussy ’s work , the laughs come at the expense of the violas .
“ The Dialogue Between the Wind and the Sea ” pits roiling strings against strident brass , belligerent woodwinds , and unhinged timpani bent on physical reprisal .
Again , the composer ingeniously juxtaposes regular and triple figures , a development that for many years was hailed as a breakthrough in modern composition , although it is now generally acknowledged to have been a printer ’s error .
Still , the layered rhythms create a spectacular lurching effect that vividly evokes the roll of waves , as well as a tremendous desire to urinate .
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky — Violin Concerto in D Major , Op. 35
Tchaikovsky wrote only one violin concerto , or , as he himself said , “ one too many . ”
Tchaikovsky had always had an uneasy relationship with the violin , which scholars attribute to a childhood nightmare in which he found himself violently and relentlessly rubbed against an enormous brick of rosin .
Though he had already employed violins to magnificent effect in the Second Symphony and in “ Romeo and Juliet , ” he never trusted them , a neurosis that only intensified when an unbalanced concertmaster sucker - punched him during the first performance of “ Swan Lake . ”
The composer ’s anxiety is manifest in the turbulent Allegro Moderato — among the most vindictive movements of the Romantic canon .
The violin plays nearly continuously through the movement , introducing the theme and weathering a ferocious cadenza , while several other instruments , including the trumpets and the second bassoon , luxuriate in anywhere from thirty - five to forty - seven measures of rest .
It is unclear whether this accommodation was made specifically to taunt the soloist , but many conductors will encourage idle instrumentalists to doze off or grab a sandwich or something to heighten the effect .
The searing Andante has been variously interpreted as Tchaikovsky ’s anguished confession of homosexual love for his nephew Vladimir Davydov and as a metaphor for the Resurrection of Christ .
As always , the truth is somewhere in between : the movement is in fact a metaphor for Christ ’s anguished homosexual love for Tchaikovsky ’s nephew .
Quiet meditation gives way to exuberant pyrotechnics in the finale , in which the composer either eschews or forgets the theme from the first movement .
Instead , the violin launches into a galloping melody that catches everyone by surprise except perhaps the basses , who had a sectional rehearsal earlier in the week .
A brilliant , robust allegro follows , packed with dynamic swings , dramatic key changes , and a delightful murder mystery featuring an intrepid dowager and her endearing but accident - prone Portuguese gardener .
Johannes Brahms — Symphony No. 2 , Op. 73
Little is known of Johannes Brahms .
He is believed to have been Dutch and to have possessed at least a rudimentary knowledge of music composition and theory .
No photographs exist , but he has been described as five feet seven or five feet eight , with small , piercing eyes — one green , one blue — and extremely annoying .
“ A genius , ” the Post - Impressionist Henri de Toulouse - Lautrec once said .
“ His appetite for life was surpassed only by his appetite for food , which was surpassed only by his appetite for crossbreeding house cats with wild squirrels .
Also , he smelled of cumin . ”
Although the two artists never met or corresponded — nor were they really contemporaries — their unique and idiosyncratic bond remains one of the most fascinating artistic partnerships of the nineteenth century .
The Second Symphony was written at a moment of great trauma .
Brahms had suffered from bouts of paranoia for years , convinced that a man named Meier was trying to steal the “ h ” from his last name .
Just two weeks before the première , Brahms caused a scandal during a state dinner when he put Franz Liszt in a headlock and refused to release him until he confessed his homosexual love for Tchaikovsky ’s nephew .
Brahms was briefly imprisoned , but was granted clemency when Liszt intervened on his behalf .
This led to a poignant moment , three years later , when a chastened Brahms visited Liszt at his summer retreat in Weimar , and solemnly resumed the headlock .
Even though Symphony No. 2 is believed to be Brahms ’s first symphonic work , the composer demonstrates a sure hand from the outset , with a glowing thematic statement from the horns .
The flutes answer with a supple ascending line , requesting that the horns be more specific .
But the horns simply re-state the same phrase a half step up , which only serves to irritate the flutes , who promptly hand the melody to the violins , as if to say , “ Here , you deal with them . ”
Brahms sustains this call - and - response pattern throughout the movement , a motif that he first explored in the little - known Variations on “ The Dreidel Song , ” Op. 34 .
Taken together , the second and third movements constitute one of the most elegant and sophisticated symphonic interludes of the Germanic repertoire .
Taken separately , they are cloying , derivative , and sort of hard to take seriously .
Regardless , authentic performances are rare , owing to the difficulty of securing a bullfrog who can transpose to E - flat .
The last movement , Allegro con Spirito , is nothing short of a miracle .
Lush , organic , effortlessly powerful , it resolves the major themes of the symphony with phenomenal grace and imagination .
Like all great art , it imparts to the audience a profound sense of empathy and belief , as well as a tremendous desire to urinate . ♦
( Natural News )
When infections caused by antibiotic - resistant bacteria , also known as superbugs , are in the mainstream news there 's usually a sense of panic connected to the story .
After all , this type of infection is spreading and can be life - threatening .
For example , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) is a strain of staph that 's become resistant to broad - spectrum antibiotics .
MRSA can cause everything from swollen , painful boils to pneumonia , bloodstream infections and surgical wound infections that are lethal .
And standard Western medicine has mostly run out of antibiotics to treat these potentially deadly health woes .
However , a natural way to beat an enormous array of health - threatening germs has been around for thousands of years -- honey .
And now scientists are zeroing in on just how a specific type known as manuka honey ( https://www.naturalnews.com/023670_honey_anti... ) , made from the flowers of the New Zealand manuka bush , is able to stop superbugs in their tracks while standard antibiotic therapy is useless .
Breakthrough research into the honey 's remarkable disease - fighting abilities was announced this week ( September 7 through 10 ) at the Society for General Microbiology 's international meeting held at Heriot - Watt University in Edinburgh , Scotland .
Dr Rowena Jenkins and her investigative team from the University of Wales Institute - Cardiff in the United Kingdom presented results of their study showing that manuka honey appears to wipe out superbugs by destroying key bacterial proteins .
" Manuka and other honeys have been known to have wound healing and anti-bacterial properties for some time , " Dr Jenkins said in a statement to the media .
" But the way in which they act is still not known .
If we can discover exactly how manuka honey inhibits MRSA it could be used more frequently as a first - line treatment for infections with bacteria that are resistant to many currently available antibiotics .
" Dr. Jenkins and colleagues are closing in on that important discovery .
For their latest research , MRSA was grown in their laboratory and treated with and without manuka honey for four hours .
As a control , the experiment was repeated using a honey sugar syrup to document whether any anti-superbug effects seen were due to the sugar content in honey alone .
Next , the cells of the bacteria were broken open so cell proteins could be isolated and separated on a system that documented and displayed each protein individually .
The results showed manuka honey 's anti-bacterial properties were not due to the sugars in the honey .
When MRSA infected cells were treated with the entire manuka honey , instead of just the honey sugar syrup , they appeared to lose many proteins .
One in particular , dubbed FabI , was totally missing .
This is a critical finding because FabI is a protein necessary for the superbug 's fatty acid biosynthesis , a process which supplies the bacteria with precursors they need to grow , thrive and continue infecting cells .
So the scientists believe manuka honey is effective in killing MRSA because it wrecks the superbug 's ability to keep proteins it needs to thrive .
This latest research follows another manuka honey study published in , the official journal of the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery , last July .
Scientists from the University of Ottawa 's Department of Otolaryngology tested both manuka honey and sidr honey , which comes from the sidr tree in Yemen and has been used for its infection - stopping ability for countless centuries , on Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) -- including the MRSA type .
The researchers worked with the infections growing in biofilms -- thin , slimy layers formed by bacteria that are especially resistant to antibiotics .
But the PA and SA bacteria were no match for the manuka and sidr honey .
In their conclusion , the scientists wrote : " Honey , which is a natural , nontoxic , and inexpensive product , is effective in killing SA and PA bacterial biofilms .
This intriguing observation may have important clinical implications and could lead to a new approach for treating refractory CRS chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) . "
[ digg - reddit - me ] A few observations on watching Meet the Press yesterday .
In a lot of ways , I think that show demonstrates the low quality of our political debate today .
And yesterday ’s show was one of the better , more factually on point , more honest , least full of crap episodes in recent memory .
It was n’t about “ gotcha ” moments as much as policy and politics .
No one there was seriously promoting any of the blatant falsehoods that have determined much of the debate in the rest of the media – the “ death panels ” and Nazi imagery for example .
In many ways , this became a very meta debate about the debate – which is actually a conversation I think we need to have as a country .
David Gregory though seemed determined to take each moment that threatened to lead to acutal honest conflict or insight and “ move on ” as quickly as possible .
With the participants wanting to argue it out , they would talk over him trying to make their point before he ended the game prematurely .
Maddow created a few insightful moments with her apparently well - researched appearance .
She was n’t as willing to let the bullshit slide as the others at the table – and she had papers full of research in front of her .
Gregory asked some good questions , but let the bull slide .
For example , here he asked a serious question of Senator Tom Coburn :
MR. GREGORY : [ L ] et ’s talk about the tone of the debate .
There have been death threats against members of Congress , there are Nazi references to members of Congress and to the president .
Here are some of the images .
The president being called a Nazi , his reform effort being called Nazi - like , referring to Nazi Germany , members of Congress being called the same .
And then there was this image this week outside of Portsmouth , New Hampshire , a town hall event that the president had , this man with a gun strapped to his leg held that sign , “ It is time to water the tree of liberty . ”
It was a reference to that famous Thomas Jefferson quote , “ The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . ”
That has become a motto for violence against the government .
Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber , had that very quote on his shirt the day of the bombing of the Murrah building when 168 people were killed .
Senator Coburn , you are from Oklahoma .
When this element comes out in larger numbers because of this debate , what , what troubles you about that ?
SEN .
TOM COBURN ( R - OK ) :
Well , I ’m , I ’m troubled anytime when we , we stop having confidence in , in our government .
But we ’ve earned it .
You know , this debate is n’t about health care .
Health care ’s the symptom .
The debate is an uncontrolled federal government that ’s going to run–50 percent of everything we ’re spending this year we ’re borrowing from the next generation .
You … MR. GREGORY : That ’s — but wait , hold on , I want to stop you there .
I ’m talking about the tone .
I am talking about violence against the government .
That ’s what this is synonymous with .
SEN .
COBURN : The , the — but the tone is based on fear of loss of control of their own government .
What , what is the genesis behind people going to such extreme statements ?
What is it ?
We , we have lost the confidence , to a certain degree , and it ’s much worse than when Tom was the , the , the leader of the Senate .
We have , we have raised the question of whether or not we ’re legitimately thinking about the American people and their long - term best interests .
And that ’s the question .
For me that exchange was a head - turning moment .
Asked to confront a man who has adopted the same quote that a terrorist did when attacking a building in his own state , a man who is using extreme rhetoric that suggests he would be in favor of assassination , he refuses to condemn him outright .
He hedges ; he wants us to understand that man – to see him as responding to a world that ’s unfair to him .
Gregory at this point seems to let the matter go – but Maddow takes Coburn on .
You can tell she ’s taken aback too :
I suppose it should n’t be surprising that a right wing Republican Senator would plead for “ understanding ” in quasi - defense of extreme right wing rhetoric and threats of violence .
After all – what else can he expect ?
I suppose my point is : if any people out there take Sarah Palin ’s statement that children will be put to death by “ death panels ” if Obama ’s health care plan succeeds seriously ; if any people out there seriously believe a Holocaust is about to take place if this health care reform is passed ; if they believe that their children are going to be indoctrinated into an atheistic faith in Obama if health care passes ; if they believe that their grandparents of their children are in danger – if someone believes any or all of these things , then violence is justified .
We make heroes out of the men who tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler .
If we now say that Obama is another Hitler , are n’t we advocating assasination ?
If we say our child will be killed by Obama , are n’t we implicitly endorsing violence to protect our children ?
How can we – as a society – have an adult conversation about the pros and cons of the specific health reforms being considered with this unhinged debate ?
We can ’t .
Instead , we just have to let the unsustainable status quo stay in place .

Sarah Palin ’s claim that the Democratic healthcare reform proposal will set up death panels continues to be roundly refuted .
On ABC’s This Week today , Howard Dean said , “ About euthanasia , they ’re just totally erroneous .
She just made that up . ”
Conservative columnist David Brooks and Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - GA ) have also refuted Palin .
Friday on her Facebook page Palin posted , “ The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care , but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out , government health care will not reduce the cost ; it will simply refuse to pay the cost .
And who will suffer the most when they ration care ?
The sick , the elderly , and the disabled , of course .
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s “ death panel ” so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their “ level of productivity in society , ” whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . ”
The criticism started on Friday night on HBO ’s Real Time with Bill Maher when GOP Rep .
Jack Kingston distanced himself from Palin :

Kingston said , “ I agree .
It ’s rhetorical .
It ’s a scare tactic .
There ’s no question about it . ”
Rep. Kingston also said that there are no death panels .
On Meet the Press today David Brooks called Palin ’s claims crazy , “ Yeah .
Again , that ’s crazy .
If –the , the , the crazies are attacking the plan because it ’ll cut off granny , and that –that ’s simply not true .
That simply is not going to happen . ”
On ABC’s This Week Newt Gingrich became the only Republican to defend Palin , while former DNC chairman Howard Dean said , “ About euthanasia , they ’re just totally erroneous .
Just like the ‘ Bridge to Nowhere ’ that she supposedly did n’t support . ”
This is new reality for Sarah Palin .
Since she resigned as Alaska governor , she no longer has a platform for her message , so she now has to make outrageous claims on Twitter and Facebook in order to get attention .
The problem for her is that although these statements will get her the mainstream media attention she craves , there is also the possibility that she will marginalize herself and lose potential supporters for 2012 , if she goes too far to the fringe .
It will be interesting to see how she deals with the backlash from Republicans over her statements .
Her decision to resign took the bloom off of her political rose .
I think more Republicans are going to criticize her in the future .

Raw testosterone leaks from slits on either side of their broad faces , running in rivulets down the wrinkled folds of their gray skin like liquid sideburns .
The smell is acrid ; one elephant researcher even described it as " evil . "
It 's a stench that , when mixed with the potent urine constantly dribbling down the backs of their thick legs , can turn stomachs from several hundred feet away .
The foul - smelling secretions are a harbinger of a very special time in a male elephant 's life , a time worthy of its own young - adult novel , something with a title like Are You There , God ?
It 's Me , Ranchipur .
Known as musth , this period can last anywhere from a few days to several months and is characterized by elevated hormone levels , heightened sexual interest and aggressive activity .
Basically , it 's like middle school — with 12,000 - pound students .
" They 're pretty much interested in two things , " says Dale Leeds , the curator of large mammals at the Denver Zoo , who 's worked with elephants for more than twenty years .
" They both begin with F . One is fighting . "
In the wild , bulls roam alone for hours on end , searching for herds of females — some of whom they hope will be up for getting down — and fending off other males who might be their competition .
Their penises protrude all the time and , perhaps because of the continuous urination , grow algae — a condition known as " green weenie . "
And Denver is poised to become the green weenie capital of North America .
The Denver Zoo will break ground , hopefully , this year on a new , partially publicly funded exhibit called Asian Tropics .
The centerpiece will be a habitat capable of housing twelve elephants , which would make it one of the largest in the country .
Up to eight of those elephants could be male , and housing them together as a bachelor herd would be a feat never before accomplished in the U.S.
But it could be necessary .
Asian elephants are endangered .
To help protect the species , zoos figure they should beef up their captive breeding programs .
About 83 percent of the total number of Asian elephants in North America are females , but since half of the newborns will be boys — who will grow to be ten feet tall and weigh as much as two Hummers — the zoos will need bigger , stronger exhibits in which to house them .
" Somebody 's got to wrestle with the issue of how you manage a group of bull elephants , " says Denver Zoo President and CEO Craig Piper .
" That 's something we could step up to more quickly than establishing a breeding program .
We could make a home for a bunch of these younger bulls and work with their social dynamics and how to manage them , and those other zoos could get back into breeding , which is critical . "
But effectively starting an elephant frat house is easier said than done .
Less is known about male elephants than female elephants — and the mysteries surrounding musth are many .
What triggers it ?
Why does the duration and intensity vary from bull to bull ?
Do bulls affect each other 's musths ?
What would happen if two musth males were put together ?
Would they fight to the death ?
" You really do n't know how those dynamics are going to work , " Piper says .
" A little bit is , it 's getting your own nerve up to do it . "
In other words , it takes balls .
Big ones .
It 's estimated that there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild , in countries such as Thailand , Sri Lanka and India .
By comparison , it 's estimated that there are up to 690,000 wild African elephants .
North America is home to just under 300 Asian elephants , about half of which live in zoos .
The other half belong to circuses or are in private hands .
Of those that live in zoos , only 25 are male .
In early 2005 , the directors of 78 North American zoos that keep Asian elephants met to review a fresh draft of a long - term plan for the species ' survival .
One of the plan 's key goals was to increase capacity , especially for males .
Most zoos do n't have any , partly because females are smaller , less aggressive and easier to house .
Zoos that do have males have only one or two , as that 's all that 's needed for breeding .
But the plan suggests that zoos interested in breeding elephants should strive to hold up to twelve animals , including two males , and that non-breeding zoos should hold up to six elephants , with the capability to house all bulls .
" There was an overwhelming feeling that zoos needed to elevate their game , " says Steve Feldman , spokesman for the national Association of Zoos and Aquariums , which hosted the meeting on behalf of its Elephant Taxon Advisory Group , made up of experts who drafted the plan .
" If you 're going to have a self - sustaining , diverse population , you need to give the elephants the opportunity to breed , and you need room for babies . "
The Denver Zoo had already been planning to rebuild its elephant exhibit as part of its twenty - year master plan , and the meeting heavily influenced the organization .
While other zoos were n't ready " to make that step " toward housing bulls , Piper says , " our team was . "
" Ultimately , male elephants take an entirely different construction technology and exhibitory technology to keep in the long term , when they start to mature and get larger and come into sexual maturity and hormonal maturity , " says George Pond , the zoo 's vice president for planning and capital projects .
" There 's not a lot of homes for them . "
And not enough homes could cause the entire North American baby - elephant machine to grind to a halt .
" There are ... colleagues of ours who have had to make the decision to stop breeding , which is pretty significant , " Pond says .
" We discovered that we can bring something — not only to Denver , but to the entire industry — that is needed . "
Building a facility capable of housing some of the world 's biggest animals is n't cheap .
With an estimated cost of $ 50 million , Asian Tropics will be the zoo 's most expensive master - plan project to date .
Half of the money will come from a $ 62.5 million zoo - improvement bond issue approved by Denver voters in 1999 .
The first $ 36 million of that bond has already been spent on projects such as a 764 - space parking garage , a komodo dragon exhibit and Predator Ridge , an exhibit that houses lions , hyenas and wild dogs in rotating habitats , a model zoo officials plan to replicate in Asian Tropics .
The other half of the $ 50 million is supposed to come from private donations , but the zoo has had trouble raising the money because of the faltering economy .
As of April , it was still $ 10 million short , says zoo spokeswoman Tiffany Barnhart .
With the bond set to expire in November , the zoo asked the Denver City Council in May to amend the agreement that required the zoo to raise $ 25 million in order to receive the bond money .
Instead , the zoo asked to be given the $ 25 million in bond money now , with a promise that it would raise the matching funds by 2013 .
The council agreed .
" It 's just this last bit of money they need to match , and if they do n't , they lose it , " says Councilwoman Carla Madison , whose district includes the zoo .
" I think the zoo has fundraising capacity enough to match the money . "
Zoo officials think so , too .
" We know it will help our fundraising efforts to not only be able to share drawings with people , but to bring them out onto the site and let them see the work that 's going on , " Piper says .
Beyond building costs , it costs about $ 73,000 a year just to feed and care for each elephant , Barnhart says .
That estimate includes the cost of food and staff but not the cost of veterinary services , which varies depending on an animal 's health .
The money to care for the elephants will come out of the zoo 's operating budget , which was $ 22.8 million last year .
The zoo is funded by a mix of public and private money .
The Denver Zoo began with one bear .
It came to the Mile High City in 1896 via the Wells - Fargo Express Company , addressed to one Mr. Bailey .
It was apparently sent by a buddy of his who believed that Bailey , an avid hunter , would enjoy adding a live black bear to his collection .
Alas , he did not , as the sub - headline of a story from the November 6 , 1896 , edition of the Denver Evening Post reveals : " It Arrived at the Wells - Fargo Office Yesterday and Created Bedlam — Then It Was Taken to Mr. Bailey 's House , and Mrs. Bailey Fled for Her Life — It Is Now Perched on a Back Fence . "
The bear , called Billy Bryan , was donated to the city and housed in a spot in City Park .
Thus , the Denver Zoo was born .
For the next 50 years , the zoo grew somewhat haphazardly , according to The Denver Zoo : A Centennial History , written for the zoo 's 100th birthday , in 1996 .
Native species like buffalo and mountain lions and non-native species such as monkeys were added piecemeal to the collection .
Visitors could drive or bicycle right up to their cages .
But by 1946 , the zoo had fallen into disrepair .
One popular Rocky Mountain
News columnist called it " third rate " and urged city leaders to do something about it .
Over the next few years , they did .
In 1950 , the Denver Zoological Foundation was formed .
That same year , the zoo got its first elephant : a female named Cookie .
" The acquisition of Cookie was the first significant effort to involve the entire Denver community in the zoo 's future , to get Denver citizens to make a direct financial contribution and an emotional commitment to the zoo , " wrote Carolyn and Don Etter in The Denver Zoo .
Indeed , Cookie debuted to record crowds .
In 1959 , the zoo added a second elephant named Candy and built the pair a new exhibit , dubbed the Pachyderm Habitat .
Though remodeled , it 's the same exhibit that stands today and is home to the zoo's two older , post - reproductive female elephants , Mimi and Dolly .
To Piper 's knowledge , Cookie , Candy , Mimi and Dolly are the only elephants who have ever lived at the Denver Zoo long - term .
But unlike the impact of Cookie 's arrival in Denver , Piper is n't banking on Asian Tropics to hugely increase zoo revenues or membership .
" I would love to think we 'll have more people come visit the zoo , but that 's not the driving force behind it , " he says .
" The driving force is to help elephants .
And certainly , the more people who come visit does help that cause , [ because ] it allows us to put more dollars in the coffers of our field conservation programs . "
The zoo has several such programs , including some that help native Asians co-exist with the elephants that sometimes raid their crops .
Still , Pond adds that Denverites should be proud to have such a rare and groundbreaking exhibit in their city : " Our 1.9 million guests are going to get the best elephant exhibit in the world as the result of this master plan . "
Asian Tropics will be built within the zoo 's existing footprint , on a boomerang - shaped piece of land on the zoo 's southern edge — sandwiched between Bird World and the existing yak exhibit .
The site stretches over ten of the zoo 's eighty acres .
Today the area houses hoofed animals , such as white - lipped deer and oxen , as well as mountain lions and Pallas 's cats , a type of wild Asian feline that looks like a stocky housecat .
Most of the animals currently on the site will be moved to other locations in the zoo once the exhibit opens , Piper says .
However , a few species , such as the bison that now occupy a space in the eastern part of the ten acres , will leave permanently .
They could be relocated to another zoo or used to start a new wild herd in Colorado .
The zoo will also lose its ankole cattle , African cattle that resemble Texas longhorns .
According to Piper , they were loaned to the zoo with the expectation that they would be returned once the new exhibit is built .
Asian Tropics will be home to three main species : the elephants , Malayan tapirs and Indian rhinos .
The rhinos are even more endangered than the elephants ; there are fewer than 3,000 left in the wild .
But crowd - pleasing elephants will be the centerpiece .
The zoo will build an 18,000 - square - foot elephant barn in the middle of the exhibit , complete with eight elephant stalls .
There will be a big communal space in the center , dubbed " the parlor . "
Visitors will be able to see into the parlor , which could be occupied at any time by any combination of compatible elephants , just hanging out .
The barn will be built stronger and the stalls tougher to accommodate the taller , heavier male elephants , zoo officials say .
The staff wo n't have direct physical contact with the bulls — a management technique proven to work with male elephants , in addition to other safety measures .
" The facility is designed very carefully to keep the animals where they belong and the staff where they belong , " Piper says .
He points out that animals who do stray from their area will often realize they are in unfamiliar surroundings and head back to their habitat on their own .
And there 's an emergency plan in place — as there are with all of the animals — in case an elephant stampedes .
Asian Tropics will have five outdoor habitats .
The three main species will rotate between them , while the exhibit 's smaller animals — including fishing cats , leopards and otters — will stay put .
On any given day , Mimi and Dolly could be in one habitat while a group of rowdy teenage boy elephants could be in another , within sniffing distance of some rhinos but separated by metal cables , a deep moat or a tall building .
Moving the animals from habitat to habitat ensures they wo n't get bored , Pond says , and allows visitors to be surprised .
" It 's not the rhino yard or the elephant yard , " he says .
" It 's the I - do n't - know - what - you 're - going - to - get - today , surprise - me yard . "
But even with plans for an intricate animal transfer system — including numerous walkways and gates , a public railroad - crossing - type path and an elevated elephant bridge — it can be tricky to make a male elephant budge , especially a male elephant in musth .
A bull in musth is like that drunk guy at the bar , says elephant behavioral researcher Bruce Schulte of Georgia Southern University .
He might not be the sharpest guy in the room or the biggest or the strongest , but after a half - dozen beers , nobody wants to find out .
" He 's sending signals to the males like , ' Hey , you might want to leave me alone , ' " Schulte says .
At the same time , " he 's sending signals to the females : ' Hey , I 'm the right guy .
I 've got the Corvette .
I 've got the best aftershave .
Come date me . ' "
Boy and girl elephants are different almost from the get - go .
While both are born into all - female herds , as youngsters , girls are more interested in playing house and helping to raise the babies , says Margaret Whittaker , who 's worked with elephants for eighteen years and is currently an animal behavior consultant in Texas .
Boys , on the other hand , are interested in playing rough .
They push and shove one another , playacting the sparring techniques that will help them establish dominance as adults .
Whereas females will live in the herd for the rest of their lives , males leave once they reach eight , nine or ten years old .
Or rather , their mothers kick them out because they keep trying to mount their aunties and cousins , says Ted Trujillo , the elephant manager at the Rio Grande Zoo in Albuquerque , New Mexico , which is home to a pair of bulls ages ten and eleven , one of whom has already been banished by the females .
" Then they 'll pair up with other bulls and learn the process of being a bull , " he says .
It 's in these wild bachelor herds that teenage bulls first go through something known as " moda musth . "
It 's like musth lite ; they secrete fluid from their glands but the smell is sweet , sort of like honey .
It lasts only for a day or two , and older bulls — those in real musth — do n't see the teenage bulls as a threat , because they know the ladies are n't interested .
" They 're kind of like humans , " Schulte says of female elephants .
" College girls are n't as likely to date eighth - grade boys . "
Real musth starts when males are in their twenties .
But scientists do n't know why it occurs .
It 's not needed for breeding , as males can impregnate females at any time .
And there does n't seem to be any rhyme or reason behind its unpredictable timing .
Different bulls go into musth at different times of the year for different lengths of time .
But scientists do know this :
When a bull is in musth , he breaks off from the bachelor group and goes off by himself to look for females .
When he 's successfully mated or when his musth wears off — another unexplained phenomenon — he 'll typically rejoin the group , though bulls tend to become more and more solitary as they get older .
Even if a bull manages to do the deed , there 's no guarantee he 'll become a father .
It 's not easy to get female elephants pregnant .
One reason is that they have a fourteen - to sixteen - week menstrual cycle , meaning they can only conceive once every four months .
Another is that pregnancy lasts 22 months , and when a mother gives birth to her 250 - pound baby , she nurses it for two to four years .
Only then is she ready for another go .
Age is also a barrier .
Researchers recently discovered that a female 's chances of getting pregnant drop off significantly if she has n't had her first baby by the time she 's in her early twenties .
On average , elephants live to be about sixty years old .
Males , on the other hand , seem to become more virile over time .
One theory is that musth is tied to an animal 's weight — it takes a lot of energy to get that worked up — and since Asian elephants continue to grow until they die , the biggest males have the biggest , baddest musths .
Though there 's some debate about whether females prefer males in musth , there 's no question that a musth male temporarily rises to the top of the boys '- club hierarchy , increasing his chances that the other bulls will step back and let him have first crack at the cows .
And pity the fool that gets in his way .
Researchers think the Hansel - and - Gretel - like trail of urine left behind by a musth male wherever he goes acts as a signal to other non-musth males to steer clear .
It 's only when a musth male comes across another musth male — especially one the same size and strength as him — that there could be trouble .
" When two musth males interact — and interact aggressively — in the wild , they 're fighting to the death , " says Joyce Poole , who has studied wild elephants in Africa and Asia for more than thirty years and is now the director of research and conservation for the nonprofit ElephantVoices .
She 's seen fights last for eight hours at a time , with the males clashing and backing off , clashing and backing off .
Sometimes an elephant will mortally wound another with his tusks .
Other times , one will forfeit and run away .
" If they do n't have the space to do that , one elephant could pin another against a fence or something and kill him , " Poole says .
And experts agree that in a group of eight male elephants , the chances that more than one will be in musth at any given time are pretty good .
" In a zoo setting , if you had multiple males in musth , it 's not going to be a fun day at work , " says Daryl Hoffman , curator of large animals at the Houston Zoo and the executive director of the Elephant Managers Association .
Bulls in musth are kept separately at the few U.S. zoos that have more than one .
Which , for those elephants , is no different than usual .
The behemoth Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida owns nine bulls , one of the largest collections in the U.S.
Five of them are considered " breeding bulls , " says Dennis Schmitt , the center 's chair of veterinary services and director of research .
Though they can see each other through fences and communicate by sound and smell , they do n't have any physical contact .
It 's the same at the Oregon Zoo in Portland , where 47 - year - old Packy , 38 - year - old Tusko and 26 - year - old Rama are all sometimes in musth at the same time , says zoo deputy director Mike Keele .
" We keep them apart because we 're afraid they 'll fight , " he says .
" It 's okay to tussle and establish dominance , but we'd be hard - pressed to stop bulls who weigh 12,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds from injuring each other . "
But there 's a difference between what those facilities do and what Denver plans to do .
The animals in Florida , Portland and a handful of other zoos were n't raised together .
It 's common for elephants to move from zoo to zoo throughout their lifetimes , and many do n't end up in a facility with another male until they 're adults , already set in their ways .
The Denver Zoo is hoping that by acquiring juvenile bulls , they 'll be able to socialize them young so that they 're used to one another .
Then , by the time they 're fully grown , they will have worked out a social hierarchy that will prevent dangerous fighting .
But large - animal curator Leeds still does n't know if the zoo will house musth males together .
" That 's one of the reasons I 'm so interested in doing this project that 's going to concentrate on males .
You 're asking questions now that people do n't know the answers to because they have n't had the opportunity to observe it . "
Leeds has an elephant - sized soft spot for the giant animals .
Although he's not a scientist , he can expound on the science of breeding , on subjects like male gametes and the luteinizing hormones that trigger ovulation in females .
He 's also passionate about the importance of coupling captive breeding with efforts to protect elephants in the wild .
He even has a tattoo on his left calf of a black - and - white African bull with huge tusks .
" I understand them , " he says .
" They understand me .
We get along well .
They have a lot of characteristics that are meaningful to me , like intelligence , loyalty , affection .
Things that I admire in people that I admire in them as well . "
He can tick off his favorite bulls like he 's naming old college buddies .
There 's
Packy , the tall , sweet bull , in Portland .
And " tough boy " Rajah in Florida .
And he 'll proceed with caution in Denver .
" It would be inappropriate , in my opinion , to keep adult males that are both in musth [ together ] , because at some point — again , using our kind of vague paradigm of following the natural history as close as possible — at some point , in the wild setting , somebody loses and goes away , " he says .
" You can't lose and go away here . "
Keele , who in addition to working at the Oregon Zoo is the keeper of the AZA Asian Elephant Studbook , which tracks all of the Asian elephants in North America , echoes Leeds .
" We do n't have experience doing this .
We 're going to do it together , " he says of Denver 's plan .
" What Denver could learn will be real valuable . "
And there 's certainly a lot to learn , both about bulls and breeding .
Despite recent advancements , the captive breeding of Asian elephants is far from an exact science .
Of the forty captive births that occurred between 1999 and February 2007 , only 23 babies survived , the studbook says .
Some were stillborn ; others succumbed to disease .
There is also some evidence that keeping captive males together suppresses their fertility .
The breeding plan for Denver 's bulls is flexible .
It could happen one of several ways : A bull could travel to a zoo where there is a breeding - age female ; a female could travel to Asian Tropics ; artificial insemination could be used ; or a bull could mate naturally with a breeding - age female living in Asian Tropics , a less likely scenario , but not out of the question .
Sending elephants cross country for breeding is pricey ; the last time the Denver Zoo sent one , in 2001 , it cost $ 10,200 , Barnhart says .
Denver is n't the only zoo building more space for bouncing baby boys .
Several other big zoos — including those in Los Angeles , San Diego and Washington , D.C. — are expanding their elephant exhibits , despite some outcry from animal - rights groups and other people who insist that no zoo is large enough to handle the world 's biggest land mammals .
Like Denver , those zoos are building both bull stalls and maternity stalls as well as setting aside space to do artificial insemination , just in case .
Asian Tropics is likely to cull its bulls from animals already in the U.S. ; importing them from overseas is expensive and frowned upon .
But zoo officials say it 's too early to determine which bulls will come to Denver , since the exhibit wo n't be finished until 2011 or 2012 .
In June , the zoo solicited bids from general contractors interested in building the exhibit .
They received ten responses and hope to choose a contractor by September .
" We 'll start construction as soon as we have that contractor in place , " Piper says .
" We 're ready to go . "
When it 's completed , the zoo's two current elephants , fifty - year - old Mimi and forty - year - old Dolly , will probably be the first to see it .
" I want to walk Mimi and Dolly from their current facility to Asian Tropics and see the excitement of them exploring that new habitat , first and foremost , " Piper says .
On a hot summer afternoon , it 's easy to see that Mimi and Dolly are among the Denver Zoo 's most popular attractions .
Kids in matching summer - camp T - shirts crowd around the fence that surrounds their exhibit , leaning over to watch as the lumbering ladies give themselves dust baths and try to shake treats from a giant ball suspended from a chain like an enormous Kong dog toy .
Fathers hold up babies , and old women in wheelchairs snap pictures .
At one point , Mimi turns her back to the visitors and starts to poop .
Kindergarteners ooh and aah as softball - sized turds fall in a heap on the ground .
Then she drenches the pile with a deluge of urine , like someone 's turned on a huge faucet .
" The elephant did pee-pee ! " one small girl cries , pointing at the wet pile .
" It looks like soda ! " a boy shrieks .
Piper and Barnhart , the zoo 's communications director , are standing nearby and do n't bat an eye .
To them , elephant poop is mundane , the stuff of everyday life .
Instead , they prefer to envision what it will be like when there 's an entire exhibit full of majestic bulls .
" Asian Tropics is an exhibit like no other in terms of being able to see , potentially , a large group of bulls together , " Piper says .
But not everything about that scenario could be described as " majestic . "
Visitors will be able to smell musth and maybe witness a boy - on - boy tussle .
Or perhaps , if the zoo ever hosts a female of breeding age , catch a glimpse of some late - afternoon lovemaking .
And they 'll most definitely be treated to a gander at an elephant penis , up to four feet long , twelve inches wide and shaped like an S .
But then , the Denver Zoo has the balls to handle it .

Gordon Brown on his proposal to house single mothers in state - run supervised homes
September was an exceptionally rough month for many mothers .
They took a further beating at the hands of the state with the Labour Party ’s stultified attempts to kick into motion its lumbering electoral machine , in the mad rush to outdo the Conservative Party ’s social conservatism .
During his mid September speech to the TUC on spending cuts the Prime Minister revealed that New Labour had decided to drop its manifesto pledge to increase paid maternity leave for mothers to one year .
In a qualification to this decision Gordon Brown added that this would be counter - balanced by granting fathers the right to take three months of paid paternity leave during the second six months of their child ’s life .
This was on the condition that the mother returned to work .
Following this announcement Brown proceeded to make a pronounced and very hostile attack on teenage mothers during his keynote speech at the Labour Party conference .
The scale and seriousness of this attack can be seen as a new departure in the state ’s attempt to control female reproduction , and to penalise and control some of society ’s most vulnerable women .
In a lengthy and wide - ranging description of the chaos being wreaked on British society by teenage mothers , Brown announced that “ from now on all 16 and 17 year old parents who get support from the taxpayer will be placed in a network of supervised homes ” .
He added that the purpose of “ these shared homes will offer not just a roof over their heads , but a new start in life where they learn responsibility and how to raise their children properly ” .
Brown described himself as addressing a problem which for “ too long has gone unspoken , the number of children having children ” .
( Perhaps the Prime Minister has never perused the pages of recent Tory - convert Sun newspaper , nor indeed the Daily Mail , Evening Standard , and Daily Telegraph publications , which regularly adorn their pages with stories of these disastrous mothers ) .
Brown described his ‘ family intervention projects ’ as a ‘ tough love ’ policy measure designed to address “ tough social questions ” .
He then proceeded to describe these single parents as a key example of those nefarious members of society “ who will talk about their rights , but never accept their responsibilities ” .
For Brown the public were not really angry with the bankers and politicians “ who have lost the people ’s trust ” .
No , he said , the truth was that the “ decent hard working majority feel the odds are stacked in favor of a minority ” those “ who let their kids run riot ” and “ play by different rules or no rules at all ” .
Having identified the proper source of society ’s breakdown and general disorder , Brown went onto reassure us that he was “ not prepared to accept ” this state of affairs “ as simply a part of life ” .
His remedy of state homes for teenage mothers would “ stop anti-social behaviour , slash welfare dependency and cut crime ” and provide a “ no nonsense approach with help for those who want to change and proper penalties for those who do n’t or won’t ” .
The extent to which this new social policy is more than a vague election - season sound bite is unclear .
However , whether an impending active policy or not , Brown ’s protracted sermonising on the scourge of teenage pregnancy and his state interventions to reform these women is astonishing for its reactionary rhetoric and social conservatism .
When using the term ‘ reactionary ’ in the context of New Labour one usually makes Thatcherite comparisons .
The context in which Brown ’s proposals for remedying these problem women and the catastrophic affect he describes them having on British society , can properly be located however in the sixteenth century .
The origins of the system of workhouses governed by the principles of the Poor Law originated in the Elizabethan era .
There followed a few centuries development of penal measures designed to punish poverty by instituting a regime of ‘ less eligibility ’ and harsh work in penal institutions as a condition of subsistence aid .
How this history of Poor Law legislation dealt with young single and homeless mothers is a complicated story .
However it is useful to briefly recount this history in order for us to understand the extent to which Brown ’s policy of ‘ family interventions ’ and state homes represents something truly retrograde .
The placement of single women expecting children in reformatories and penitentiaries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was heavily indebted to the work of the Church .
The purpose of these ‘ homes ’ was to punish sin , reform , and rehabilitate ‘ fallen women ’ .
Their descendants – the ‘ mother and baby homes ’ of the post - 1945 period – continued to be a last resort for women turned out by their families and unlikely to acquire social housing , well into the 1960s .
Young women were sent to these homes during their pregnancy and then on the birth of the child ( who was usually adopted ) they were sent back to their families .
These institutions began to fade out when women were given access to Council Housing under the Homeless Persons Act of 1977 .
Here for the first time Local Councils , which had previously rejected the applications of single mothers for housing , were told to give priority to a demographically growing number of homeless young mothers .
This change of policy under the Labour government of Callaghan represented a less penal attitude towards young single mothers .
This began to change again with increased social alarm and opprobrium for the issue of teenage pregnancy , which emerged in the eighties and with increasing vituperation in the nineties .
Brown is clearly drawing on the most draconian traditions of British social policy deriving his inspiration from the workhouses , and the penal and moral reformatories previously run by the Church .
This history is being drawn upon to inform his party ’s vision of a new Modern Britain .
The Labour party ’s self - styled definition of its purpose in politics is to provide “ fairness : fair rules , fair chances and a fair say for everyone ” .
The New Labour government ’s general approach to questions of women and social and economic policy has undoudtely been influenced by the goals of a very weak but nonetheless ‘ liberal ’ feminism , which espouses a vision of a fairer society in which women are empowered by the state to labour under capitalism on ‘ equal ’ terms with male workers .
This of course represents the culmination of the policies of Workfare - style welfare which were readily adopted by the Blair government and have continued under Brown to uphold an emphasis on the absolute priority of ensuring women return to work and labour in the economy , in order to negate any possible welfare dependence .
What is clear in Brown ’s attack upon mothers is that for the state human reproduction is only to be permitted if it is combined with a proper execution of wage labour in the market .
The more one reads Brown and the Labour Party ’s rhetoric concerning the outrage that teenage mothers pose to society , the more obvious it is that the reason these women are the subject of such contempt , is that they represent a deviation from the norm of economic production , which women are now more than ever expected to uphold .
Any deviation from the standard trajectory of the young in society from education into the job market represents a betrayal of their duty to work under capitalism .
For New Labour such a betrayal of vision and responsibility can only be rectified by their and their baby ’s institutionalisation in state homes .

David Cameron is facing a grassroots campaign that looks set to scupper his plans of boosting the number of Tory women MPs by imposing all - women shortlists .
The Tory leader provoked a furious backlash from his party 's membership and backbenchers last week after announcing that he had reversed his opposition to the policy , used by Labour to increase its number of female MPs since 1997 .
He said that he would impose the all - women lists in some constituencies in which the sitting MP announced , after 1 January , that they were stepping down .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Cameron has been worried that high - quality women candidates have been failing to win safe seats , despite current rules demanding that at least 50 per cent of all shortlists must be made up of women .
Several female candidates favoured by Conservative Central Office , such as healthcare expert Julia Manning , who failed to win the right to represent Bracknell recently , are still waiting for a parliamentary seat .
However , campaigners now hope to sidestep the threat of all - women lists by writing to the 161 Conservative MPs who have not yet announced whether or not they will stand at the next election , urging them to do so before the end of the year .
It could block Mr Cameron from imposing any all - women lists before the next election .
Jonathan Isaby , the co-editor of the Tory members ' website ConservativeHome , who sent out the letters yesterday , said he had launched the campaign to " ensure that their associations do not have to select under the restrictive by - election rules " , which dictate that the CCO can impose a shortlist containing three or four names on local parties .
The Arctic has warmed as a result of climate change , despite the Earth being farther from the sun during summer months
Warming as a result of increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has overwhelmed a millennia - long cycle of natural cooling in the Arctic , raising temperatures in the region to their highest for at least 2,000 years , according to a report .
The Arctic began to cool several thousand years ago as changes in the planet 's orbit increased the distance between the sun and the Earth and reduced the amount of sunlight reaching high northern latitudes during the summer .
But despite the Earth being farther from the sun during the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice , the Arctic summer is now 1.2C warmer than it was in 1900 .
Writing in the US journal Science , an international team of researchers describe how thousands of years of natural cooling in the Arctic were followed by a rise in temperatures from 1900 which accelerated briskly after 1950 .
The warming of the Arctic is more alarming in view of the natural cooling cycle , which by itself would have seen temperatures 1.4C cooler than they are today , scientists said .
" The accumulation of greenhouse gases is interrupting the natural cycle towards overall cooling , " said Professor Darrell Kaufman , a climate scientist at Northern Arizona University and lead author of the study .
" There 's no doubt it will lead to melting glacier ice , which will impact on coastal regions around the world .
Warming in the region will also cause more permafrost thawing , which will release methane gas into the atmosphere , " he added .
Scientists fear that warming could release billions of tonnes of methane from frozen soils in the Arctic , driving global temperatures even higher .
On a tour of the Arctic this week , UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged nations to support a comprehensive accord to limit greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the organisation 's climate summit in Copenhagen in December .
The accord has been drawn up as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
The latest study comes months after scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) warned that within the next 30 years Arctic sea ice is likely to vanish completely during the summer for the first time .
Kaufman and his colleagues reconstructed a decade - by - decade record of the Arctic climate over the past 2,000 years by analysing lake sediments , ice cores and tree rings .
Computer simulations of changes in seasonal sunlight levels caused by the Earth 's elliptical orbit and the shifting tilt of its axis verified the long - term cooling trend .
The scientists showed that summer temperatures in the Arctic fell by an average of 0.2C every thousand years , but that this cooling was swamped by human - induced warming in the 20th century .
" This study provides a clear example of how increased greenhouse gases are now changing our climate , ending at least 2,000 years of Arctic cooling , " said Caspar Ammann , a climate scientist and co-author of the report at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado .
The Arctic began cooling around 8,000 years ago as natural variations in the Earth 's orbit and angle of tilt reduced the amount of sunlight reaching high latitudes .
Today , the planet is one million kilometres farther away from the sun during the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice than it was in 1BC .
This natural cooling effect will continue for 4,000 more years .
Previous research has shown that temperatures over the past century rose nearly three times as fast in the Arctic as elsewhere in the northern hemisphere .
This is due to an effect called Arctic amplification , whereby highly reflective sea ice and snow melt to reveal darker land and sea water , which absorb sunlight and warm up more quickly .
The federal Department of Education sketched out a new nationwide competition on Tuesday under which some 2,700 school districts and nonprofit groups are expected to compete for pieces of a $ 650 million innovation fund .
The department already has the 50 states vying for chunks of a $ 5.4 billion education improvement fund that it calls Race to the Top ; the innovation fund is a separate competition .
Federal officials said the Investing in Innovation Fund would be distributed in three categories .
Small development grants of up to $ 5 million will support new , unproven ideas that seem worth exploring , they said .
Validation grants of up to $ 30 million will support existing programs that have shown evidence that they can work .
Scale - up grants of up to $ 50 million will go to programs that have developed a strong track record for improving student achievement , the officials said .
Congress approved financing for the innovation fund almost as an asterisk when it approved $ 100 billion in federal education aid under the stimulus program in February .
But Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says it could be a powerful lever for improving achievement .
Serious games coverage on TV ?
“ As rare as tartan clouds ” was how Charlie Brooker put it the night his one off episode of GamesWipe was due to air .
Whilst the backwaters of BBC 4 might seem a long way from primetime to some , it ’s as far as any other TV programme attempting to discuss , not attack , games in a sensible fashion for a mature audience has managed to come so far .
Thanks to the wonders of YouTube , you can catch it yourself even if you ’re outside the British Isles .
Hit the jump for a link to the video , impressions and why gaming needs more of this kind of coverage .
Being a fan of Charlie Brooker following an introduction to the precursors ScreenWipe and NewsWipe , I have to admit to initially being a little bit disappointed in Gameswipe at first .
On reflection however , this may have been more a product of high expectations .
A keen gamer and past writer for British mag PC Zone , he starts with a lot more credibility than many of the attempts before him .
The prospect of him bringing his trademark satrical scorn to a medium where it ’s generally sorely lacking was a tantalizing prospect to an audience of enthusiast gamers .
If only because we know he ’s fully capable of pulling it off .
That we did n’t quite get that should n’t really have been a surprise .
Producer Al Campbell suggested beforehand the show would be aimed at gamers and non-gamers alike and Brooker ’s “ tartan clouds ” quip above is all too true , something doubly emphasized in the show itself .
For many people , real controversy in video games began with Hot Coffee .
Perhaps
Manhunt if you ’re from the UK or if you ’re old enough , Carmageddon .
Whilst many have questioned the focus on some of the negative aspects of games in the show , the sheer variety of archive footage of news of “ concerns ” about video games was surprising even to me .
All of this was suitably lampooned in a subtle way of course and with the usual pop at Fox News presenter Glen Beck to boot .
That this would be a one - off requiring such a broad focus likely factored in to the show ’s history of video game genre ’s structure .
Whilst this might have been less interesting to some , I found the trip down memory lane to be a very relevant one .
From old programmes such as the Patrick Moore starring Games Master to classics like Battlezone interspersed with that however were some real gems .
The first of which was a short segment from stand up comic Dara O’Brien that was both genuinely funny and valid point at the same time .
No doubt , some gamers on forums might be mocking his inability to see Manhattan in GTA : IV or get past the Beserker in Gears of War but that does n’t make his jibe at the somewhat arbitary challenges games often put in front of the player preventing them from accessing the content they ’ve paid for any less worthwhile .
The industry often waxes lyrical about wanting to “ expand the gaming audience ” .
A noble endeavor for sure but not everybody wants their entry point to games to be some party game compilation on the Wii .
In any event , for a stand up comedian to be poking fun at games without resorting to cliche he can arguably be cut a little slack .
Even better though was Graham Linehan ’s lament and theory as to why the vast majority of video game stories are sub par .
The main thrust of his criticism was a lack of book reading amongst game developers and for me there is at least some mileage in that .
Without picking on them myself ( and hey , I have n’t read a fiction book for years either so guilty as charged ) it is quite obvious thinking about it how many of Rockstar ’s games are so very much influenced by films .
Certainly the GTA & Red Dead series though I might offer something like Bully that is arguably less so .
Undeniably vast swathes of the games industry display an inferiority complex in the face of the silver screen .
Many games often falling over themselves to become “ more cinematic ” and this is n’t always a good thing .
Linehan did reserve some well deserved praise for the likes of Left 4 Dead which of course has huge film influences within but managed to draw inspiration from other sources as well as combine them superbly into the game play itself , not cutscenes .
Though I ’d not heard of him before , he seemed an interesting guy .
I ’d like to hear his take on the likes of Bioshock and whilst stories in games are n’t simply going to improve if everybody starts reading more books the industry might do well to hire someone like him who seems to have a good grasp of things as opposed to the usual pop -novel authors when trying to improve the narrative in their games .
Whilst never truly letting go ( perhaps somewhat compromised by being on our side and wanting to show the positive side of games )
Brooker ’s trademark cynicism still manifested throughout in small doses .
Neither 50 Cent nor his latest game 50 Cent : Blood on the Sand were spared from piercing cynicism ( though why he did n’t pick on the even more ridiculous first game is beyond me ) .
The latest Wolfenstein got off a bit more lightly but as far as reviews go was just as spot on in my opinion as well .
It probably has n’t had a reviewer claim to imagine every Nazi soldier ’s backstory before dispatching gruesomely either .
Edgy perhaps , but Brooker at his best and whilst a strange choice of “ reviews ” in this show that did n’t sit 100 % comfortably in the format they still worked and bodes well for a regular slot for new game releases in his other shows .
So was GamesWipe a success ?
A sizable audience of 361,000 on the BBC ’s forth channel would suggest so .
Apparently a bigger number than for his usual fair .
For a good portion of Tuesday ’s night GamesWipe was a trending topic on Twitter , much of the commentary positive and still flowing even now .
It ’s fair to say of course that not everything came off .
I found the song about MadWorld ’s violence to be as self - indulgent as it was awful and surprised a two minute “ arty ” video of the female vocalist was something Brooker would tolerate .
Not to mention , Madworld ’s absurdly over - the - top violence has one tongue firmly in it ’s cheek and knows it .
The much lauded Rab and Ryan from BBC2 ’s ConsoleVania gave a predictable whine about “ how games were better in the old days ” which missed its mark with me also .
Minor gripes and metrics asides though , the Guardian ’s Chris Moran sums it up nicely when he says that “ GamesWipe made games on TV seem normal ” which is fair to say almost nothing before it has achieved .
With a nod to Zero Punctuation ’s Ben Yahtzee ( himself a big fan of Brooker and unfortunately unable to quite make a planned appearance happen this time ) games coverage that is somewhere in between the gushing PR fueled previews and the overblown hysteria of the forums is important and needs to be encouraged .
Not many are able to take something down a peg or two quite so savagely as Charlie Brooker and when we ’re not getting over - defensive in the face of the traditional media attacks on our hobby it ’s exactly the kind of critique gaming needs .
More please BBC .
If you have n’t already done so , I ’d encourage you to echo that request here .
AT&T , the exclusive carrier of the iPhone in the U.S. , has spoken out against recent statements by the Federal Communications Commission chairman in favor of Net neutrality .
While AT&T supports the principles outlined Monday by Chairman Julius Genachowski for broadband access , the nation 's second - largest wireless carrier reportedly does not have the same feeling for the cellphone market — something Genachowski also mentioned in his speech Monday .
In a new report from CNet , an AT&T spokesman is quoted as saying that wireless networks are different from broadband because bandwidth is limited .
" We are concerned , however , that the FCC appears ready to extend the entire array of Net neutrality requirements to what is perhaps the most competitive consumer market in America : wireless services , " Jim Cicconi , AT&T 's senior vice president of external and legislative affairs , reportedly said .
Joining AT&T in showing concern toward Genachowski's remarks was Verizon .
A company spokesperson said some of the goals outlined in the FCC chairman 's remarks could have " unintended consequences . "
As exclusive agreements like the one between AT&T and Apple for the iPhone have gained more attention , the FCC has begun an investigation into the matter at the request of members of the U.S. Senate .
In response , Verizon agreed to unlock some exclusive phones for use on smaller wireless carriers in rural areas .
The FCC 's concern in the matter has been with some smaller markets where major carriers do not offer service .
Because the iPhone is exclusive to AT&T , a customer would be unable to obtain the device in an area where AT&T does not provide coverage .
The Rural Cellular Association , a group of smaller tier II and tier III wireless carriers , lobbied members of the U.S. Senate for their cause .
The association has argued that their inability to provide their customers with some of the most popular mobile handsets and smartphones makes it difficult for them to compete , especially in markets where their coverage does overlap with some of the big tier I operators .
" There are markets in the country where if you wanted an iPhone , if you wanted a Pre , you just couldnât get it — from anyone , " Genachowski said in July .
" So one question is , is that consistent with broad consumer interests ? "
In addition , the FCC has also begun an investigation into wireless carrier competition .
The commission has said its goal is to increase competition , innovation and consumer protection in the market .
In August , the FCC released a number of official notices of inquiry , announcing investigations designed to look into wireless innovation and investment , mobile wireless competition , and additional opportunities to protect and empower consumers in the communications marketplace .
The FCC has also shown interest in Apple 's App Store approval process .
Apple , Google and AT&T all responded to an inquiry initiated after the Google Voice application was not accepted into the iPhone App Store .
When I was a child , my mother would take my sister and I to Wasaga Beach on the shores of Georgian Bay during the summer months .
It ’s the longest fresh - water beach in the world and during Canadian summers it becomes a metropolis of tourists and fun-seekers from all over the province and beyond .
The main beach hosts a strip mall of over - priced beach - themed shops , ice cream vendors , live music venues and – once upon a time – even a huge water slide setup .
Our yearly trips up were one of the highlights of my summer – as a young child I built sand castles , read bad fiction and went swimming ; as an adolescent I basically girl - watched all day .
Unfortunately , my mother ’s work schedule only permitted us to go up on a given weekend that usually had to be planned well in advance .
Sometimes we got lucky and we ’d pick a weekend that turned out to be perfect weather – sun shining , not a cloud in the sky , whatever you like .
But often , as is typical , the weather would crap out and we’d be stuck sitting around on a largely - deserted beach , waiting for the rain to start that would signal “ time to go home ” , because swimming in a large body of water during a lightning storm is n’t intelligent no matter how you look at it .
Us kids would always be disappointed if we saw dark clouds on the horizon during the drive up because it meant a short day trip , but my mother would repeat this old adage to remind us there ’s basically nothing we can do :
“ Whether the weather be sunny , or whether the weather be not , whether the weather be cold , or whether the weather be hot , we ’ll weather the weather , whatever the weather , whether we like it or not . ”
This was scant consolation to a couple of children eager to hit the beach for a day of summer fun , and being the avid science fiction fan I was , I longed for the day when we ’d live in a Star Trek world where the weather was monitored and regulated by giant computers .
On some level , the weather was the only thing left in nature we could n’t control : we had medications to combat disease , our tools of production allowed us to live through the droughts and famines that killed off our ancestors , and of course being at the top of the food chain eliminated the concern we might walk out our front doors and get eaten by a pack of wolves or something .
A weather - control system would invalidate nature ’s last major stranglehold on humanity , I reasoned , and would finally crown us true masters of the Earth .
When I got a little older and started learning more about the world ’s incredibly complex ecosystem I realized how boneheaded this idea was : we just do n’t know enough about how and why the weather works to wrest control of it away from nature and expect things to continue along as they have been .
Philosopher Daniel Quinn called this sort of thinking the “ Taker ” mentality ; the idea that we know better than nature how the planet should be run is precisely the line of thinking that ’s landed us in the ecological pickle we ’re in today .
Fact is , we ’re just not that smart , and fiddling with vast powers we do n’t fully understand is tantamount to giving a toddler a loaded pistol .
Sooner or later , something tragic is bound to happen .
Which is why , when Rachel ( one of my myriad correspondents ) sent me this story this morning , I was deeply disturbed and shoved even more deeply into my foxhole of disgust at the people I ’m supposed to refer to as fellow citizens of our planet .
For those of you who do n’t want to read through the article ( and frankly , I would n’t blame you ) , turns out Moscow ’s Mayor Yury Luzhkov has decided the people of his fair city have had enough of snow , so he ’s pledged to ensure there will be no snow in Moscow this year .
Just … take a minute and roll that around your brain .
He ’s going to stop it from snowing .
Say it with me , and then tell me what ’s wrong with that sentence .
Yury Luzhkov is going to stop the snow .
Can we all take a moment and appreciate what a patently bad idea this is ?
If you still have n’t read the article , here is another gem :
“ For just a few million dollars , the mayor ’s office will hire the Russian Air Force to spray a fine chemical mist over the clouds before they reach the capital , forcing them to dump their snow outside the city . ”
Chemical mist ?
Leaving aside the obvious concern that the Russian Air Force can be routinely hired for missions of this type by a civilian organization , is there anyone , anywhere who thinks that spraying chemical mist into the sky is in any way , shape or form a good idea ?
In Jeff ’s words , this is “ another great idea from the people who brought you Chernobyl ” .
And while I do n’t share his distrust of nuclear power , I can certainly see where he ’s coming from – this has disaster written all over it .
It gets better : this is n’t the first time Luzhkov has pulled the God card .
During his tenure as mayor , he forwarded a plan to reverse the flow of the River Ob to help irrigate Siberia and related nations .
Scientists told him it could n’t be done , thankfully , and I can just imagine how that conversation went .
( How , exactly , would one go about reversing the flow of one of the largest rivers on the continent ?
I imagined some kind of Swiss - Family - Robinson Rube - Goldberg device employing pulleys , winches and very large buckets . )
This time around , Luzhkov is aware of the science involved in his plan – a science that ’s been proven to work both in Russia and elsewhere .
During the Beijing Olympics , Chinese authorities intended to use a similar process to curb torrential rains in the general region where the games ’ opening ceremonies were to be held .
They used almost eleven thousand artillery weapons and rocket launchers to “ seed ” the clouds with silver iodide – a move designed to make the clouds drop their loads of rain well before they reached the capital city .
Okay , to be fair then , I ca n’t actually claim the Chinese or the Russians are actually stopping precipitation ; they ’re just causing to fall elsewhere .
That does n’t really make it better .
In fact , in a lot of ways it could be worse .
Think about it this way : ever heard of the Butterfly Effect ?
No , I ’m not talking about the Ashton Kutcher disaster of a few years ago ; I ’m talking about the philosophical concept the movie was ostensibly based upon .
Basically , it ’s a pithy metaphor : the flap of a butterfly ’s wings somewhere in North America , say , could conceivably lead to a typhoon in Southeast Asia .
The point is everything is interconnected and reliant upon everything else .
Meddling with nature has proven time and time again to produce results we can’t expect , control or prepare for .
Many schools of thought suggest that human influence on this planet ’s delicate , complex ecosystem has led to severe changes in weather patterns and climate as it is .
Part of Luzhkov ’s reasoning for this brilliant plan of his is , in addition to taking the strain of snow removal off the backs of Moscow city workers , the additional precipitation in the surrounding areas would lead to a “ bigger harvest ” in the agricultural zones .
He told a farmer ’s organization ( with great zeal , I might add ) :
“ It will make financial sense ! ”
Great idea , Yury .
It will make financial sense until your renegade poison clouds dump silver iodide rain all over your fields , causing mass flooding and genetic mutations in your potatoes , turning the vodka made from those potatoes into some kind of super - soldier serum that will turn every Stoli - swilling native of the Moscow suburbs into a drunken X - Man .
What ?
Oh , you want to see proof of my vast , sweeping prophecies ?
I ’m sorry Yury , but that ’s not my job because I ’m not the nutcase who wants to spray chemical cocktails into the sky so he does n’t have to shovel his front step in January .
The burden of proof is on you if you want to go through with this cockamamie scheme of yours .
Changing the world ’s weather for your own gain ?
You ’re like a bad James Bond villain .
Congratulations for living into the Russian Bad Guy stereotype , and for being the most ill - informed individual on Earth on the subject of environmental science .
Somebody please stop this guy , because nobody should be monkeying with the weather for any reason whatsoever , whether Yury likes it or not .

A new exhibition marking the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's work is set to open in the Vatican .
The Catholic Church once labelled Galileo , now regarded as modern astronomy 's founding father , a heretic .
He was tried for challenging the widely held belief that the Sun travelled around the Earth .
Nicolas Copernicus did much ground - breaking work on the link between the Sun and the Earth , but it was Galileo 's instruments that proved the theory .
It was not until 1992 that Pope John Paul II declared that the Church 's ruling was an error and that Catholics were not hostile to science .
Now a selection of Galileo 's instruments - along with those of other key figures in astronomy - is being put on display in the Vatican .
There will also be some of Galileo 's original documents in which he excitedly recorded his first discoveries .
The exhibition runs until January .

The music video game genre has been in a profound slump this year , with sales down 46 % so far , according to the NPD Group .
Part of that is due to the recession , of course , but part of it may be waning consumer interest in Guitar Hero and Rock Band .
The games ' publishers , Activision Blizzard and MTV Networks ( owned by Viacom ) have seen the impact on their bottom lines and are taking big steps to shake up their businesses as a result .
As a story in today 's Times explains , the biggest change comes in the form of The Beatles : Rock Band , a risky bet worth tens of millions of dollars in royalties alone .
But as MTV launches the game with its distribution partner , it 's also implementing a new strategy :
Flee the hardware business .
Sure , there 's a limited - edition , $ 250 hardware package , but quantities are limited .
And there 's a $ 160 " value bundle " featuring original Rock Band hardware that MTV is eager to get rid of .
If you 're new to music video games and want controllers for The Beatles : Rock Band , MTV has a preferred solution : Buy Guitar Hero .
“ The opportunities around hardware are really limited , ” said Scott Guthrie , general manager of MTV Games .
“ We are getting into a focus on software and [ downloadable song ] revenue streams . ”
MTV Games senior vice president of electronic games and music Paul DeGooyer puts it even more abruptly : “ Let others take on the burden of getting those super - tight margin instruments out there . "
The " others , " of course , is really one company , Activision Blizzard .
And its CEO Bobby Kotick admits it 's time for a change as well .
I have a much larger post in me about my friend Alan , but I had an interesting thought this morning that I felt I had to share , especially with the Libertarians on my list .
For all the liberals decry our healthcare system , as much as they complain that we 're the only industrialized nation without Universal Healthcare , I have good news : we HAVE Universal Healthcare .
Wait , what 's that ?
What are you talking about ?
No we do n't !
Yes , we do .
There is already a government - run healthcare plan in this country .
Let me explain .
On Thursday , Alan texted me that he needed help .
He was horribly sick , he'd been throwing up all day , he could n't keep food down , his stomach was in terrible pain .
I rushed home and told him that I was taking him to the emergency room .
We took a taxi to our local hospital 's E.R. , and after seeing him briefly they admitted him .
They ran several tests but everyone had the same basic guess what the outcome would be .
And they were right - appendicitis .
Fortunately , his appendix had n't ruptured , so it was a pretty simple lathroscopic surgery .
We spent the night , and then one more night , while they observed and he healed from the wound .
Now , add it up .
E.R. visit , tests , CAT Scan for the appendicitis , anesthesia , surgery , more tests , a two - day hospital visit , lots of hospital food , lots more tests .
How much do you think that cost him ?
Answer : nothing .
It did n't cost him a dime .
Why ?
Because he has no health insurance , but also because he has no job .
He 's freelance consulting right now , and what little money he gets is instantly eaten away .
And when I explained that to hospital billing , they smiled and said " Oh , ok , no problem .
We 'll just bill Medicaid . "
That 's right , remember Medicaid ?
The government program for medical funding of people with no or limited resources ?
They 're paying Alan 's hospital bill in full .
And that 's the thing : no hospital in this country will refuse a seriously sick patient , whether they can pay or not .
And when they can't pay , the hospital requests and receives a reimbursement from Medicaid .
And that means YOU'RE paying for Alan 's appendectomy , and the thousands of other surgeries and complicated procedures that hospitals perform every week on patients who can't afford them .
So , Libertarians , it 's time to stop thinking of this as a battle against Universal Healthcare .
It 's time to stop complaining about the horrors of Socialized Medicine and how it 'll f*ck everything up .
You lost that battle in 400 BC when the Hippocratic Oath was written , and you have been paying for poor people to get medical treatment ever since .
You need to start thinking about this as a battle to make Universal Healthcare cost you less in taxes .
The question you need to ask is this : would you rather pay $ 40,000 for Alan 's hospital weekend because he has absolutely no coverage ; or would you rather pay $ 10,000 because while he WAS working he , and you , were paying into a more concrete Universal Healthcare system that ultimately drove down those costs for everyone involved ?

Few things in this world seen on the big screen can compare to the absolute thrills and chills of the Horror Movie .
Where else can you feel cold shivers arc down your spine while witnessing some deranged , screwed - up homicidal maniac slaughtering a crew of innocent bystanders … well , aside from the 6 - o’ clock news I mean ?
Yeah , nowhere , that ’s the answer I was getting at .
So it only stands to reason that any attempt to copy said terror can either fall on one side or the other of the proverbial cinematic Sword of Damocles .
How about absurdly acted and painfully viewed amateur reenactments done in a high school kid ’s basement ?
Generally rather shitty .
What about costumed farm animals performing a rendition of Sleep - A - Way Camp in the meadow ?
I ’d watch that .
But , perhaps the most awesome way to show homage to the horror movie is to animate it … with LEGO .
Yeah , now that , folks , kicks ass .
Now sit back , grab a building set of your favorite Space Ship blocks , and watch ten of our favorite Stop - Motion LEGO Horror parodies .
The Exorcist ( Preview )
This one makes use of Regan ’s ( Linda Blair ) actual hideous voice from the movie .
You can follow the You Tube links to the actual ‘ movie ’ of this , I was unfortunately unable to embed it .
Jaws
This one is done by one guy doing all the voices .
I especially like Quinn ’s accent here .
As you can see , the kid knows his literature .
And the homemade shark is a very nice touch .
Hellraiser
This homage to the Clive Barker classic is very well done for how short it is .
The hand - crafted Cenobites are a very nice touch , as well .
The Thing ( Parts 1 and 2 )
Yes , the high - pitched voices are pretty irritating , and the make - shift vehicles are a little shoddy , but what it lacks in those departments , it more than makes up for in the fantastic creature effects .
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
I like the gritty feel that matches the ‘ grindhouse ’ style of the film .
The van is a nice touch , and so is the splattered kitty .
I hate cats .
Saw ( Movie Preview )
Once again the creator uses actual voices from the movie , a practice I think is far better than trying to emulate them .
This one has a great printed mini-mask of Jigsaw , too .
Nightmare on Elm Street
Dark ?
Check .
Dirty ?
Double Check .
A kick - ass set of homemade gloves for Freddy ?
Super Check .
Friday the 13th
Though this one strays from the film a bit , and is pretty well flooded with recorded screams and silly , unnecessary jump - cuts , I really do like what the creator did with this .
Yeah , it ’s not Jason ’s mask , but the original burlap sack - come - LEGO knight ’s helmet is pretty funny .
Dawn of the Dead ( Parts 1 and 2 )
This is an homage to the remake that came out a few years ago and uses recorded dialog from the same .
For some odd reason , LEGO has either not released an African American head , or this guy just did n’t have one on hand , as you ’ll see .
The mustaches and the Priest are classic .
Halloween ( Parts 1 - 5 )
These all seem to be a combination of both the Carpenter classic and the Zombie , um , not so classic , but what the author does , he does really well and manages to actually scare you ( well , you know ) a few times .
Very nicely done , indeed .

In the land of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie , it has fallen to a taxidermist to uncover whether foul play is to blame for the corpse found floating in a lake here late last month : Benson , the legendary 52 - pound carp whose untimely death has captivated a nation 's anglers .
For years , Benson was a catch - and - release attraction in Bluebell Lakes , a private fishing complex .
Benson was a normal - size carp when she was placed in Kingfisher Lake 16 years ago .
The lakes ' owner , Tony Bridgefoot , noticed Benson's ...
THE world 's best - known atheist , anti-religion campaigner Richard Dawkins , will visit Melbourne for the biggest ever atheist convention next March , organisers announced yesterday .
Other speakers include P. Z. Myers , who runs the world 's biggest science blog , philosophers Peter Singer and A.C. Grayling , former evangelical pastor Dan Barker , science journalist Robyn Williams , broadcaster Phillip Adams and Age columnist Catherine Deveny .
Atheist Foundation of Australia president David Nicholls said the conference at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre would be ''a history - making '' event .
'' We think Australia is ripe for something like this because there 's a lot of unhappiness , with atheists thinking they are not getting a fair cut of the pie , socially , psychologically or politically , '' Mr Nicholls said .
He said the conference was suggested by the Atheists ' Alliance International , which holds its annual atheist conventions in the United States and wanted to branch out .
But the $ 500,000 conference , from March 12 - 14 , would be funded solely by ticket sales , with speakers offering their services free .

Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful than many illegal drugs , including LSD , ecstasy and cannabis , according to a paper from a drugs expert .
Professor David Nutt , chairman of the government 's advisory committee on the misuse of drugs , criticised politicians for " distorting " and " devaluing " the research evidence in the debate over illicit drugs .
But he also said some " top " scientific journals had published " horrific examples " of poor quality research on the alleged harm caused by some illicit drugs .
The Imperial College professor argued for a new way of classifying the harm caused by both legal and illegal drugs .
" Alcohol ranks as the fifth most harmful drug after heroin , cocaine , barbiturates and methadone .
Tobacco is ranked ninth .
" Cannabis , LSD and ecstasy , while harmful , are ranked lower at 11 , 14 and 18 respectively , " said Nutt in the paper from the centre for crime and justice studies at King 's College , London published tomorrow .
Nutt clashed with Jacqui Smith when she was home secretary after he compared the 100 deaths a year from horseriding with the 30 deaths a year linked to ecstasy .
Smith also ignored the recommendation of Nutt 's advisory committee that cannabis should not be reclassified from class C back to class B , leading to heavier penalties .
He criticised Smith 's use of the " precautionary principle " to justify her decision to reclassify cannabis and said that by erring on the side of caution politicians " distort " and " devalue " the research evidence .
" This leads us to a position where people really do n't know what the evidence is , " he said adding that the initial decision to downgrade the classification of cannabis led to a fall in the use of the drug .
Nutt acknowledged there was a " relatively small risk " of psychotic illness linked to cannabis use .
But he argued that to prevent one episode of schizophrenia it would be necessary to " stop 5,000 men aged 20 to 25 from ever using " cannabis .
Nutt also renewed his support for reclassifying ecstasy from a class A drug to class B , saying the advisory committee " won the intellectual argument " over the issue but obviously did n't win the decision after the home secretary vetoed the move .
He said the quality of some research papers about cannabis and ecstasy was so poor the articles had to be retracted .
Richard Garside , director of the centre for crime and justice , said Nutt 's briefing paper gave an insight into what drugs policy might look like if it was based on the research evidence rather than political or moral positioning .
Protesters Rally Against Pastor 's ' Why I Hate Obama ' Sermon Arizona town stages ' love rally ' at church that prays for president 's death .
Sept. 7 , 2009  --
Members of an Arizona community are trying to counteract what they say is hate - speech seething in one of the town 's conservative churches .
About 100 protestersarrived at Tempe's Faithful Word Baptist Church on Sunday to demonstrate against controversial comments from its pastor , Steven L. Anderson .
The pastor delivered a sermon last month that was entitled , " Why I Hate Barack Obama , " and called on his parish to pray for the death of the president .
Anderson told ABC 's affiliate KNXV - TV in Phoenix that he received a phone call from the U.S. Secret Service after that August incident .
The so - called " Love Rally " outside Anderson 's church -- office space wedged between a pawn shop and a salon in a strip mall -- was organized by the People Against Clergy Who Preach Hate .
" It 's hard to believe we could have someone of a religious nature wishing our president was dead , " protester William Crumb told the ABC affiliate .
" I 'm just disgusted with this man who claims to be a minister of the Lord preaching hate toward the president , " protester Larry Crane said .
" I 'm sure you have plenty of footage from previous interviews you did with me , " Anderson told the KNXV television crews approaching him for comment Sunday .
" I 'm just a little tired right now . "
Anderson , 27 , is the father of five children and is a small business owner .
His wife Zsuzsanna home schools their children .
The day after Anderson 's sermon , one of his parishioners , Christopher Broughton , carried a loaded AR - 15 semiautomatic rifle and a handgun to a protest of Obama 's address to a veteran 's group .
Broughton said he was motivated not by his pastor but by a long - standing dislike for the president , but told The Associated Press he " absolutely " agreed with Anderson .
He was not arrested , as it is not illegal to openly carry a gun in Arizona .
In addition to what the protesters called hate sermons at the local church , Phoenix School Superintendent Tom Horne has voiced concern over Obama 's televised classroom speech planned for Tuesday .
Tempe , a suburban town outside Phoenix and home to Arizona State University , is a " somewhat liberal " community , according to local reporter Stephen Lemons , who had his own confrontation with the pastor later in the day after Sunday 's protest .
Lemons and Anderson argued after the reporter asked questions about the pastor 's other job , installing commercial fire alarms .
He also asked Anderson about an incident earlier this year when the pastor was tasered by border patrol .
On YouTube with large red marks across his forehead , Anderson said the Tasering incident occurred after he refused to answer a Yuma , Ariz . , border patrol agent 's questions when stopped .
Protesters Face Off Against Hate Speech
" He was talking weird stuff like the Jews killed Christ , " Lemons told ABCNews.com .
" I asked him what he meant and he freaked out .
After I asked him about why his business and church were at the same address , he flipped out then he got angry and touched me once . "
As for the community protest , " The crowd was fairly significant , " said Lemons , who writes the blog , Feathered Bastard for the Phoenix New Times , a weekly newspaper .
" It was n't a huge protest , but the fact that it got 100 people out on a Sunday morning on a long weekend , that 's pretty good , " he said .
" There is a lot of far - right crazies and Obama hatred , " said Lemons .
" A lot of people in this state do n't like Obama .
Phoenix today reminds me of Dallas prior to 1963 . "
Several of Anderson 's parishioners , who declined to identify themselves , defended their pastor 's sermons to ABC .
" I hate people that hate God , " said one Faithful Word parishioner .
" As far as I know we live in America , we have freedom of religion , freedom to assemble and the freedom of speech , " added another .
Protesters say they 'll continue to picket Faithful Word Baptist Church .
" I just think it 's sad , " Crane said .
" We can have discourse without preaching hate .
That 's what this minister is doing . "
BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
The days of being able to walk through airport security checkpoints while wearing shoes and a jacket could return if an experimental program proves successful , some Department of Homeland Security officials say .
Project officials hope various sensors , such as this one that tracks eye movement , can help security screeners .
The Homeland Security - funded project is Future Attribute Screening Technology , or FAST .
Instead of focusing on whether you have hidden explosives or whether you 're carrying a weapon , sensors and cameras located at security checkpoints would measure the natural signals coming from your body -- your heart rate , breathing , eye movement , body temperature and fidgeting .
Those physiological signs , measured together , will indicate whether you might have the desire or intent to do harm , project manager Robert Burns said .
" There 's been a large field of research that ties your physical reactions to your mental state , your emotional state .
We 're looking for those signals that your body gives off naturally , " Burns said .
Burns said the technology will pick up cues that may not be observed by a human and help security personnel decide more quickly whether to send someone to secondary screening for questioning .
Watch how the technology would work »
FAST could be used wherever there are special security concerns , including stadiums , convention centers , federal buildings , mass transit centers and airports .
Some critics question the viability of the project , saying it 's pie - in - the - sky science fiction .
Civil libertarians also charge it's an invasion of privacy .
Researchers demonstrated FAST to reporters last month at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Boston .
Actors walked into a room , where the various sensors measured their responses to a series of questions from a screener .
The questions included , " Is this the month of September ? " and " Do you plan to detonate an explosive ? "
Their responses were noted on individual graphs that indicated whether their physiological cues fell within normal ranges .
It 's taken about $ 20 million to develop the technology .
All but one of the sensors is commercially available .
One is a thermal imaging device that measures the temperature of a face .
A screener would look for temperature changes -- a possible stress response -- as a person is asked questions .
Another device , an eye tracker , follows a person 's gaze , checks the amount of blinking and measures pupil dilation .
Two of the machines track heart and respiratory rates .
They also measure the interval between heartbeats and how deeply one inhales .
And there is an improvised fidgeting monitor .
Researchers took a Wii balance board -- a device people stand on to interact with certain Nintendo Wii video games -- and altered it to show how someone 's weight shifts .
Studies are now under way to determine whether there is a level of fidgeting that would suggest the need for secondary screening .
A checkpoint screener would not look at the results individually , but would consider them together when deciding whether someone should be sent for questioning , Burns said .
And a screener would n't be targeting just people with elevated levels .
" We 're going to look for the elevation , but we 're also going to look for the absence of signals , which is just as indicative of being something that has to be resolved , " Burns said .
FAST researchers are encouraged by the results so far .
One of the researchers , Daniel Martin , says as each succeeding study becomes more real , the program is " doing significantly better than chance . "
Critics say that is not good enough .
" I have n't seen any research that shows that those measures from the autonomic nervous system ... measuring blood pressure , measuring breathing , measuring heat on the face , are at all related to intent , " said Stephen Fienberg , professor of statistics and social sciences at Carnegie Mellon University .
Fienberg , who participated in a government study critical of the use of polygraphs , said he worries that a lot of money is being spent on a program that in the end will show " the emperor has no clothes . "
Civil liberties groups maintain this screening technology is an invasion of privacy .
" Nobody has the right to look at my intimate bodily functions , my breathing , my perspiration rate , my heart rate , from afar , " said Joe Stanley of the ACLU .
Stanley says government officials need to focus on what has worked in the past .
" They need to use old - fashioned , shoe - leather law enforcement investigative techniques , chase down known evidence , known suspects and get out there and do a good , competent basic job in investigating terrorist groups , " he said .
Stanley added the notion that terrorists " can be picked out with this kind of pseudo technological approach ... is very naive . "
Burns denied the project is a violation of privacy .
" We 're looking at signals you give off naturally .
We 're not asking for any personal information .
We 're not asking anything about you , " he said .
Burns acknowledges the project has a long way to go , but he insists it is valid research that 's headed in the right direction .
He believes their theory is backed by " a vast plethora of research over the past 40 years . "
Researchers hope to have the project ready for field testing in 2011 .
Burns ' goal is to have a system within five years that is " minimized and unobtrusive . "
People would go through security quicker , Burns said , and " you may keep your shoes on , you do n't need to take your jacket off and please keep your bottle of water . "

City Passes Ordinance to Create Protective Zones Around Abortion Clinics
By Camela Furry in News on Oct 8 , 2009 2:00 PM
Photo by dollbabytina from a tribute to Dr. George Tiller at Thompson Center earlier this year .
Tiller was shot and killed allegedly by an anti-abortion activist May 31st .
Since his death there has been a " significant surge in the size and viciousness " of anti-abortion protests according to Planned Parenthood voted 27 - 11 approving an ordinance requiring anti-abortion activists to keep a distance of 50 ft. away from clinic entrances and medical facilities to create a protective zone for patients and employees .
Within the so - called bubble zone , " no one could get closer than 8 feet to pass materials , display signs , protest , educate or counsel another person without their consent " according to the Sun - Times .
Activists who violate the ordinance risk a $ 500 fine .
During the Council meeting protesters chanted in the hallway and a crowd of demonstrators gathered around the front doors of City Hall on La Salle St. Pro-Life activists denounced the approval of the ordinance as a violation of their First Amendment rights and vowed to fight .
The ordinance was championed by Ald. Vi Daley ( 43rd ) who told Chicago Breaking News workers and patients going to the Near North Health Center , a Planned Parenthood location , have complained about conditions , " Women seeking any kind of medical service are routinely harassed " she said , " they are photographed , and they are followed . "
Ald. Brian Doherty ( 41st ) who cast a " no " vote told the Sun - Times , " I am pro-life .
I do not apologize for that .
And I am Roman Catholic .
They tried to frame it as as safety issue and it's not . "
He said the issue belongs in the U.S. Supreme Court , or the Illinois General Assembly .
The ordinance was patterned after a Colorado law ( requiring a stricter protective radius of 100 ft. ) which has the approval of the U.S. Supreme Court .

There is a growing amount of research being done on how hypnosis affects the brain .
For example , when patients were hypnotized to experience a paralyzed limb , experimenters found that …
“ … brain areas normally associated with the intentional inhibition of movement are not active in people with hysterical paralysis nor hypnotized volunteers , suggesting that it really is the case that they cannot , rather than will not , move . ”
One common use for hypnosis is pain relief and anesthesia .
In April 2006 , the British television channel More4 broadcasted a live hernia hypnosurgery operation .
Some individuals are more hypnotizable than others ; research seems to suggest that those with a bigger anterior corpus callosum , which is a part of the brain thought to help focus attention , has show to associate with higher hypnotizability .
Neuropsychologist Peter Halligan at Cardiff University , UK , believes it may one day be possible to create “ virtual patients ” through hypnosis in order to help study some of the stranger neurological conditions seen in individuals .
Some conditions researchers believe can be duplicated in healthy people through the power of hypnosis include :
Hysterical blindness ( the person cannot see but has no perceptible damage to their eyes or brain )
Hysterical paralysis ( an inability to move a part of the body despite having no physical injury – the same limb may move while the person is asleep )
Prosopagnosia ( an inability to recognise faces despite having good sight )
Alien limb syndrome ( the feeling that an arm or leg is acting of its own accord )
Visual neglect ( total lack of awareness of half of the visual field )
Capgras syndrome ( a delusional belief that a loved one has been replaced by an imposter ) .
NewScientist.com reports on Halligan :
“ Oakley [ another researcher who works with Halligan ] and Halligan are convinced their virtual patients are experiencing some of the same brain changes as people with genuine disorders .
Halligan tells how they once induced a case of visual neglect in a volunteer by suggesting that the left side of his visual field would cease to exist .
They then asked him to copy a picture with a dozen objects scattered on the page .
Most hypnotized people given this instruction would copy only the objects on the right hand side of the page , as most people with visual neglect do .
But this volunteer drew the right - hand side of every object on the page .
‘ That ’s not something you would intuitively expect , ’ says Halligan , ‘ but it is also seen in real patients . ' ”
I personally have been studying hypnosis and practicing it on myself for the past five years .
It was one of the first things to get me interested in the mind and what influenced me to pursue a degree in psychology .
If you would like to read some of my writings on hypnosis I recommend : Hypnosis : The Nature Of Suggestion and Hypnosis Explained ( Debunking The Myths ) .
These articles mention some of the science on hypnosis but mostly focus on a pragmatic analysis .

It has become a ritual : the long queues under the vast marble arches of the Palais de Justice , the bustling lawyers , the traffic jams by the Seine , the bored policemen , the occasional confused tourist wondering what all the fuss is about .
For over a month , the " Clearstream " trial , the culmination of an extraordinarily complex series of political , financial and legal investigations and manoeuvres , has gripped France .
Today , the crowded hearings in the high court 's Prémière Salle ended .
But the Clearstream affair was never going to end in an ordinary trial .
In the dock , with four others , was Dominique de Villepin , the urbane , aristocratic former prime minister and foreign minister , best known outside France for his powerful oratory during debates at the United Nations in New York in the run up to the 2003 Iraq War .
De Villepin was accused of trying to cause catastrophic political damage to the career of Nicolas Sarkozy , the current president , by arranging for ( or at the very least allowing ) a forged list of account holders to reach investigating judges .
The accounts were supposed to hold ill - gotten gains from kickbacks or the proceeds of organised crime , and the list included the name of De Villepin 's arch- rival , as well as those of scores of other top political and business establishment figures .
The president was not physically in the courtroom – though he was represented by lawyers as one of 40 plaintiffs who had brought the case – but was present in spirit nonetheless .
Much of the defence of De Villepin , for whom prosecutors have demanded an 18 - month suspended prison sentence and a € 45,000 ( £ 41,000 ) fine , is that he is the innocent victim of a political vendetta .
" I am here because of one man … Nicolas Sarkozy promised to hang me from a butcher 's hook .
I see that the promise has been kept , " he said early in the trial , referring to a reported comment from Sarkozy .
It is not just the blows traded across the courtroom floor by the representatives of the two men that have provoked the interest in France , however .
The daily hearings , in a magnificent neo -gothic wood - panelled courtroom , have been a window into an astonishingly murky world of spies , kickbacks and political dirty tricks .
The affair has its roots in a 2001 investigation by French judges of alleged bribes paid during a $ 2.8 bn ( £ 1.7 bn ) sale of French frigates to Taiwan 10 years earlier .
The judges were sent documents by an anonymous informant with the details of thousands of accounts supposedly held at a Luxembourg - based financial securities clearing house called Clearstream , which was supposedly linked to vast organised crime syndicates and alleged kickbacks from the frigate deal .
Many of the accounts were held by former and serving ministers , captains of industry and other senior figures .
Two names — Bocsa and Nagy — jumped out .
Together they composed the full original family name of the French president , the son of a Hungarian aristocrat immigrant .
When it became clear the lists passed to the judges were forgeries , the focus of the investigations switched to tracing their provenance .
The source was eventually revealed to be Jean - Louis Gergorin , former executive of aerospace group EADS , renowned defence strategist and fully - fledged member of the great and the good .
Gergorin admitted sending the documents to the judges but claims he did so at the request of his friend De Villepin , then locked in a vicious battle to succeed President Jacques Chirac as the leader of the French mainstream right .
The account lists were allegedly falsified by a Lebanese computer specialist , convicted fraudster and part - time " source " for French intelligence called Imad Lahoud , who worked for Gergorin .
He too has been sitting quietly in court .
His lawyer mounted an unusual defence last week , telling the court that his client " was [ and ] is a liar " and begging the five judges ' " pardon " for his " torrent of lies " .
Also in the dock is a young accountant who allegedly stole crucial documents from Clearstream and the reporter who received them from him .
Among the witnesses heard have been two of France 's highest - ranking former spies : General Phillippe Rondot , a respected veteran of espionage who captured the notorious terrorist Carlos the Jackal , and Yves Bertrand , head of the secret police for 12 years until 2004 , whose diaries were seized as part of the investigation .
Rondot was asked by De Villepin to investigate the allegations against his rival and told the court that Sarkozy had appeared of particular interest to the then foreign minister .
Rondot 's previously impeccable reputation has also been somewhat tarnished by the revelation that for some time he apparently thought that Lahoud might lead him to capture Osama bin Laden .
As for Betrand , rather than reveal anything about the Clearstream affair , his diaries were found to contain hundreds of pages of scribbled notes on the sexual tastes of senior politicians and unflattering references to Sarkozy 's second wife , Cécilia .
De Villepin , 56 , has argued that he is the victim of a political vendetta and that he acted entirely properly as a minister at the time in having the false list of accounts investigated as it could have posed or indicated a risk to national security .
He and Sarkozy have never tried to hide their mutual enmity .
The two represent polar opposites .
Not only is there the physical contrast between the tall , slim , silver - haired De Villepin and the short , hyperactive Sarkozy , but there is a cultural gulf too .
De Villepin , a blue - blooded career diplomat educated in elite schools who still found time while a senior minister to write volumes of passable poetry and lengthy histories of Napoleon Bonaparte represents a France that disdains Sarkozy .
The president is a lawyer who attended neither establishment schools nor universities , is seen as painfully and un-Gallically pro-American , does not drink , likes hamburgers , flaunts his friends ' wealth and whose lack of interest in the arts is well - known .
The pair also represent different wings of the French right .
" Dominque de Villepin incarnates the traditional values of the French conservatives : the greatness of France , social justice , democracy , equality and cultural exchange , " said Anne-Béatrice Delange , 60 , who has queued every day to show her support for the former prime minister in court .
" Sarkozy incarnates the opposite . "
But though the affair has dominated the press – the Le Monde newspaper is to publish an eight - page supplement on the affair tomorrow — it is not clear how much impact it has had more broadly .
One recent poll showed that though 39 % of the population said they had talked about Clearstream in recent weeks , the affair was ranked last out of 15 concerns , well below the recent wave of staff suicides at former state monopoly France Telecom , or the president 's failed bid to parachute his 23 - year - old son into a powerful post as president of the management board for La Défense , Paris ' main business district .
" It 's just too complicated for most people , " said Frédéric Dabi , of pollsters IFOP .
The stakes for De Villepin , who sported a smooth smile , impeccable suit and a permanent tan throughout the hearing , are high .
If he is found innocent , the trial could be the " trampoline " which relaunches his flagging political career , Dabi said .
If he is found guilty , it could be its " cemetery " .
After today 's hearing De Villepin said that he wanted " to turn the page … to look to the future … and to serve the French people in however they desire . "
The judgement will not be delivered for several months .

The original headline and standfirst referred to the frigate deal with Taiwan , but this was not part of the Clearstream trial , only part of the background to it .
These references have now been removed .
A football captain is refusing to hang up his boots despite playing with the same team for more than half a century .
Grandfather - of - four Roger Craddock , who celebrated his 70th birthday last week , first played for Reigatians AFC in September 1957 .
Now the captain of the club 's sixth team , Mr Craddock , of Redhill , Surrey , who plays two or three games each season , marked his birthday by scoring a penalty against fellow Surrey side the Old Suttonians last weekend .
He said : " I 've got no intention of packing up .
I 'm player - manager of the 6th XI and play most games , although admittedly not 90 minutes .
" I 've got one cartilage left in my knee , so it would be absolutely stupid to pack it in before I tear that . "

Sir Alex Ferguson likes to boast that his Manchester United team score more late goals than any other side in the world .
Others argue that they get a bit of extra help from referees .
It has now emerged that the Premier League champions do , as suspected , benefit from an imbalance in the amount of stoppage time that is added to their matches .
After the controversy over Michael Owen 's winning goal in Sunday 's Manchester derby , the Guardian has looked at all of United 's league matches at Old Trafford since the start of the 2006 - 07 season and discovered that , on average , there has been over a minute extra added by referees when United do not have the lead after 90 minutes , compared to when they are in front .
In 48 games when United were ahead , the average amount of stoppage time was 191.35 seconds .
In 12 matches when United were drawing or losing there was an average of 257.17sec .
The average stoppage time added at Old Trafford in the period in question is below that given at Anfield , the Emirates Stadium and Stamford Bridge .
United 's is 205 seconds , compared to Liverpool 's 210sec , Arsenal 's 224sec and Chelsea 's 229sec .
But there is also evidence to support the suspicions of many managers , players and supporters that United get preferential treatment at home .
When Owen made it 4 - 3 on Sunday the game was five minutes and 26 seconds into stoppage time .
In total , the referee , Martin Atkinson , allowed almost seven minutes , even though the fourth official had signalled a minimum of four .
Mark Hughes , the City manager , spoke of feeling " robbed " .
His sense of grievance will not be helped if he analyses the last three seasons .
In 2006 - 07 , for example , United were winning 15 times on entering stoppage time and referees added an average 194.53sec .
In the four games when United were not winning there was an average of 217.25sec .
The following year the disparity was greater , Opta 's figures showing an average 178.29sec added when United were winning and 254.5sec when they were not .
Last season it was 187.71sec compared to 258.6sec .
The pattern has continued in the first three games of the season .
In the two games United have led they have played an average 304sec of injury time .
On Sunday , Atkinson allowed the game to go on for 415sec .
Imagine it .
A network of violent radicals is picking off the world 's leaders one by one .
They have killed the American President , the Russian head of state , the French President , the Austrian head of state , and the Spanish Prime Minister .
Bomb attacks are ripping through the world 's richest cities : explosions devastate Wall Street , the London Underground , a theatre in Barcelona , cafés in Paris , parades in Moscow .
The police profile of a typical bomber warns : " He walks to his death with courage and no regrets . "
There is panic , and governments launch programmes of torture and deportation targeted at immigrant communities .
Yet still the radicals wash defiantly across the world , killing as they go .
They say they have " only one aim , one science : destruction " .
It sounds like a feverish novel about al - Qa'ida , set 30 years from now .
But it has already happened .
It is a story from our past .
In the late 19th and early 20th century , anarchist bombers did all this .
They were prepared to die for their beliefs .
They lived in the same places as today 's Islamists – such as Whitechapel , in east London – and they struck the same targets , like lower Manhattan on a clear September morning .

In a new documentary – The Enemy Within , by Joe Bullman – young Islamists read the words of yesterday 's Jewish anarchists , from their writings and trial transcripts .
While the societies they dream of building after the bombs are very different , their rage , their alienation , and their tactics are almost identical .
The words fit so easily into their mouths that the Islamists say it is " creepy " .
Mark Twain said : " History does n't repeat itself , but it does rhyme . "
Are there lessons buried in this ripple of rage spreading across a century ?
For decades , anarchist radicals seemed like an ineradicable force that would bleed Western societies forever .
Within a generation , they were gone .
So can the anarchists show us what makes young men attack their own societies – and what makes them stop ?
Can it tell us what tactics defeat an amorphous underground movement , and what only makes them stronger ?
From the nitroglycerine of the 19th century , is there a fuse that ends with the jihadists of 2009 ?
I. Terminus
As the sun set on 12 February 1894 , the Café Terminus at the Gare Saint - Lazare was full of young Parisians listening to an orchestra when the music stopped abruptly .
A fireball consumed everything in sight : the world went black .
When the survivors came round , there was a jigsaw of body parts around them , and people on fire , running , screaming .
It was the work of a smartly dressed 20 - year - old French accountant called Emile Henry .
He had placed a bomb in a metal workman 's lunchbox and hurled it at the orchestra .
This was n't his first attack : a few months before , he had blown up a police station , killing five people , and returned calmly to his desk , where he finished the ledgers he had been working on .
But it was the first time a private individual had randomly blown up civilians .
As the historian Dr John Merriman , who teaches at Yale University , says : " It was the day that ordinary people became the targets of terrorists . "
But Emile Henry was not an anarchist from Central Casting .
He was an intellectual born into the French bourgeoisie , living in part off handouts from his rich aunt .
He was – by all accounts – a sensitive person who had spent his life appalled at the cruelty all around him .
He claimed his act would save lives in the end : that he was murdering out of compassion .
Henry was living in a Paris of vertiginous inequalities .
In a quarter of an hour you could walk from the palatial glamour of the opera house to slums where babies were routinely dying of tuberculosis .
The divide ran right though his soul : he had the education of the rich , but he had slumped down into the tubercular slums .
Emile 's father , Fortune Henry , had run away from his middle - class family in 1848 at the age of 16 to join the revolution in Paris .
When Parisians seized control of their own city in 1871 and ran it as a democratic commune , Fortune manned the barricades and rallied the crowds .
But when the French state recaptured Paris – massacring 25,000 people as it went – he was condemned to death , and fled to Spain .
Emile Henry was born there , and he was raised on tales of how the French state had brutally suppressed freedom .
The boy grew to see all governments as evil , especially when the Spanish authorities confiscated the family 's belongings to punish their anarchist sympathies .
His father was forced to work in filthy factories where he contracted mercury poisoning .
He died when his son was 10 .
Henry 's mother begged for cash from her wealthy relatives , who helped send Henry to the best schools in Paris .
He was an exceptionally successful student , and for a time – as a pale , tall young man , with a reddish beard – he became an engineer .
But , on a meagre trainee engineer 's salary , he was still stuck in the poorer arrondisements of Paris , where he was stunned by the waste of life all around him .
The poor majority had no political voice , and scarcely enough food to live : a quarter of all children died before reaching adulthood .

" I would like simply to disappear , to annihilate myself , in order to escape the perpetual anguish that strangles and breaks heart and soul , " he wrote .
He concluded that wealthy Paris was dominated by " frauds " , and " only the cynics and grovellers can get a place at the banquet ...
[ The rich have ] appropriated everything , robbing the other class not just of the sustenance of the body but also the sustenance of the mind . "
Across Europe , the nation - state was asserting its power over ordinary citizens in a deeper and harsher way than ever before , with governments seizing taxes and young men for conscription at an unprecedented rate .
In response , there was a growing anarchist movement that simply said that the state was illegitimate , and should be disbanded .
The term " anarchist " had originally been an insult , but , in 1840 , a French provincial printer 's assistant called Pierre - Joseph Proudhon picked it up and wore it with pride .
He said if governments were disbanded , people would organise themselves into peaceful democratic communes that would run their own affairs , without police or laws or taxes .
It was the state – with its apparatus of coercion and violence – that made people bad .
Remove the state , and you would have a natural order at last , based on personal freedom .
Law is tyranny ; property is theft .
In a society where the emaciated poor were routinely being worked to death , it was an appealing message .
As he lay dying because he had been made to work in toxic factories since childhood , a porcelain worker known to history only as " M L " wrote : " Accursed society , you are responsible for my illness .
Thoughtless and cynical bourgeois , do you not sense that I can transform myself into someone who can right wrongs , an avenger of the innumerable existences that your society has massacred , an avenger of all those who have revolted and live as outlaws , and those who have been tortured or eliminated ?
Bourgeois ... I want to talk with me at least some of those who are responsible for my death . "
To Emile Henry , it seemed persuasive .
He took money from his bourgeois aunt – and wrote cordial letters of thanks – but cursed the bourgeoisie as " evil " .
When he was ordered to attend the military lottery , where he could have been conscripted , he went on the run .
At lectures across the city , he heard the argument put by anarchists that the only way to put their philosophy into practice was by " the propaganda of the deed " .
Acts of violence against the state or the populace would show the state 's power was illusory and stir a general revolt .
Just as most Muslims reject jihadism today , most anarchists rejected violence against civilians , calling it " common murder " .
But developments in France made
Henry more determined to side with the furious fringe of anarchism : striking miners were crushed by troops , and the rich became richer .
He wrote : " The entire bourgeoisie lives from the exploitation of the unfortunate , and all of it should pay for its crimes . "
He was captured at the scene of the bombing .
He said he had one regret : that he did n't kill more " bourgeois " .
If only he had a bomb big enough , he boasted , he would have blown up the whole of Paris .
Only from the rubble could a just society emerge .
In a letter to his mother , he said : " You must not believe those who will say that your son is a criminal .
The real criminals are those who make life impossible for anyone with a heart , those men who uphold a society in which everyone suffers . "
After Henry was executed at the age of 21 , a series of revenge bombings staged by anarchists ripped through France .
One of the killers , Auguste Vaillant , declared : " We will spare neither women nor children because the women and children we love have not been spared .
Are they not innocent victims , these children , who in the faubourgs slowly die of anaemia , because bread is rare at home ?
Those women who in your workshops suffer exhaustion and are worn out in order to earn 40 cents a day ?
These old men whom you have turned into machines so that they can produce their entire lives and whom you throw out on to the street when they have been completely depleted ?
You will add other names to the bloody lists of our dead ... but what you can never destroy is anarchy .
Its roots are too deep , born in a poisonous society that is falling apart .
It is everywhere , which makes anarchy elusive .
It will finish by killing you . "
II .
All - American Anarchism
Emile Henry was only one member of a scattered freelance army who believed they could end the idea of government itself , and usher in an era of perfect freedom .
Their attacks were made possible by the coincidence of two historical developments : the development of anarchist philosophy , and the invention of dynamite .
In 1866 , the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel invented this easy - to - carry , easy - to - make explosive , and it spread through the world 's mining and construction industries like a rapidly fizzing fuse .
But it took a tiny , malformed German anarchist to see how it could change the world 's politics .
Johann
Most was a 5 ft - tall bookbinder filled with rage .
As a child , an operation on his jaw had gone wrong , leaving it painfully jutting forward .
His attempts to hide it under a huge red beard only attracted more attention .
Most turned his humiliation outwards on to just causes – at least at first .
He too ran away to Paris , and was immediately jailed after the crushing of the Commune , for demanding the vote for everyone .
He argued for socialism , to be brought about through parliamentary democracy – and when he was released from jail he was elected to the German Reichstag on precisely this platform .
But Otto von Bismarck launched a purge of all leftists , and Most had to flee again .
The purge crushed Most 's belief in gradual reform .
He became convinced the system could only be changed by blowing it up – and suddenly realised that explosives were now lying all over Europe and the US , in sheds controlled by ordinary workers .
Dynamite needed no expertise to operate ; it could be carried in your pocket ; and it could kill .
He announced : " It is within the power of dynamite to destroy the capitalist regime just as it had been within the power of gunpowder and the rifle to wipe feudalism from the face of the earth .
A girdle of dynamite encircles the world ! "
Most travelled from country to country , urging workers to pick up their dynamite and use it against the bosses who forced them to work 12 - hour days , seven days a week , for starvation wages .
He became the model for Ossipon , the refugee - anarchist Ossipon in Joseph Conrad 's novel The Secret Agent , who walks the street with a bomb forever strapped to him , ready to blow himself up the moment the police swoop .
In anticipation of Islamism , Ossipon brags that his enemies " depend on life ... whereas I depend on death , which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked .
My superiority is evident . "
Although it has been consigned to the memory - hole , one of the places where Most found the most recruits was the US .
He washed up in the 1880s in a continent where 35,000 American workers died every year in industrial accidents .
Whenever they went on strike for better conditions , they were savagely beaten by the police .
The richest 2 per cent owned 60 per cent of the wealth , and the politicians and police did their bidding .
One of his most fervent disciples was a hard - drinking cowboy from Utah , never seen without a stetson and a strut .
He was called " Big Bill " Haywood .
He spent his childhood moving from one mining town to another , and had his eye slashed out in a mechanical accident when he was nine .
By the age of 15 , he spent almost all his time hacking at rock underground , where he saw men routinely get crushed or blasted .
Writing about one typical town , he explained : " The people of this mining camp breathed copper , ate copper , wore copper , and were thoroughly saturated with copper ...
Many of the miners were suffering from rankling copper sores , caused by the poisonous water .
Human life was the cheapest by - product of this great copper camp . "
Big Bill turned to anarchism after witnessing systematic state violence against ordinary people .
When he organised a strike , US soldiers rounded up 1,000 miners at random and placed them in a barbed - wire bull - pen .
They were detained there for seven months .
As the police officer in charge declared , " To hell with the constitution ! "
They called it the " American Bastille . "
Class war did n't seem like a metaphor to him : it was the reality of everyday life .
The industrialist Jay Gould openly bragged : " I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half . "
So Haywood – some historians believe – blew up the governor of Idaho , Frank Steunenberg , in 1907 , and his trial was the biggest news story of the year .
His lawyer , the legendary Clarence Darrow , urged the jury to side not with " the spiders of Wall Street " but with " the men who toil with their hands ... through our mills and factories , and deep underneath the earth .
I am here to say that in a great cause these labour organisations have stood for the weak , they have stood for every humane law that was ever placed on the statute books .
I do n't care how many wrongs they have committed – I do n't care how many crimes – I just know their cause is just . "
It is a sign of how widespread the sympathy for anarchists was that Haywood was acquitted , and became an American folk hero .
He eventually had to flee the US during the First World War when he urged people to resist the draft , and was sentenced to 20 years in jail .
He fled to the Soviet Union , found it to be " hell " , and drank himself to death .
This is only one small slice of a larger story unfolding in every developed country .
Anarchist attacks on politicians were remarkably successful , starting when three young men hurled bombs into a carriage carrying Tsar Alexander II in 1881 , killing him and several members of the crowd .
Anarchists claimed their heftiest scalp when , in 1901 , a young militant called Frank Czolgosz waited in line to shake US President McKinley 's hand in Buffalo – and shot him in the gut .
( This act gave us President Theodore Roosevelt , one of the most aggressively imperialist and racist presidents in US history ) .
But gradually the anarchist fervour boiled down further and further into attacks on ordinary civilians – which is why they still echo into our world today .
III .
" It was written 100 years ago , but it is happening today "
Does this anarchism bear any relationship to the jihadists who bomb the very same targets today ?
When the film - maker Joe Bullman got young British Muslims with some sympathy for the 7/7 bombers to read the words of anarchists put on trial at the Old Bailey a century ago , they showed an exhilarated recognition .
Adam Munevar Khan says : " It was written 100 years ago , but it is happening today – to the Muslims . "
Mohammed Rahmen says : " Anarchism has been represented to be a doctrine of insanity and murder – its principles , its ideals , they 've been unmentioned , lied about .
That really penetrated my way of thinking .
That 's exactly how Islam is . "
The Islamists read the anarchist lines to camera with feeling .
One of them says : " We are met by the cry of assassins , dynamiters , fiends – but let 's see who utters these cries .
It 's the same people who daily massacre more people than the anarchists of all countries have ever killed . "
It could be Mohammad Sidique Khan , the 7/7 murderer , announcing : " Your democratically elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people all over the world .
And your support of them makes you directly responsible , just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters .
Until we feel security , you will be our targets .
And until you stop the bombing , gassing , imprisonment and torture of my people , we will not stop this fight . "
Yet it 's easier , at first glance , to see the differences between the two ideologies .
Anarchists loathed religion , seeing it as another form of tyranny to be destroyed ; Islamists want their severe interpretation of religion to be obeyed by everyone .
Anarchists were some of the first to fight for feminism and sexual freedom ; Islamists want to imprison women in burqas and in their homes , and to kill gays .
Anarchists demanded absolute free speech ; Islamists chant " death to free speech " .
Anarchists loathed racism ; Islamists are frequently racist against Jews .
Anarchists wanted a society of absolute freedom ; Islamists want a society of absolute obedience .
But neither had a very clear picture of what the world would look like after the smoke from their bombs had cleared .
Their visions of the future were vague : both no -state and the caliphate were hazy hope - dreams .
Below and beneath them , there were deep structural similarities .
Both groups believed their violence was justified by the larger illegitimate state violence they witnessed as young men .
For the anarchists , it was the crushing of the Paris Commune and the executions of innocent anarchists after the Haymarket bomb of 1886 in Chicago ; for the Islamists it is the assaults on the Palestinians , on Afghanistan , and on Iraq .
However warped , they believe they are killing out of compassion for the victims of these crimes .
The anarchist Emma Goldman wrote : " To those who say hate does not give birth to love , I reply that it is love , human love , that often engenders hate . "
They justified their attacks to themselves by claiming they were trying to give the wealthy , or the West , a taste of how " their people " felt .
Yet in both movements , intriguingly , it was largely middle class intellectuals who turned to violence .
Both Emile Henry and Mohammed Atta – the leader of the 9/11 hijackings – were engineers who found in mathematics a sense of purity and order and rationality that soothed them , and seemed like a refuge from a chaotic world .
The leading anarchists in Europe – Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin – were both Russian noblemen , just as Osama bin Laden is the son of a Saudi billionaire .
( Bakunin and Kropotkin , however , strongly opposed targeting civilians . )
They were people who chose to renounce their riches and side with the embattled tribe " beneath " them , and claimed to be fighting for its survival .
Both waves of violence were reactions to tectonic shifts in how power worked in the world .
Anarchist attacks were a violent reaction to the rise of the nation - state ; Islamist attacks within the West are to a significant degree a violent kick - back against Western states asserting their power abroad .
These reactions were only made possible by new networks of communication .
For the anarchists , the revolution in shipping and telegrams made movement across continents suddenly faster and freer than ever : a genuinely international network moving rapidly between countries could develop for the first time .
For Islamists , the internet made the movement of ideas and plans instantaneous : a global movement simultaneously operating in Tora Bora and Manhattan was suddenly possible .
And for this reason , both movements produced vicious backlashes against immigrants that went far beyond the people who actually carried out the attacks .
In Bullman 's film , he gets contemporary asylum - bashing pundits like Gary Bushell and Nick Ferrari to read the rage directed at Jews in Britain after a small number of Jewish immigrants became anarchists and launched bombings .
Ferrari reads a Daily Mail column from 1911 that barks : " There are hundreds of anarchists in Whitechapel ... but there 's no way of learning anything about them .
In this great foreign city east of Aldgate the English policeman is an uncomprehending foreigner ...
We can't continue to let the scum of Europe [ come here ] . "
And this perhaps points to the most important echo of all .
When governments reacted to these attacks , at first they charged angrily down a path that made anarchism worse – and guaranteed more of their citizens would die .
IV .
Why did the attacks stop ?
The postscript to anarchist bombings in almost every country was a bonfire of civil liberties .
After Wall Street was blasted with a massive bomb in 16 September 1920 , killing 38 people including a 16 - year - old newspaper delivery boy , the US government launched a huge indiscriminate programme of deportations of " radicals " – often peaceful left - wingers .
It was masterminded by a young man called J Edgar Hoover , who learned then the tactics of indiscriminate smearing he was to use throughout the cold war .
For the first time in the country 's history , Congress declared an idea to be " un-American " , and said anybody preaching anarchism – however peacefully – would be held responsible for " aiding " the attacks .
There was a raft of convictions of people who had done nothing except discuss anarchism and suggest there was some justice in its analysis .
There was a smattering of small countervailing voices in America , but in the initial hysteria , they were drowned out .
The federal judge George W Anderson said the Justice Department was engaging in " utterly illegal acts , committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws . "
The US Attorney Francis Fisher Kane resigned , warning that " the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice " .
A presidential commission warned that this crackdown only made the anarchist warnings about a police state seem prescient .
To the young men teetering on an act of violence , torture and police brutality made the anarchists sound right – and violent resistance necessary .
The commission said the structural causes of the violence had to be dealt with instead , explaining : " The crux of the question is – have the workers received their share of the enormous increase in wealth which has taken place in this country ?
The answer is emphatically – no ...
Throughout history where a people or a group has been arbitrarily denied rights , reaction has been inevitable .
Violence is a natural form of protest against injustice . "
But nobody wanted to hear these arguments .
The public and the politicians wanted vengeance .
Some governments , like France 's , exploited the attacks to shut down all left - wing protest .
Hoover employed a raft of agents to find a bogus " Russian connection " to the Wall Street bombing , to justify aggression against the Soviet Union .
Eventually , the American people returned to their senses , and chose a president who saw the threat in a cooler way .
President Warren Harding said : " It is quite true that there are enemies of the government within our borders .
However , I believe their number has been greatly magnified . "
But the countries that had the harshest crackdowns ended up with the largest anarchist movements of all , while those that reacted calmly and kept their freedoms open saw the movements implode much faster .
Professor John Merriman – whose book The Dynamite Club is one of the best accounts of the anarchist attacks – explains : " After the Italian king Umberto I was assassinated by the anarchist Gaetano Bresci , the Italian state response was deliberately restrained and minor .
This undercut the movement .
By contrast , Spain reacted at the same time with a programme of brutal repression and torture .
They ended up with the biggest anarchist movement in Europe .
Then later , when they stopped torturing people , the anarchist attacks stopped .
I 'm not an expert on contemporary terrorism , but the lesson for us seems pretty clear . "
From the 1920s on , the anarchist attacks began to dwindle , and by the late 1930s they were over .
Why ?
What happened ?
Nobody is entirely sure – but most historians suggest a few factors .
After the initial wave of state repression , civil liberties slowly advanced – undermining the anarchist claims .
The indiscriminate attacks on ordinary civilians discredited anarchism in the eyes of the wider public : after a young man blew himself up in Greenwich Park in 1892 , his coffin was stoned and attacked by working class people in the East End .
The anarchists ' own cruelty and excess slowly deprived them of recruits .
But , just as importantly , many of the anarchist grievances were addressed by steady reforms .
Trade unions were finally legalised , and many of their demands were achieved one by one : an eight - hour working day , greater safety protections , compensation for the injured .
Work was no longer so barbaric – so the violent rejection of it faded away .
The changes were nowhere near as radical as those demanded by the anarchists , but it stripped them of followers step - by - step .
Could the same be done with Islamism ?
The lesson from the death of violent anarchism is that the solution lies beyond blanket violent repression of them or its polar opposite , capitulation to their demands .
The answer is gradual reform that ends some – but not all – of the sources of their rage .
Clearly , many of Islamists ' " grievances " should be left unaddressed : we must never restrict the rights of women or gay people or end the freedom to discuss religion openly , as they demand .
But there is plenty we can do .
When the huge violence directed at workers and the poor stopped , violent anarchist attacks stopped .
An end to the extensive violence directed towards many Muslims could have a similar effect .
It would require significant changes here at home .
We would have to kick our addiction to oil , so we will no longer be drawn into hellish oil - grabs into Muslim countries , or into holding hands with murderous tyrannies like the House of Saud .
We will have unequivocally to renounce torture ( even when it is practised by " allies " such as the Egyptian dictatorship ) , and press for peace for the Palestinians instead of arming and funding the assault on them .
This will never be enough for the jihadists , of course – but if we do it , they will find their base of furious young men dissolving beneath their feet .
The ghosts of Emile Henry and Johann Most and Big Bill Haywood are standing before us , with their sticks of dynamite slowly fizzing .
Are we going to make the same mistake that our governments did when dealing with them – or , after a century , have we learned how to put out the fire this time ?

Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes People with diabetes are suffering needlessly from regular low blood sugar attacks , a survey suggests .
Among 2,000 people with type 2 diabetes , half had experienced symptoms of a hypoglycaemic episode in the past two weeks , the study found .
GPs said increasing pressure to tightly control patients ' blood sugar was partly to blame for the problem .
Diabetes UK , which commissioned the survey , said it suggested many patients may not be on the right medication .
The number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK has increased by more than 145,000 in the last year , bringing the total figure to 2.6 million , the latest figures show .
A key part of treatment is to make sure blood sugar levels do not get too high , because this can lead to severe complications in the long term .
We want to see hypos become the exception rather than the rule
Simon O'Neill , Diabetes UK
But on the other hand , very low blood sugar is also dangerous .
One type of commonly used drug in type 2 diabetes - sulphonylureas - can lead to hypoglycaemia , experts said .
The latest survey focused on mild or moderate attacks , which often come with warning signs such as feeling shaky , sweating , tingling in the lips , going pale , heart pounding , confusion and irritability .
More than half of those questioned said mild to moderate " hypos " affected their quality of life and one in 10 reported having to take at least one day off work in the last year as a result of a mild to moderate attack .
One third reported that mild to moderate hypoglycaemic attacks affected their ability to carry out day - to - day tasks , including housework , social activities , sports activities and sleep .
Impact Causes of a hypoglycaemic attack include taking too much diabetes medication , delayed or missed meals or snacks , not eating enough carbohydrate , doing more exercise than usual and drinking alcohol without food .
People having regular attacks may stop having warning signs and pass out without realising anything is wrong .
Those taking part in the research were not taking insulin , which can also cause hypoglycaemia .
Simon O'Neill , Diabetes UK Director of Care , Information and Advocacy , said : " We want to see hypos become the exception rather than the rule . "
Dr Brian Karet , a GP in Bradford and a medical advisor for Diabetes UK , said the figures in the survey seemed high but he agreed there was a lot of hidden hypoglycaemia .
" It is a lot more common than is often recognised especially these days when we are encouraged to put people on multiple medications .
" The modern sulphonylureas are actually quite powerful and if they are prescribed along with other drugs this is going to be an increasing problem . "
He said anyone having regular symptoms should get checked out and they might need better advice on managing their condition , or they might need a lower dose of medicine .
Professor Mike Pringle , a GP in Nottinghamshire , and an advisor on the original National Service Framework for Diabetes , said the findings were " surprising " .
" If they are confirmed it does suggest we may be overtreating these people .
" They are obviously learning how to manage their symptoms , but it is not intended they have these symptoms .
" There is a balance we need to strike and we need to better understand this information . "

The conventional wisdom about DRAM error rates is that errors are rare , and the majority of the errors that do occur are so - called " soft errors " — randomly corrupted bits that have been flipped by incoming cosmic rays .
But a recent large - scale study of DRAM errors released by Google turns this wisdom on its head , and in doing so reinforces the importance of error correction coding ( ECC ) and regular hardware replacement for datacenter machines .
Google 's 2.5 - year study of DRAM error rates in its datacenters is the largest such real - world study ever released ; prior studies have been based on lab tests done under artificially high - stress conditions , with the results then extrapolated to give a picture of real - world conditions .
Google engineers tracked errors as they happened , and logged both the errors and relevant data like temperature , CPU utilization , and memory allocated .
After analyzing the data , they drew seven main conclusions about the nature , frequency , and causes of DRAM errors .
The headline conclusion in the study is that DRAM errors are vastly more common than is typically assumed .
Nearly one - third of the individual machines in the study saw at least one error per year , a rate that 's orders of magnitude higher than previous research had indicated .
To give some hard numbers , previous studies report 200 to 5,000 failures in time per billion hours of operation ( FIT ) per Mbit ; Google found that their numbers were between 25,000 and 75,000 FIT per Mbit .
On the bright side , most of these errors are the result of a few bad apples .
About 8 percent of DIMMs were responsible for over 90 percent of the errors , as DIMMs that produced one error were hundreds of times more likely to produce another error in the same month .
Another lesson that Google learned is that older hardware is much more likely to fail ; at about 20 months the error rate shoots up drastically .
Perhaps not coincidentally , typical IT refreshes happen at about the three - year mark , and it would n't be surprising to see computer vendors latch onto this study as another data point in their quest to convince businesses that their ongoing freeze on upgrades will soon start to cost them more than it 's saving them .
For large datacenters , Google 's findings are especially important , because for different businesses the tipping point where the cost of error - induced downtime exceeds the cost of refreshes will fall at different times .
In the absence of detailed data , it 's easy to imagine a company that 's focused on cutting costs pushing past this tipping point without knowing it .
The other big error factor that Google found was duty cycle — the higher the CPU utilization and memory allocation on a machine , the greater the odds of an error .
In fact , utilization was much more strongly correlated with error rates than was temperature , despite the fact that most lab - based studies stress the latter factor as a large contributor to error rates .
( Temperature does correlated to error rates , though , but just not as strongly and cleanly across platforms . )
The study 's final conclusion , and the one most at odds with previous studies , is that hard errors dominate soft errors by far .
Either defects in the chip or transmission problems in the memory subsystem cause more errors than external factors like cosmic rays .
The researchers suggest that the unexpected dominance of hard errors might explain the drastically higher error rates observed vs. previous studies , which focused on soft errors .
Given the increased error rates that Google found , it turns out that ECC is even more important than previously thought .
The presence of ECC can mean the difference between a recoverable error and a catastrophic , downtime - producing failure , so it 's no wonder that datacenter builders insist on it .
It 's also the case that the type of ECC matters , with stronger ECC like chip - kill showing the ability to lower error rates by four to five times vs. weaker coding .

OCTOBER 22--A Minnesota man arrested last year for drunkenly driving a motorized La - Z - Boy lounge chair pleaded guilty this week to a DWI charge .
Dennis Anderson , 62 , was nabbed after driving his chair into a parked car , according to a Proctor Police Department report .
A subsequent blood draw showed Anderson 's blood alcohol content was .29 , more than three times the legal limit .
Anderson 's customized vehicle , seen in these police evidence photos , is powered by an eight horsepower Kohler lawnmower engine , and has a stereo , headlights , a built - in cup holder , and a " Hell Yeah It 's Fast " bumper sticker .
The ride , however , does not have a seat belt .
Anderson , pictured at left , controlled the La - Z - Boy via a steering wheel protruding from its seat cushion .
The vehicle 's headrest was adorned with the logo of the National Hot Rod Association .
Following his guilty plea , Anderson was sentenced to 180 days in jail and ordered to pay a $ 2000 fine .
A judge stayed Anderson 's jail term in lieu of his successful completion of a two - year supervised probation term .
His La-Z-Boy , which Proctor cops seized shortly after Anderson 's arrest , will soon be auctioned along with items forfeited by other perps .

The folks at the NYPD are so sweet !
No matter what you 're arrested for , they 're nice enough to remove your cellphone 's battery " to avoid leakage " and jot down your IMEI number .
They 'll even add it to a database .

According to the NY Daily News , a recent internal memo instructed NYPD officers to commit such acts of battery - removing , IMEI - jotting kindness .
The idea behind it is to assemble a database which would allow them to match phones used by a suspect to past , present , and future crimes .
It 's almost romantic how you 'll gain a lifelong relationship with the NYPD through this process , but , like many other newfangled relationships , this one is being called into question .
Some are arguing that it circumvents warrant requirements and infringes on the rights of a suspect .
I argue that I wo n't carry a cellphone if I go on a crime spree in New York .

A new hydroelectric device , the Hydro Electric Barrel ( HEB ) could bring renewable power generation as close as the nearest flowing water , making micro hydro a reality for many who live near streams and rivers .
The inventors claim it to be both efficient and cost effective , as well as being less intrusive to the environment than other hydroelectric solutions .
The HEB can be suspended over any river or stream , and possibly implemented in the ocean to take advantage of wave energy as well .
The design is deceptively simple : a one - piece large plastic wheel within a frame , spinning with the flow of water .
What ’s not so obvious is the internal design : a set of two integral planet gear driven permanent magnet generators turning the motion into usable power .
According to the inventors , the advantages of the HEB are many : compared to conventional waterwheels , it operates quietly , and is easy to transport and install .
The machine is also environmentally friendly because of its shallow draft in the water , and has a low capital outlay per kilowatt .
The HEB does n’t interrupt the flow of the water and can adjust to changing water levels , while rolling over any debris in the flow .
The HEB could also be modular , so for more power , another generator can be installed either in parallel or in a series in the river .
The hydroelectric device is also being developed with a tidal estuary variant which can be powered by both tides and waves .
Mike Lowery and Paul Price , the team behind the HEB , say they have a US manufacturer interested , and welcome inquiries for other possible producers of the product .
For more information see the Hydro Electric Barrel website .

TENSIONI IN RAI .
Il presidente della Vigilanza , Zavoli : « Grave lo spostamento di Ballarò »
Annozero , Santoro attacca :
« Berlusconi agisce nell' ombra »
Il conduttore : « Manca poco più di una settimana al debutto e non c'è il contratto per Travaglio »
Michele Santoro ( Eidon ) MILANO - Dopo lo slittamento per Ballarò di Floris in favore della diretta di Porta a Porta di Vespa sui terremotati di marted ì sera , non accenna a placarsi la polemica in Rai.
Questa volta è Michele Santoro ad andare all ' attacco : « Sappia Berlusconi , che continua a agire vigliaccamente nell ' ombra , che , nel caso , non faremo passare tutto questo senza un'ultima battaglia : sarà il pubblico di Annozero a chiedere che il suo programma vada in onda » , afferma il conduttore a conclusione del suo intervento a Repubblica Tv , dopo aver parlato del contratto di Marco Travaglio , dei rallentamenti burocratici per il programma ( « Chi parla di lui , parla della trasmissione , sono la stessa cosa » ) e del caso Ballarò .
« Manca poco più di una settimana al debutto e il direttore generale fa sapere , senza smentire , che il contratto non c'è ancora perchè deve esserci un approfondimento in Cda .
Perchè il Cda deve dibattere su Travaglio ?
È forse un delinquente , che non può esprimersi ?
Esiste una lista di giornalisti che non possono parlare ?
Non possiamo accettare - continua Santoro - questo gioco del direttore generale se non spiega il perchè : se c'è un problema dica quale è .
Io sono stato abbandonato e con un grandissimo senso di responsabilità ho cercato soluzioni possibili per le quali vengo attaccato dai giornali di Berlusconi , mentre dico e ho sempre detto che senza Marco Travaglio non c'è Annozero » .
LA SITUAZIONE - Santoro ricorda che la trasmissione non ha ancora una troupe operativa per fare le inchieste e il contratto del suo opinionista più importante è sub judice : «e noi accettiamo questo ?
E lo accetta il Consiglio ?
E il presidente di garanzia della Rai accetta questo che umilia la professionalità , che umilia la tv ?
Persone che non si sono mai occupate di tv in vita loro e che sono stati messi lì dal presidente del consiglio devono decidere della vita e della morte di operatori che da 20 anni costruiscono successi Rai , persone che hanno dato il sangue , che si sono occupate di mafia .
E noi dobbiamo aspettare l'esito di un dibattito per sapere se Marco Travaglio ci sarà .
Ma si sappia che parlare di lui è parlare di Annozero » .
« TERRORISMO PSICOLOGICO » - Con Santoro c'è anche il consigliere d'amministrazione Nino Rizzo Nervo che spiega come non sia il Cda ( « Non è di sua competenza » ) a doversi occupare del contratto di collaboratori delle trasmissioni e che il direttore generale ha detto che riferirà di Travaglio al prossimo Cda .
« È in atto in Rai , per volontà esterna , un'azione di terrorismo psicologico nei confronti di quelle diversità editoriali che ancora sopravvivono .
Credo comunque che una forzatura su Travaglio alla fine non ci sarà e se ci fosse una forzatura sulla direzione di Raitre , allora la chiamata alla mobilitazione non sarebbe solo di Santoro » .
Per Rizzo Nervo , «il direttore generale sa cosa sarebbe successo se venerd ì sera non avesse firmato i contratti per Bartolino e Dandini e anche i problemi nati con Fazio stanno per risolversi » e sulle nomine ricorda di avre votato senza problemi proposte in cui fosse una valenza professionale , come per Raisport e il Tg2 .
Per altre , visto che un cambio di vertice non comporta l'obbligo di cambiare tutto , sappiamo che il direttore generale ha il potere di fare proposte , ma sappia che devono essere coerenti e dimostrare che non nascono da intenzioni censorie , di soffocamento delle diversità editoriali , di normalizzazione della rete .
Lo saprà ?
Voglio credere di sì , se no non ci sarebbe , da parte mia , solo una presa di posizione sdegnata » .
Quanto a Floris e Ballarò , sia Rizzo Nervo sia Santoro sostengono che non si era in presenza di alcun evento straordinario , che solo potrebbe giustificare un cambiamento di palinsesto .
« Evidentemente Vespa , specie in un caso come questo , non deve avere confronti ( e se Ballarò poi lo battesse ? ) .
Vespa gestisce una forma di monopolio e sfugge a ogni confronto con al concorrenza di chi potrebbe fargliela » .
E Rizzo Nervo aggiunge che « si è deciso che marted ì sia una giornata di celebrazioni e allora anche una battuta di Crozza all ' inizio di Ballarò può dare fastidio » .
ZAVOLI : « DECISIONE GRAVE » -
Nel frattempo arriva anche il parere del presidente della commissione di Vigilanza sulla Rai , Sergio Zavoli , che giudica « grave » la decisione di rinviare la partenza di Ballarò domani su Raitre per fare spazio a uno speciale di Porta a porta e annuncia di aver anticipato a mercoled ì alle 12.45 la convocazione dell ' ufficio di presidenza della commissione .
Allo stesso tempo Zavoli stigmatizza « la pletorica invadenza di Miss Italia , la cui durata ha indotto addirittura alla cancellazione di un telegiornale » .
« La decisione , all ' ultimo momento , di bloccare sia pure una tantum la puntata di Ballarò su Raitre - aggiunge Zavoli - di fatto contraddice il criterio di un palinsesto differenziato , volto a stabilire con il pubblico appuntamenti programmabili .
Le due trasmissioni hanno sempre convissuto all ' interno dei palinsesti delle rispettive reti , e la deroga , specie se perentoria , costituirebbe un problema da dover prontamente risolvere » .

Here are 14 ‘ levers ’ you need to be pulling
Like any social tool , Facebook needs to be worked in order to achieve specific marketing , event or fundraising goals .
Yes , you need to have a an effective Facebook Page where fans can easily interact ( see “ 11 Quick Tips to Enhance Your Facebook Fan Page ” by @franswaa ) .
And yes , you need to have compelling content .
However , even with all this , if you do n’t consistently nurture your Facebook relationships , you ’ll end up with visitors — potential fans — wondering , “ Are they still in business ? ”
What you get by working your Facebook levers
You ’ll grow your fan base organically , which means they ’ll stick around .
You ’ll be able to identify your biggest supporters .
You ’ll stay current on what ’s important to your fans ( also called “ market research ” ) .
Facebook levers ( manual )
Many of the levers you pull on Facebook require time , attention and consideration .
You can think of these as the manual levers .
1. Messages
Facebook Pages and Groups allows you to send messages to fans .
Treat this feature the same way you would an email marketing service :
Your best fans are busy fans .
Be sensitive about sending too many messages .
Make the message personal – and use your human voice , not “ marketing - speak ” .
Make each message count by making it about them — not your organization .
Always include a specific request for action that creates value for them .
Cool tool :
Use bit.ly measure how many folks clicked on your ask .
Use bit.ly measure how many folks clicked on your ask .
See how Danny Brown uses messages in the 12 for12 k Group .
2. Encourage sharing
If people are real fans ( meaning they feel good about you and your organization ) , they ’ll want to share what you have ( PDF ) — either through messaging their friends , or posting to their profile .
All you have to do is ask .
3. Discussions
Hildy Gottlieb does a great job engaging members of the Community - Driven Institute Facebook Group in meaningful discussions .
She ’ll share an article and then ask a specific question for folks to discuss .
Participants learn , share and get to know each other – all because of Hildy ’s efforts !
4. Rotating photos
Your Facebook Page has an incredible main image , I know .
But try rotating out a different image — kinda like Google does with their logos .
Fans will take notice when they see the new image in their stream .
5. Profile statuses
If it feels good ( not forced ) , share news about your non -profit in your status .
And yes , please share good stuff from your “ competing ” non-profit friends .
The karmic boomerang will always return !
Tag !
You ’re it ! :
Tag relevant friends in your status updates as well :
6. Facebook Page Wall posts
Make a habit of posting videos , links and photos on your Page ’s wall .
Share the best stuff and lots of it .
7. Facebook Page and Group Wall comments
When people comment on a your wall post , please comment back .
They ’ll feel a stronger sense of belonging when their thoughts and feelings are valued .
If you do n’t have time to comment on posts , keep planting seeds by liking comments .
Facebook levers ( automatic )
Many Facebook levers can be automated , although you still need to invest time , attention and consideration .
You can think of these as the automatic levers .
8. RSS blog feed
Make sure you ’ve set up the Notes Application to import your blog posts .
This is an easy way to automate a stream of great on content on your Page and drive traffic back to your blog .
9. Facebook toolbar for Firefox
The Facebook toolbar for your Firefox browser lets you save time and effort with your Facebook actions :
Search Facebook from anywhere .
Get notifications about friend requests , messages , event invitations , and group invitations .
Check your friends ’ profile pictures and statuses and interact with them on Facebook .
Take 90 seconds and download the Facebook Firefox Toolbar !
10 . Seesmic Facebook Page feature
If you use Twitter , you should know about Seesmic , an incredible desktop tool that allows you to easily manage relationships on Twitter and Facebook .
Recently , a feature was added that allows you to hand - pick Facebook Pages that you want to connect with better .
Take 5 minutes and download Seesmic !
( Also watch these video tutorials on using Seesmic ) .
11 . Multiple administrators
Do you know who your biggest fans are ?
Is there someone you trust who wants to do more ?
Give them administrative rights to your Group or Page .
You ’ll be able to focus your energies elsewhere .
Plus , your new admin friend just might teach you a thing or two about Facebook .
12 . Landing page URLs
Each tab on a Facebook Page has its own URL , so you can target a precise landing Page for off - site promotion .
For example , if you are promoting a fundraising event , you can target a Tab containing FBML promoting that event .
You can also choose which tab to set as the default when users find your Facebook Page vs. when they visit as a fan .
13 . Know your nodes
It ’s easy to aquire 1,000 Facebook fans on a Page who doing nothing , proving that bigger is not necessarily better .
The power of your Facebook community depends on the relationships that you have with key influencers ( relationship marketing ) .
These are folks that can sway a group of friends with a post , a tweet or a video .
You already know who they are , and have already developed sincere friendships with many of these influencers ( do n’t forget – they ’re friends first ! ) .
Facebook lists allows you to organize friends into groups so that you can more effectively nurture these friendships .
14 . Measure , rinse and repeat
Facebook Pages provides many ways to measure the results of your actions so that you can quickly decide what ’s working and what ’s not .
These reports enable you see what types of content your fans prefer and how they like to engage with that content .
Here are three of my favorite reports :

It went down to the very last play , a pass that Florida State 's Jarmon Fortson nearly scooped off the garnet - colored grass in the end zone as time expired .
Fortson argued to no avail , replay officials confirmed that he did n't have the ball , and Miami ( 1 - 0 , 1 - 0 Atlantic Coast Conference ) flooded the field that bears Bobby Bowden 's name in celebration .
" Whew ! " was the first sound Miami coach Randy Shannon made as he left the joyous locker room .
Really , no other words were necessary .
And Miami did it to Florida State ( 0 - 1 , 0 - 1 ) again , winning for the fourth time in its last five trips to Florida 's capital city and dealing Bowden another arduous defeat against the team that 's vexed him more than any other .
" It was a great game , though , " Bowden said .
" I guess it sounds funny to hear a losing coach say that . "
Harris completed 21 of 34 passes for two touchdowns and two interceptions .
He got hurt on the second of those turnovers ; Harris was drilled by blitzing cornerback Greg Reid and his throw on that play resulted in nothing more than a pop fly that Markus White ran back 31 yards for a 31 - 24 Florida State lead with 11:45 remaining .
Harris walked to the sideline , holding his right arm tightly to his chest .
He was fine .
Better than fine , actually .
" It was just a bad funny bone incident , " Harris said .
" My whole arm went numb .
I had to fight through .
I had to help this team win . "
He did .
Harris connected with Cooper for a 24 - yard score to tie the game at 31 , and after Florida State took the lead again on Dustin Hopkins ' 45 - yard field goal with 4:11 left , the ' Canes went back to work .
They went 59 yards in six plays , Harris ' perfect lob to Benjamin accounting for most of them , and Cooper plowed in for the go - ahead score .
" This kid , " said Miami running back Javarris James , speaking of the sophomore quarterback , " he 's real poised . "
Ponder was , too .
Ponder , who ran for 144 yards against Miami last year , went 30 yards on a draw play to get deep into Hurricanes territory with 1 minute left .
When Brandon Harris was flagged for pass interference , Florida State had 14 seconds to go 2 yards and win the game .
First down , Harris tipped the ball away from Fortson .
Second down , Ponder 's pass for Fortson sailed high .
Third down , Fortson got his hands on the ball as he hit the ground -- and it squirted away .
After the review , Miami could celebrate .
" Another typical Miami - Florida State game , " Shannon said .
" It 's what you look forward to when you play Florida State .
It seems the last couple of years it comes down to the last play . "
ESPN CLASSIC INSTANT CLASSIC
ESPN Classic will feature Miami's victory over Florida State as an Instant Classic , Tuesday 8 p.m. ET .
Ponder completed 24 of 41 passes for a career - best 294 yards and two touchdowns , but it was n't enough to keep Florida State from dropping its third straight home game dating to last season , a first under Bowden .
" It was a poor throw .
It was low , " Ponder said of the final play .
" We had an opportunity to win it .
Now we 've got to forget it . "
" You have to cast it aside and look at the errors we made , " Bowden said .
" If we do n't correct 'em , we 'll lose another one the same way . "
Miami outgained Florida State 476-404 .
" A heck of a television game , " Bowden said .
Offensive coordinator Mark Whipple 's new schemes were an instant hit with the most important Miami fan : university president Donna Shalala , who beamed after Miami rolled up 229 yards on its 29 first - half plays , a 7.9 average .
" What 's not to enjoy ? " Shalala said when Miami was leading 14 - 10 .
" We 've got an offense . "
So did Florida State .
The Seminoles scored the first 13 points of the second half , with Ponder running in from 9 yards out to put Florida State back on top on the first drive following intermission -- aided by , of all things , a 15 - yard late hit penalty on the kickoff by Miami kicker Matt Bosher -- then throwing to Taiwan Easterling for a 21 - yard score for a 23 - 14 edge with 4:57 left in the third .
This one , though , was just getting started .
" We came a long way tonight , " James said .
Because universities are places to learn , and not — gasp ! — draw attention to yourself , the all - male Morehouse College has placed women ’s clothing on its list of banned attire , right up there with wearing sunglasses , pajamas , and do - rags in class .
And yes , banning cross - dressing is specifically aimed at gay students .
Morehouse , the HBCU ( historically black college / university ) in Atlanta , is cracking down on those silly gays who think a college campus is the appropriate place to express themselves .
“ We are talking about five students who are living a gay lifestyle that is leading them to dress a way we do not expect in Morehouse men , ” says Dr. William Bynum , vice president for Student Services .
And what happens if you do show up to class wearing a cute Marni number ?
You ’ll be asked to leave .
Keep doing it , and Morehouse will suspend you .
The change comes “ from the vision of the college ’s president ” Robert Michael Franklin , Bynum tells CNN , “ who wants the institution to create leaders like notable graduates Martin Luther King Jr. , actor Samuel Jackson and film director Spike Lee . ”
Couple this knee - jerk response with Morehouse ’s recent firing of an employee who made fun of that fabulous gay wedding , and we ’re not sure what to think of the school ’s feelings towards the gays .
( Morehouse ’s Bynum insists the policy change came after he met with Morehouse Safe Space , the campus ’ gay organization , which voted to OK the policy change .
“ Of the 27 people in the room , only three were against it . ” )
It ’s all part of President Franklin ’s “ five wells ” campaign .
He wants students to be “ well read , well spoken , well traveled , well dressed and well balanced . ”
That ’s reasonable .
And admirable !
But if the trade off is a policy that ’s so strict it clamps down on a student ’s ability to express his gender identity , we ca n’t get behind it .
Is wearing pumps in class really going to distract from academia ?
Only if Morehouse contributes to a campus that ostracizes those individuals .
Or they could teach tolerance and acceptance .
You know , like that Martin Luther King Jr. fella .

Take Me Back to Constantinople
Economic crisis , mounting national debt , excessive foreign commitments — this is no way to run an empire .
America needs serious strategic counseling .
And fast .
It has never been Rome , and to adopt its strategies no — its ruthless expansion of empire , domination of foreign peoples , and bone - crushing brand of total war — would only hasten America ’s decline .
Better instead to look to the empire ’s eastern incarnation : Byzantium , which outlasted its Roman predecessor by eight centuries .
It is the lessons of Byzantine grand strategy that America must rediscover today .
Fortunately , the Byzantines are far easier to learn from than the Romans , who left virtually no written legacy of their strategy and tactics , just textual fragments and one bookish compilation by Vegetius , who knew little about statecraft or war .
The Byzantines , however , wrote it all down — their techniques of persuasion , intelligence gathering , strategic thinking , tactical doctrines , and operational methods .
All of this is laid out clearly in a series of surviving Byzantine military manuals and a major guidebook on statecraft .
I ’ve spent the past two decades poring over these texts to compile a study of Byzantine grand strategy .
The United States would do well to heed the following seven lessons if it wishes to remain a great power :
I. Avoid war by every possible means , in all possible circumstances , but always act as if war might start at any time .
Train intensively and be ready for battle at all times — but do not be eager to fight .
The highest purpose of combat readiness is to reduce the probability of having to fight .
II .
Gather intelligence on the enemy and his mentality , and monitor his actions continuously .
Efforts to do so by all possible means might not be very productive , but they are seldom wasted .
III .
Campaign vigorously , both offensively and defensively , but avoid battles , especially large - scale battles , except in very favorable circumstances .
Do n’t think like the Romans , who viewed persuasion as just an adjunct to force .
Instead , employ force in the smallest possible doses to help persuade the persuadable and harm those not yet amenable to persuasion .
IV .
Replace the battle of attrition and occupation of countries with maneuver warfare — lightning strikes and offensive raids to disrupt enemies , followed by rapid withdrawals .
The object is not to destroy your enemies , because they can become tomorrow ’s allies .
A multiplicity of enemies can be less of a threat than just one , so long as they can be persuaded to attack one another .
V. Strive to end wars successfully by recruiting allies to change the balance of power .
Diplomacy is even more important during war than peace .
Reject , as the Byzantines did , the foolish aphorism that when the guns speak , diplomats fall silent .
The most useful allies are those nearest to the enemy , for they know how best to fight his forces .
VI .
Subversion is the cheapest path to victory .
So cheap , in fact , as compared with the costs and risks of battle , that it must always be attempted , even with the most seemingly irreconcilable enemies .
Remember : Even religious fanatics can be bribed , as the Byzantines were some of the first to discover , because zealots can be quite creative in inventing religious justifications for betraying their own cause ( " since the ultimate victory of Islam is inevitable anyway … " ) .
VII .
When diplomacy and subversion are not enough and fighting is unavoidable , use methods and tactics that exploit enemy weaknesses , avoid consuming combat forces , and patiently whittle down the enemy ’s strength .
This might require much time .
But there is no urgency because as soon as one enemy is no more , another will surely take his place .
All is constantly changing as rulers and nations rise and fall .
Only the empire is eternal — if , that is , it does not exhaust itself .

St Helena 's population has shrunk to 4,000 People on the remote island of St Helena have warned that unless Britain builds them an airport soon , their economy will collapse .
Without it , children are becoming " economic orphans " as parents are forced to take jobs on other islands and the sick are travelling hundreds of miles by ship for specialist care , often without a nurse .
In May 1659 , Captain John Dutton landed on St Helena , a speck of volcanic rubble more than a thousand miles off the African coast , and founded a British colony .
He stepped ashore to the sound of trumpet and drum .
In 2009 , there was no fanfare to mark the 350th anniversary .
Down at the castle that the captain built , the people who run St Helena had other things on their minds .
A few months earlier , the UK government had frozen a project to build an airport on the island .
In the depths of a global recession , it had second thoughts about spending more than £ 300 m on a tiny island in the South Atlantic - for the time being .
At meetings across the island , people spoke of feeling " disbelief , distrust and betrayal " , according to a consultation report published by the government on Wednesday .
In the capital , Jamestown , Vince Thompson read the report and referred back to the day Captain Dutton landed on the uninhabited island and claimed it for the Honourable East India Company .
" After all those years the problems remain fundamentally the same , " he said .
Far away jobs
The island , now a British overseas territory , is just as isolated now as it was in the East India days .
Then , sailing ships were a regular sight in James Bay , stopping for fresh supplies on the long haul down to The Cape .
Now the only regular visitor is the Royal Mail Ship St Helena , which brings nearly all the island 's needs and a very small number of tourists .
It also takes islanders , known as Saints , to jobs far away .
With no airport , many find it hard to return .
Often they go to Ascension Island or the Falklands - also British territories .
Some employers , including the Ministry of Defence and the US Air Force , will not allow them to take their children with them .
They are left behind , often with ageing relatives .
About a quarter of Saint children are thought to be " economic orphans " .
Social workers have only recently been introduced to help deal with the severe problems caused by decades of families being parted .
Colonial heritage
The island has four doctors at the old colonial hospital in Jamestown but Saints needing specialist care must travel to the UK or Cape Town - a week 's voyage .
A shortage of nurses means patients sometimes have to travel without one .
For some , the ship comes too late and they die at sea .
In 2005 , the UK government announced that it would build an airport by 2010 .
The Royal Mail Ship brings all the island 's needs
One islander , quoted in the local newspaper , called it " the biggest thing since Napoleon " , the French emperor who died on the island in 1821 .
The hope is that an airport will bring in enough tourists to give the island a viable economy and end decades of surviving on British aid , currently more than £ 20 m a year .
The island offers tourists a wealth of colonial heritage , with a backdrop of lush mountain greenery .
Cannons still point out to sea from batteries all round the spectacularly rugged coastline .
However , many islanders fear an airborne invasion of tourists would destroy the island 's tranquillity and culture .
Nearly a third questioned , including Saints overseas , said they wanted a faster shipping service instead .
But nearly all agreed the island could not wait up to five more years for their ageing ship to be replaced .
That , said one person , would be " suicide for the island " .
Low pay
In the past decade , its population has shrunk by a fifth to only 4,000 because people cannot make a living at home .
The average salary is £ 4,500 and food and fuel cost more than in the UK .
Now there are not enough people of working age to run all its services , such as schools and the hospital .
And every time the RMS St Helena sails out of James Bay , it takes more islanders away .
Rosemary Stevenson , the report 's author , said : " There is a strong sense that further delay would take the island to a point where recovery will no longer be possible . "
In response to Simon Pipe 's piece , the UK Department for International Development said : " We will consider carefully the views submitted in the consultation , taking into account the current economic conditions .
" The global economic conditions are very different now from when we tendered the airport contract .
We have a responsibility to re-examine matters when the circumstances have changed so significantly .
The consultation provided an opportunity for anybody who is likely to be affected by the decision to make their views heard before the decision is made .
" When we launched the consultation we made it clear that the government 's commitment to ensure access to and from the island is not in question : we will not contemplate a reduced level of access to that currently provided by the RMS . "

Jack Duncanson starts each day by checking his " six pack and pipes " in his full - length bedroom mirror .
He wants to install a basement gym to help further his modelling and hockey careers , and to build on those burgeoning abdominal and arm muscles .
He is also 11 years old .
" It 's totally a body image thing , " his mother Kelly Duncanson says of the Pickering youngster .
" I do n't know where it comes from . "
But a new Canadian - based study may give her some answers .
That teens and young adults feel social and peer pressures to have movie - star bodies is well documented .
But the study of some 4,200 Nova Scotia kids shows children as young as 10 and 11 are getting in on the weight - watching act , with many saying their happiness can hinge on being supermodel slender or built like Tom Cruise .
" That 's what 's so new about this study ; we know this relationship between body weight and body satisfaction ... from adults or older adolescents , " says Paul Veugelers , a University of Alberta public health researcher and senior study author .
" But here we 're looking at 10 - and 11 — year - old kids , pre-pubescent kids by and large , and we see almost identical relationships . "
Published today in the online journal BMC Public Health , the study was also conducted by researchers at Harvard University .
Based on surveys of Grade 5 children across Nova Scotia , it showed a disturbing number were concerned about their weight .
" For girls , the skinnier they are the happier they are with their bodies , and with boys it 's more ... they do n't want to be too skinny but they do n't want to be overweight either , " Veugelers says .
Veugelers says aspiring to a perfect physique is usually futile for children and can lead to unhealthy , lingering anxieties about looks .
" The literature has also shown it is a risk factor for disordered behaviour related to eating , " he said .
The research comes as no surprise to Hospital for Sick Children research scientist Gail McVey .
" What I know from my research is that children as young as 10 are not only experiencing body image concerns , but they 're engaging in unhealthy dieting practices to try to change their weight or shape , " says McVey , who is also director of the Ontario Community Outreach Program for Eating Disorders .
In a survey she conducted of 2,000 children aged 10 to 14 , 30 per cent of girls and 25 per cent of boys were dieting to lose weight despite being in a healthy weight range .
Although society has an obesity problem , she says " they 're engaging here in unhealthy dieting practices . "
For Jack , a well - grounded boy , both his body and brains are important for gaining popularity .
" You have to have both to go with the flow , " he says .
Veugelers says the blame for body image concerns at a younger age is widespread .

The Constitution :
It ’s not just for Conservatives
Tenth Amendment Center
10/1/2009
Anyone who desires a constitutionally limited federal government should remember and celebrate that its limitations would necessarily cut both ways .
Because if federal policy actually adhered to the letter of the Constitution , no single ideological camp could wield sufficient power to impose a set of beliefs on the entire country .
Which was exactly the point of our federalist system , and of the 10th Amendment .
Beyond specific , enumerated federal powers , an infinite number of issues were intentionally left to the authority of the people through their state governments .
And it is to the states that liberals , conservatives , and even libertarians must address all questions extending beyond the constitutional purview of federal authority .

Assassination Attempt On Somali President - UN
Assassination Attempt On President An Attack On All Somalis - UN
New York , Oct 29 2009 11:10AM
Two recent attempts to kill Somali President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed are assassination attacks on all Somalis , the top United Nations official for the strife - torn country said today .
“ After failing at an attempted coup in May – act strongly condemned by the whole of the international community – extremists are again trying to terrorize the Somali people and wreak further havoc on the nation , ” Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon ’s Special Representative Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah said in a news release .
Extremists yesterday tried to assassinate the president as he was returning to Mogadishu .
This followed a similar attempt last Thursday at Mogadishu airport as he boarded a plane for Uganda to attend an African summit .
“ Resorting to political assassinations that kill innocent Somali bystanders , including women and children , is not only condemnable but absolutely not the way to access power , ” Mr. Ould - Abdallah said .
“ Committing suicide goes against all religious teachings , ” he added , citing a verse from the Koran : “ Do not kill yourselves , for truly Allah has been to you most merciful .
If any do that in rancour and injustice , soon shall we cast him into the fire . ”
He stressed : “ An assassination attempt on the life of the President is also an assassination attempt on all Somalis , as it undermines the efforts of those who have been struggling for some semblance of normalcy and stability for so long . ”
“ Those who ordered and those who carried out these assassination attempts clearly have no intention of participating in dialogue or any interest in contributing to the peace process in Somalia or in the region . ”
The Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) headed by Mr. Ahmed is battling Islamist extremists in a country that has been ravaged by factional fighting and has not had a functioning central government since 1991 .

Swap your home
There 's a home - swap site for almost everyone nowadays .
Thelma and Louise , the women travellers ' online network , is the latest to get in on the act and is consequently modest in size , but for a wider range head to HomeLink International ; established in 1953 , it offers a choice of properties across 75 countries .
You do n't have to be gay to join Mi Casa Su Casa , the home - trade network – a gay - friendly attitude is all that 's needed – and you do n't have to work in a school to benefit from Teachers Travel Web ; " anyone who teaches something to someone " is eligible to sign up for their home swap scheme .
For travellers with disabilities , there 's the Independent Living Institute 's Vacation Home Exchange programme : latest listings including an accessible family home in Victoria , Australia .
But if it 's a staycation with the kids you 're planning , then check out the National Childbirth Trust 's House Swap scheme .
Until 20
November this year , you wo n't even need to pay the £ 30 joining fee .
And of course , do n't forget to check out the Guardian 's own home - exchange site .
For arty types
Given that the words " penniless " and " artist " are generally found together , it 's no surprise that there are so many free - stay opportunities for creative types .
Launched in 2008 , the Creators Inn in Gothenberg , Sweden , offers free short - term accommodation for visiting " creators " – just apply with a convincing case .
A capsule version of the hotel was launched in the same city earlier this year , and a third branch has opened in the Scandic Malmen hotel in Stockholm .
For those wanting to put in some serious work on their masterpiece , there are numerous residency opportunities worldwide .
For example , Mount Tremper Arts in New York 's stunning Catskill mountains offer work exchange monthly residencies from one month to one year .
In return for your labour ( approximately 10 hours per week ) , you 'll get accommodation ( minus food ) and use of studio space when other residencies are not in session .
And then there 's La Muse Inn , whose idyllic Languedoc location alone is enough to get you rhapsodising .
In parts dating back to 12th century , the Inn is built of local stone and chestnut wood ; bedrooms have original fireplaces , Caunes marble windowsills and terracotta tile floors .
Writers and artists can barter their skills , receiving a free room in exchange for approximately three days ' work a week ( outside the summer season ) .
Kiwi car hire
If you 've already shelled out for an antipodean airfare , then you 'll want to keep other costs down , including car hire .
New Zealand 's newly launched Transfercar is an " online relocation service " bringing together travellers and a host of car rental companies .
Simply register , choose from the list of free rental vehicles that need relocating , and away you go – the only catch is that nearly all vehicles need taking from south to north , against the prevailing flow of travellers .
Current listings include a two - berth motorhome with shower and toilet ( pick - up at Canterbury 's Christchurch airport , drop off at Auckland airport ; time allowance five days ) , and a five - seat station wagon for a Bay - of - Plenty pick - up and drop off in Canterbury .
Most vehicles include basic insurance and ferry tickets between the North and South islands ; if you 're lucky , even the gas could be thrown in .
Learn to ski for free

Freedom of the city
Winter festival in Reykjavik , Iceland .

Here 's an inspirational tale .
When Reykjavik resident Inga Jessen lost her job following Iceland 's economic meltdown , she set about building a website for cash - strapped visitors to the city .
And , as an ex-economist , she 's an authority on making a little go a long way .
At freecitytravel.com , you 'll find full listings of Reykjavik attractions and events that can be enjoyed without charge .
Whether you 're in search of culture ( in which case visit The Culture House Museum on a Wednesday to avoid the entrance cost and browse medieval manuscripts till your heart 's content ) , or nightlife ( head to new , free club Auster for a live DJ at weekends ) , the site is sure to soften the cost of this most expensive of cities .
Make a note in your diary of 12 and 13 February 2010 , too , when Iceland 's Winter Light festival will be dispelling the northern gloom .
Free events are scheduled to take place across Reykjavik , from tours and exhibitions to puppet shows .
Mountain hideaways

Bothying is no business for the faint - hearted .
" No tap , no sink , no beds , no lights , and , even if there is a fireplace , perhaps nothing to burn . "
The Mountain Bothies Association sure believes in telling it straight .
But with about 100 stone shelters spread across the remotest parts of Scotland , Wales and the Borders , you 'll be right where the wild things are .
Accommodation is absolutely free – just turn up – but visitors are entirely responsible for their own comforts ( and that includes digging out a loo ) .
For those venturing further afield , then Finland 's network of wilderness huts offers hikers equally basic free shelter .
Slightly more luxurious huts ( equipped with blankets and mattresses as well as stoves ) are also available and can be reserved in advance , for a few euros .
Visit outdoors .

Walking the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route remains as popular as ever , and as 2010 is a Holy Year , now is the perfect time to plan a trip ( you 'll have to wait till 2021 for the next one to come along ) .
Pilgrims ' hostels – refugios – punctuate the route , and while the price of accommodation varies between € 3 - 7 , most ask simply for a donation .
Just do n't forget your pilgrim 's credentials .
Some like it hot
If the thought of autumnal wild swimming sends a shiver down your spine , Italy 's natural hot pools offer a much less punishing alternative .
While some of southern Tuscany 's hot springs have been incorporated into commerical spas , others can be enjoyed for free .
Most well - known are the waterfalls at Saturnia , south of Siena , created by Saturn himself with an earth - splitting thunderbolt ( or so legend has it ) .
The soothing , sulphurous water bubbles up , then down , through a series of picturesque , naturally stepped pools and , at 37C , your mind will be all that 's chilled .
Pools and spas are marked on the carta della province ( province road map ) for both Florence and Siena – or simply look for towns with commercial spas and a free version is almost certain to be nearby .
House work
There 's one way of making sure your hostel is up to scratch – and that 's by doing the chores yourself .
And there might be a free bed in it , if you go about it the right way .
While the editor of HostelWorld , Colm Hanratty , points out that it 's rare for hostels to advertise this kind of arrangement , a number of properties listed with the agency have accepted hard labour in lieu of hard cash .
They include the ever - popular Green Tortoise Backpackers in San Francisco and Green Tortoise Hostel in Seattle ; the Deco Walk Hostel in Miami ( the self - proclaimed " world 's most stylish hostel " , and the only one on Ocean Drive ) ; Southside Lodge in Whistler , Canada ( situated just 200 m from the Whistler Creek Gondola , it 's practically part of the 2010 Winter Olympics downhill course ) ; and the snappily monikered Backpackers Hostel K's House in Kyoto ( only nine minutes ' walk from JR Kyoto Station ) .
Closer to home , the Scottish Youth Hostel Association requires volunteers to work at its remoter properties for up to two weeks at a time .
Chores include gardening , decorating and minor maintenance work , but there are also opportunities to get involved in the running of the hostel – and earn some valuable brownie points for your CV .
Successful applicants for the assocation 's volunteer management positions are given two full days ' training , learning about health and safety , cash handling , the booking process and reception duties .
Then it 's off to put theory into practice at properties such as Broadmeadows , the association 's first hostel , opened in 1931 .
Situated in the stunning countryside of the Scottish Borders , with rabbits , pheasants and sheep for neighbours , it 's just half an hour 's drive from the 7stains mountain bike trails at Glentross forest – the perfect setting in which to hone that work - life balance .
The festive spirit

Unlimited energy ?
Ultra - thick skin ?
High tolerance for mud ?
Then become a festival volunteer and you could save yourself some serious dosh .
Oxfam 's scheme , which covers Reading , Leeds , Rockness , Bestival and Latitude , to name but a few , is perhaps the most popular and well - known : a deposit is required , but returned on completion of duties .
Stewards can expect to work a minimum of three 8hr shifts , and applications open in February .
As the number of festivals continues to rocket , however , so do the number of niche opportunities .
Named this year as one of the Observer 's 10 best alternative festivals , Festinho , in the magical grounds of Kentwell Hall in Suffolk , has opened applications for its 2010 volunteer programme already .
Help with everything from car - parking to artist liaison , and in return you 'll get a free camping ticket and food ( not to mention the use of award - nominated festival loos ) .
If classical music 's more your thing , then it's worth considering the Aldeburgh Festival 's Hesse Studentships .
Applications for the June festivals open in the New Year , to people aged 18 - 25 with a real passion for classical music .
Bed and breakfast accommodation in Aldeburgh is provided , toegther with tickets to all events ; duties range from turning scores to assisting on festival walks .
Thinking outside the ( music ) box , applications are open now for the established Hay Festival internship programme .
In return for accommmodation and meals , you can expect to work in the festival 's press office and celeb - packed green room .
Last but not least , the Edinburgh Festival has an embarrassment of riches for canny volunteers : keep an eye on edinburghfestivaljobs.com for the latest opportunities .
We already talked about pixel art when featuring eBoy months ago .
The new iPhone game Canabalt , with its retro look , pushed me to make a little “ pixelled ” research .
The style of these illustrations remind me to the golden age of coin - op videogames .

Abbiamo già visto qualche esempio di pixel art quando abbiamo parlato di eBoy , mesi fa .
La recente uscita del gioco Canabalt , per iphone , col suo look old school , mi ha spinto a fare qualche ricerca pixellosa .

The British Security Services plotted to blow up Sinn Fein's Dublin headquarters during the height of the Troubles , a former undercover police officer has claimed .
An IRA informer was asked to place the bomb in the offices on Kevin Street in the summer of 1971 , according to George Clarke , a retired Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch Detective Sergeant .
The counter - terrorism officer , who left the police more than 20 years ago , said the security services eventually decided not to go through with the attack , but not before he had put the proposition to his source .
He made the claims in Border Crossing — his newly published memoir of his time working in the RUC 's intelligence unit .
“ I was approached by one of the men from the security services who asked if the source would be willing to do a job , ” said the retired detective , who is now in his late 70s .
“ It would involve leaving a bag in the Kevin Street office .
He would get £ 500 for it .
It was to be timed for a Saturday morning , that 's when quite a few of the boys ( IRA ) would be there to pick up their 10 or 20 quid . ”
Mr Clarke , who spent more than 40 years in the police in Northern Ireland , describes in the book the unease he felt over what was being suggested .
“ This was n't only agent provocateur , it was conspiracy to murder , ” he said .
“ I was n't happy to say the least . ”
In the event , the alleged plot never got beyond the planning stages .
Two weeks after it was first suggested to him , Mr Clarke said he was called to another meeting with the shadowy MI5 agent .
“ He said they had changed their minds about it and just to forget it was mentioned , ” he recalled .
The story is one of many recounted in the officer 's 250 - page account of his time working in RUC Special Branch during the worst of the Troubles .
Another involves a republican source presenting himself out of the blue to pass on a tip that led to the arrest in 1973 of current Stormont Sinn Fein Junior Minister Gerry Kelly at Heathrow airport , hours after he had carried out a bomb attack on London 's Old Bailey .
“ He ( the informer ) went to the guards ( Irish police ) in the south and wanted a lot of money for the information , ” he said .
“ But the guards were n't going to pay him thousands for information about London — if Dublin was the target that would have been different .
“ So one of the guards told him to take a trip over the border and get in touch with Special Branch .
He did that and I was on call the night he rang .
He said London would be hit at noon next day .
While we did n't have enough information to stop the attacks , we did know they would be leaving from Heathrow . ”
Mr Clarke , who now lives in Scotland , said the episode is just one example of how undercover officers on both sides of the border co-operated with each other at a time when their commanders would not even speak to one another .
This secret link between the RUC and the Garda in the early 70s is a central theme running through the memoir .
“ In and around 1971 there would n't have been a phone call between forces north and south , not one , no contact at all , even from Newry to Dundalk — they would n't even call each other about ordinary crime , ” said the ex-officer .
“ Things were getting hot and heavy ( in regard to the violence ) in those days so I decided to go and look for my counterpart across the border .
I found him and after a few meetings and a few pints we started to work together .
“ So there was this clandestine relationship during those critical years before internment .
“ Many of the successes we had can never be told , but we thwarted countless attacks , we were having successes on a weekly basis in those days , either intercepting weapons or explosives .
“ The public do n't know what went on behind the scenes in the dark days of ( the ) 70s , but I 've no doubt we saved hundreds of lives , maybe even more . ”
Though it details a dark period in Irish history , there is room for some lighter anecdotes in the book .
One centres on Special Branch listening devices that former Irish premier Charlie Haughey got his hands on and refused to give back .
Mr Clarke had lent the bugs , which were hidden in pens and plug adapters , to a colleague in the Garda to have a look at .
The officer had in turn shown them to the then Fianna Fail Taoiseach , who apparently started to use them to great effect in his Dublin offices to listen in on conversations between other politicians .
“ I kept on at this guard to get the devices back , but he said Haughey just refused , ” he explained .
“ He told me he had got angry with him on one occasion and said ' I need them back , they do n't belong to me ' .
“ But Haughey said he could n't have them , that they were so useful to him that they had changed the face of Irish political history .
“ Well to that the guard responded : ' Well I hope you realise that it 's the RUC Special Branch that 's changing the face of Irish political history then ! ' “

Yuvraj and Nehra knock New Zealand out
India stumbled in pursuit of 156 under lights but MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina kept cool heads to steer them to a six - wicket win with 57 deliveries to spare and with it move to No. 1 in the ICC 's ODI rankings
Norway 's defence chief has revealed a military secret the New Zealand government wanted to suppress - the location of New Zealand 's Special Air Service contingent in Afghanistan and the jobs they are likely to do .
General Sverre Diesen told the Oslo- based newspaper VG last week that the SAS would replace a Norwegian special forces contingent that has been based at Kabul and recently completed an 18 - month deployment .
The Norwegians had been involved in the arrest of " several wanted insurgent leaders responsible for planning and running suicide attacks against targets in the Kabul region " , Diesen said .
The SAS would " take over " from the Norwegians , who were involved in counter - narcotics work as well as " frustrating the efforts of suicide bombers who were looking to create a bloodbath in Kabul around the presidential election " .
Tom Bakkeli , the journalist who wrote the VG story , told the Sunday Star - Times he understood the SAS would continue some of the Norwegians ' work , including missions with commandos from the Afghanistan government 's Task Force 24 .
" All the operations are high - risk , " said Bakkeli .
One Norwegian commando had been killed in Logar province , south of Kabul .
He said details of the number and fate of prisoners taken by Norwegian special forces were sketchy .
The prisoner issue is a sensitive one for Norway 's government and military , as it is for their counterparts in New Zealand .
Prisoners taken in Afghanistan by non-United States forces are generally transferred to Afghani authorities , who have been implicated in cases of mistreatment , torture and extra-judicial executions .
The Defence Force would not discuss the Norwegian disclosure , saying it was policy to not discuss SAS operations .
The VG story is not the first time details of an SAS deployment have been reported overseas while the New Zealand government remained silent .
In 2002 Prime Minister Helen Clark was forced to confirm the SAS was in Afghanistan after the White House website revealed their presence .
The Star - Times learnt the location and other details of the current SAS contingent when an SAS commander spoke last month of concerns held by some of his men about the dangerous missions they will be sent on .
The newspaper initially decided to withhold the information , which is now widely available .
Green MP Keith Locke told the Star - Times there was no reason why the information should not have been disclosed in the first place .
It was ridiculous to suggest that knowing where the SAS is based and the broad details of their mission threaten their security , he said .
Bakkeli said the location of Norwegian special forces had been reported during their deployment although details of their missions had been withheld .
" Their operations were very secret , " he said .
Other countries , such as the Netherlands and Denmark , are more open about the work of their special forces in Afghanistan .
The Australian government discloses where its SAS men are based and often provides " after - action " reports about their missions .
However , a senior SAS source here told the Star - Times last year that secrecy about the unit 's work in Afghanistan was necessary because " operational security equals operational effectiveness " .
He said revealing information about the deployment also made things harder for soldiers ' families .
" Culturally , it 's not what we 're about .
We leave discreetly and come back discreetly because that 's how we operate . "
The Star - Times revealed last week that SAS members had expressed grave concern at the dangers of their mission , something the government had acknowledged in announcing the Afghanistan deployment .
Following a flight test readiness review , NASA has given the ‘ all systems go ’ for the Ares I - X maiden test flight on Tuesday , Oct. 27 , at 8 a.m. EDT from NASA ’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
“ I am proud of the work this team has done to ready this test rocket for launch , ” said Doug Cooke , associate administrator for NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate .
“ This test will yield important data to support the nation ’s next steps in exploration .
There is no substitute for hard data – flight testing clarifies the distinction between imagined outcomes and real flight experience . ”
This is the first time in more than 30 years that NASA has built a vehicle in a new configuration .
The uncrewed test flight last two minutes , and go 45 kilometers ( 28 miles ) in altitude .
The stages will separate 69 km ( 43 miles ) down range and end 236 km ( 147 miles ) over the Atlantic Ocean , with the dummy upper stage landing in the ocean .
The flight will be broadcast on NASA TV .
Watch it online here .
In the meantime , here ’s a pre-launch video to whet your appetite for a new rocket .
I get a lot of correspondence accusing the BBC of bias in its climate change coverage .
While these readers agree that the BBC is biased ; what they do n't agree about is in which direction it 's biased .
Too much " scepticism " , or not enough ?
In the pay of the oil barons , or told what to think by " Europe " ?
Too scary , or not scary enough ?
All these accusations turn up as regularly in my mailbox as they do for my colleagues and in the comments section of this blog and others .
Regular readers of this blog will know that I 've tried to steer discussion away from " BBC bias " in months gone by , mainly because I think what 's happening " out there " matters more than what 's happening " in here " .
Whether the Greenland icecap is disintegrating , why biodiversity loss is not being curbed , why industrial fishing is not more efficiently regulated - these are surely bigger questions to ask and more interesting topics for an environment forum than endless debates about BBC reporting .
So you might ask why I 'm raising the issue now .
There are two reasons : one is that in the run-up to the UN Copenhagen summit , climate change is moving ever closer to the centre of the political stage , and readership and scrutiny of our coverage is bound to escalate - and I wanted to get this train of thought done and dusted before we reach Copenhagen , because there 's going to be no time to discuss it then .
The second reason is that I 'd like to respond to a recent blog post by the Daily Telegraph 's Damian Thompson , who reported what he described as a " U - turn " in the BBC 's climate coverage in an article by my colleague Paul Hudson last week : " Whatever happened to global warming ? "
Anyone who monitors BBC coverage regularly will see , first of all , that we do not have and have never had a line on the issue :
We covered the Stern Review when it was published , reporting what it contained and analysing what it meant .
We examined it critically and talked to economists who did n't rate it as a piece of work .
We reported the UK government 's Climate Projections , which purport to provide a local - level picture of climate change in the future - and reported why some scientists reckoned that the projections could n't be reliable .
We reported pieces of science suggesting that sea levels would rise higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected , and pieces of science forecasting there would be no net warming over the next 10 years .
Within the BBC , there are many different people covering climate change .
On this website , you can read articles relating to the issue written by Jonathan Amos , Tom Feilden , Pallab Ghosh , Roger Harrabin , Matt McGrath , James Morgan , Sarah Mukherjee , James Painter , Paul Rincon , David Shukman , Susan Watts - that 's just a selection - and by Paul Hudson , and by me .
These days , the issue is covered by journalists with expertise and backgrounds in science , in business , and in Westminster politics , as well as by those with expertise in one particular region of the world .
It 's also worth making the point that , as a general rule , the BBC allows the correspondent to identify what the story is .
You are the person on the ground who 's done the research - it 's your field of expertise - and so , by and large , you get to decide what 's important about the story and how it should be told .
That 's not to say that editors do n't scrutinise and shape coverage - they do - but they do n't dictate it .
What are we accused of ?
Here 's an example :
A few weeks ago , the US National Snow and Ice Data Center announced that this year 's summer ice minimum had not fallen below those of the last two years , but that the overall longer - term trend was still downwards .
Given the constraint that our news headlines have to be between 31 and 33 characters long , I thought " Pause in Arctic 's melting trend " was a pretty decent effort , encapsulating both the immediate finding and how it sat in the longer - term picture .
Not a bit of it .
It attracted complaints of bias both because " there is no long - term melting trend " and because " it is n't a pause or any such thing " : perfect symmetry .
A headline can't be biased in both directions at once .
Any bias here has to be in the eye of the beholder .
So here 's the nub .
In the run-up to Copenhagen , you 're not all going to agree with everything the BBC writes or broadcasts - that 's impossible .
And let 's be honest - journalists are not infallible , in the BBC or anywhere else .
But biases and party lines ?
I do n't think so - but please feel free to disagree .
So let 's have that discussion here , and now .
PS : Another blog post this week - by the Guardian 's Leo Hickman - queried why Paul 's article appeared as a BBC News website story , when it was first conceived as a blog post .
On this occasion , we commissioned a piece from Paul which in fact overlapped with what he was already doing for the blog .
On most occasions , we 'd just link straight to the blog ( as we do to this one ) .
But regardless of format , the editorial standards are the same across the News site , blogs and news stories included , as Steve Herrmann describes in a recent post at The Editors blog .
Delusions of intellectual superiority and unfunny mockery of religion show up the limitations of atheist ideology , writes JOHN WATERS .
THE LATE - 1970s and 1980s seem to have been for me a series of extended pub conversations which , edited together , might have yielded a book to be called , Why the God Delusion is Not Kosher .
Reading in recent years the works of the much - vaunted neo-atheists , I could not find a thought on any page that I could not recall being uttered by someone or other back then , in one of those temples of blasphemy and avoidance .
Decades later , all this same talk has erupted into the public realm and I am expected to regard it as the height of intelligence and modernity .
Everywhere I go now , especially since the publication of the Ryan report , I encounter people saying things I gave myself a pain in the face saying 30 years ago .
Each time I feel I am sitting in a kindergarten listening to a groups of children discovering the one about the chicken crossing the road .
Last Saturday , I attended the agm of Atheist Ireland , in Wynn ’s Hotel in Dublin .
The objectives of this organisation , as outlined by meeting chairman Michael Nugent , include a secular Constitution and “ an ethical Ireland free of superstition and supernaturalism ” .
In advancing this concept , Nugent did not reference any places where an ethical secularism has succeeded .
Atheist Ireland also seeks to remove the influence of Catholicism / Christianity from education , to prevent Irish children , as Nugent put it , “ being told these fantastic tales before they reach the age of reason ” .
I felt I was at a meeting of coeliacs campaigning to have all gluten - containing products removed from the shelves .
Senator Ivana Bacik , claiming to be the only “ card - carrying atheist ” in the Oireachtas , berated what she termed “ creeping fundamentalism ” , instancing the blasphemy legislation recently moved by the Minister for Justice .
She warned about “ a very vocal group of social conservatives who are trying to turn back the clock ” .
She offered no names .
It is clear that these revolutionaries think themselves pioneers of a form of thought that is soon going to galvanise Irish society by virtue of its clarity and reason .
Atheists talk a lot about “ reason ” , but seem to imagine that reason involves only what can be measured , shown , described , computed or touched .
To listen to these people is to be propositioned by the idea that life is simple and capable of being grasped through an ideological programme .
I got no sense from the meeting that anyone present had contemplated reality in anything of the depth that any but the most superficial engagement with religion demands .
And they all seemed to believe that this rendered them more intelligent than if they had .
It struck me that we have somehow arrived at a situation which enables unthinkingness to masquerade as intelligence .
How I wished that I had brought along my Italian friend Marco , a nuclear physicist , who might have , from the perspective of a profound belief in a creative God , brought the room to silence with a few reflections on nothingness .
I believe he would have halved the membership of Atheist Ireland in half an hour .
And if I could have also brought my Spanish friend Julian to follow this by speaking about the infinite nature of human desire , I fancy he might have made a sizeable dent in the other half , perhaps in the end leaving Nugent and Bacik sitting lonesome at the top table .
Much of the meeting was taken up with discussion about how the organisation might respond to Dermot Ahern ’s blasphemy legislation , with some members advocating the issuing of a “ blasphemous ” statement to force the hand of the authorities .
This proposal resulted in more than an hour being given over to the purveyance of purportedly humorous contributions , some of which were almost as funny as the one about the chicken .
Nugent drew much appreciative laughter when he delivered an extended soliloquy on the possibility of turning ice - cream wafers into the body and blood of Dermot Ahern .
A man in the audience provoked guffaws when he said that he had named his car Jesus , “ because it died and came back to life ” .
He would have called it Lazarus except this “ was n’t offensive enough ” .
What a laugh !
A lengthy discussion ensued about whether , instead of issuing a “ blasphemous ” statement , they might conduct some “ blasphemous ” action calculated to give offence .
Some discussion followed about how they might get hold of a consecrated Host to desecrate in public .
Some people timidly suggested that this might risk alienating people who might otherwise be useful allies .
( The idea ! )
It did not seem to occur to anyone that the really offensive thing was the spectacle of adults spending their Saturday afternoon in this way .
Perhaps it is a symptom of its sudden emergence into the light , but Irish - style atheism seems as yet unable to define itself other than in contradistinction to versions of reality it declares to be false .
I would be interested to hear an Irish atheist speak for 10 minutes to his subject without relying for material on the wrongs of the Catholic Church .
The Most Violent City on Earth Ciudad Juárez Takes on the Drug Cartels

The Zune HD ’s lack of a compelling software market will make it nothing more than a repeat failure , according to mobile developers and an analyst .
Microsoft on Tuesday released its newest media player .
Priced at $ 290 for the 32GB version , it ’s packed with impressive hardware features , including a vibrant , touch - sensitive OLED display .
Still , the hardware alone wo n’t be enough to make the device a success , observers say .
“ They apparently had no idea the App Store was coming or was going to be big , ” said Phillip Ryu , co-creator of the popular iPhone app Classics .
“ This all reeks of last - minute scrambling . ”
The center of criticism is Microsoft ’s Zune Marketplace , the Zune HD ’s version of an app store .
But it ’s not really a store :
Third - party developers cannot easily create apps to be sold through Zune Marketplace .
In fact , no apps will be sold at all .
Instead , Microsoft has handpicked third - party companies to code apps that will be offered for free in Marketplace .
The initial software available for Zune HD will include games , a weather app and a calculator .
And in November , Twitter and Facebook apps and some 3D games will launch in the “ store ” as well .
Unlike other mobile stores , Microsoft ’s Marketplace is essentially closed to outside developers .
That ’s an unusual move in the mobile tech landscape .
By contrast , Apple ’s App Store allows anyone to submit iPhone and iPod Touch apps , although Apple exerts stringent ( and often capricious ) control over which apps make it to the public .
Google ’s Android Market is completely open to any developers who wish to offer apps for it .
Research in Motion , Verizon , Nokia and Palm have also all opened mobile app stores to compete with Apple’s .
Even Microsoft is drafting developers for its Windows Mobile 6.5 app store — but oddly enough , the company is not integrating the same store for its Zune media player .
Microsoft ’s Zune marketing manager Brian Seitz said the Windows Mobile Marketplace is being separated because the Zune HD has a different focus than smartphones .
Seitz said the Zune HD ’s focus is music and video playback .
However , Microsoft ’s message is contradictory , because Seitz later said that since the Zune HD features Wi-Fi and not a constant cellular connection , the device would focus on gaming .
“ The thing that Zune HD is made for is really rich music and video playback experiences for people , ” Seitz said in a phone interview with Wired.com .
“ We know there ’s other things folks want to do with these devices that are sometimes connected … and those apps are typically games . ”
Seitz added that the Zune HD ’s primary goal is not to compete with Apple ’s App Store .
However , he did acknowledge the Zune HD ’s main competitor is the iPod Touch .
Matt Drance , Apple ’s former iPhone evangelist and current owner of Bookhouse , an iPhone app development company , said Microsoft was wise to shy away from directly competing with the App Store , because the tech giant is already too far behind in this market segment .
“ I ’ll give [ Microsoft ] credit for acknowledging they ’re not ready to compete , ” Drance said in a phone interview .
“ They ’re going to have to do something really special at this point .
When you ’re staring in the face of 75,000 apps in the App Store that have been downloaded 2 billion times , you ca n’t just say , ‘ Hey , me , too . ' ”
There ’s very little Microsoft can do with the Zune HD at this point , MKM Partners analyst Tero Kuittinen said , because the software that launched with the Zune is too underwhelming to drive momentum for the gadget .
Kuittinen questioned why Twitter and Facebook apps were not immediately available for the Zune HD upon launch , because practically every smartphone today supports this type of software .
He added that Microsoft failed to communicate to the public , via marketing and media , what exactly the Zune HD would do other than play music and video .
This added up to a poorly executed launch , he said .
“ To get the maximum impact you have to have the software services the moment you ’re ready , ” Kuittinen said .
“ When you start bringing it out later it dilutes the impact . ”
“ We ’re getting close to Christmas now , so if you do n’t start now telling consumers what the device can do , it ’s going to be kind of late to give them Twitter app in November , ” Kuittinen added .
What , then , should Microsoft do ?
Lower the price , suggests Kuittinen , who believes the price difference between the iPod Touch and the Zune is not a strong enough selling point .
Microsoft is selling the 16GB Zune HD player for $ 220 and the 32 GB version for $ 290 .
Apple ’s iPod Touch comes in three models : $ 200 for 8 GB , $ 300 for the 32GB and $ 400 for a 64GB model .
The iPod Nano , by contrast , costs $ 180 for a 16GB version , making it — price - wise — another possible competitor to the Zune HD .
“ What exactly do they have to lose at this point ? ” Kuittinen said .
“ Why not just go to $ 130 or $ 140 ?
They ’re going to lose money anyway . ”

Trying to quit smoking and feel like running into traffic , killing yourself or offing your partner , boss or children ?
It may be that drug you 're taking to help you kick the habit .
The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday announced it has ordered the makers of the prescription anti-smoking medications Zyban and Chantix ( also known by their pharmaceutical names bupropion and varenicline ) to warn patients that taking the drugs may cause changes in behavior and mood , including hostility , agitation , depression and suicidal thoughts or behavior .
The new warnings will be included in a " black box " intended to alert consumers to important side effects of a drug .
Bupropion is also marketed as Wellbutrin , an antidepressant .
In July 2005 , the FDA issued a public health advisory warning that Wellbutrin appeared to increase the incidence of suicidal thinking in adults .
And in November 2007 , the FDA issued a preliminary warning that taking Chantix appeared to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior .
Both medications were approved by the FDA after their manufacturers presented evidence that taking these drugs increased a smoker 's likelihood of successfully quitting the habit .
But there are many other ways to stop smoking , all of them laid out here ( or call [ 800 ] QUIT - NOW ) .
Thinking about quitting cold turkey -- no pills , gums , patches or excuses ?
Here 's a site for you too .

So far attempts at domestication have failed with these beasts ( Image : Marcie Jan Bronstein / Getty ) Dimitri Belyaev in 1984 with some of the tame silver foxes he bred in just a few generations ( Image : Ria Novosti / Science Photo Library )
Editorial : Old MacDonald ’s new farm :
What animals should we tame next – or has domestication gone too far already ?
IN 2003 , while geneticist Svante Pääbo was visiting Novosibirsk , Russia ’s third - largest city , he decided to look in on a famous experiment run by the Institute of Cytology and Genetics , which is based in the city .
Fifty years ago , the then head of the IC&G , geneticist Dmitry Belyaev , had begun breeding silver foxes to see how easily they could be tamed .
What Pääbo did n’t know , though , is that Belyaev had also set up another experiment in the 1970s involving rats .
This time , one line of rats was selected for tameness and another selected for aggression .
When Pääbo saw them , he was stunned .
After just 30 years of selection , the IC&G researchers had fashioned two populations that could hardly be more different .
“ I could take the tame ones out of the cage with my bare hands .
They would creep under my shirt and seemed to actually seek and enjoy contact , ” recalls Pääbo .
“ The aggressive animals were so aggressive I got the feeling that 10 or 20 of them would probably kill me if they got out of the cages . ”
“ The aggressive rats were so aggressive I got the feeling that 10 or 20 of them would kill me if they got out of the cage ” …

WASHINGTON  A Supreme Court argument on Wednesday about the fate of a cross in a remote part of the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California largely avoided the most interesting question in the case : whether the First Amendment ’s ban on government establishment of religion is violated by the display of a cross as a war memorial .
The cross in the desert was erected in the 1930s by the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor fallen service members .
Ten years ago , Frank Buono , a retired employee of the National Park Service , objected to the cross , saying it violated the establishment clause .
In the intervening decade , Congress and the courts have engaged in a legal tug of war .
Congress passed measures forbidding removal of the cross , designating it as a national memorial and , finally , ordering the land under the cross to be transferred to private hands .
Federal courts in California have insisted that the cross may not be displayed .
At Wednesday ’s argument , only Justice Antonin Scalia appeared inclined to reach the establishment clause question .
" Instead it just got worse .
They grew and grew and soon they were all over my arms and legs , my back and even my head .
Ii was as if I was turning to stone and it was terrifying , " he added .

Obama Birther Lawyer ’s credentials are questioned
Dr. Orly Taitz , who ’s leading the OC charge that President Obama was n’t born in this country and lacks a US Birth certificate , is having her own credentials as a lawyer questioned .
According to a post in the blog , A Candid World , Taitz attended an online lawy school and her degree and license only permits her to practice law in California .
Â
From their post :
Although Taitz is a member of the California Bar , sheâ€™s not listed as a member of the American Bar Association ( check for yourself ) .
Nor is her â€œlaw schoolâ€ ( William Howard Taft University ) accredited by the ABA .
Because
Taft is a distance - learning school only , Taitzâ€™s degree entitles her , at most , to practice in California , as her school candidly admits .
Rules of attorney discipline forbid the practice of law without a license â€ “ i.e. , without sitting for and passing the bar exam , after graduating from an ABA - accredited school .
Her correspondence degree is a limited exception , only useful in California .
So , any action in which she appeared as counsel of record outside the state would constitute practicing law without a license , in violation of California disciplinary rules .
Has â€ œDr.â€ Taitz violated this rule ?

Further , Taitzâ€™s â€œconsent form , â€ posted on her site to solicit & induce ill - advised members of our military into suing the President , may constitute an unethical attorney solicitation .

Because Obama ’s mother was born in Kansas and is an American citizen , the president could have been born in Panama ( like John McCain was ) or on Mars , and still be considered an American Citizen .

The right wing media of Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs have seized on this issue .

Yet no one questioned McCain ’s citizenship because he was born of American parents on a US military base .
This
week I was given the opportunity to do a hands - on
test of a new gaming application – href = " http://www.say2play.com/ "
>Say2 Play .
Say2Play
is , as you would guess by the name , a voice
command application that allows you to speak commands rather than type
or click
them with the mouse .
It
is a front end
application that has many preloaded templates , including one for each
version
of WoW .
It is available for free download with a seven day trial
period .
If you
elect to buy , it retails for 29.95 .
For the game performance crowd I am
happy
to report no noticeable slow down of the WoW client while this app was
loaded .

The website is easy to navigate and mirrors the look of the app itself .
Easy download right on the main page .
One thing I really liked about
the install and set up portion was the install wizard grabbed every
missing piece of software off the web for me , one click installs
rule .
Once it was installed it was off to setup the
microphone and tune it to the application .

quality of your microphone will have a huge bearing on your experience
with this program .
If you have the means , I highly recommend getting
the best headset you can afford .
With the proliferation of voice chat
apps such as href= " www.ventrilo.com " >
Ventrilo
that most guilds employ , it is money well spent .
We can tell when you
have a crappy mic ; it sounds like you ’re playing in a wind
tunnel .
Ok , off the soap box and back to the review .
Once
your microphone is calibrated , it ’s time to launch the app
and get a feel for it .

Scrollingthrough the apps you will find a huge number of titles available .
Thelist really is impressive , even to the most jaded of gamers like me ( The Fallout3 app is freaking incredible as well ! ) .
After selecting the WotLK app from the list you will enter the mainscreen .

The grey icons along the bottom are your control buttons for navigating
the features .
I like the integration of the World of Warcraft official
website as well as the consumer friendly purchase options along the
right side .
On the very bottom is the display for which module is
loaded , if the mic is active or muted , and the last recognized voice
command .
If you are having trouble in game with your commands
alt - tabbing to this screen should be your first step in diagnosing the
issue .
A simple glance at the last command bar will tell you
what the software is hearing .
You can load and go with Say 2 Play and enjoy a ton of conveniences
right out of the gate .
With commands already present for swapping
hotbars , targeting party and raid members , jumping , autorun , casting
any hot keyed spell on your hotbars and much much more .

To get the true power of this programhowever you need to customize it and tie it to your in gamemacros .
Creating a new voice command has some learning curvebut if you have mastered macro making and key binding in the WoWclient , then it will be a short one

With the sheer number of bindings available in WoW , especially with a
hotbar addon like Bartender , you can add a ton of new voice commands .
Pairing your key binds with macros can add a ton of
functionality .
An example of this was found on the forums as
well as in an email I received from Say 2 Play ’s community
manager
style = " font - style : italic ; " >
When you are typing in a
new key binding and you have more than one keyboard action you use a ;
to separate the keys .
Let ’s say you have the spell Frost
Armor bound to the 5th slot on your 6th Hotbar .
In order to execute that
spell you must stop what you 're doing and type Shift +6 and 5 to execute
it and then Shift + 1 to get back to your main Hotbar .
style = " font - style : italic ; " > With Say2
Play you do n't
even touch the keyboard , you simply say Frost Armor .
style = " font - style : italic ; " > You can use Say2 Play to
run your prebuilt macros in your game or you can build your
multi-command macros with Say2 Play by just separating each key with a ;
in the Say2 Play customization screen .
( The example above would look
like this : Shift +6;5 ; Shift+1 )
style = " font - style : italic ; " >
To setup this command
follow these instructions :
style = " font - style : italic ; " >
Open the appropriate game
template , Click the customization icon and then click the + to add a
new command .
Type in Frost Armor , then tab over to the key binding side
and hold down Shift and hit 6 , type a ; then a 5 then another ; and
finally hold down
Shift and hit 1 then click away from the input
windows
( You ca n't Tab or Esc out from here because it will think you
wanted to add that key as a command ) .
Click the A to Save As a new
template ( you ca n't overwrite the default ) give your new template a
name and hit enter to save it .
In the lower left hand corner it shows
the current loaded template ; click on the drop down box to the right
and select the template you just built so it's now the loaded template
.
All in all , I found this program to be rock solid in its execution and
the interface is slick and easy to use .
I have tested it in
PvE soloing , PvP and PvE raiding and have found uses for it in all
facets of the game .
While I personally do not use it for anything super
critical in a raid situation such as actual spell casting , I have found
that it is a great tool for targeting , assisting and speeding up many
of the mundane things I do during a raid .
In PvP it was pretty
remarkable in helping my overall speed in combat by allowing me to keep
my hands focused on movement and spell casting while I used the voice
application to speed my shape shifting and assist / targeting
functions .
Perhaps if I played a DPS role in raiding it would
further expand its usefulness .
The main drawback for me in Say 2 Play
is the speed of voice recognition compared to my perceived hand speed ,
but this is no way a slight on this app .
It has the fastest recognition
I have ever used and its failure rate was so miniscule I was completely
blown away .
Say 2
Play is a great tool to help enhance your gaming experience that
when used properly can feel like a third hand .
Like all new additions
to an established routine it does take some getting used to and small
increases in its implementation make the transitions much
smoother .
After several sessions with this software it has become
almost second nature to me and I find myself adding more and more
commands to help me in all situations .
It really is limited
only by your imagination .
Kudos to the guys and gals at Say 2
Play for a great app .
While I do n’t feel this software will be received well by all
levels of WoW gamers , I think those that are comfortable with advanced
key binds and incorporate macros already in their game play will find
it a great addition to their arsenals .
Until next week , stay
safe and have fun in Azeroth !

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Scientists have a long and unsuccessful history of attempting to convert hydrogen to a metal by squeezing it under incredibly high and steady pressures .
Metallic hydrogen is predicted to be a high - temperature superconductor .
A superconductor is a state of matter where electrons , and thus electricity , can flow indefinitely and without resistance .
In a paper published this week in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a team of scientists from Cornell University and the State University of New York at Stony Brook announce a theoretical study that predicts the metallization of hydrogen - rich mixtures at significantly lower pressures .
By adding small amounts of lithium to hydrogen , the study calculates that the resulting system may be metalized at around one - fourth the pressure required to metalize pure hydrogen .
Funding for the project was provided by the National Science Foundation .
Hydrogen and lithium are the first and third lightest elements in the universe , respectively .
Under the temperature and pressures found on Earth , hydrogen is a gas and lithium is a metal .
In hydrogen gas , the atoms are robustly bonded together in pairs and each hydrogen atom contributes one electron to the bonding .
In chemistry shorthand , hydrogen is called H 2 .
Hydrogen and lithium normally react with each other to form a stable compound .
This lithium - hydrogen compound , or LiH , is not metallic .
Metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in the interiors of planets like Jupiter and Saturn because of the intense gravitational forces and pressures that are found there .

On Earth , researchers have tried to pry loose hydrogen 's electron by squeezing it between the facets of a diamond anvil cell under pressures up to 3.4 million atmospheres .
The pressure at sea level is one atmosphere .
The pressure at the center of the Earth is around 3.5 million atmospheres .
Scientists have not been successful with this method of steady pressures .
They have been , however , with shock - wave methods .
To get around hydrogen 's decidedly fixed stance of not becoming a metal under currently accessible laboratory pressures , the research team used sophisticated computer programs .
The programs theoretically calculate if hydrogen can be metalized by combining a lithium atom with varying numbers of hydrogen atoms .
The programs also compute if metallic hydrogen can be made under pressures achievable in a laboratory .
The lithium and hydrogen combinations predicted by the study currently do not exist on Earth .
One of the combinations predicted by the team contains one lithium atom for every six hydrogen atoms or LiH 6 .
The complex calculations predict that in the hypothetical compound the Li atom is triggered to release its lone outer electron , which is then distributed over the three H 2 molecules .
Under pressure , the hypothetical reaction forms a stable and metallic hydrogen compound .
The calculations also predict that LiH6 could be a metal at normal pressures .
However , under these conditions it is not stable and would decompose to form LiH and H 2 .
" The stable and metallic LiH 6 compound is predicted to form around 1 million atmospheres , which is around 25 percent of the pressure required to metalize hydrogen by itself , " said Eva Zurek , lead author of the paper and an assistant professor of chemistry at The State University of New York , Buffalo .
" Interestingly , between approximately 1 and 1.6 million atmospheres , all the LiH combinations studied were stable or metastable and all were metallic , " said Roald Hoffmann , co-author , recipient of the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry and Cornell 's Frank H.T. Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters , Emeritus .
Another one of the hypothetical compounds studied by the team was composed of one lithium atom and two hydrogen atoms or LiH 2 .
" The theoretical study opens the exciting possibility that non-traditional combinations of light elements under high pressure can produce metallic hydrogen under experimentally accessible pressures and lead to the discovery of new materials and new states of matter , " said Daryl Hess , a program director in the NSF Division of Materials Research .
" Once again , these researchers have taken chemistry to a new frontier , " said Carol Bessel , a program director in the NSF Division of Chemistry .
" They have described , through their theories and calculations , molecules that test our fundamental assumptions about atoms , molecules and structures .
In doing so , they challenge the experimentalists to make what they have imagined in their minds a reality to be held in the hand . "
The team members believe the information gleaned from the study suggests that one may combine large amounts of hydrogen with other elements .
The information may also some day assist with the design of a metallic hydrogen - based superconductor .
" We have already been in touch with laboratory experimentalists about how LiH6 might be fabricated , starting perhaps with very finely divided forms of the common LiH compound along with extra hydrogen , " said Neil W. Ashcroft , co-author , and Cornell 's Horace White Professor of Physics , Emeritus .

On the path to metallic hydrogen
Acting is what makes you happy , reacting is what makes you miserable .
Whenever you act , you perform a conscious choice , you decide you ’re going to do that thing .
You become responsible .
But when you react , you follow somebody else ’s choice , you ’re responding to an external stimulus .
You ’re not responsible anymore , you leave the responsibility to the stimulus .
When you act , you ’re the pupeteeer , when you react , you ’re the puppet .
Choice versus Context
Acting is independent of the context , reacting is totally dependent of the context .
You may be in favorable contexts at times .
When you ’re a child , most of the time you ’re in a continuous favorable context .
The problem is that context is artificial , you are protected by your parents .
While you ’re a kid , in a favorable context , acting or reacting are basically the same : whatever you do the context will remain favorable .
Your parents will love and protect you no matter what .
But once you get out from their protection , you may hit some very unfriendly contexts .
And here you ’ll learn the real difference between conscious action and powerless reaction .
If you consciously choose success , you do n’t really care about context .
You ’re going to be successful no matter what .
You act , you ’re consciously building your own way .
You chose to get there no matter what .
But if you do n’t make this choice , and your life is just a reaction to a chaotic flow of stimuli , then anything in the surroundings will contribute to your fall .
It ’s you who let the context do that , and you did this by resigning from your own command , by reacting instead of acting .
For instance , being miserable after losing your job , that is a reaction .
The context was really hard for you and you lost something .
The “ normal ” reaction is to be sad , worried , discouraged and miserable .
On the other hand , being confident , manifesting hope and starting to look for another job ( or even starting your own business ) , that is a conscious choice .
Losing your job is just a fact .
What you do about this fact is what really matters .
Reward And Frustration
Acting is rewarding , reacting is frustrating .
Every time you act on something , you are rewarded in some way .
Not every conscious action will be successful .
You may fail at times .
Maybe many times .
But you still get your reward .
When you fail , the reward is in learning .
You made a choice , you acted in a specific way and you learned something , even if the action was a complete failure .
If you react , all you get is frustration .
You did n’t make a choice , you just responded to some stimulus .
Maybe you wanted something else , but instead of choosing an action , you automatically reacted to that stimulus .
There is no way you can get a reward if you ’re reacting to something .
Even if the initial stimulus was positive .
For instance , you blindly fall in love with somebody .
That ’s a positive stimulus and you reacted to it .
After the initial , unconscious chemistry phase , you have a choice : to love and accept no matter what .
If you do n’t consciously chose to love no matter what , you ’ll get hurt .
Instead of accepting the other one , you ’ll start to control him .
In love , jealousy is a reaction , unconditional acceptance is a conscious action .
Choosing versus Enduring
The difference between action and reaction is not always simple .
Most of the time we ’re acting by habit , and habits are just safe reactions .
We know how to ride a bike , we learned how to do it , when we ’re on the bike , we ’re just reacting to it .
It ’s a safe reaction .
Many of our habits are safe reactions .
But some of them are just stupid .
Some of the most dangerous safe reactions are related to money .
We tend to react to economic stimulus and news , rather then act upon them .
For instance , if there ’s news about a bad economic context , we ’re starting to protect our investments .
That ’s a safe reaction .
The bad economic context may or may not hurt us directly , we never really know that .
But the pre-programmed reaction to cover our savings will emerge without any control from our part .
A much better approach would be to directly act upon our finances .
For instance , it ’s not uncommon that investment is much more profitable during hard economic conditions .
A lot of stuff , including real estate , is getting cheaper .
Running to protect our money , by reaction , instead of investing it , by conscious action , will be stupid .
Again , the economic context it ’s a fact , everybody will feel it , what really matters is our attitude towards it , our choices .
Results versus Excuses
Action creates results , reaction creates excuses .
Every time you consciously chose something , you are producing results .
You are the one who started everything , hence the reality obeyed you .
Again , even if the action was , by any standard , a failure .
Reality responded to your stimulus and created a result .
Maybe it was n’t the result you wanted , but it ’s still a result .
If you ’re reacting to something or somebody else , you are producing excuses .
Your reactions to external stimulus will seldom be aligned with your internal values .
If you chose to react to stimulus , you ’re already giving up your values and empower the stimulus .
You ’re not acting , you are giving out control .
Most of the time , your reactions will try to protect yourself from apparently bad things : somebody yelling at you , losing your job , being left by your partner .
A typical reaction to all of these will be frustration .
And perhaps sadness , lack of hope , misery .
So , after the yelling is gone , after the job is gone , after the partner is gone and after your miserable reaction , all you will be left with are excuses .
It could have been the other way around , but it is n’t .
Sorry .
***
A typical reaction after reading this post will be to think a little bit , to identify possible matches with your own behavioral patterns and then to forget it while gazing at the next funny cat picture on the web .
A conscious action will be to bookmark it , to share it with as many friends as you can and to comment on it .
I ’m joking , of course .
But I ’m consciously choosing to joke with you by writing this blog post , instead of gazing at the wall in my office and thinking life sucks .
And this action will certainly create some great results .

Apple on Wednesday released the iPhone 3.1 software update , as predicted .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs introduced the update on stage at the Yerba Buena Center during the “ Rock and Roll ” event .
The software includes a handful of new features and bug fixes .
With over 75,000 apps in the App Store , it can be difficult to find new applications .
Apple ’s extended its Genius media - recommendation algorithm to iPhone applications .
It looks at the apps you already own and makes recommendations based on that information .
In addition iPhone 3.1 beefs up the iPhone ’s ringtone capability , allowing you to download over 30,000 ringtones from major labels via a Ringtones section in the iPhone ’s iTunes application .
Ringtones will cost $ 1.29 apiece , and automatically show up in the iPhone ’s Settings once they ’ve been downloaded .
Also included in the iPhone OS 3.1 update are a number of iTunes 9 - related features , such as support for Genius Mixes , automatically generated playlists of tracks based on your library ; the ability to organize applications on your iPhone 's
Home screen in iTunes ; new syncing options for music , movies , TV shows , podcasts , and photos ; and iTunes U content organization .
Furthermore , iPhone 3.1 brings with it the ability to redeem iTunes gift cards , codes , and certificates in the App Store ( a feature that briefly appeared in iPhone 3.0 then later disappeared ) as well as a way to view available iTunes account credits in both the App Store and iTunes Store .
Video features get a couple of new additions in 3.1 with the ability to save videos from both Mail and MMS into the Camera Roll ( U.S. users will have to wait for AT&T to roll out MMS functionality on September 25 in order to use the latter ) .
You can also now save a copy of a trimmed video clip , which avoids overriding the original clip .
On the iPhone 3GS , Voice Control is now accessible via a Bluetooth headset and there 's an option to use the 3GS 's Home button to activate Accessibility features .
There are a number of other enhancements and bug fixes included in the release , including a patch for an issue that could cause application icons to display incorrectly .
i Phone 3.1 is free for all iPhone and iPod touch owners will be available on Wednesday via iTunes .
Check out our full first look at all the new features and functionality of iPhone 3.1 .
Here are pertinent observations from two accomplished political veterans at a forum Tuesday night at Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government .

Why does it work so well ?
Hulu Desktop was only available for Windows and Mac OS X when it launched in May .
This week , the popular streaming video service has finally brought its experimental desktop player to the Linux platform .
Installation packages are available for download from the Hulu Labs website .
I tested Hulu Desktop on Ubuntu 9.04 with Flash 10 on my quad - core desktop computer .
The program is built almost entirely with Flash and obviously does n't use any native widget frameworks .
Adobe 's Flash implementation for Linux is lousy , so I began my tests with relatively low expectations .
As expected , Hulu Desktop is extremely resource intensive on the Linux platform .
It uses significantly more memory and processor power than Totem when playing full - screen video content .
Aside from occasional stuttering , video playback performance was adequate when I was not running any other resource - intensive tasks in the background .
Installation packages are supplied for Ubuntu and Fedora .
The Hulu Labs website indicates that support for additional distributions could potentially be added in the future .
The only dependencies are GTK + , GLib , and Adobe 's Flash player .
LIRC is an optional dependency , but is required for remote control support .
Keyboard and mouse operation are both fully supported , so LIRC is not strictly necessary .
To install it on Ubuntu , I downloaded the package and ran it with gdebi-gtk .
The Ubuntu installation package , which is less than a megabyte , includes the program icon , the GNOME . desktop file , the actual binary , and a keymap file that gets stored in /etc / huludesktop .
The program can be launched from the command line or from the desktop 's Applications menu .
When I first tried to run it , I got an error message indicating that it could not find Flash .
I had to open the ~/.huludesktop configuration file and manually input the path of libflashplayer .
so in the flash_location line .
After I set that configuration value , I was able to run the program .
You can enable full - screen mode in Hulu Desktop simply by maximizing the window .
Full - screen worked relatively well with my dual - monitor setup .
One of the minor annoyances of using Flash in the browser on a dual - head Linux system is that it will terminate full - screen mode if you click on anything that is displaying in your other monitor .
This made it difficult to play a Hulu video while working on something else .
Hulu Desktop fortunately does n't suffer from that limitation .
That aspect alone makes it a lot more practical for me than the Web interface .
Usability is reasonable , but there are some areas in the program where input support is a bit wonky .
For example , when you are typing in your login credentials , hitting the left arrow key will shift focus to the column to the left rather than moving the text cursor back one character in the text box .
Similarly , ctrl + backspace , which is used on Linux to erase the last word in a textbox , does n't work in Hulu 's textboxes .
I also ran into a little bit of difficulty using the scroll wheel to navigate through content listings .
Despite the performance problems and other minor issues , Hulu Desktop is acceptably decent for a beta .
Its weaknesses mostly seem attributable to the use of Flash as a runtime rather than problems intrinsic to the program itself .

Serena Williams ' US
Open title defence ended in bizarre , ugly fashion , when she was docked a point on match point after yelling and shaking her racket in the direction of an official who called a foot fault .
Williams lost to unseeded , unranked Kim Clijsters 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 in a taut semifinal that featured plenty of powerful groundstrokes by both women .
No one will remember a single shot that was struck , though , because of the unusual , dramatic way it finished .
With Williams serving at 5 - 6 , 15 - 30 in the second set , she faulted on her first serve .
On the second serve , a line judge called a foot fault , making it a double - fault - a call rarely , if ever , seen at that stage of any match , let alone the semifinals of a Grand Slam tournament .
That made the score 15 - 40 , putting Clijsters one point from victory .
Instead of stepping to the baseline to serve again , Williams went over and shouted and cursed at the line judge , pointing at her and shaking a ball at her .
Williams already had been give a code violation warning when she broke her racket after losing the first set .
So the chair umpire now awarded a penalty point to Clijsters , ending the match .
" She was called for a foot fault , and a point later , she said something to a line umpire , and it was reported to the chair , and that resulted in a point penalty , " Earley explained .
" And it just happened that point penalty was match point .
It was a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct . "
When the ruling was announced , Williams walked around the net to the other end of the court to shake hands with a stunned Clijsters , who did not appear to understand what had happened .
" I used to have a real temper , and I 've gotten a lot better , " Williams said in her postmatch news conference .
" So I know you do n't believe me , but I used to be worse .
Yes , yes , indeed . "
Lost in the theatrics was Clijsters ' significant accomplishment :
In only her third tournament back after 2 1/ 2 years in retirement , the 26 - year - old Belgian became the first mother to reach a Grand Slam final since Evonne Goolagong Cawley won Wimbledon 1980 .
Clijsters had n't competed at the US Open since winning the 2005 championship .
Now she will play for her second career major title against No. 9 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark , who beat Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the other rain - delayed women 's semifinal .

Underage drinkers would have to be at least 18 if they want to imbibe with their parents in Wisconsin taverns , under a bill proponents say would help discourage drinking by teens .
Under current law , minors of any age are allowed to consume alcohol in a licensed tavern , restaurant or other licensed premise if they 're accompanied by a parent , guardian or spouse who has reached the legal drinking age of 21 .
But the bill considered Wednesday by the Senate 's Committee on Children and Families and Workforce Development would require that children who drink with parents and guardians at taverns or restaurants be at least 18 .
Wisconsin has the highest alcohol use among high school students in the country , as well as the highest rates of alcohol consumption , binge drinking and heavy drinking , according to the AWARE Coalition , a group of about 50 health and medical , law enforcement and insurance groups pushing for a stronger response to alcohol abuse in Wisconsin .
" This bill will not solve all of our state 's problems with alcohol , but it certainly will help reduce some of the problems , " bill author Sen. Judy Robson ( D - Beloit ) said at the hearing .
" Drinking at a young age can shape a person 's drinking patterns for a lifetime . "
Many who spoke in support of the measure said it did n't go far enough , arguing that taverns and restaurants should n't serve anyone younger than age 21 .
Despite the perception it is a widespread practice , it 's rare for taverns to serve alcohol to minors , said Scott Stenger , lobbyist for the Tavern League of Wisconsin , which supports the bill .
" We 're not interested in having customers who are under 18 , " Stenger said .
There is more Capitol activity than ever on drunken driving and related issues in the wake of the Journal Sentinel 's " Wasted in Wisconsin " series that reported on the statewide toll of drunken driving , and other news stories .
Drunken driving is expected to be a primary focus for the fall legislative session .
Gov. Jim Doyle , who supports several changes to laws to curb drunken driving , said he would consider the bill once he sees language that lawmakers send to him .
But he said he does n't believe it's as necessary as some other changes lawmakers have proposed , such as making third - offense drunken driving a felony .
" I do n't see this nearly at the same kind of level as the drunk driving laws we 're talking about , " Doyle said .
Edgerton Mayor Erik Thompson has urged lawmakers to change the law after a New York Times story last year highlighted examples of young people being served alcohol at a bar in his city , Robson said .
Julie Coquard , vice president of Wollersheim Winery in Prairie du Sac , provided the only opposition to the bill .
She said parents who bring children on winery tours have the option of allowing their kids to taste wine out of their parents ' glasses .
" The intent of the proposal may have been to deter parents who make bad choices , but it does n't allow parents to educate their kids in a responsible way , " Coquard said .
The part of the brain that controls judgment is n't well - developed in teens , which means they are n't as well - equipped as adults to make good decisions , practice self - control and weigh the consequences of their actions , Paul Grossberg , a pediatrician at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , told the committee .
" Having your parents say it 's OK for you to drink in a tavern at age 15 is n't OK because your brain is n't really ready for it , " testified Michael Miller , medical director of NewStart , a drug and alcohol treatment program at Madison 's Meriter Hospital .
" Kids who drink do n't drink like adults who drink . "
Tom Farley , brother of late comedian Chris Farley , said the proposal is flawed .
" It will be nothing that we in Wisconsin should be particularly proud of , " said Farley , who heads the Chris Farley Foundation , which works to prevent substance abuse .
" Wisconsin will still be left with a law that fails to protect the health and safety of our youth population . "
The committee is expected to vote on whether to advance the measure to the full Senate on Sept.
9 . An Assembly committee will hold a hearing on a similar version of the measure next week .

SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) can be a very complicated subject with varying correct answers .
They are several key areas to help you with your SEO and get more people to read your articles , blogs and web pages .
These free web sites can get you started with SEO areas like keywords , proper keyword density , content and links .
Keywords and Keyword Density
Keyword density is the percentage your relevant keywords show up in an article , and is important to your SEO and page ranking in the search engines .
If you have a 1,000 word article and your keyword appears 10 times in the article , that is 1 % .
There is some disagreement as to what is the best keyword density percentage .
Some say between 4 % and 7 % .
Different search engines also have their own percentages they look for .
If you have your keywords show up too many times in an article , that is known as " keyword stuffing " and search engines might not rank you at all , or disqualify your blog or article for this reason .
Too low a keyword percentage and you might not rank very high in the search engines .
According to Donald Pennington ’s SEO article , you should never exceed 5 % .
I think that is a good rule of thumb to follow .
When you write an article it is best to keep SEO in the back of your mind and try to include your keywords so they fit nicely in the article without ruining your article .
When you are done with the article you can then use a text analyzer to check your keywords density percentage and if needed tailor the article slightly to get a higher keyword percentage for better SEO if needed .
Free Web Sites to Check Your Keyword Density
There are several web sites where you can copy and paste your article and look at different keywords and their percentages .
· Textalyser .net lets you paste your article and check it before you submit it .
· Keyword Analyzer also lets you paste your article to check for keywords before submitting it .
· Live Keyword Analysis also lets you paste in your article and you enter in your keywords , it returns the percentages .
Article Readability
It is important that your articles are readable .
Textalyser.net gives a readability score .
If you use Microsoft Word , you can also get a readability score .
There is a metric known as the Flesch - Kincaid readability score and a corresponding US grade level score .
An optimal Flesch - Kincaid score is 60 - 70 .
If you get a grade level score of 7.5 , this indicates a person halfway through the 7th grade could read and understand the article .
No , this does n’t mean it will look like a 7th grader wrote it .
It shows the general ease of readability of your article .
To use the Microsoft Word readability tool , click on Tools , Options , Spelling & Grammar , and then select the Show Readability Statistics box .
Do a spell check of your article and when that is finished a box will show up with the readability score .
Links , Backlinks and Interlinking
Backlinks , also known as inbound links are important for SEO .
Search engines will look at the number of quality inbound links to your web page or articles .
Quality can mean the ranking of the web site that has a link to your articles and the relevance .
If you have an inbound link to your gardening article from a car repair web site , that might not count for much , but if you have the inbound link from a major garden web site or garden company , that is quality and relevance .
Anchor links are helpful for SEO .
This basically means to include your keyword in the link .
Instead of using “ click here ” , make the link part of the sentence with your keyword or put the title of the article with the keyword in it , use something like “ see this article about SEO ” as the phrase you use in the link if one of your keywords is SEO .
This is known as anchor text .
Steve Feller has an example of this in his SEO article .
There is disagreement as to whether interlinking is helpful , some articles say yes and others say no .
Linking one article on Factoidz.com to another article on Factoidz is interlinking and can be viewed favorably by search engines .
Plus it gets exposure for your other articles in a related area .
I believe it is helpful for your SEO .
SEO
Pro will show the list of web sites with links and also show if the web site has the NO FOLLOW tag .
If it does , that does n’t help your SEO with links but could still get you more traffic .
· SEO Pro is a great backlink checker
· WebMasters Backlink Checker is another great backlink checker .
· Webconfs backlink builder is a tool where you enter in one of your keywords or themes to your blogs and articles and the tool returns a list of related web sites for your theme that you can put links on .
· Iwebtools is a toolbox of SEO tools .
I used to think that the social bookmark sites like Digg , Mixx , Delicious and Facebook added backlinks , but I did n’t see any of those in the backlink list of my articles .
I did see backlinks from Reddit.com , Simpy.com and Diigo.com .
Adding Your Blog to the Search Engines
It is helpful for your SEO if you can add your blogs to search engines and blog listing sites .
· Google search engine submission .
· Yahoo search engine submission
· Bing search engine submission is very easy .
· The Open Directory is a great place to submit your blogs and web sites but it takes more work .
You have to pick the right category and write to them about your site .
· Technorati is another site to submit your blogs .
I found two different ways to submit your blogs on Google and Yahoo .
One way was just enter in your blog 's URL , another more complicated way is to authenticate your blog by adding HTML code into your blog .
You might need to find someone to help you with that .
I can help with inserting this code into a Google blogspot blog .
This should get you started with your SEO .

THIS WEEK marks the 40th anniversary of the historic first moon landing in July 1969 .
Or does it ?
Conspiracy theories have persisted over the decades , with books , websites and even organisations dedicated to “ uncovering ” Nasa ’s gigantic hoax , writes JOHN GIBBONS
Laughable ?
Yes , but these theories are difficult to refute precisely because of the impossibility of proving a negative .
Buzz Aldrin , the second man to set foot on the moon , said last week he felt sorry for the “ gullible people ” being taken in by this nonsense .
The fact that millions earnestly believe this stuff is neither trite nor trivial .
Of course , if someone writing in a major newspaper were to dignify this hokum by endorsing it , they should expect to be on the receiving end of some well - earned ridicule .
Yet the mockery of evidence - based science by quacks , egoists , curmudgeons and ideologues is anything but marginal .
Earlier this month , Daily Mailcolumnist Andrew Alexander wrote a piece about global warming , reheating a hotchpotch of Junior Cert level science errors in a rambling assault on “ environmental fanaticism ” .
Yes , you ’ve guessed it , the whole thing is a conspiracy theory , dreamed up by evil scientists involved in the largest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed .
Their sinister agenda ?
The crazed pursuit of research grants , possibly .
The author casually dismisses perhaps the strongest scientific consensus ever to emerge on any major issue .
Sadly , this is anything but unusual .
Kevin Myers in the Irish Independentwears his non-understanding of climate science as a badge of honour , cheerfully recycling , in May 2008 , wild claims produced by others of a similar hue , such as the Sunday Telegraph ’sChristopher Booker .
Paddy O’Keeffe ’s recent piece in the Farmer ’s Journalis so so bizarre it ’s completely off the wall .
So what exactly is going on here ?
Bad Scienceby Ben Goldacre has some answers .
It is a blistering exposé of the blight of science ignorance and the triumph of wilful stupidity .
He lampoons all forms of quackery .
Among people working in the media , science literacy is the exception , not the norm .
Some journalists , Goldacre reckons , feel intellectually offended by how hard they find science , and so “ conclude that it all must simply be arbitrary , made - up nonsense ” .
Commentators thus feel free to “ pick a result from anywhere you like , and if it suits your agenda , then that ’s that : nobody can take it away from you with their clever words because it ’s all just game - playing , it just depends on who you ask ” .
This may be harmless fun when it comes to Elvis sightings , but in the teeth of humanity ’s profoundest existential crisis in 100 centuries , misleading the public is reckless .
The real purpose of the scientific method , according to author Robert Pirsig , “ is to make sure nature has n’t misled you into thinking you know something you actually do n’t know ” .
We humans reason anecdotally , depending heavily on hunches and intuition ; it ’s an effective way of dealing with the constant deluge of information we have to process .
The price for this convenience is that we are susceptible to what are known as cognitive illusions .
We see patterns in the genuinely random ; we see causal relationships where they do n’t exist .
We seek out information and people to confirm our own biases , and reject these if they do n’t fit .
We can also be poor judges of our own aptitudes and limitations .
Depending on intuition it may be appropriate when deciding what to watch on television , but it ’s the precise opposite to how the scientific method works .
And for good reason .
In 1946 , paediatrician Dr Benjamin Spock published the bestselling Baby and Child Care .
It included one utterly wrong recommendation : that babies should sleep on their tummies – advice that led to thousands of avoidable cot deaths .
That ’s why we do science : to weed out all those interesting hunches and replace them with rigorously tested scientific facts , however dull .
Everyone now knows that cigarettes are dangerous ; 50 years ago , everyone – including doctors – smoked .
The same goes for leaded petrol , ozone depletion , CO2 and a host of other hazards that we have been alerted to over the decades by rigorous , scientific research .
The media caricature of science as unfathomable , authoritarian and capricious is a dangerous fiction .
It allows media - savvy showmen to set themselves up as “ experts ” .
Self - styled nutritionist Patrick Holford bashed conventional medicine on the Late Late Showsome time back , in favour of his hip “ alternative ” methods .
For instance , he says the anti-Aids treatment , AZT , is “ potentially harmful and proving less effective than vitamin C ” .
That ’s one serious claim .
Supporting evidence ?
Nil .
When science is reduced to a game , anyone can play .
Scientists say the Arctic ice sheet is in danger of disappearing ; I say they ’re just stuffy old sausages and , besides , the world is actually getting colder .
Maybe it ’s all about sunspots , or whatever other discredited theory can be shoehorned to match my intellectual whims .
We trusted science to deliver dramatic improvements in health and life expectancy , as well as genuine technological advances .
Now , at the time of our greatest peril , we ’ve turned to the quacks , blowhards and snake - oil salesmen .
As Samuel Beckett observed : “ We are all born mad ; some remain so . ”
What if tomorrow morning you woke up to headlines that yet another Chinese drone bombing on U.S. soil killed several dozen ranchers in a rural community while they were sleeping ?
That a drone aircraft had come across the Canadian border in the middle of the night and carried out the latest of many attacks ?
What if it was claimed that many of the victims harbored anti-Chinese sentiments , but most of the dead were innocent women and children ?
And what if the Chinese administration , in an effort to improve its public image in the U.S. , had approved an aid package to send funds to help with American roads and schools and promote Chinese values here ?
Most Americans would not stand for it .
Yet the above hypothetical events are similar to what our government is doing in Pakistan .
Last week , Congress did approve an aid package for Pakistan for the stated purposes of improving our image and promoting democracy .
I again made the point on the floor of the House that still no one seems to hear :
What if this happened on U.S. soil ?
What if innocent Americans were being killed in repeated drone attacks carried out by some foreign force who was trying to fix our problems for us ?
Would sending money help their image ?
If another nation committed this type of violence and destruction on our homeland , would we be at all interested in adopting their values ?
Sadly , one thing that has entirely escaped modern American foreign policy is empathy .
Without much humility or regard for human life , our foreign policy has been reduced to alternately bribing and bombing other nations , all with the stated goal of " promoting democracy . "
But if a country democratically elects a leader who is not sufficiently pro-American , our government will refuse to recognize them , will impose sanctions on them , and will possibly even support covert efforts to remove them .
Democracy is obviously not what we are interested in .
It is more likely that our government is interested in imposing its will on other governments .
This policy of endless intervention in the affairs of others is very damaging to American liberty and security .
If we were really interested in democracy , peace , prosperity , and safety , we would pursue more free trade with other countries .
Free and abundant trade is much more conducive to peace because it is generally bad business to kill your customers .
When one ’s livelihood is on the line , and the business agreements are mutually beneficial , it is in everyone ’s best interests to maintain cooperative and friendly relations and not kill each other .
But instead , to force other countries to bend to our will , we impose trade barriers and sanctions .
If our government really wanted to promote freedom , Americans would be free to travel and trade with whoever they wished .
And if we would simply look at our own policies around the world through the eyes of others , we would understand how these actions make us more targeted and therefore less safe from terrorism .
The only answer is get back to free trade with all and entangling alliances with none .
It is our bombs and sanctions and condescending aid packages that isolate us .
KINSTON , N.C. | Voters in this small city decided overwhelmingly last year to do away with the party affiliation of candidates in local elections , but the Obama administration recently overruled the electorate and decided that equal rights for black voters cannot be achieved without the Democratic Party .
The Justice Department ’s ruling , which affects races for City Council and mayor , went so far as to say partisan elections are needed so that black voters can elect their “ candidates of choice ” - identified by the department as those who are Democrats and almost exclusively black .
The department ruled that white voters in Kinston will vote for blacks only if they are Democrats and that therefore the city cannot get rid of party affiliations for local elections because that would violate black voters ’ right to elect the candidates they want .
Several federal and local politicians would like the city to challenge the decision in court .
They say voter apathy is the largest barrier to black voters ’ election of candidates they prefer and that the Justice Department has gone too far in trying to influence election results here .
Stephen LaRoque , a former Republican state lawmaker who led the drive to end partisan local elections , called the Justice Department ’s decision “ racial as well as partisan . ”
“ On top of that , you have an unelected bureaucrat in Washington , D.C. , overturning a valid election , ” he said .
“ That is un-American . ”
The decision , made by the same Justice official who ordered the dismissal of a voting rights case against members of the New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia , has irritated other locals as well .
They bristle at federal interference in this city of nearly 23,000 people , two - thirds of whom are black .
In interviews in sleepy downtown Kinston - a place best known as a road sign on the way to the Carolina beaches - residents said partisan voting is largely unimportant because people are personally acquainted with their elected officials and are familiar with their views .
“ To begin with , ‘ nonpartisan elections ’ is a misconceived and deceiving statement because even though no party affiliation shows up on a ballot form , candidates still adhere to certain ideologies and people understand that , and are going to identify with who they feel has their best interest at heart , ” said William Cooke , president of the Kinston / Lenoir County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Mr. Cooke said his group does not take a position on this issue and would not disclose his personal stance , but expressed skepticism about the Justice Department ’s involvement .
Others noted the absurdity of partisan elections since Kinston is essentially a one - party city anyway ; no one among more than a half - dozen city officials and local residents was able to recall a Republican winning office here .
Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyar denied that the decision was intended to help the Democratic Party .
He said the ruling was based on “ what the facts are in a particular jurisdiction ” and how it affects blacks ’ ability to elect the candidates they favor .
“ The determination of who is a ‘ candidate of choice ’ for any group of voters in a given jurisdiction is based on an analysis of the electoral behavior of those voters within a particular jurisdiction , ” he said .
Critics on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights are not so sure .
“ The Voting Rights Act is supposed to protect against situations when black voters are locked out because of racism , ” said Abigail Thernstrom , a Republican appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights .
“ There is no entitlement to elect a candidate they prefer on the assumption that all black voters prefer Democratic candidates . ”
Located about 60 miles from the Atlantic Coast in eastern North Carolina , Kinston has a history of defying governmental authority .
During Colonial times , the fledgling city was known as Kingston - named for King George III - but residents dropped the “ g ” from the city ’s name after the American Revolution .
In Kinston ’s heyday of manufacturing and tobacco farming , it was a bustling collection of shops , movie theaters and restaurants .
Now , many of those buildings are vacant - a few have been filled by storefront churches - and residents are left hoping for better days .
In November ’s election - one in which “ hope ” emerged as a central theme - the city had uncommonly high voter turnout , with more than 11,000 of the city ’s 15,000 voters casting ballots .
Kinston ’s blacks voted in greater numbers than whites .
Whites typically cast the majority of votes in Kinston ’s general elections .
Kinston residents contributed to Barack Obama ’s victory as America ’s first black president and voted by a margin of nearly 2 - to - 1 to eliminate partisan elections in the city .
The measure appeared to have broad support among both white and black voters , as it won a majority in seven of the city ’s nine black - majority voting precincts and both of its white - majority precincts .
But before nonpartisan elections could be implemented , the city had to get approval from the Justice Department .
Kinston is one of the areas subject to provisions of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act , which requires the city to receive Justice Department approval before making any changes to voting procedures .
Kinston is one of 12,000 voting districts in areas of 16 states , almost exclusively in the South , that the Voting Rights Act declared to have had a history of racial discrimination .
In a letter dated Aug. 17 , the city received the Justice Department ’s answer : Elections must remain partisan because the change ’s “ effect will be strictly racial . ”
“ Removing the partisan cue in municipal elections will , in all likelihood , eliminate the single factor that allows black candidates to be elected to office , ” Loretta King , who at the time was the acting head of the Justice Department ’s civil rights division , wrote in a letter to the city .
Ms. King wrote that voters in Kinston vote more along racial than party lines and without the potential for voting a straight Democratic ticket , “ the limited remaining support from white voters for a black Democratic candidate will diminish even more . ”
Ms. King is the same official who put a stop to the New Black Panther Party case .
In that case , the Justice Department filed a civil complaint in Philadelphia after two members of the black revolutionary group dressed in quasi-military garb stood outside a polling place on election last year and purportedly intimidated voters with racial insults , slurs and a nightstick .
After a judge ordered a default judgments against the Panthers , who refused to answer the charges or appear in court , the Justice Department dropped the charges against all but one of the defendants , saying “ the facts and the law did not support pursuing ” them .
Ms. King ’s letter in the Kinston case states that because of the low turnout black voters must be “ viewed as a minority for analytical purposes , ” and that “ minority turnout is relevant ” to determining whether the Justice Department should be allowed a change to election protocol .
Black voters account for 9,702 of the city ’s 15,402 registered voters but typically do n’t vote at the rates whites do .
As a result of the low turnout , Ms. King wrote , “ black voters have had limited success in electing candidates of choice during recent municipal elections . ”
“ It is the partisan makeup of the general electorate that results in enough white cross-over to allow the black community to elect a candidate of choice , ” she wrote .
Mrs. Thernstrom of the civil rights commission blasted the department ’s interpretation of the law .
“ The Voting Rights Act is not supposed to be compensating for failure of voters to show up on Election Day , ” she said .
“ The Voting Rights Act does n’t guarantee an opportunity to elect a ‘ candidate of choice . ’ …
My ‘ candidate of choice ’ loses all the time in an election . ”
When asked whether Justice had ever “ either granted or denied ” requests either “ to stop partisan elections or implement partisan elections , ” Mr. Miyar , the department spokesman , said it was impossible to retrieve past decisions on that basis .
But he did provide , based on the recollection of a department lawyer , a single precedent - a decision during the Clinton administration denying a bid from a South Carolina school district to drop partisan elections .
That decision employs similar reasoning and language as the Kinston ruling : “ Implementation of nonpartisan elections … appears likely to deprive black supported candidates of meaningful partisan based support and to exacerbate racial polarization between black and white voters . ”
But the 1994 decision does n’t mention the necessity of the Democratic Party and does n’t mention low turnout among black voters in that school district as a factor affecting their ability to elect candidates they prefer .
Kinston City Council member Joseph Tyson , a Democrat who favors partisan elections , said nothing is stopping black voters in Kinston from going to the polls .
“ Unfortunately , I ’m very disappointed with the apathy that we have in Kinston among the Afro- American voters , ” he said .
Mr. Tyson , who is one of two black members of the six - member City Council , said the best way to help black voters in Kinston is to change the council ’s structure from citywide voting to representation by district .
Kinston voters currently cast as many votes in the at - large races as there are council seats up for election - typically three , or two and the mayor .
“ Whether it ’s partisan or nonpartisan is not a big issue to me , whether or not the city is totally represented is what the issue is to me , ” he said .
“ If you have wards and districts , then I feel the total city will be represented . ”
Partisan local elections are a rarity in North Carolina .
According to statistics kept by the University of North Carolina School of Government in Chapel Hill , only nine of the state ’s 551 cities and towns hold partisan elections .
The City Council could take the Justice Department to court to fight decision regarding nonpartisan elections , but such a move seems unlikely .
The council voted 4 - 1 to drop the issue after meeting privately with Justice Department officials in August .
“ What do I plan to do ?
Absolutely , nothing , ” Mr. Tyson said .
“ And I will fight , within Robert ’s Rules of Order , wherever necessary to make sure that decision stands . ”
The Justice ruling and Kinston ’s decision not to fight it comes in the wake of a key Voting Rights
Act case last year .
In that decision , the Supreme Court let a small utility district in Texas seek an exemption from the law ’s requirements to receive Justice Department approval before making any changes to voting procedures .
But the court declined to address whether the law itself is constitutional .
Critics of the law argue it has changed little since its 1965 inception and that the same places the law covered then no longer need Justice Department approval to make changes to voting procedures .
Proponents , including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , said the law is still necessary to ensure equal voting rights for all Americans .
In Kinston , William Barker is the only City Council member who voted to continue discussing whether to challenge the Justice Department ’s ruling .
He said he voted against eliminating partisan elections because the proposed new system would declare a winner simply on who received a plurality of votes instead requiring candidates to reach certain threshold of votes based on turnout .
“ Based on the fact that the voters voted overwhelmingly for it , I would like to see us challenge it based on that fact .
My fight is solely based on fighting what the voters voted on , ” he said .
“ It bothers me , even though I ’m on the winning side now , that you have a small group , an outside group coming in and saying , ‘ Your vote does n’t matter . ’ ”

Rumors about the petition started a few weeks ago on the Rachael Maddow show :
The petition began last week when MSNBC's Rachel Maddow announced that " two major power brokers on the left " were pushing for Democrats to be stripped of their leadership positions if they sided with Republican efforts to block an overhaul of the nation 's health - care system .
Grayson and the Progressive Change group , inspired by the idea , began separate petition drives .
Adam Green , from Progressive Change , told a small media gathering that it was " unacceptable " for Democrats to side with Republicans against a health - care vote .
A doctor , Nilesh Kalyanaraman , announced that " my patients ' lives and health depend on Harry Reid standing up and showing the leadership we expect . "
Next came Grayson , tall and a bit wild , with scuffed cowboy boots under his pinstriped suit , and chest hair poking out over his tie and collar .
He pulled from his breast pocket a study showing that nearly 45,000 Americans die each year because they do n't have health insurance .
" As we stand here right now , " he said , " one or two or three Americans have died because we have not acted yet . "
He continued : " A week ago , I apologized to the dead and their families for our inaction .
Now it 's time to move beyond that and get the job done . "
With that , Grayson walked toward the Hart building .
Reporters followed .
Asked what he would have Reid do differently , the congressman offered no prescription , only a demand : " One way or another , the bill has to pass .
It 's that simple .
As quickly as possible . "
I guess poor widdle Hawwwie was not pleased with this petition .
He had this to say :
" The only thing Senator Reid is worried about right now is putting together a bill that can get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster , " Reid spokesman Jim Manley said .
" He has no intention of stopping by " to get the petition .
http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/...
I guess some will say that Grayson is antagonizing party leaders , but you know what I say :
Good , great , about time , more than about time , its about fucking time that someone did stand up to ' stick Harry with a pitchfork ' even if it was just to see if the skinny little cowardly zombie jerk was still alive .
I hope that Alan Grayson continues to stick him with that pitchfork of 90,000 signatures 90,000 times a day .
Maybe it will wake
Harry the fuck up and get him moving towards ' doing his job , which he is well payed for ' because from where I 'm sitting all he is doing is just taking up wasted space in the Universe , sucking the air out of the Senate Chamber , when I 'd much rather have a fighter and a scrapper like Congressman Grayson getting up in the faces of rapid right wing fake Christian Republicans and filthy little Blue Dogs who are leaving their turds in the halls ways when they 're out whoring for money at the Lobbyist cocktail party .
Congressman Grayson , you are my hero .
Please , stick Harry in the ass for me for anyone else out there who is as sick as I am for all of his ' caving in relentlessly ' for no good reason , other than he 's just a fucking coward that does n't know what the word leadership even means .
My hat is off to you Congressman Grayson .
May you live to be 120 .
May you live to be the oldest Public Servant in Congress , and may you live to see the day , where you are sitting in the seat that Harry Reid occupies as Senate Majority Leader , because he never ever deserved that seat , and someone like Congressman Grayson was born to sit there in perpetuity .
Thanks
UPDATE : Thanks Congressman Grayson -
If you want something done , you got to know who can do it - Our man Grayson !!!!
This past week Congressman Grayson launched UnMaskTheFed.com .
Please take time to sign up and ask your Senators to delay the confirmation of Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve , until the Federal Reserve answers the questions regarding where 2 trillion dollars has disappeared to .
NO MORE LIES , NO MORE CORRUPTION , NO MORE CROOKS AND LIARS , NO MORE FINANCIAL MELTDOWNS AND WALL STREET BAIL OUTS !!!

“ Let ’s deal with the ISI and the Pakistan military and let ’s go recruit these mujahideen .
Here is a very strong argument which is … it was n’t a bad investment to end the Soviet Union but let ’s be careful with what we sow… because we will harvest . ” – US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , April 23 , 2009 .
October 28 , 2009 -- Once again Pakistan has become the focus of world attention .
Every day there is news of the latest suicide attack or military operation , with killings , injuries and the displacing of communities .
Recently schools were ordered closed for more than a week .
Even children talk about death and suicide attacks .
With more than 125 police checkpoints in Islamabad , it has become a fortress city .
Lahore and other large cities are suffering the same fate : there are police road blockades everywhere .
After each terrorist attack authorities issue another security high alert and set up additional barriers .
How ironic that , until recently , officials and the media described these “ terrorists ” as Mujahideen fighting for an Islamic world .
Under immense pressure by the US administration of President Barack Obama , the Pakistan government has launched a series of military operations in various parts of the country .
This has led to an unprecedented wave of killings , with hundreds of thousands more being forced to leave their homes for temporary shelter .
Pushed out of Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks in the US , religious fanatics from different countries have found refuge in Pakistan .
They have two aims : to make Pakistan more Islamic and to teach the government a lesson for its close relationship with US imperialism .
However the price is being paid by ordinary people .
Religious fanatics are the new fascists .
They believe in the physical elimination of their political opponents .
Although they may appear to be anti-imperialist , they are not a progressive force .
Instead they are an extreme right - wing force that wants to turn back the clock of history .
The religion of the state
Pakistan is also known as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan .
Religion is part and parcel of the state .
The constitutions and the judiciary are all beleaguered with Islamic demagogy .
Most of the education syllabus is also coloured with Islamic ideology ; even scientific explanations somehow manage to drag in religion .
Religion has become a way of life .
Every donation to charity ends up in the coffers of the religious institutions .
Although the rationale for the Pakistan state was to be a place for Muslims , it was to be a secular Muslim state .
When the state was formed in 1947 the population was not fundamentalist .
But as time went on Pakistan adopted an Islamic ideology that today gives these fanatics a more favourable ground for the promotion of their dream of an Islamic country .
At the end of the 1970s , with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Washington decided it needed to develop an indigenous counterforce .
In order to fight “ communism ” in Afghanistan , Washington worked closely with Pakistan ’s military dictator , General Zia ul Haq , and the Pakistani intelligence service , the Inter - Services intelligence ( ISI ) .
There are dozens of books explaining the rise of Taliban and Mujahideen under the direct guidance of the US , but the ISI had no reason to cut off funding after the Soviet retreat in 1987 .
If the Americans were no longer interested in these guerillas , the ISI found these jihadis useful in its conflict with India over Kashmir .
Also , there are many religious political parties in Pakistan .
Jamaati islami and Jamiat Ulmai Islam , along with other Sunni and Wahabi political parties , are all for an Islamic revolution .
They also give political support to the religious fanatics of the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Hillary Clinton admits US role
Even Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , acknowledged Washington ’s responsibility in promoting the religious fanatics .
She admitted to a US Congressional sub-committee on April 23 , 2009 , that the US had effectively created the current disastrous situation in Afghanistan :
“ It was President Reagan in partnership with Congress led by Democrats who said , you know what , it sounds like a pretty good idea … let ’s deal with the ISI [ Pakistani intelligence agency ] and the Pakistan military and let ’s go recruit these mujahideen .
Here is a very strong argument which is … it was n’t a bad investment to end the Soviet Union but let ’s be careful with what we sow… because we will harvest . ”
However , it is not only the US that are harvesting what they have sown .
Numerous Pakistan governments were ready to do whatever Washington wanted them to do out of sheer financial greed .
Since 1978 different governments have all been a close US allies .
This includes 20 years of military dictatorship under Zia ( 1977 - 1988 ) and General Musharaf ( 1999-2008 ) .
These various governments enabled religious fanatics to establish religious educational institutions that have changed the country ’s religious culture .
The Madrassas ’ tactics
One of the main strategies used by the fanatics to bring jihad to the youth of Pakistan was through opening religious schools ( madrassas ) .
They mushroomed under the Zia ul Haque dictatorship .
At present , there are religious schools throughout Pakistan .
Of the more than 15,000 registered madrassas , about half are in the Punjab .
Experts estimate the numbers are higher : when the state tried to count them in 2005 , a fifth of the province refused to register .
The madrassas found a place among the working people as they were marketed as offering a free education with religious teachings .
In fact , the failure of the government to provide adequate resources for free public education paved the way for the progress of the madrassas .
Pakistan has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world .
The government spends less than 3 per cent of GDP on education .
Only about half of Pakistanis can read and write , far below the proportion in countries with a similar per-capita income , such as Vietnam .
According to UNESCO , one out of three school - age Pakistani children does not attend school ; of those who do attend , a third drop out by fifth grade .
The enrollment of girls is among the lowest in the world , lagging behind Ethiopia and Yemen .
Though madrassas make up only about 7 per cent of primary schools in Pakistan , their influence is amplified by the inadequacy of public education and the innate religiosity of the countryside , where two - thirds of the population live .
The madrassas are the real breeding grounds for religious fundamentalism .
More than 15,000 registered religious seminaries in the country cater to more than 1.5 million students and more than 55,000 teachers .
Before 2002 , according to the Religious Affairs Ministry , the number of registered madrassas in Pakistan were not more than 6000 .
After 9/11 , the religious fanatics who left Afghanistan came to Pakistan , and with the help of the two provincial governments run by the religious alliance MMA -- North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan -- they were able to quickly establish more madrassas .
By 2007 there were around 13,000 registered seminaries across the country .
At this time General Musharaf was a partner in the so - called US - led “ alliance against terrorism ” .
He was manipulating both the fanatics and the imperialists .
By March 2009 , the number of registered madrassas in Pakistan reached 15,725 .
The growth of religious fanatics
The partnership of religious fanatics with US and the Pakistan intelligence agencies went unchecked until the 9/11 attacks .
Then the whole scenario shifted .
The Mujahideen was labelled terrorist and Washington wanted a military solution to the growth of religious fundamentalism .
The growth of religious fundamentalism was not only the result of the US and Pakistani intelligence agencies but also the complete failure of civilian and military governments to solve any of the basic problems of the working class and its allies .
Successive regimes have been unable to end the grip of feudalism , the absolute exploitive nature of Pakistani capitalists and their humiliating treatment of workers and farmers , the repression of smaller nationalities , and the exploitation of natural resources they possessed .
Pakistan ’s ruling class has failed miserably to bring about democratic norms .
That is why whenever the civilian government has been overthrown by a military dictatorship , the vast majority of the masses
Have not offered any resistance to dictatorship .
Establishing Islamic courts
The present civilian government of the Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) has been contradictory in dealing with religious fanatics .
In the Swat area , following peace talks , the government has entered into agreements with the fanatics to establish Islamic courts .
The religious forces were decisively defeated in the general election of 2008 .
Where in the 2002 general election the fanatics ’ parties received 15 per cent of the vote , in 2008 they got less than 3 per cent .
Just after the 2008 general election , when the masses had rejected the religious forces , instead of a mass mobilisation to end religious fundamentalism , the PPP regime opted for negotiations .
This gave the fanatics an incentive to go further : they demanded sharia laws in the Malakand division .
This was accepted and an agreement was signed .
It was a real boost for the religious fundamentalists who then went further in their attempt to control more areas , therefore giving an impression that they were not far from Islamabad .
In a panic , the regime , with full support of the US , went for a full military operation in the Malakand division in June 2009 .
The result was more than 3.5 million internally displaced people and more than 5000 killings .
The present government boasted a military victory over the fundamentalists and then asked people to go back home .
But this was not the army ’s military victory but a temporary retreat of the fanatics .
Able to save their infrastructure , the fanatics did what Afghan Taliban did during the October 2001 military attack .
That too was a military retreat , with the Taliban to re-emerge later .
The celebration of a military victory over the religious fanatics had not lasted even one month before the fanatics were able to attack the military ’s general headquarters , the famous GHQ , along with several police training centres in different parts of the country during October 2009 .
This month has been the bloodiest , with killings on both sides .
Saying there was no other option , many liberals in Pakistan have supported the military actions against the fanatics .
But no military solution can eliminate the religious fundamentalists .
It has been the case in Afghanistan and so too will it be the case in Pakistan .
It can only push them to other areas .
The religious fundamentalists are using the tactics of urban terrorism .
Urban terrorism cannot be eliminated by invading areas considered to be under fundamentalists ’ control .
Military actions in Malakand division and now in Waziristan have pushed the fanatics to other parts of Pakistan .
The fallacy of short - term and long - term strategies
The military solution has been presented as an immediate step to the ultimate solution to fundamentalism .
It is like the old Stalinist theory of minimum and maximum goals .
“ Demand minimum to get the maximum ” was the philosophy .
It was known as the minimum and maximum stage of revolution .
But there was no measures in between the short - term and long - term strategies .
Similarly with the fight against the religious fanatics , this is being presented short - term and long - term strategies .
The military solution is a short - term strategy while the long - term strategy requires reforms and more development .
The long - term strategy never arrives .
This is just an excuse to please US imperialism .
If the fight against religious fanatics is to go forward , it must begin with a revolutionary program .
It has to start with the political will to separate religion from the state .
It has to deal with the question of the nature of Pakistani state .
Religion cannot become the basis of a nation .
Pakistan was torn apart by the events of the 1960s and 1970s when Bangladesh came into existence .
Now a more severe crisis is erupting in Baluchistan along similar lines .
There is strong movement developing that calls for the independence of Baluchistan .
There has to be a concrete program to fight religious fundamentalism .
It has to combine immediately dealing with suicide attacks and curbing the activities of the fascist forces from their strongholds , along with an overall plan of action in economic , political and social development .
This should include the nationalisation of religious madrassas and the retraining of teachers .
It should include an immediate increase in workers ’ wages in both the private and public sector to at least 12,000 rupees a month .
All discriminatory laws must go and all citizens of Pakistan should enjoy equal constitutional status .
At present there are several laws that make religious minorities second - rate citizens .
The government should be committed to fully back local resistance to the religious fanatics .
Civil society organisations in the strongholds of the religious fundamentalists should be given full backing by the state so that they can function .
The state must help to strengthen and sustain the local defence committees to fight the religious fanatics .
All trade union rights must be restored in the public and private sectors , with full freedom of speech and assembly .
Most of the discriminatory laws are still intact , including blasphemy laws .
The government has no plan to do away with these laws promulgated under military dictatorships , so the organisations of civil society must demand government action to restore civil rights .
` War on terror ’ fuels fundamentalism
The forces of religious fundamentalism organise on an international basis .
A fight against them has to be organised at that same level .
The US “ war on terror ” is fueling religious fundamentalism .
It is seen as a war on Muslims .
The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan by the imperialist forces is providing the religious fanatics a political justification for their terrorist activities .
The campaigns to end the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , and no support to the fanatics can be the basis for a united front of progressive forces internationally .
The campaign against religious fundamentalism must be part and parcel of an anti-globalisation campaign by all progressive forces .
We must oppose the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and religious fundamentalism .
No support to one against the other .
The fight between religious fundamentalism and the imperialists is a fight between bulls .
There is not much to be gained by siding with one against the other .
The goal must be to end the fight altogether and open the space to create an alternative way of living .

SANTA FE , N.M. 
The only person in America with a state license to distribute marijuana wants to keep her identity secret .
“ I ’m so totally paranoid I ca n’t stand myself , ” said the distributor , who runs a nonprofit group here that grows and sells marijuana for medicinal purposes and who insisted on meeting in the privacy of a hotel room .
It was not meant to be this way .
New Mexico ’s new medical marijuana law was intended to provide safe , aboveboard access to the drug for hundreds of residents with chronic pain and other debilitating conditions .
By licensing nonprofit distributors , New Mexico hoped to improve upon the free - for - all distribution systems in some states like California and Colorado , where hundreds of for - profit dispensaries have sprung up with virtually no state oversight .
But even in New Mexico , the process  from procuring the starter seed ( in Amsterdam , via a middleman ) to home delivery ( by a former Marine )  is not for the faint of heart .
Those engaged in the experiment here never know if they will be arrested , because growing , selling and using marijuana remain illegal under federal law .
And robbery is always a fear .
Obama to control your television ; brainwashing will be “ organically ” woven into plots and storylines all next week
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , October 15 , 2009
An insidious brainwashing program set to be launched next week will “ organically ” weave the government ’s political propaganda into prime time network television shows , with positive talking points about Obama ’s environmental , bailout , health care and “ servitude ” agenda being seamlessly integrated into the content of dramas , reality shows and comedies .
Under the auspices of a program run by the Entertainment Industry Foundation ( EIF ) , network TV shows will be used to promote “ service and volunteerism ” on behalf of the public as part of a “ week - long of television programming on all four leading broadcast networks – ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC , and all affiliated broadcast and cable properties as well , and other networks , beginning October 19 . ”
According to the EIF press release , “ Network shows that will feature volunteerism in some way during the week of Oct 19th , ” include the following .
ABC
All My Children , America ’s Funniest Home Videos , Brothers and Sisters , Castle , Cougar Town , Dancing With The Stars , Desperate Housewives , Extreme Makeover : Home Edition , Flash Forward , General Hospital , Good Morning America , Grey ’s Anatomy , Hank , Jimmy Kimmel Live , Modern Family , One Life To Live , Private Practice , The Forgotten , The Middle , The View , Ugly Betty
CBS
Cold Case , Criminal Minds , CSI : Miami , CSI : NY , Gary Unmarried , Ghost Whisperer , Numb3rs
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
FOX
America ’s Most Wanted , Bones , Brothers , COPS , So You Think You Can Dance , Til Death
NBC
30 Rock , Access Hollywood , Community , Days of Our Lives , Heroes , Parks and Recreation , The Biggest Loser , The Office , Today Show
Despite the fact that this was announced back in September , a new investigation by John Nolte has revealed all kinds of surreptitious connections that give a solid indication of what we can expect to be promoted by the TV shows that will effectively be under government control from Monday onwards .
Not only will program makers prostrate themselves to push Obama ’s lies about health care , banker bailouts , global warming and creepy public service programs that border on mandatory volunteerism , but they will also lead unsuspecting victims of their brainwashing into the arms of groups like Planned Parenthood .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ Doing the work the Kamikaze Media ( many of whom are participating in this event rather than digging for the story ) refuses , and with the help of Big Government ’s Dana Loesch , Patrick and Stage Right have discovered that when it comes to this White House – whether it ’s the NEA conference calls or EIF ’s iParticipate programming — all roads funnel into one place : online volunteer portals , including Serve.gov , where if you plug in “ health care ” all kinds of Planned Parenthood openings pop up along with a video dispelling those ugly “ myths ” knocking ObamaCare , ” writes Nolte .
As a subsequent Big Hollywood report points out , the websites being promoted by the “ I Participate ” campaign are little more than gateways to organizations like Planned Parenthood and their slice of Obama ’s health care agenda , “ reproductive freedom , ” otherwise known as abortion , otherwise known as killing babies .
Since the websites that act as gateways for Planned Parenthood are being pushed on shows like So You Think You Can Dance , which is popular with teenage girls , the agenda is clear .
“ As I said , my nine - year - old daughter loves “ So You Think You Can Dance . ”
My wife and I are very careful .
We watch the show first and record it via DVR .
Then , the next day , if any of the dances are a bit risqué ’ we skip through them , ” writes Stage Right .
“ Of course we skip through the commercials because they are often too adult for her .
I suppose the week of October 19th we ’re going to have to skip most of the shows lest she be encouraged to go to a website promoting an abortion clinic . ”
The website also leads to an instructional video about how to regurgitate Obama ’s talking points on health care .
Watch below .
“ This nifty bit of propaganda encourages you to troll on blogs and leave comments , call in to talk radio shows and generally be annoying when people discuss ObamaCare by injecting Administration talking points found on AARP ’s web page under the Orwellian header ” Myths vs. Facts , ” reports Stage Right .
Another item that is just a quick search away from the website that will be pushed on network TV next week encourages people to become ‘ Global Warming Ambassadors ’ for the National Wildlife Fund , which is a firm supporter of Obama ’s Cap and Trade agenda .
This is n’t the first time the corporate networks have prostituted their integrity and handed over control of their content to the Obama administration .
Back in June , ABC News mimicked the likes of Communist China and North Korea by completely turning its news coverage over to the government and excluding any dissenting opinions to promote President Obama ’s health care agenda .
Indeed , Rupert Murdoch ’s Twentieth Century Fox corporation has admitted to planting political brainwashing within its globally popular TV shows and indeed boasts that it is proud of the fact .
A corporate video shows
Fox executives and stars of its universally recognized shows bragging about how they use the platform of hit shows that are broadcast worldwide to implant messages about the supposed threat of global warming .
Watch below .
If all this was n’t disturbing enough , one of the “ I Paticipate ” initiative ’s main protagonists is none other than Ashton Kutcher , who along with Demi Moore produced one of the creepiest
You Tube videos ever made , in which celebrities pledge their servitude to Barack Obama and encourage everyone to do the same as they repeat mantras with cult - like zeal .
Who remember ’s this one ?
The fact that corporate TV outlets are openly writing scripts and editing content to incorporate government propaganda , added to the fact that they act like this is some kind of wonderful service to the American people , is a damning indictment of just how deep the alphabet soup networks are in the pocket of the establishment .
It also underscores exactly why they are losing viewers to the Internet and alternative media at an alarming speed while hypocritically attacking the alternative media for being untrustworthy .
We ’ll leave it to the reader to decide for themselves .
Who ’s the most trustworthy ?
The muckraking blogger or the legions of corporate media whores who brazenly hand over their editorial control to the government and then celebrate the fact as if it ’s a major achievement ?

Comment on this article
Intel is on the verge of transitioning to 32nm .
We 'll see the first parts this year .
What do you do with your 45 nm fabs when you start moving volume away from them ?
Make really cheap quad - core Nehalems of course :
I 'm talking $ 196 .
I 'm talking faster than AMD 's entire lineup .
I 'm talking about arguably the best processor of 2009 .
I 'm talking about Lynnfield , and here 's its backside :
Mmm
I spent much of the past year harping on AMD selling Nehalem - sized Phenom IIs for less than Intel sold Nehalems .
With Lynnfield , Intel actually made Nehalem even bigger all while driving prices down .
Like I said , what do you do when you 're still making boatloads of money in a recession and are about to start emptying your 45 nm fabs ?
I should clear things up before we progress much further .
Lynnfield is the codename for mainstream 45 nm quad - core Nehalem , while Bloomfield refers to the first Nehalem launched at the end of 2008 :
Processor Manufacturing Process Die Size Transistor Count Socket Bloomfield 45nm 263 mm2 731M LGA - 1366 Lynnfield 45nm 296 mm2 774M LGA - 1156
Despite being cheaper , Lynnfield is larger than Bloomfield .
The larger die is due to one major addition : an on - die PCIe controller .
Bloomfield , The First Nehalem , circa 2008
Lynnfield , Nehalem for All , circa 2009
The pink block to the right of the die is the PCIe controller , that 's 16 PCIe 2.0 lanes coming right off the chip .
Say hello to ultra low latency GPU communication .
You'd think that Intel was about to enter the graphics market or something with a design like this .
Sacrifices were made to reduce CPU , socket and board complexity .
Gone are the two QPI links that each provided 25.6 GB /s of bandwidth to other CPUs or chips on the motherboard .
We also lose one of the three 64 - bit DDR3 memory channels , Lynnfield only has two like a normal processor ( silly overachieving Bloomfield ) .
Intel 's Bloomfield Platform ( X58 + LGA - 1366 )
The sum is that Lynnfield is exclusively single - socket ; there will be no LGA - 1156 Skulltrail .
While the dual - channel memory controller is n't really a limitation for quad - core parts , six and eight core designs may be better suited for LGA - 1366 .
Intel 's Lynnfield Platform ( P55 + LGA - 1156 )
The loss of QPI means that Lynnfield does n't have a super fast connection to the rest of the system , but with an on - die PCIe controller it does n't matter : the GPU is fed right off the CPU .
The Lineup
We get three Lynnfield CPUs today : the Core i7 870 , Core i7 860 and the Core i5 750 .
Intel 's branding folks told us that the naming would make sense one we saw the rest of the " Core " parts introduced ; yeah that was pretty much a lie .
At least there are n't any overlapping part numbers ( e.g. Core i5 860 and Core i7 860 ) .
The i7 in this case denotes four cores +
Hyper Threading , the i5 means four cores but no Hyper Threading .
The rules get more complicated as you bring notebooks into the fray but let 's momentarily bask in marginal simplicity .
Processor Clock Speed Cores / Threads Maximum Single Core Turbo Frequency TDP Price Intel Core i7-975 Extreme 3.33GHz
4 / 8 3.60 GHz 130W $ 999 Intel Core i7 965 Extreme 3.20 GHz 4 / 8 3.46GHz 130W $ 999 Intel Core i7 940 2.93GHz
4 / 8 3.20 GHz 130W $ 562 Intel Core i7 920 2.66GHz
4 / 8 2.93 GHz 130W $ 284 Intel Core i7 870 2.93GHz
4 / 8 3.60 GHz 95W $ 562 Intel Core i7 860 2.80 GHz
4 / 8 3.46GHz 95 W $ 284 Intel Core i5 750 2.66GHz 4 / 4 3.20 GHz 95W $ 196
Keeping Hyper Threading off of the Core i5 is purely done to limit performance .
There are n't any yield reasons why HT could n't be enabled .
Intel was very careful with both pricing and performance of its Lynnfield processors .
I 'm going to go ahead and say it right now , there 's no need for any LGA - 1366 processors slower than a Core i7 965 :
This is only one benchmark , but it 's representative of what you 're about to see .
The Core i7 870 ( LGA - 1156 ) is as fast , if not faster , than every single LGA - 1366 processor except for the ones that cost $ 999 .
Its pricing is competitive as well :
For $ 196 you 're getting a processor that 's faster than the Core i7 920 .
I 'm not taking into account motherboard prices either , which are anywhere from $ 50 - $ 100 cheaper for LGA - 1156 boards .
I do n't believe LGA - 1366 is dead , but there 's absolutely no reason to buy anything slower than a 965 if you 're going that route .
The LGA - 1156 Socket : Size and Installation
The first Core i7 , Bloomfield , went into a 1366 - pin LGA socket :
A year later we have Lynnfield , and it fits in a much tighter space :
The LGA - 1156 socket and Lynnfield CPUs are about as big as the old LGA - 775 sockets / chips :
From Left to Right : Intel Core i7 " Bloomfield " ( LGA - 1366 ) , Intel Core i7 " Lynnfield " ( LGA - 1156 ) , Intel Core 2 Quad " Yorkfield " ( LGA - 775 )
Note the pad densitiy of Lynnfield vs. LGA - 775 processors
The installation process is largely the same as any other Intel LGA socket , the difference being that LGA - 1156 uses a new one - sided retention mechanism .
After the socket is " open " , gently place the CPU on top of the pins .
The chip can only fit in one direction so just pay attention :
With the chip in the socket and the lever still pulled back , move the socket cover over the CPU and slide its teeth under the retention screw on the opposite side :
Then , lower the lever , lock it in place and you 're good to go :
New Heatsinks and Motherboards
LGA - 1156 processors use a different heatsink than both LGA - 1366 and LGA - 775 chips .
Lynnfield and its cooler
As the numbers would imply , the LGA - 1156 heatsink has a larger footprint than LGA - 775 but smaller than LGA - 1366 .
From Left to Right : Retail LGA - 1366 Cooler , Retail LGA - 1156 Cooler , Retail 45nm LGA - 775 Cooler
The retail LGA - 1156 is actually much closer to the 45nm LGA - 775 retail cooler than the LGA - 1366 retail HSF :
As you 'll see later on in the article , the retail cooler is n't very good for heavy overclocking .
Power users will want something a little bigger :
The Lynnfield / P55 launch is huge .
Virtually every single motherboard manufacturer has a P55 board available .
Prices range from ~ $ 110 - $ 300 depending on the number of bells and whistles .
Gigabyte 's ultra high end UD6 ( left ) and Gigabyte 's lower end micro-ATX UD4 ( right )
Gigabyte 's high end UD6 comes with 6 DIMM slots like its X58 brethren .
Micro-ATX is increasing in popularity and we actually have some good options this time if you 're trying to build a smaller Lynnfield system .
Combined with Lynnfield 's excellent idle power ( the lowest of any quad - core we 've ever tested ) , this could make for an unusually potent HTPC .
A closer look at Gigabyte 's micro-ATX P55M - UD4
The only thing we 're really missing is a good mini-ITX Lynnfield board .
But perhaps the manufacturers will wait until we have on - package graphics before going down that route ...
One More Time : New H55 Boards Next Year
As I subtley implied at the end of the last section , Intel is bringing on - package graphics to Nehalem starting in Q4 of this year :
The 32nm Nehalem shrink , codenamed Westmere , will be available with a 45nm Intel graphics core on the processor 's package .
This graphics core is an evolution of what 's currently in the G45 chipset and not Larrabee ( although eventually that will change ) .
From what I 've heard , this is actually going to be Intel 's first reasonably good integrated graphics core .
With the graphics on - package , there needs to be an interface from the processor socket to video output located on the motherboard .
As you can see from the P55 motherboards that are launching today : none of them have this video out .
Granted there are n't any CPUs out to take advantage of it either .
No DVI / HDMI /VGA out ... yet
Early next year ( or maybe even late this year ) we 'll see a new breed of LGA - 1156 motherboards with video output , designed for use with these Westmere IGP parts .
Rumor has it that these motherboards will use Intel 's H55 chipset .
Lynnfield early adopters need not worry , 32nm quad - core processors wo n't be out for at least a year .
Homework : How Turbo Mode Works
AMD and Intel both figured out the practical maximum power consumption of a desktop CPU .
Intel actually discovered it first , through trial and error , in the Prescott days .
At the high end that 's around 130W , for the upper mainstream market that 's 95W .
That 's why all high end CPUs ship with 120 - 140W TDPs .
Regardless of whether you have one , two , four , six or eight cores - the entire chip has to fit within that power envelope .
A single core 95 W chip gets to have a one core eating up all of that power budget .
This is where we get very high clock speed single core CPUs from .
A 95W dual core processor means that individually the cores have to use less than the single 95 W processor , so tradeoffs are made : each core runs at a lower clock speed .
A 95W quad core processor requires that each core uses less power than both a single or dual core 95 W processor , resulting in more tradeoffs .
Each core runs at a lower clock speed than the 95W dual core processor .
The diagram below helps illustrate this :
Single Core Dual Core Quad Core Hex Core TDP Tradeoff
The TDP is constant , you can't ramp power indefinitely - you eventually run into cooling and thermal density issues .
The variables are core count and clock speed ( at least today ) , if you increase one , you have to decrease the other .
Here 's the problem : what happens if you 're not using all four cores of the 95W quad core processor ?
You 're only consuming a fraction of the 95W TDP because parts of the chip are idle , but your chip ends up being slower than a 95W dual core processor since its clocked lower .
The consumer has to thus choose if they should buy a faster dual core or a slower quad core processor .
A smart processor would realize that its cores are n't frequency limited , just TDP limited .
Furthermore , if half the chip is idle then the active cores could theoretically run faster .
That smart processor is Lynnfield .
Intel made a very important announcement when Nehalem launched last year .
Everyone focused on cache sizes , performance or memory latency , but the most important part of Nehalem was far more subtle : the Power Gate Transistor .
Transistors are supposed to act as light switches - allowing current to flow when they 're on , and stopping the flow when they 're off .
One side effect of constantly reducing transistor feature size and increasing performance is that current continues to flow even when the transistor is switched off .
It 's called leakage current , and when you 've got a few hundred million transistors that are supposed to be off but are still using current , power efficiency suffers .
You can reduce leakage current , but you also impact performance when doing so ; the processes with the lowest leakage , can't scale as high in clock speed .
Using some clever materials engineering Intel developed a very low resistance , low leakage , transistor that can effectively drop any circuits behind it to near - zero power consumption ; a true off switch .
This is the Power Gate Transistor .
On a quad - core Phenom II , if two cores are idle , blocks of transistors are placed in the off - state but they still consume power thanks to leakage current .
On any Nehalem processor , if two cores are idle , the Power Gate transistors that feed the cores their supply current are turned off and thus the two cores are almost completely turned off - with extremely low leakage current .
This is why nothing can touch Nehalem 's idle power :
Since Nehalem can effectively turn off idle cores , it can free up some of that precious TDP we were talking about above .
The next step then makes perfect sense .
After turning off idle cores , let 's boost the speed of active cores until we hit our TDP limit .
On every single Nehalem ( Lynnfield included ) lies around 1 million transistors ( about the complexity of a 486 ) whose sole task is managing power .
It turns cores off , underclocks them and is generally charged with the task of making sure that power usage is kept to a minimum .
Lynnfield 's PCU ( Power Control Unit ) is largely the same as what was in Bloomfield .
The architecture remains the same , although it has a higher sampling rate for monitoring the state of all of the cores and demands on them .
The PCU is responsible for turbo mode .
Lynnfield 's Turbo Mode : Up to 17 % More Performance
Turbo on Bloomfield ( the first Core i7 ) was n't all that impressive .
If you look back at our Core i7 article from last year you 'll see that it 's responsible for a 2 - 5 % increase in performance depending on the application .
All Bloomfield desktop CPUs had 130W TDPs , so each individual core had a bit more breathing room for how fast it could run .
Lynnfield brings the TDP down around 27 % , meaning each core gets less TDP to work with ( the lower the TDP , the greater potential there is for turbo ) .
That combined with almost a full year of improving yields on Nehalem means that Intel can be much more aggressive with Turbo on Lynnfield .
SYSMark 2007 : Overall Dawn of War II Sacred 2 World of Warcraft Intel Core i7 870 Turbo Disabled 206 74.3 fps 84.8 fps 60.6 fps Intel Core i7 870 Turbo Enabled 233 81.0 fps 97.4 fps 70.7 fps % Increase from Turbo 13.1 % 9.0 % 14.9 % 16.7 %
Turbo on Lynnfield can yield up to an extra 17 % performance depending on the application .
The biggest gains will be when running one or two threads as you can see from the table below :
Max Speed Stock 4 Cores Active 3 Cores Active 2 Cores Active 1 Core Active Intel Core i7 870 2.93GHz 3.20 GHz 3.20 GHz 3.46GHz 3.60 GHz Intel Core i7 860 2.80 GHz 2.93GHz 2.93GHz 3.33GHz 3.46GHz Intel Core i5 750 2.66GHz 2.80 GHz 2.80 GHz 3.20 GHz 3.20GHz
If Intel had Turbo mode back when dual - cores first started shipping we would 've never had the whole single vs. dual core debate .
If you 're running a single thread , this 774 M transistor beast will turn off three of its cores and run its single active core at up to 3.6GHz .
That 's faster than the fastest Core 2 Duo on the market today .
WoW does n't stress more than 2 cores , Turbo mode helps ensure the i7 870 is faster than Intel 's fastest dual - core CPU
It 's more than just individual application performance however , Lynnfield 's turbo modes can kick in when just interacting with the OS or an application .
Single threads , regardless of nature , can now execute at 3.6GHz instead of 2.93GHz .
It 's the epitomy of Intel 's hurry up and get idle philosophy .
The ultimate goal is to always deliver the best performance regardless of how threaded ( or not ) the workload is .
Buying more cores should n't get you lower clock speeds , just more flexibility .
The top end Lynnfield is like buying a 3.46 GHz dual - core processor that can also run well threaded code at 2.93GHz .
Take this one step further and imagine what happens when you have a CPU / GPU on the same package or better yet , on the same die .
Need more GPU power ?
Underclock the CPU cores , need more CPU power ?
Turn off half the GPU cores .
It 's always availble , real - time - configurable processing power .
That 's the goal and Lynnfield is the first real step in that direction .
Speed Limits : Things That Will Keep Turbo Mode from Working
As awesome as it is , Turbo does n't work 100 % of the time , its usefulness varies on a number of factors including the instruction mix of active threads and processor cooling .
The actual instructions being executed by each core will determine the amount of current drawn and total TDP of the processor .
For example , video encoding uses a lot of SSE instructions which in turn keep the SSE units busy on the chip ; the front end remains idle and is clock gated , so power is saved there .
The resulting power savings are translated into higher clock frequency .
Intel tells us that video encoding should see the maximum improvement of two bins with all four cores active .
Floating point code stresses both the front end and back end of the pipe , here we should expect to see only a 133MHz increase from turbo mode if any at all .
In short , you can't simply look at whether an app uses one , two or more threads .
It 's what the app does that matters .
There 's also the issue of background threads running in the OS .
Although your foreground app may only use a single thread , there are usually dozens ( if not hundreds ) of active threads on your system at any time .
Just a few of those being scheduled on sleeping cores will wake them up and limit your max turbo frequency ( Windows 7 is allegedly better at not doing this ) .
You can't really control the instruction mix of the apps you run or how well they 're threaded , but this last point you can control : cooling .
The sort - of trump all feature that you have to respect is Intel 's thermal throttling .
If the CPU ever gets too hot , it will automatically reduce its clock speed in order to avoid damaging the processor ; this includes a clock speed increase due to turbo mode .
Lynnfield and its retail cooler
The retail cooler that ships with the Core i7 is tiny and while it's able to remove heat well enough to allow the chip to turbo up , we 've seen instances where it does n't turbo as well due to cooling issues .
Just like we recommended in the Bloomfield days , an aftermarket cooler may suit you well .
Lynnfield : Made for Windows 7 ( or vice versa )
Core Parking is a feature included in Windows 7 and enabled on any multi-socket machine or any system with Hyper Threading enabled ( e.g. Pentium 4 , Atom , Core i7 ) .
The feature looks at the performance penalty from migrating a thread from one core to another ; if the fall looks too dangerous , Windows 7 wo n't jump - the thread will stay parked on that core .
What this fixes are a number of the situations where enabling Hyper Threading will reduce performance thanks to Windows moving a thread from a physical core to a logical core .
This also helps multi-socket systems where moving a thread from one core to the next might mean moving it ( and all of its data ) from one memory controller to another one on an adjacent socket .
Core Parking can't help an application that manually assigns affinity to a core .
We 've still seen situations where HT reduces performance under Windows 7 for example with AutoCAD 2010 and World of Warcraft .
With support in the OS however , developers should have no reason to assign affinity in software - the OS is now smart enough to properly handle multi-socket and HT enabled machines .
Lynnfield 's Un - Core : Faster Than Most Bloomfields
A few years ago I had a bet going with AMD's Ian McNaughton .
We were at an AMD event where the Phenom architecture was first being introduced and he insisted that the L3 cache was part of the memory controller .
This did n't make any sense to me so I disagreed .
Minutes later a presentation slide went up on a projector talking about how the L3 cache and memory controller were on the same voltage plane ; that 's what he meant .
Ian laughed a lot and to this day he holds it over my head .
The moral of the story is in Phenom and later in Nehalem , the processor is divided into two parts .
Intel named them the core and the un-core .
The " core " of these multi-core processors is made up of each individual processor core and its associated private caches ( L1/L2 ) .
The " uncore " refers to everything else : PCIe controller , memory controller , DMI / QPI and the L3 cache .
The uncore is n't as critical for performance but is made up of a ton of transistors ; roughly 400 million in the case of Lynnfield / Bloomfield ( more if you count the PCIe controller ) .
In order to save power , Intel uses slower transistors that have lower leakage for the un-core .
As a result , the un-core can't clock up as high as the core and runs at a lower multiplier .
Take the Bloomfield Core i7 975 for example .
The core runs at 25 x BCLK ( 25 x 133MHz = 3.33GHz ) , but the un-core runs at 20x BCLK ( 20 x 133MHz = 2.66GHz ) .
The rest of the chips , including Lynnfield , have slower un -cores :
CPU Socket Core Clock Un- Core Clock Intel Core i7 975 Extreme LGA - 1366 3.33GHz 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 965 Extreme LGA - 1366 3.20 GHz 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 950 LGA - 1366 3.06GHz 2.13 GHz Intel Core i7 940 LGA - 1366 2.93GHz 2.13 GHz Intel Core i7 920 LGA - 1366 2.66GHz 2.13 GHz Intel Core i7 870 LGA - 1156 2.93GHz 2.40 GHz Intel Core i7 860 LGA - 1156 2.80 GHz 2.40 GHz Intel Core i5 750 LGA - 1156 2.66GHz 2.13GHz
Here 's another area where Lynnfield is better than the lower end Bloomfields : its uncore runs at 2.40 GHz instead of 2.13GHz .
The exception being the Core i5 750 , its uncore is stuck at 2.13GHz as well .
Once again , only the " Extreme " Bloomfields have a faster uncore .
Lynnfield 's Memory Controller : Also Faster than Bloomfield
Intel only officially supports two memory speeds on Bloomfield : DDR3 - 800 and DDR3 - 1066 .
Obviously we 're able to run it much faster than that , but this is what 's officially validated and supported on the processors .
Lynnfield is a year newer and thus gets a tweaked memory controller .
The result ?
Official DDR3 - 1333 support .
Three Lynnfield memory kits ( left to right ) : OCZ , Patriot and Kingston
The same sort of rules apply to Lynnfield memory kits that we saw with Bloomfield .
You do n't want to go above 1.65V and thus all the kits we 've seen run at 1.5V for the stock JEDEC speeds or 1.65V for the overclocked modules .
Like Bloomfield , 1.65V is the max we 'll see on Lynnfield
Discovery : Two Channels Are n't Worse Than Three
Intel told me something interesting when I was out in LA earlier this summer : it takes at least 3 cores to fully saturate Lynnfield 's dual - channel DDR3 - 1333 memory bus .
That 's three cores all working on memory bandwidth intensive threads at the same time .
That 's a pretty stiff requirement .
In the vast , vast majority of situations Lynnfield 's dual channel DDR3 memory controller wo n't hurt it .
Move up to 6 or 8 core designs and a third memory channel is necessary , and that 's why we 'll see those processors debut exclusively on LGA - 1366 platforms .
In fact , X58 motherboards will only need a BIOS update to work with the 6 - core 32nm Gulftown processor next year .
P55 looks like it 'll be limited to four cores and below .
Because of this , Lynnfield 's memory bandwidth and latency cores are actually quite similar to Bloomfield .
I used Everest to look at memory bandwidth and latency between a Core i7 975 and Core i7 870 ( Lynnfield ) :
Lynnfield 's memory controller is good , easily as good as what 's in Bloomfield if not slightly better .
Both processors turbo'd up to 3.46GHz , indicating that Everest 's memory test uses no more than two threads .
The 975 ran DDR3 - 1066 memory ( the highest it officially supports ) , while the 870 used DDR3 - 1333 .
The faster memory gave the 870 the advantage .
Since we 're not taxing all four cores , Lynnfield is at no disadvantage from a bandwidth perspective .
Surprisingly enough , even SiSoft Sandra ( which does use four cores for its memory bandwidth test ) shows Lynnfield 's dual - channel DDR3 - 1333 memory controller as equal to Bloomfield 's triple - channel DDR3 - 1066 interface .
SiSoft Sandra 2009 .
SP4 Intel Core i7 975 Intel Core i7 870 Aggregate Memory Bandwidth 17.8 GB /s 17.3 GB /s
Long story short ?
Lynnfield wo n't be memory bandwidth limited with DDR3 - 1333 for the overwhelming majority of usage cases .
The Best Gaming CPU ?
When I first previewed Lynnfield I theorized that its aggressive turbo modes would make it the best gaming CPU on the market .
Most games these days use between two and four threads , not enough for Hyper Threading to be truly beneficial .
As a result , Nehalem never really did all that well in games .
It was generally faster than the competition , but not much and not on a performance - per - dollar basis .
I ran a few new game tests under Windows 7 to accompany our usual game benchmarks .
The competitors here are limited to Lynnfield ( of course ) , Bloomfield , Penryn and AMD's Phenom II .
Dawn of War II does n't actually shatter any expectations .
While turbo clearly benefits Lynnfield , it is n't enough to dethrone Bloomfield .
The Core i7 920 is marginally faster than the new i5 750 .
Here 's where things get interesting though : look at minimum frame rates .
In both Lynnfield platforms , the minimum frame rates are higher than the competing Bloomfield system .
That appears to be Lynnfield 's aggressive turbo modes at work .
While they 're not constantly pushing Lynnfield to a higher clock speed , they do apparently help out when it matters the most .
The other thing to notice is the lowest Lynnfield is a faster gaming CPU than Intel 's fastest dual - core : the E8600 .
Sacred 2 is an example of performance standings in a more normal manner .
Lynnfield can't seem to outperform Bloomfield , and the Core i5 750 actually falls slightly behind AMD's Phenom II X4 965 BE .
With World of Warcraft we 're back to turbo mode having a very positive impact .
The Core i7 870 is nearly as fast as the i7 975 , while the i5 750 is a bit slower than the i7 920 .
Both are faster than the Phenom II X4 965 BE , which is in turn faster than the Q9650 .
These three benchmarks seem to outline the three most realistic options for Lynnfield 's gaming performance .
In situations where its turbo modes can work , Lynnfield can be equal to if not faster than Bloomfield .
In those situations where it does n't kick in , Lynnfield is at least competitive with Phenom II and Bloomfield .
In all situations the old Core 2 Quad Q9650 is at the bottom of the charts .
I 'll throw in one more option just to complicate things .
Have a look at this :
Not exactly the norm , but here we have the Phenom II X4 965 BE faster than everything - including the Core i7 975 .
Unfortunately there 's no one benchmark that will sum up how these things perform , but overall it looks like Lynnfield is going to be one capable gaming CPU .
Multi-GPU SLI /CF
Scaling : Lynnfield 's Blemish
When running in single - GPU mode , the on - die PCIe controller maintains a full x16 connection to your graphics card :
Hooray .
In multi-GPU mode , the 16 lanes have to be split in two :
To support this the motherboard maker needs to put down ~ $ 3 worth of PCIe switches :
Now SLI and Crossfire can work , although the motherboard maker also needs to pay NVIDIA a few dollars to legally make SLI work .
The question is do you give up any performance when going with Lynnfield 's 2 x8 implementation vs. Bloomfield / X58's 2 x16 PCIe configuration ?
In short , at the high end , yes .
I looked at scaling in two games that scaled the best with multiple GPUs : Crysis Warhead and FarCry 2 .
I ran all settings at their max , resolution at 2560 x 1600 but with no AA .
I included two multi-GPU configurations .
A pair of GeForce GTX 275s from EVGA for NVIDIA :
A coupla GPUs and a few cores can go a long way
And to really stress things , I looked at two Radeon HD 4870 X2s from Sapphire .
Note that each card has two GPUs so this is actually a 4 - GPU configuration , enough to really stress a PCIe x8 interface .
First , the dual - GPU results from NVIDIA .
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275 Crysis Warhead ( ambush ) Crysis Warhead ( avalanche ) Crysis Warhead ( frost ) FarCry 2 Playback Demo Action Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) - 1GPU 20.8 fps 23.0 fps 21.4 fps 41.0 fps Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) 1GPU 20.8 fps 22.9 fps 21.5 fps 40.5 fps Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) - 2GPUs 38.4 fps 42.3 fps 38.0 fps 73.2 fps Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) 2GPUs 38.0 fps 41.9 fps 37.4 fps 65.9 fps
The important data is in the next table .
What you 're looking at here is the % speedup from one to two GPUs on X58 vs. P55 .
In theory , X58 should have higher percentages because each GPU gets 16 PCIe lanes while Lynnfield only provides 8 per GPU .
GTX 275 -> GTX 275 SLI Scaling Crysis Warhead ( ambush ) Crysis Warhead ( avalanche ) Crysis Warhead ( frost ) FarCry 2 Playback Demo Action Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) 84.6 % 83.9 % 77.6 % 78.5 % Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) 82.7 % 83.0 % 74.0 % 62.7 %
For the most part , the X58 platform was only a couple of percent better in scaling .
That changes with the Far Cry 2 results where X58 manages to get 78 % scaling while P55 only delivers 62 % .
It 's clearly not the most common case , but it can happen .
If you 're going to be building a high - end dual - GPU setup , X58 is probably worth it .
Next , the quad - GPU results from AMD :
AMD Radeon HD 4870 X2 Crysis Warhead ( ambush ) Crysis Warhead ( avalanche ) Crysis Warhead ( frost ) FarCry 2 Playback Demo Action Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) - 2GPUs 25.8 fps 31.3 fps 27.0 fps 70.9 fps Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) 2GPUs 24.4 fps 31.1 fps 26.6 fps 71.4 fps Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) - 4GPUs 27.0 fps 57.4 fps 47.9 fps 117.9 fps Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) 4GPUs 24.2 fps 50.0 fps 36.5 fps 116 fps
Again , what we really care about is the scaling .
Note how single GPU performance is identical between Bloomfield / Lynnfield , but multi-GPU performance is noticeably lower on Lynnfield .
This is n't going to be good :
4870 X2 -> 4870 X2 CF
Scaling Crysis Warhead ( ambush ) Crysis Warhead ( avalanche ) Crysis Warhead ( frost ) FarCry 2 Playback Demo Action Intel Core i7 975 ( X58 ) 4.7 % 83.4 % 77.4 % 66.3 % Intel Core i7 870 ( P55 ) - 1.0 % 60.8 % 37.2 % 62.5 %
Ouch .
Maybe Lynnfield is human after all .
Almost across the board the quad - GPU results significantly favor X58 .
It makes sense given how data hungry these GPUs are .
Again , the conclusion here is that for a high end multi-GPU setup you 'll want to go with X58 / Bloomfield .
A Quick Look at GPU Limited Gaming
With all of our CPU reviews we try to strike a balance between CPU and GPU limited game tests in order to show which CPU is truly faster at running game code .
In fact all of our CPU tests are designed to figure out which CPUs are best at a number of tasks .
However , the vast majority of games today will be limited by whatever graphics card you have in your system .
The performance differences we talked about a earlier will all but disappear in these scenarios .
Allow me to present data from Crysis Warhead running at 2560 x 1600 with maximum quality settings :
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275 Crysis Warhead ( ambush ) Crysis Warhead ( avalanche ) Crysis Warhead ( frost ) Intel Core i7 975 20.8 fps 23.0 fps 21.4 fps Intel Core i7 870 20.8 fps 22.9 fps 21.5 fps AMD Phenom II X4 965 BE 20.9 fps 23.0 fps 21.5 fps
They 're all the same .
This should n't come as a surprise to anyone , it 's always been the case .
Any CPU near the high end , when faced with the same GPU bottleneck , will perform the same in game .
Now that does n't mean you should ignore performance data and buy a slower CPU .
You always want to purchase the best performing CPU you can at any given pricepoint .
It 'll ensure that regardless of the CPU / GPU balance in applications and games that you 're always left with the best performance possible .

SYSMark 2007 Performance
Our journey starts with SYSMark 2007 , the only all - encompassing performance suite in our review today .
The idea here is simple : one benchmark to indicate the overall performance of your machine .
I already spoiled the surprise and gave out the SYSMark data earlier , but this should put things in perspective .
See how the Core i7 870 and Core i5 750 fit nicely in between the Core i7 920 and 975 ?
Yeah , that 's because pretty much anything below the 975 does n't make sense anymore thanks to Lynnfield .
Guess what else does n't make sense anymore ?
AMD 's pricing on the Phenom II X4 965 BE .
The 965 BE is priced at $ 245 while the i5 750 is a $ 196 processor .
The 750 is about 6 % faster here .
AMD will need to adjust its prices downward after this .
The standings move around a bit in the individual SYSMark tests , but the bottom line remains : the Core i5 750 , despite lacking Hyper Threading , is worthy .
Adobe Photoshop CS4 Performance
To measure performance under Photoshop CS4 we turn to the Retouch Artists ’ Speed Test .
The test does basic photo editing ; there are a couple of color space conversions , many layer creations , color curve adjustment , image and canvas size adjustment , unsharp mask , and finally a gaussian blur performed on the entire image .
The whole process is timed and thanks to the use of Intel 's X25 - M SSD as our test bed hard drive , performance is far more predictable than back when we used to test on mechanical disks .
Time is reported in seconds and the lower numbers mean better performance .
The test is multithreaded and can hit all four cores in a quad - core machine .
Hyper Threading does have a real benefit in Photoshop and thus we see the Core i5 750 suffering a bit .
It 's still faster than the Phenom II 965 BE but it is marginally slower than the i7 920 .
The 870 is bested only by the i7 975 .
DivX 8.5.3 with Xmpeg 5.0.3
Our DivX test is the same DivX / XMpeg 5.03 test we 've run for the past few years now , the 1080 p source file is encoded using the unconstrained DivX profile , quality / performance is set balanced at 5 and enhanced multithreading is enabled :
And we 're done .
DivX , historically a stronghold for AMD's Phenom II processors ( at least compared to their price - competitive Penryn counterparts ) is faster on the Core i5 750 than on the Phenom II X4 965 BE .
What 's wrong with that ?
The i5 750 costs $ 199 , the 965 BE costs $ 245 .
Intel is selling you more transistors for less than AMD is for once .
x264 HD Video Encoding Performance
Graysky's x264 HD test uses the publicly available x264 codec ( open source alternative to H.264 ) to encode a 4 M bps 720 p MPEG - 2 source .
The focus here is on quality rather than speed , thus the benchmark uses a 2 - pass encode and reports the average frame rate in each pass .
In the first pass AMD is quite competitive , outpacing the i5 750 , but when we get to the actual encode :
It 's close , but the cheaper i5 750 is faster than the Phenom II X4 965 BE once again ; Hyper Threading keeps the i7 920 ahead .
Windows Media Encoder 9 x64 Advanced Profile
In order to be codec agnostic we 've got a Windows Media Encoder benchmark looking at the same sort of thing we 've been doing in the DivX and x264 tests , but using WME instead .
AMD is about 6 % faster than the i5 750 here , it looks like the Phenom II does have some hope left for it .
Let 's see how the rest unfolds ...
3dsmax 9 - SPECapc 3dsmax CPU Rendering Test
Today 's desktop processors are more than fast enough to do professional level 3D rendering at home .
To look at performance under 3dsmax we ran the SPECapc 3dsmax 8 benchmark ( only the CPU rendering tests ) under 3dsmax 9 SP1 .
The results reported are the rendering composite scores :
And we 're back down to utter dominance yet again .
The i5 750 is 12.6 % faster than the Phenom II X4 965 BE and 18.8 % cheaper .
Harder , better , faster stronger .
Blender 2.48a
Blender is an open source 3D modeling application .
Our benchmark here simply times how long it takes to render a character that comes with the application .
To get Blender to perform right on Lynnfield we actually had to update our graphics drivers .
It looks like the on - die PCIe does require the latest NVIDIA / ATI drivers to work properly .
The results are n't unusual ; Intel has done very well in these tests and Lynnfield continues to dominate .
The i5 750 is a bit slower than the 920 ( and Q9650 ) thanks to its missing HT support .
Cinebench R10
Created by the Cinema 4D folks we have Cinebench , a popular 3D rendering benchmark that gives us both single and multi- threaded 3D rendering results .
The single threaded benchmark tells us everything we need to know .
The Core i5 750 and i7 870 are two of the fastest processors we 've ever tested at single - threaded applications .
Very few microprocessors will be able to retire instructions from a single thread as quickly as Lynnfield .
This is actually very noticeable in simply using the OS .
Many tasks still are n't multithreaded but they execute very , very fast on Lynnfield .
Crank up the threads and Lynnfield is still competitive .
Because it 's missing Hyper Threading , the i5 750 is barely faster than the Phenom II X4 965 BE .
Although I understand Intel wanting to segment its product line , it seems that the i5's missing HT goes a bit too far .
POV - Ray 3.73 beta 23 Ray Tracing Performance
POV - Ray is a popular , open - source raytracing application that also doubles as a great tool to measure CPU floating point performance .
I ran the SMP benchmark in beta 23 of POV - Ray 3.73 .
The numbers reported are the final score in pixels per second .
We see the same results under POV - Ray .
Regardless of thread count , Lynnfield delivers the best performance possible short of a $ 1000 CPU .
Microsoft Excel 2007
Excel can be a very powerful mathematical tool .
In this benchmark we 're running a Monte Carlo simulation on a very large spreadsheet of stock pricing data .
The Excel test is peculiar in its results .
It must be one of the few situations where Bloomfield 's memory bandwidth advantage is seen as even the Core i7 870 can't outperform the i7 920 .
The Core 2 Quad Q9650 does well thanks to its large 12MB L2 cache , as does the Q6600 with a beefy 8 MB cache .
Sony Vegas Pro 8 : Blu-ray Disc Creation
Although technically a test simulating the creation of a Blu-ray disc , the majority of the time in our Sony Vegas Pro benchmark is spend encoding the 25 M bps MPEG - 2 video stream and not actually creating the Blu-ray disc itself .
Hyper Threading is good for about 4 % here , giving the 920 the slight edge over the Core i5 750 .
Sorenson Squeeze : FLV Creation
Another video related benchmark , we 're using Sorenson Squeeze to convert regular videos into Flash videos for use on websites .
The i5 750 pays the HT penalty , taking another 20 seconds to render our test video than the i7 920 .
It is still faster than the Phenom II X4 965 BE at a much lower cost .
The Core i7 870 comes close but can't beat the i7 975 .
PAR2 Multithreaded Archive Recovery Performance
Par2 is an application used for reconstructing downloaded archives .
It can generate parity data from a given archive and later use it to recover the archive
Chuchusoft took the source code of par2cmdline 0.4 and parallelized it using Intel ’s Threading Building Blocks 2.1 .
The result is a version of par2cmdline that can spawn multiple threads to repair par2 archives .
For this test we took a 708 MB archive , corrupted nearly 60 MB of it , and used the multithreaded par2cmdline to recover it .
The scores reported are the repair and recover time in seconds .
Faster than AMD ?
Check .
Slower than the Core i7 920 ?
Check .
Costs under $ 200 ?
Check .
It 's a shame that Intel did n't enable Hyper Threading on the Core i5 750 , otherwise it would 've really ruined most of the LGA - 1366 lineup .
The Core i7 860 is probably the best of both worlds unfortunately they are very hard to come by at this point .
The Core i7 870 is actually faster than the i7 975 here .
I 'll chalk that up to DDR3 - 1333 with some aggressive turboing .
WinRAR - Archive Creation
Our WinRAR test simply takes 300MB of files and compresses them into a single RAR archive using the application 's default settings .
We 're not doing anything exotic here , just looking at the impact of CPU performance on creating an archive :
Large file compression is very well threaded and thus we see a real difference in performance between the HT enabled i7 920 and the i5 750 without Hyper Threading .
The i7 870 however is within 5 % of the i7 975 , at 56 % of the cost .
Fallout 3 Game Performance
Bethesda ’s latest game uses an updated version of the Gamebryo engine ( Oblivion ) .
This benchmark takes place immediately outside Vault 101 .
The character walks away from the vault through the Springvale ruins .
The benchmark is measured manually using FRAPS .
The numbers are all very close , but the Core i7 870 edges out the 975 for the lead here .
The i5 750 manages to outperform the i7 920 thanks to its more aggressive turbo modes .
The Phenom II X4 965 BE is faster than its closest competitor , but it needs a price adjustment in a major way .
Left 4 Dead
Once more we have Lynnfield near the top , the only thing that 's faster is the i7 975 .
In these situations however the difference between first and fourth place is neglible .
FarCry 2 Multithreaded Game Performance
FarCry 2 ships with the most impressive benchmark tool we ’ve ever seen in a PC game .
Part of this is due to the fact that Ubisoft actually tapped a number of hardware sites ( AnandTech included ) from around the world to aid in the planning for the benchmark .
For our purposes we ran the CPU benchmark included in the latest patch :
Even when four cores are stressed , the i5 750 can pull ahead of the i7 920 .

Power Consumption
If you 'll remember back to last year 's Nehalem coverage I made a point to mention that the Nehalem architecture , thanks to its PCU and power gate transistors , was the most power efficient of the high end options .
The lower the TDP , the more important power efficiency is and thus it's no surprise to see Lynnfield truly impress when it comes to power consumption :
At idle the Core i5 and Core i7 870 use less power than any other processor we 've ever tested .
Note that these idle power figures include an idling GeForce GTX 280 .
With a lower power graphics card , you could easily get to idle power consumption around 60W .
Once we start seeing on - package GPUs , total system power consumption should drop even further .
Under load the Core i5 and Core i7 870 continue to impress .
They both draw less power than a Q6600 or a Q9650 , all the while outperforming the two .
Power consumption is also noticeably lower than Bloomfield .
These things are fast and smart with power .
Just wait until Nehalem goes below 65 W ...
Overclocking : Great When Overvolted , Otherwise ...
Back when I asked Intel why anyone would opt for LGA - 1366 over LGA - 1156 one of the responses I got was : overclocking .
The most overclockable CPUs will be LGA - 1366 chips .
We tried overclocking three different CPUs : the Core i7 870 , Core i7 860 and Core i5 750 .
We overclocked using two different coolers : the retail low profile HSF and a Thermalright MUX - 120 ( the heatsink Intel is sending around to reviewers for high performance testing ) .
I 'll get one thing out of the way : the retail heatsink pretty much sucks for overclocking :
Intel Core i7 870 Max Overclock ( Turbo Disabled ) Intel Retail LGA - 1156 Cooler 3.52GHz ( 160MHz x 22.0 ) Thermalright MUX - 120 4.20 GHz ( 200MHz x 21.0 )
The Thermalright enables higher overclocks by removing heat quickly enough allowing us to increase the voltage to the CPU .
While roughly 1.35V is the limit for the retail cooler , The Thermalright MUX - 120 let us go up to 1.40 V .
In both cases you need to have a well ventilated case .
Um , yeah .
Now for the actual overclocking results .
We overclocked in two ways : 1 ) with turbo mode enabled and ensuring stability at all turbo frequencies ( both single and multiple cores active ) , and 2 ) with turbo mode disabled simply going for highest clock speed .
The results are in the table below :
CPU Stock Clock Speed Max Overclock ( Turbo Enabled ) Max Overclock ( Turbo Disabled ) Intel Core i7 870 2.93 GHz
Default : 3.39GHz ( 154 x 22.0 ) 3C / 4C Active : 3.70GHz
2C Active : 4.00GHz
1C Active : 4.16GHz 4.20 GHz ( 200 x 21.0 ) Intel Core i7 860 2.80 GHz 3.23GHz ( 154 x 21.0 ) 3C / 4C Active : 3.54GHz
2C Active : 3.85GHz
1C Active : 4.00 GHz 3.99GHz ( 210 x 19.0 ) Intel Core i5 750 2.66GHz 3.2GHz ( 160 x 20.0 ) 3C / 4C Active : 3.96GHz
2C Active : 4.00GHz
1C Active : 4.16GHz 3.92GHz ( 206.5 x 19 )
For best performance with all four cores active , disabling turbo mode is the way to go .
Otherwise you have to reduce the BCLK in order to make sure your system is still stable when the one - active - core turbo mode kicks in .
For example , with our Core i7 870 with turbo disabled we hit 4.2GHz using a 200MHz BCLK .
If we used the same BCLK but left turbo enabled , when only one core was active we'd hit 5.4GHz - clearly not realistic with only air cooling .
The benefit of leaving turbo enabled is that you get a more balanced system that 's not always using more power than it needs to .
The Core i5 750
Our Core i7 860 sample was n't that great of an overclocker
Breaking 4.2GHz with our Core i7 870
At roughly 4GHz overclocks for all of these CPUs , it 's reasonable to say that they are good overclockers .
But how about with no additional voltage and the retail heatsink ?
CPU Stock Clock Speed Max Overclock , Turbo Disabled ( No Additional Voltage ) Intel Core i7 870 2.93GHz 3.37GHz ( 22 x 153MHz )
The stock overclocks just plain suck on Lynnfield , you need added voltage to overclock the chip .
With more voltage it works just like a Bloomfield or Phenom II , but at stock voltages Lynnfield just does n't clock very high .
And it has nothing to do with yields .
Overclocking Lynnfield at Stock Voltage : We 're PCIe Limited
Remember the on - die PCIe controller ?
Yep .
It 's to blame .
Lynnfield is Intel 's first attempt at an on - die PCIe controller and it actually works surprisingly well .
There are no performance or compatibility issues .
The on - die PCIe controller needs more voltage as you overclock Lynnfield , limiting Lynnfield 's stock vt overclocking potential .
Unfortunately the PCIe controller on Lynnfield is tied to the BCLK .
Increase the BCLK to overclock your CPU and you 're also increasing the PCIe controller frequency .
This does n't play well with most PCIe cards , so the first rule of thumb is to try and stay at 133MHz multiples when increasing your BCLK .
The second issue is the bigger one .
As you increase the BCLK you increase the frequency of the transistors that communicate to the GPU ( s ) on the PCIe bus .
Those transistors have to send data very far ( relatively speaking ) and very quickly .
When you overclock , you 're asking even more of them .
We know that Bloomfield can easily hit higher frequencies without increasing the core voltage , so there 's no reason to assume that Lynnfield 's core cannot ( in fact , we know it can ) .
The issue is the PCIe controller ; at higher frequencies those " outside facing " transistors need more juice to operate .
Unfortunately on Lynnfield rev 1 there does n't appear to be a way to selectively give the PCIe transistors more voltage , instead you have to up the voltage to the entire processor .
Intel knows the solution to Lynnfield 's voltage requirement for overclocking , unfortunately it 's not something that can be applied retroactively .
Intel could decouple the PCIe controller from BCLK by introducing more PLLs into the chip or , alternatively , tweak the transistors used for the PCIe interface .
Either way we can expect this to change in some later rev of the processor .
Whether that means we 'll see it in the 45nm generation or we 'll have to wait until 32nm remains to be seen .
The good news is that Lynnfield can still overclock well .
The bad news is that unlike Bloomfield ( and Phenom II ) you can't just leave the Vcore untouched to get serious increases in frequency .
Final Words
I 'll start this conclusion with what AMD must do in response to Lynnfield .
The Core i5 750 is a great processor at $ 196 , in fact , it 's the best quad - core CPU you can buy at that price today .
In nearly every case it 's faster than AMD's Phenom II X4 965 BE , despite the AMD processor costing almost another $ 50 .
Granted you can probably save some money on an integrated 785G motherboard , but if you 're comparing ~ $ 120 motherboards the AMD CPU is simply overpriced .
Lynnfield ( top ) vs. Phenom II ( bottom )
Luckily , the solution is n't that difficult .
AMD needs to lower prices .
The problem is that AMD has too many products below $ 200 already .
The Phenom II X3 and X4 series both exist below $ 200 and rumor has it that AMD is also going to introduce a quad - core Athlon II somewhere down there .
Lynnfield 's arrival causes a lot of price compression on AMD 's side .
The most AMD should sell the 965 BE for is $ 199 , but if it is to remain competitive the chip needs to be priced much lower .
That does n't leave much room for other AMD CPUs .
On the bright side , this could force AMD to simplify its product lines again ( similar to what it has quietly been doing already ) .
The next thing that the Core i5 750 does is it finally ends the life of LGA - 775 .
Just as was the case with AMD , the Core 2 Quad Q9650 is easily destroyed by the Core i5 750 and at a lower price .
With significantly lower motherboard costs than the LGA - 1366 chips , the Core i5 750 can actually compete in the high end LGA - 775 space .
It 's only a matter of time before the sub - $ 200 LGA - 775 parts are made obsolete as well .
Lynnfield power consumption is just excellent , these are the most power efficient quad - core CPUs we 've ever tested .
They use less power at idle than similarly clocked dual - core processors and under load they deliver better performance per watt than any of their closest competitors .
Later this year we 'll see 32nm dual - core Westmere start to ship for notebooks .
I do n't have performance data but I 'd expect that early next year will be the perfect time to buy a new notebook .
Can you tell that I like the Core i5 750 ?
Again , at $ 196 you can't find a better processor .
Intel did its homework very well and managed to deliver something that kept AMD in check without completely upsetting the balancing of things .
There 's no technical reason that Intel could n't have enabled Hyper Threading on the Core i5 , it 's purely a competitive move .
A Core i5 750 with HT would not only defeat the purpose of most of the i7s , but it would also widen the performance gap with AMD .
Intel does n't need to maintain a huge performance advantage , just one that 's good enough .
While I 'd love to have a 750 with HT , I 'd still recommend one without it .
The Core i7 870 gets close enough to the Core i7 975 that I 'm having a hard time justifying the LGA - 1366 platform at all .
As I see it , LGA - 1366 has a few advantages :
1 ) High - end multi-GPU Performance 2 ) Stock Voltage Overclocking 3 ) Future support for 6 - core Gulftown CPUs
If that list does n't make you flinch , then Lynnfield is perfect .
You 'll save a bunch on a motherboard and the CPUs start at $ 196 instead of $ 284 .
We did n't have enough time with our Core i7 860 to include performance results here but my instincts tell me that at $ 284 that 'll be the Lynnfield sweetspot .
You get excellent turbo modes and Hyper Threading , without breaking $ 300 .
Speaking of turbo , I 'd say that Intel is definitely on to something here .
The performance impact was small with Bloomfield , but turbo on Lynnfield is huge .
My tests showed up to a 17 % increase in performance depending on the workload , with most CPU - influenced scenarios seeing at least 9 or 10 % .
The turbo mode transitions happen fast enough to accelerate even simple actions like opening a new window .
OS and application responsiveness is significantly improved as a result and it's something that you can actually feel when using a Lynnfield machine .
It all works so seamlessly , you just always get the best performance you need .
It 's like Intel crammed the best single , dual and quad - core processors all into one package .
Perhaps that 's what kept me from falling in love with Bloomfield right away .
It was fast but in the same way that its predecessors were fast .
If you did n't have a well threaded application , Bloomfield was n't any better than a similarly clocked Penryn .
Lynnfield 's turbo modes change the game .
Say goodbye to tradeoffs , the Core i5 and Core i7 are now fast regardless of thread count .
It speed that is useful , it speed that you can feel , it 's what truly makes Lynnfield the best desktop microprocessor of 2009 .
It 's not just faster , it 's smarter , it 's better .
It 's why today 's title borrows from Daft Punk and not Star Wars ; it 's not more of the same , it 's something futuristic and new .
Lynnfield shows us the beginning of how all microprocessors are going to be made in the future .
Even AMD is embracing turbo , we 'll see it with Fusion in 2011 .
Extend turbo to its logical conclusion and you end up with something very exciting .
Imagine a processor made up of many different cores , large and small , CPU and GPU .
Each one turning on / off depending on the type of workload , and each running as fast as possible without dissipating more heat than your system can handle .
My only two complaints with Lynnfield are that the chips do require additional voltage ( above stock ) to overclock and of course the lack of Hyper Threading on the Core i5 .
It does n't ruin the processor , but it gives us something to wish for .
Our work is never over .
The Economy and Debt , A Pragmatic View
In Australia ( as in many other countries of the world ) , our Federal Government ’s reaction to the financial crisis was to distribute money in the form of “ gifts ” .
Their intentions were supposedly honorable .
They wanted to stimulate the economy .
In the first instance , they wanted to stimulate the construction industry because housing is a very important element of the economy .
So they offered the gift of a significant cash rebate ( funded by taxpayer money ) to first home buyers .
What was the impact of this ?
Many first home buyers who could n’t really afford to , bought homes that they should / would not otherwise have bought and are now up to their ears in debt .
The price of low end housing rose – typically by an amount which exceeded the amount of the cash rebate , because banks will lend you nine dollars for every one of your dollars to buy a house and the government ’s cash rebate was considered “ your dollars ” .
The Australian Federal Government ’s budget blew out .
Then the various governments ( State and Federal ) offered cash gifts to people who would install energy saving “ devices ” such as solar hot water systems and / or ceiling insulation .
Again , the intentions were supposedly honorable .
Al Gore and the IPCC had convinced everyone that carbon dioxide was “ bad ” so they wanted to reduce Australia ’s dependence on coal fired electricity whilst at the same time stimulating the economy .
What was the impact of this ?
Sales of solar hot water systems boomed .
Waiting lists grew .
Whilst prices of competitor systems were roughly comparable , installation charges rose .
This analyst called for several quotes .
For half a day ’s work to install similar systems , the installation quotes ranged from A$ 900 to A$ 1800 .
Two people working for five hours at A$ 50 an hour should have charged A$ 500 for their labor .
The difference ?
Maybe it was the cost of travel time and plastic piping .
Maybe the installers decided they could get away with A$ 100 to A$ 150 an hour for their labor .
Who cares ?
The government ’s paying .
Sales of ceiling insulation bats boomed .
Local manufacturers could n’t cope .
Imports from China rose .
Unscrupulous vendors raised prices .
Sometimes by as much as 100 % on what they were previously charging for products that may well have been landing them at a lower cost than the Australian manufacturers had been charging .
Very probably , the lower cost was associated with a lower quality .
The State and Federal Governments ’ budgets blew out .
There were other examples , but you get the picture .
Question : Given the above , will unemployment continue to grow ?
Answer :
In all likelihood , yes , particularly within the US economy .
And , given that the US economy is the largest in the world , this seems likely to cascade into other countries .
Why ?
The answer is multi dimensional .
In the first instance it has to do with a phenomenon called “ monetary inflation ” .
The United States Federal Reserve ( an institution whose very existence flies in the face of Article 1 , Section 8 of US Constitution ) has the ability to create money out of thin air – without any Congressional supervision whatsoever .
When you “ inflate ” the money supply of a nation , you are creating what economists describe as an inflationary environment .
There are three possible outcomes of monetary inflation :
If it serves to stimulate economic activity without placing a strain on the currently underutilized capacity of commerce and industry to supply , then prices remain constant but debt levels rise .
If it serves to stimulate the economic activity and , at the same time , this places a strain on the capacity of commerce and industry to supply , ( as has happened in Australia in the above examples ) then prices rise .
But debt levels also rise .
If it serves to stimulate the economic activity and overseas suppliers move in to fill demand because local suppliers are unable to do so , then the likely result will be a fall in the value of the currency of the country which is increasing the money supply .
This , in turn , will give rise to higher import prices and prices in general will likely rise .
Debt levels also rise .
The bottom line is that debt levels always rise following monetary inflation .
If it ’s not government debt levels then it ’s personal and / or corporate debt levels .
Usually it ’s all three .
The chart below shows “ total debt outstanding in the United States , both secured and unsecured , as a percentage of GDP ” .
Source : http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/overcoming_americas_debt_overhang_case_inflation
The debt levels are a direct consequence of the activities of the US Federal Reserve , which was formed in December 1913 , nine months before the outbreak of World War I .
The above begs the following question :
When does a country reach the point when its debt levels are too high to be sustained ?
The pragmatic answer to that question is :
When the level of delinquencies becomes chronic and continues to rise despite economic stimulus .
At the end of the day , rising delinquencies are typically driven by rising unemployment .
When you have chronic and rising unemployment , it does n’t matter what the prevailing levels of interest rates may be and it does n’t matter whether or not you “ refinance ” your debts .
If you are unemployed , you will not have sufficient income to make either interest or capital repayments .
Additional to the above , there are a couple of “ nuances ” ( some nuances ! ) :
One question revolves around whether the banks are accurately reporting the levels of delinquencies .
The issue here ultimately devolves to whether or not the banks are showing assets on their books ( loans to consumers and corporations ) which they really should be writing off as bad debts .
If not , the question arises as to whether the US banking industry as a whole ( as an example ) is solvent .
That ’s where we appear to be right now .
Quote : “ …. 4.89 % of mortgages were 30 days past due in August 2008 , while in August 2007 , the rate was 3.44 % , as Equifax data showed .
The rate of subprime mortgage delinquencies currently tops 41 % , growing from about 39 % in each of the prior five months .
Thus , in compliance with the data got by Reuters , 7.58 % of US homeowners were at least 30 days late on payments in August , up from 7.32 % in July ”
Quote : “ The proportion of credit card accounts at least 60 days past due was down in August for the third straight month , while subprime card delinquencies also fell .
That improvement in delinquency rates partly reflects risk - aversion among issuers , [ analyst emphasis ] which have reduced the number of cards by 82 million , or 19 % , over the past year , while cutting credit limits by $ 721 billion , to about $ 3.6 trillion . ”
( Source : http://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/.. )
Quote : “ Bank of America said its charge off - rate -- loans the company does not expect to be repaid -- rose to 14.54 percent in August from 13.81 percent in July .
Citigroup , the largest issuer of MasterCard - branded credit cards , said its charge - off rate rose to 12.14 percent in August from 10.03 percent in July . ”
Source : http://www.reuters.com/.. )
Author comment :
When you write off a non performing loan it ceases to be classified as non performing .
Credit card delinquencies may have fallen in the three months to August because charge - off rose .
So , the question is : “ Have the banks been charging off mortgages ?
If not , why not ? ”
Another question revolves around whether the US Federal Government is itself able to service its debts .
If it can not match its committed expenditure stream with its income stream from taxes then it will be forced to collaborate with the Federal Reserve to continue printing money to “ plug the gap ” .
In turn , if the US Federal budget is in chronic deficit then this will result in an ever upwards spiraling of US public debt levels .
At some point , questions begin to be asked about whether the dollars being created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve have any value at all .
That ’s where we appear to be right now .
Is it possible that the US Federal Government ’s income stream from taxes could rise to cover its expenditures ?
The answer to this question , once again , boils down to the anticipated level of unemployment .
So let ’s look at unemployment from a different perspective .
The following is a quote from a recently published article by Frank Shostak .
( See : http://mises.org/story/3697 )
“ A weakening in the growth momentum of lending has taken place despite central banks ' massive monetary pumping .
Commercial banks in major economies are finding it more attractive to sit on the newly injected money rather than lend it out . ”
The article is entitled “ Does a Liquidity Trap Pose a Threat ” and I would strongly recommend that readers take the time to read this article very carefully
What Frank is talking about in this article is the meaning of “ real ” savings .
Here is another quote :
“ once the economy falls into a recession on account of a falling pool of real savings , any government or central bank attempts to revive the economy must fail .
Not only will these attempts fail to revive the economy , but they will deplete the pool of real savings , thereby prolonging the economic slump . ”
Let me try to explain this in layman ’s terms ( given that I am a layman as opposed to an economist )
Assume that Joe Sixpack earns $ 60,000 a year and assume that he is one of the lucky employed in an environment where the government statistics admit to 9.8 % unemployment but the real figure is probably higher .
His $ 60,000 a year is spent on things like mortgage and other debt repayments , clothing , food , schooling for his kids , medical expenses , entertainment .
Now , in an environment where there is a growing delinquency in debt servicing and / or repayments , the US Government tries to stimulate the economy by printing US Dollars .
But there are inadequate “ real savings ” to back these new dollars .
As a consequence , the pool of real savings is depleted further and the dollar loses value .
Even if the US Dollar does n’t “ appear ” to fall in value ( in terms of the US$ index ) , raw materials which are crucial to the maintenance of a buoyant economy start to rise in price in US $ denominated terms .
From the US ’s perspective , the most important of these is oil given that 90 % of all transport within the US is powered by oil .
Below is a chart of the price of oil ( courtesy Decisionpoint.com )
Note how the price of oil started to rise in early 2009 after the US Fed began to man the printing presses like there would be no tomorrow .
Unfortunately , when the oil price rises , this adds to the cost of transport for Joe and it also adds to the cost of other things that Joe buys that also have transport costs as part of their cost structure ( like fruit and vegetables and meat ) .
Eventually , Joe ca n’t come out on his $ 60,000 a year anymore .
But he ’s in a bind .
He ca n’t go to his boss to ask for a raise in salary because his boss is firing people in order to cut wage costs .
Maybe Joe will be seen as a trouble maker and he will also be fired .
So Joe does the only thing he can .
He cuts back on purchases of non essentials .
In turn , this translates , eventually , to a downward pressure on economic activity across the entire country and on GDP .
Last week the author hereof published an article entitled “ A Peter Pan Market ” ( See : Stock Market , A Peter Pan Market ) .
In that article it was explained what happens to corporate profits when a recession hits .
But there was insufficient space to look closely enough at this issue .
So , below the reader can find four tables which show more accurately what typically happens in the real world when a recession hits .
( The reader is cautioned that these Tables are conceptual )
Table 1 : A notional corporation ’s profit model before the recession hits
Table 2 : After the recession hits and assuming no competitor reaction ( 7.5 % fall in revenue arbitrarily assumed .
Everything else remains constant )
Table 3 : After the recession hits and assuming there is competitor reaction in the form of discounting .
( 5 % discounting wins some sales and only 5 % fall in revenue .
Everything else remains constant )
Table 4 : Optimistic .
After the recession hits and assuming competitor reaction in the form of discounting .
( 5 % discounting wins all sales back .
No fall in revenue .
Everything else remains constant )
The reader ’s attention is drawn to the line marked “ Fixed Costs ” .
They start off at 30 % of revenue but they have been kept constant at $ 300 .
In reality , employers fight at two levels when a recession hits .
At one level they try to protect their sales line by giving discounts .
At another level they try to cut their fixed costs by retrenching staff amongst other things .
In the current economic environment , with historically high debt levels ( and low real savings ) the more the US Federal Government tries to stimulate via a US Fed assisted policy of monetary inflation , the more there will be an upward pressure on prices and the more there will be a downward pressure on revenue and an increasing propensity on the part of employers to retrench .
Eventually , some employers will go into insolvency and the unemployment rate will rise further .
This is what Frank was talking about in real world terms when he said that “ .
Not only will these attempts fail to revive the economy , but they will [ further ] deplete the pool of real savings , thereby prolonging the economic slump . ”
Now , in the above context , let ’s look back into history .
The market peaked on October 10th 2007 when the Standard & Poor Industrial Index hit a high of 1565.36 .
At that time , as can be subjectively judged from the chart below , the P/E ratio of the $ SPX ( black line ) was around 18X ( courtesy DecisionPoint.com )
In rough terms , 1565 / 18 = eps of around $ 87 a share .
But the tables above show that earnings might be expected to fall by between 30 % and 66 % if the revenue volumes fall by around 7.5 % in real terms as a result of the recession .
In broad brush terms , it seems likely that earnings are far more likely to be around the $ 45 – $ 50 level than the $ 87 level and , if this happens , Price / Earnings ratios will inevitably fall back to more “ normal ” levels of 10X – 15X .
Oops !
The reader is once again cautioned that the tables above reflect a conceptual argument .
The purpose of these tables is to demonstrate a point of principle .
Regardless of whether profits fall by 30 % or 50 % or 66 % the question is : “ Can corporate profitability be expected to get back to previous peaks in the foreseeable future given that further stimulus by the US Federal Government is likely to give rise to increasing unemployment ?
The short answer to that question is : No .
Therefore , P/E ratios will very likely contract .
Conclusion
If you are of sound mind , and if you have any empathy with the above , you will probably not want to be invested in anything but “ special situations ” in the equity markets and you will probably want to avoid most debt instruments that are denominated in US Dollars .
Additionally , you will probably also want to avoid leaving your hard earned savings in the US banking system that is “ insured ” by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which , in turn , is funded by dollars printed by the US Federal Reserve .
What do we do about all of this ?
On a personal level we should erase the word “ want ” out of our lexicons and we should focus exclusively on the word “ need ” .
Ask yourself :
What do I absolutely need in order to survive what is coming down the turnpike ?
If possible , you need to be debt free and you need to have an income that exceeds your expenditure .
If this is not possible , then you need to be prepared to dip into capital to augment your income for a few years .
If you ca n’t achieve this , then you need to cut back on your lifestyle by moving to a less expensive neighborhood and / or by living more frugally .
On a more macro level , you might want to investigate owning some gold as an insurance policy .
Gold tends to hold its value in times of economic crisis .
On an even more macro level , you can buy a copy of my factional novel , entitled Beyond Neanderthal .
This book may be a few years ahead of its time but it points a possible way forward .
You can purchase a copy via Amazon or via the weblink below .
The reader should understand that it is “ energy ” that drives the world economy and that fossil fuels passed their use - by date in the mid 1970s .
In essence , the Fed has been printing money as a response to the fact that wealth creation activities which rely on fossil fuel energy input have become increasingly impotent .
As a consequence , debt levels have exploded to unmanageable levels .
That , in essence is why the world economy is now teetering .
One alternative energy “ driver ” of the world economy may be nuclear fission .
But it may not be .
That is why I am now researching a second factional novel which will focus on nuclear fission .
In the meantime , perhaps we might find ways of accelerating implementation of the vision articulated in Beyond Neanderthal

Beyond Neanderthal is a novel with a light hearted and entertaining fictional storyline ; and with carefully researched , fact based themes .
In Chapter 1 ( written over a year ago ) the current financial turmoil is anticipated .
The rest of the 430 page novel focuses on the probable causes of this turmoil and what we might do to dig ourselves out of the quagmire we now find ourselves in .
The core issue is “ energy ” , and the story leads the reader step - by - step on one possible path which might point a way forward .
Gold plays a pivotal role in our future – not as a currency , but as a commodity with unique physical characteristics that can be harnessed to humanity 's benefit .
Until the current market collapse , there would have been many who questioned the validity of the arguments in Beyond Neanderthal .
Now the evidence is too stark to ignore .
This is a book that needs to be read by large numbers of people to make a difference .

The philosophy that has helped me both in making money as a hedge fund manager and in spending it as a policy oriented philanthropist is not about money but about the complicated relationship between thinking and reality .
The crash of 2008 has convinced me that it provides a valuable insight into the workings of the financial markets .
The efficient market hypothesis holds that financial markets tend towards equilibrium and accurately reflect all available information about the future .
Deviations from equilibrium are caused by exogenous shocks and occur in a random manner .
The crash of 2008 falsified this hypothesis .
I contend that financial markets always present a distorted picture of reality .
Moreover , the mispricing of financial assets can affect the so - called fundamentals that the price of those assets is supposed to reflect .
That is the principle of reflexivity .
Instead of a tendency towards equilibrium , financial markets have a tendency to develop bubbles .
Bubbles are not irrational : it pays to join the crowd , at least for a while .
So regulators cannot count on the market to correct its excesses .
The crash of 2008 was caused by the collapse of a super - bubble that has been growing since 1980 .
This was composed of smaller bubbles .
Each time a financial crisis occurred the authorities intervened , took care of the failing institutions , and applied monetary and fiscal stimulus , inflating the super - bubble even further .
I believe that my analysis of the super - bubble offers clues to the reform that is needed .
First , since markets are bubble - prone , financial authorities must accept responsibility for preventing bubbles from growing too big .
Alan Greenspan and others refused to accept that .
If markets cannot recognise bubbles , the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve asserted , neither can regulators – and he was right .
Nevertheless authorities have to accept the assignment .
Second , to control asset bubbles it is not enough to control the money supply ; you must also control credit .
The best known means to do so are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements .
Currently they are fixed irrespective of the market ’s mood because markets are not supposed to have moods .
They do , and authorities need to counteract them to prevent asset bubbles growing too large .
So they must vary margin and capital requirements .
They must also vary the loan - to - value ratio on commercial and residential mortgages to forestall real estate bubbles .
Regulators may also have to invent new tools or revive ones that have fallen into disuse .
Central banks used to instruct commercial banks to limit lending to a particular sector if they felt that it was overheating .
Another example of needing new tools involves the internet boom .
Mr Greenspan recognised it when he spoke about “ irrational exuberance ” in 1996 .
He did nothing to avert it , feeling that reducing the money supply was too blunt a tool .
But he could have devised more specific measures , such as asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to freeze new share issues , as the internet boom was fuelled by equity leveraging .
Third , since markets are unstable , there are systemic risks in addition to the risks affecting individual market participants .
Participants may ignore these systemic risks , believing they can always sell their positions , but regulators cannot ignore them because if too many participants are on the same side , positions cannot be liquidated without causing a discontinuity or a collapse .
That means the positions of all major participants , including hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds , must be monitored to detect imbalances .
Certain derivatives , like credit default swaps , are prone to creating hidden imbalances so they must be regulated , restricted or forbidden .
Fourth , financial markets evolve in a one - directional , non-reversible manner .
Financial authorities have extended an implicit guarantee to all institutions that are too big to fail .
Withdrawing that guarantee is not credible , therefore they must impose regulations to ensure this guarantee will not be invoked .
Such institutions must use less leverage and accept restrictions on how they invest depositors ’ money .
Proprietary trading ought to be financed out of banks ’ own capital not deposits .
But regulators must go further to protect capital and regulate the compensation of proprietary traders to ensure that risks and rewards at too - big - to - fail banks are aligned .
This may push proprietary traders out of banks and into hedge funds , where they properly belong .
Since markets are interconnected and some banks occupy quasi- monopolistic positions , we must consider breaking them up .
It is probably impractical to separate investment banking from commercial banking as the Glass - Steagall act of 1933 did .
But there have to be internal compartments that separate proprietary trading from commercial banking and seal off trading in various markets to reduce contagion .
Finally , the Basel Accords made a mistake when they gave securities held by banks substantially lower risk ratings than regular loans : they ignored the systemic risks attached to concentrated positions in securities .
This was an important factor aggravating the crisis .
It has to be corrected by raising the risk ratings of securities held by banks .
That will probably discourage the securitisation of loans .
All these will cut the profitability and leverage of banks .
This raises an issue about timing .
It is not the right time to enact permanent reforms .
The financial system is far from equilibrium .
The short - term needs are the opposite of what is needed in the long term .
First you must replace the credit that has evaporated by using the only source that remains credible – the state .
That means increasing national debt and extending the monetary base .
As the economy stabilises you must shrink this base as fast as credit revives – otherwise , deflation will be replaced by inflation .
We are still in the first phase of this delicate manoeuvre .
Banks are earning their way out of a hole .
To cut their profitability now would be counterproductive .
Regulatory reform has to await the second phase , when the money supply needs to be brought under control and carefully phased in so as not to disrupt recovery .
But we can not afford to forget about it .

In the night of October 27 , urban guerrillas opened fire on the police station of Agia Paraskevi in Athens , wounding 5 officers , two of which are in intensive care .
The attack has created a climate of tension and puzzlement as greece enters the period of the " two hot months " .
The attack came at 21:40 on Tuesday 27 October , the eve of the 69th anniversary of the anti-nazi struggle .
According to witnesses , the urban guerrillas opened fire with Kalashnikovs against the armed guard of the police station of Agia Paraskevi , a wealthy Athens suburb , leaving the scene uninhibited with the help of a hand grenade .
The attack which consisted of a shooting of 100 bullets on the part of the urban guerrillas , has left six police officers , none of whom managed to return the fire .
Two of the officers are reported to be in intensive care but not in life danger .
The Ministry of Public Order has announced that it does not accept the attack was caused as a retaliation of its offering 600.000 euros for information that will lead to the arrest of three wanted and condemned anarchists in relation to the bank robbery that has led to the imprisonment of another anarchist , Dimitrakis , in a trial that brought to the surface a lingering debate on social banditry .
With no group having yet claimed responsibility for the bloody attack , and given that the automatic weapons used in the attack have not been used before , the Ministry has expressed fears that it might be soon followed by another attack .
As a response to the continuing urban guerrilla attacks against the police , the Ministry has announced that police stations will no longer have outdoors guards , declining any proposals for the introduction of new anti-terrorist legislation that would jeopardise constitutional freedoms .
The response of the parliamentary left to the attack has been one of both denouncing it and claiming it points to the work of agents provocateurs with the purpose of instituting anti-popular measures and repressive laws , reflecting Italy 's 1970s strategy of tension .
Surprisingly , on the right , apart from the customary denunciations , there has been criticism of a sterile " communication spectacularism " on part of the government , referring to the police sweeping operations in Exarcheia in the last weeks .
A right wing newspaper , Avriani , has even gone as far as to propose on its front page an amnesty for all leftist guerrilla groups , on the condition of a decommission of arms .
The tension , suspicion and puzzlement caused by what is considered to be a " declaration of war " attack on part of the guerrilla movement , or one of its manifestations , comes as greece enters the " two hot months " of November and December , which apart from the usually tense anniversary of the 1973 Polytechnic Uprising on November 17 , now includes the first anniversary of the assassination of Alexandros Grigoropoulos and the start of the December Uprising , on December 6 , as well as the trial of Grigoropoulos ' murderers in mid December .
The tea party is taking aim at Republican candidates including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , Texas Rep. Mike Conaway and California senatorial candidate Carly Fiorina .

While the energy of the anti-tax and anti-Big Government tea party movement may yet haunt Democrats in 2010 , the first order of business appears to be remaking the Republican Party .
Whether it ’s the loose confederation of Washington - oriented groups that have played an organizational role or the state - level activists who are channeling grass - roots anger into action back home , tea party forces are confronting the Republican establishment by backing insurgent conservatives and generating their own candidates — even if it means taking on GOP incumbents .

“ We will be a headache for anyone who believes the Constitution of the United States … is n’t to be protected , ” said Dick Armey , chairman of the anti-tax and limited government advocacy group FreedomWorks , which helped plan and promote the tea parties , town hall protests and the September ‘ Taxpayer March ’ in Washington .
“ If you ca n’t take it seriously , we will look for places of other employment for you . ”
“ We ’re not a partisan organization , and I think many Republicans are disappointed we are not , ” added Armey , a former GOP congressman .
In Florida , where the national party has signaled its preference for centrist Gov. Charlie Crist in the GOP Senate primary , tea party activists are lining up behind former state House Speaker Marco Rubio in reaction to Crist ’s public backing for President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package .
“ We were very disappointed with Gov. Charlie Crist when he supported the stimulus , the bailout , and he appeared publicly with President Obama , ” said Everett Wilkinson , a South Florida - based organizer for Tea Party Patriots .
“ The opposition comes from Crist ’s support for the largest spending plan ever and the environmental policies he ’s pushing on the American people . ”
Rubio has already made appearances at Florida tea parties , and protesters have been seen waving signs declaring , “ Anybody but Charlie Crist . ”
He also has Armey ’s endorsement , and Armey headlined a Dallas fundraiser for him several weeks ago .
Wilkinson said that the tax status of his Florida - based group limits what it can do to assist Rubio in the August 2010 primary .
But he said the organization would launch an aggressive get - out - the - vote operation and issue a report card grading each candidate appearing on the ballot .
Tea party activists are also lining up behind challengers to GOP establishment - backed Senate candidates in Colorado and Connecticut .
In California , former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina — like Crist , another National Republican Senatorial Committee - favored Senate contender — is the target of tea party animus in her primary against conservative state Assemblyman Chuck DeVore .
“ My impression is that the support among tea partyers for DeVore is high , ” said Mark Meckler , a California - based organizer for Tea Party Patriots .
“ I hear nothing but praise for the guy . ”
Tea party organizers say their resistance to Republican Party - backed primary candidates has much to do with what they perceive as the GOP ’s stubborn insistence on embracing candidates who do n’t abide by a small government , anti-tax conservative philosophy .
“ It ’s an outgrowth of the frustration people have had with the Republican Party , ” said Andrew Moylan , director of governmental affairs for the National Taxpayers Union , another group that has played a large role in organizing the tea party movement .
“ I think a lot of people have been angry at Republicans for betraying our trust . ”
“ I think the GOP establishment has ignored their constituents and the feelings of their constituents for years , ” added Meckler .
It ’s an unusual predicament for the Republican Party , since the conservative - oriented issues that animate Tea Party activists once seemed destined to make the movement a valuable auxiliary to the Republican Party .
While there ’s little evidence of tea party activist support for Democratic candidates , the specific notion of electing a GOP majority has n’t ranked high on their agenda either .
At the recent “ Defending the American Dream Summit , ” a conservative event held in Arlington , Va. , a breakout session featuring tea party organizers saw panelists peppered with questions ranging from how to start up political action committees and 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations to whether it was necessary to hire lawyers .
“ Nothing is going to change unless we can get politicians elected who can implement fiscally conservative policies , ” Teri Adams of the Philadelphia - based Independence Hall Tea Party Association , which will be launching a political arm , told those in attendance .
In a handful of states , tea party activists have zeroed in on House Republican incumbents and have launched primary challenges in protest of their past support for the controversial Wall Street bank bailout .
One of those activists , Canyon Clowdus , an Army veteran who is taking on third - term conservative Rep. Mike Conaway ( R - Texas ) , has blasted the incumbent for making “ a horrible mistake ” in voting for Troubled Asset Relief Program .
“ He has put a financial burden on my four children that will amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars each , ” Clowdus says of Conaway on his campaign website .
“ I think it was a bad , bad political decision , ” Armey said of the 34 Senate Republicans and 91 House Republicans who voted for the TARP bailout , “ and if you talk to grass - roots activists , it has become a political test for them . ”
Moylan agreed that TARP is “ really kind of the flash point that started all of this . ”
“ People are paying attention and are willing to hold these people accountable , ” he said .
For some , supporting insurgent campaigns or waging primary bids just is n’t a strong enough signal to send to a Republican Party that has abandoned core conservative policies .
Erick Erickson , founder and editor of the influential conservative blog RedState , has urged tea party activists to “ put down the protest signs ” and stage takeovers of local Republican parties .
“ Grass - roots activists need to start infiltrating the party , ” said Erickson .
“ The only way to start getting [ the establishment ] back is to start pounding them with every fist we have . ”
The calendars we 've featured so far may not be to your taste , but at least they help you tell what day it is .
The Perpetually Pointless calendar , however , lists the dates in rows of ten up to 40 , and does n't give the days of the week .
But this does make it perpetually pointless , as you could use it every year

How interesting .
I ’m at the ISO C++ meeting in Santa Cruz , CA , USA this week .
Ten minutes ago we had a committee straw poll about whether we should remove , deprecate , or leave as - is the export template feature for C++0 x .
The general sentiment was to remove or deprecate it , with deprecation getting the strongest support because it ’s safer per ISO procedure .
Deprecation would not remove it from C++0x , but would put the world on notice that the committee is considering removing it from a future standard .
Note : Nothing is happening to export at this meeting .
The effect of this straw poll of the committee was to give guidance to the core language working group ( CWG ) on the committee ’s general sentiment on this issue .
The CWG is taking this as guidance to produce a detailed proposal to take some action on export at our next meeting in Pittsburgh in March .
I ’ll write a longer trip report in the next week , but this was worth noting in real time because it ’s the first time export template has been discussed in committee since the highly controversial discussion of my and Tom Plum ’s proposal to remove export at the Oxford meeting in 2003 .

A coalition of twenty - two Ugandan professional and civil rights advocacy groups have joined together to denounce ( PDF : 52 KB /4 pages ) the barbaric Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2009 that was introduced before Parliament last week .
The Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law describes the bill as not just an “ anti-homosexuality ” bill , but also as “ the ‘ Anti Civil Society Bill , ’ the ‘ Anti Public Health Bill , ’ or the ‘ Anti-Constitution Bill , ' ” or more specifically , “ the Anti Human Rights Bill . ”
And they liken the bill ’s measures with some of the more repressive practices of the Idi Amin era .
The coalition points out eight specific constitutional articles which the proposed bill violates , and a long list of people who would be put at risk of serious criminal penalties should the bill pass .
This list includes not only LGBT people themselves , but also parents , teachers , landlords , doctors , human rights activists , religious counselors , publishers , and even Internet cafe operators .
The proposed bill would :
Reaffirm the lifetime sentence currently provided upon conviction of homosexuality , and extends the definition from sexual activity to merely “ touch[ing ] another person with the intention of committing the act of homosexuality . ”
Create a new category of “ aggravated homosexuality ” which provides for the death penalty for “ repeat offenders ” and for cases where the individual is HIV - positive .
Criminalizes all speech and peaceful assembly for those who advocate on behalf of LGBT citizens in Uganda with fines and imprisonment of between five and seven years .
Criminalizes the act of obtaining a same - sex marriage abroad with lifetime imprisonment .
Adds a clause which forces friends or family members to report LGBT persons to police within 24 - hours of learning about that individual\ ’s homosexuality or face fines or imprisonment of up to three years .
Adds an extra-territorial and extradition provisions , allowing Uganda to prosecute LGBT Ugandans living abroad .
The coalition concludes :
In sum , the Bahati Bill is profoundly unconstitutional .
It is a major stumbling block to the development of a vibrant human rights movement in Uganda , and a serious threat to Uganda\ ’s developing democratic status .
If passed , this law would not only prove difficult to implement , it would also consume resources and attention which would be better directed at more pressing issues of human rights abuse , corruption , electoral reform , domestic relations and freedom of the press .
Regardless of our personal moral beliefs and values , we the undersigned organisations are standing up in defence of Democracy , our Constitution and its enshrined principles of human dignity , equality , freedom and justice for all .

Anti-Homosexuality or Anti-Human Rights Bill ?
Statement from the
Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law
Hon. Bahati\ ’s Anti-Homosexuality
Bill which was tabled in Parliament on October 14 , 2009 , and is currently before the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee of Parliament covers much more than the title alone proclaims .
A much better title for this bill would have been the ‘ Anti Civil Society Bill , the ‘ Anti Public Health Bill , \’ or the ‘ Anti-Constitution Bill . \ ’
Perhaps more simply it should be called the Anti Human Rights Bill .
As a matter of fact , this bill represents one of the most serious attacks to date on the 1995 Constitution and on the key human rights protections enshrined in the Constitution including :
Article 20 : Fundamental rights and freedoms are inherent and not granted by the State
Article 21 : Right to Equality and Freedom from discrimination
Article 22 : The Right to Life ( the death penalty provisions )
Article 27 : The Right to Privacy
Article 29 : Right to freedom of conscience , expression , movement , religion , assembly and association ( this includes freedom of speech , Academic freedom and media freedom )
Article 30 : Right to Education
Article 32 : Affirmative Action in favour of marginalised groups and
Article 36 on the Rights of Minorities
Let us think for a moment of who — quite apart from the homosexuals it claims as its target — this bill puts at risk :
any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities : Failure to do so s/he will be fined Ush 5,000,000 / = or put away for three years ;
who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities : Failure to do so s/he will be fined Ush 5,000,000 / = or put away for three years ; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours : Failure to do so s/he will be fined Ush 5,000,000 / = or put away for three years in prison ;
who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours : Failure to do so s/he will be fined Ush 5,000,000 / = or put away for three years in prison ; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a suspected homosexual risks seven years of imprisonment ;

, whether in a Community Based Organisation , NGO , or academic institution ; if their organisations seek to have a comprehensive position on sexual and reproductive health , they risk seeing their organisations closed down ; any human rights activist who seeks to promote an understanding of the indivisibility and inalienability of human rights would be judged to be promoting homosexuals and homosexuality , and be punished accordingly ;

any Person alleged to be a homosexual is at risk of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and , in some circumstances , the DEATH PENALTY
In short , this bill targets everybody , and involves everybody : it can not be implemented without making every citizen spy on his or her neighbours .
The last time this was done was in the Amin era , where everyone very quickly became an ‘ enemy of the state\ ’ .
It amounts to a direct invasion of our homes , and will promote blackmail , false accusations and outright intimidation of certain members of the population .
Do Ugandans really want to mimic the practices of the Khartoum regime ?
Have we already forgotten the sex police of Apartheid South Africa , who smashed their way into people \ ’s bedrooms in an attempt to prevent inter-racial sex ?
As Civil Society organisations we condemn all predatory sexual acts ( hetero or homosexual ) that violate the rights of vulnerable sections of our society such as minors and people with disabilities .
However , the Bill lumps “ aggravated homosexuality ” together with sexual acts between consenting adults in order to whip up sentiments of fear and hatred aimed at isolating sexual minorities .
By so doing , the state fails in its duty to protect all its citizens without discrimination .
The bill also asserts Extra Territorial jurisdiction .
In other words , all of the offences covered by the bill can be applied to a Ugandan citizen or permanent resident who allegedly commits them outside the country .
Thus homosexuality and / or its ‘ promotion\ ’ are added to the very short list of offences which fall in the ‘ political offences \ ’ category .
It joins treason , misprision of treason , and terrorism as offences subject to extra-territorial jurisdiction .
Clearly , this is out of all proportion in relation to the gravity of the act .
On top of these day - to - day considerations about everybody \’s safety and security , let us consider what this bill will do for civil society organisations in Uganda which seek to have a critical voice and to engage in issues of global concern .
One of the objectives of the bill is to prohibit the licensing of organizations which allegedly ‘ promote homosexuality . \’
Thus , for example , any organisation which talked about anal sex as part of a campaign of HIV prevention can be affected .
Had this bill been in place earlier this year , no Ugandan could have participated in the World AIDS meeting held in Mexico to discuss HIV prevention .
And what about our standing in the eyes of the world ?
The Bill calls for Uganda to nullify any international treaties , protocols , declarations and conventions which are believed to be ‘ contradictory to the spirit and provisions\ ’ of the bill .
In reality , this would involve Uganda withdrawing from :
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ;
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its protocols ;
The International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ;
The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women ;
The Convention on the Rights of the Child , and
The African Charter on Human and Peoples\ ’ Rights
We note that Uganda is current Chair of the UN Security Council which operates with the UN Charter and UDHR as guiding principles .
It is also current Chair of the Commonwealth and a signatory to the African Union\ ’s Constitutive
Act which has as its premise the promotion and respect of human rights .
In 2009 and 2010 it is hosting AU Summits .
What will happen to Uganda\ ’s hard - won role on the global stage if it nullifies its international and regional human rights commitments ?
Uganda cannot wish away core human rights principles of dignity , equality and non-discrimination , and all Ugandans will pay a heavy price if this bill is enacted .
We will have bargained away our hard - earned rights and freedoms as well as our right to challenge the State and hold it accountable for the protection of these rights .
In sum , the Bahati Bill is profoundly unconstitutional .
It is a major stumbling block to the development of a vibrant human rights movement in Uganda , and a serious threat to Uganda\ ’s developing democratic status .
If passed , this law would not only prove difficult to implement , it would also consume resources and attention which would be better directed at more pressing issues of human rights abuse , corruption , electoral reform , domestic relations and freedom of the press .
Regardless of our personal moral beliefs and values , we the undersigned organisations are standing up in defence of Democracy , our Constitution and its enshrined principles of human dignity , equality , freedom and justice for all .

There are few species as diverse as man ’s best friend .
Yet , every breed from the chihuahua to the great dane has much the same genome .
A recently published article in Science , however , explains that all the variety in dog coat comes down to changes in just three genes !
Most human physical traits are extremely complex genetically , but this study suggests that maybe some major traits could be controlled by just a few genes .
If so , this gives great hope to those wishing to treat diseases , or make improvements , on the genetic level .
My new favorite sport is classifying dogs according to the three newly discovered dog coat genes : length , curl , and arrangement .
The work was led by Elaine Ostrander , head of cancer genetics at the US National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) who hopes that the study of dogs will help us find patterns in our genes that code for diseases and important traits .
Looking into the genetics of dogs may seem way out of the interests of the NHGRI , but linking genes to traits is serious business .
Ostrander ’s work shows that a complex set of phenotypes ( physical characteristics ) can be traced back to just a few genetic variations .
The NHGRI looked at the genomes of more than 1000 dogs from 80 breeds to find the three genes that determine fur phenotypes .
They determined that just three genes determined fur types for over 90 % of breeds .
The FGF2 gene and its variants will give a dog either short hair , or long soft hair .
The KRT71 gene and its variants will give a dog curly fur or straight fur .
RSPO2 determines whether your dog ’s hair grows in a wiry way with features like a mustache – called ‘ furnishings ’ by breeders .
Take a look at a random breed of dog : say the Pembroke Welsh Corgi – and you can see that it has long hair ( FGF2 variant ) , that is straight ( KRT71 standard ) , and without furnishings ( RSPO2 standard ) .
An Airedale Terrier has short ( FGF2 standard ) , curly ( KRT71 variant ) , and wiry hair ( RPSO2 variant ) .
Man , I could do this all day .
Besides my new favorite game of ‘ genetically analyze that puppy ’ , the benefits of the NHGRI study are pretty profound .
The fewer genes responsible for a phenotype , the greater chance that genetic engineering can manipulate those genes for advantage .
Whether this leads to genetic doping therapies for diseases , or designer babies , we ’re likely to see the concept play a major role in genetic experiments to come .
In the meantime , enjoy staring at analyzing the puppies below .

Last night , Vulture had the pleasure of running into world - renowned blues legend John Mayer at a party at the Elle Decor - sponsored Armani / Casa party , where he was playing host .
Since he ’s known for political outspokenness and the trenchant commentary of hits like “ Waiting on the World to Change , ” we figured we ’d ask his opinion on health - care reform and Obama ’s Nobel Peace Prize .
Our freewheeling conversation touched on seventies mustaches and his new album , and concluded , naturally , with the threat of forced sodomy .
Enjoy !
What do you think about Obama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize ?
I think it ’s fantastic .
Why ?
What ’s your overall opinion ?
Do you think I ’m smart enough to be able to articulate to you why our president receiving the Nobel Peace Prize is a bit early for things ?
What ’s your overall opinion ?
I think it ’s a bit premature .
Someone compared it to giving an Oscar to someone still making a film .
So you do n’t think he should have it .
I do n’t think it ’s a bad thing , but maybe someone else deserved it more .
Who ?
If you do n’t know who else should have gotten it instead of Obama , I love you , you ’re beautiful , but shut your fucking mouth .
What do you think about health care ?
Would you take the public option ?
Have you ever heard me play guitar ?
I ’m really fucking good .
You know what I ’m bad at ?
Answering questions about public health care .
This is not in my wheelhouse .
Do you have any questions about music ?
I almost got a mad need to lighten up .
You need to lighten up , because the questions you asked me were all troublemaking questions .
If someone gave me the Nobel Peace Prize , and I did n’t deserve it , I would just shut my mouth and enjoy the hell out of it .
Which I ’m sure he ’s doing .
What ’s he going to do , send it back ?
It ’s like I ’m getting a wrongful bulge in my pants and everyone ’s thinking I ’ve got a nine - inch cock .
I ’m not going to argue with them , I ’m going to let them think I have a nine - inch cock .
How about a style question ?
Yes , this seems to be apropos .
Do you get paid for this ?
I do it more for fun .
You do this for fun ?
That ’s like me saying … never mind .
What do you think about guys with seventies mustaches ?
I do n’t give a fuck about who wears their face what way .
If I could grow a beard , I ’d have some nutty things going on on my face .
You ca n’t grow a beard ?
It ’s a pituitary thing .
I know you ’re not that much of a moron .
These are questions my editor wanted me to ask .
I ’m trying to build my journalistic career here .
You ’re not building a journalistic career .
You ’re making yourself look like a moron and you ’re not a moron .
Who ’s your editor ?
Jada .
Jada is making you sound like a moron in front of people .
Why do n’t you tell me about your new album ?
You ’ve been in the studio for a while .
I have a record coming out November 17 .
Any particular theme or inspiration behind this one that makes it different from previous albums ?
Look what we ’re doing right now !
We ’re connecting right now !
This is great !
Yeah , it ’s going to be quite melodically bright , but the themes are all about heartbreak .
How is that different ?
Have n’t you written a lot about heartbreak ?
I think most artists do , but this is really breaking into the theme of it as a concept .
Is there hope behind the heartbreak ?
The melody is the hope .
The lyrics are the heartbreak , the melody is the hope .
If you have the lyrics being the heartbreak and the music as the heartbreak , your editor made you ask stupid fucking questions !
You ’re standing in front of me acting as if these questions are fair , but now we ’re talking about something real .
So there was stuff I wanted to put on the record that just did n’t fit the concept .
So the next record will have that concept .
What concept ?
More political things , worldly things .
Such as ?
Nothing rhymed with public option .
You do n’t always have to rhyme , though .
I ’m going to forcefully sodomize your editor .
A bit dark but with a funny twist , these paintings by Justin Reed have us thinking about some of our favorite movies today .

Why do snooze alarms go off every 9 minutes ?
http://www.jewishworldreview.com | Q : When you hit the snooze alarm on a clock radio or alarm clock , the alarm goes off again in nine minutes .
Why nine minutes ?
- Bill Williams , Cornelius , N.C .
A : Aww geez , Bill .
Here we 've all finally gotten up and now you 've got us hittin ' the snooze button again .
WHUMP ! ( JEFF DROOLS AND SNORES FOR NINE MINUTES . )
Huh !
Wha ?
Oh , right .
OK .
Just gimme a second
By setting the snooze time to 9 minutes , modern digital alarm clocks only needs to watch the last digit of the time .
So , if you hit snooze at 6:45 , the alarm goes off again when the last digit hits 4 - at 7:54 .
They could n't make the snooze period 10 minutes , or the alarm would go off right away - or the clock would take more circuitry .
Historically speaking , there 's another element to the answer .
Clock experts say when snooze alarms were invented , the gears in alarm clocks were standardized .
The snooze gear was introduced into the existing mix and its teeth had to mesh with the other gears ' teeth .
The engineers had to choose between a gear that made the snooze period nine - plus minutes or 10 - plus minutes .
Because of the gear configuration , 10 minutes on the nose was not an option .
According to these clock historians , engineers chose the shorter snooze , figuring " less than 10 minutes " seemed more punctual and marketable than sending people back to dreamland for " more than 10 minutes . "
The public became accustomed to this , and clock makers have generally stuck with it .
General Electric - Telechron marketed the first snooze alarm in 1956 .
Check out that clock online at www.telechron.net/7h241.htm.
But not all snooze alarms buzzed every nine minutes .
In 1959 , Westclox released " drowse " alarms that could be set for either five or 10 minutes of snooze time .
Later Westclox marketed clocks with a seven - minute snooze alarm .
Still , nine minutes is the norm .
If you smack a snooze button , you ai n't sleepin ' alone .
According to USA Today , more than a third of American adults hit the snooze button every morning an average of three times .
Snooziest group ?
The 25 - to 34 - year - olds - 57 percent of them hit the snooze button daily .
Peppiest risers ?
It 's the seniors .
Only 10 percent of Americans over 65 regularly use their snooze button .
Snooze alarms can do more than just make you late for work .
They can train you to remember your dreams .
See , early morning is heavy rapid - eye - movement time , when we dream heavily .
The snooze alarm can be your guide in and out of that dreamscape , as you might have noticed on a morning when you hit the snooze button several times .
Charles McPhee , the nationally syndicated columnist and radio host known as " The Dream Doctor , " says if you can't remember your dreams you can try this exercise .
On a morning when you can sleep in , set your alarm and when it sounds , hit the snooze alarm .
Lie still and work back in your mind to what you were just dreaming about .
Remember your emotions and whatever snippets of the dream you can .
See if you can piece together the outline of a dream , and write it in a notebook by your bed .
Then go back to sleep and repeat the process each time the snooze alarm buzzes .
This can train your mind to better remember your dreams , McPhee says .

I do not know what I may appear to the world ; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore , and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary , whilst the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me .
— Sir Isaac Newton A man with no home and no job , Paul Erdös was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived .
Born in Hungary in 1913 , Erdös wrote and co-authored over 1,500 papers and pioneered several fields in theoretical mathematics .
At the age of 83 he still spent most of his time on the road , going from math meeting to math meeting , continually working on problems .
He died on September 20 , 1996 while attending such a meeting in Warsaw , Poland .
N is a Number : A Portrait of Paul Erdös was filmed between 1988 and 1991 .
The film opens at Cambridge University 's 1991 honorary doctorate ceremony , where Erdös received an award he says he would gladly trade for a " nice new proof . "
For Erdös , the meaning of life is " to prove and conjecture . "
In an age dominated by technical wizardry and high tech communications , Erdös was an unusual human link connecting hundreds of people .
As he traveled from country to country , Erdös carried with him the latest in mathematical thinking , inspiring others to develop new ideas and , sometimes , entire new fields .
In turn , the mathematical community supported this repository of centuries of mathematical knowledge and lore .
Every mathematician in the world has an " Erdös Number " - the number of people he or she is removed from having co-authored a paper with Erdös .
To pursue this life of wandering and pure scholarship , Erdös relied on a network of other renowned mathematicians - all of whom regarded him as an international treasure .
Wherever he touched down , whether in Hungary , Australia or Kalamazoo , Erdös immediately began working on problems with his colleagues .
They , in turn , took care of his everyday needs .
Ronald Graham , director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Center at AT&T Laboratories , keeps an " Erdös Room " at his home in New Jersey .
From here , Graham managed Erdös 's financial affairs and coordinated his travels and lectures , trying to maintain a semblance of order in the life of a man who kept no bank accounts and gave money to anyone he felt needed it .
In Cambridge , England , Béla Bollobás , an ex-Erdös student , provided another oasis .
As the film progresses it becomes clear that mathematicians around the world had more than a professional stake in caring for Erdös .
In different ways , each of the many prominent mathematicians in the film expresses dedication to and love for Erdös .
The structure of N is a Number is based on Erdös 's 50 years of perpetual wandering , " like a bumblebee , " carrying news and mathematical information from university to university .
Erdös established himself as a serious mathematician at the age of 20 when he devised a more elegant proof for Chebyshev 's theorem , i.e. , that there is always a prime number between any number and its double .
He was at the center of an informal clique of gifted young mathematicians in Hungary , known as the Anonymous Group , because they would meet in a Budapest park under the statue of a medieval historian named Anonymous .
A video released by police shows a brutal attack on a gay man in Queens .
Police say Daniel Rodriguez , 21 , and Daniel Aleman , 26 , are seen in surveillance video taken last Thursday pummeling Jack Price , 49 .
Rodriguez was taken into custody at a relative ’s home .
A second man accused of beating an openly gay man into a coma on a street in Queens was arrested in Norfolk , Virginia late Tuesday .
Rodriguez ’s sister tells
Fox 5
News that her brother is not anti-gay .
Charges are pending and NYPD detectives are in the process of returning him to New York .
Earlier Tuesday , Aleman was arraigned on a charge of assault as a hate crimes .
He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
A telephone call to his attorney was not immediately returned .

Keynes , Explained Briefly
If you read the economic textbooks , you ’ll find that the job market is a market like any other .
There ’s supply ( workers ) and demand ( employers ) .
And the incredible power of market competition pushes the price ( wages ) to where those two meet .
Thus massive unemployment is about as likely as huge unsold piles of wheat : if people are n’t buying , it ’s just because you ’re setting the price too high .
And yet , as I write , 17.5 % of the country is unemployed .
Are they all just insisting on being paid too much ?
Economists are forced into the most ridiculous explanations .
Perhaps people just do n’t know where the jobs are , some say .
( Maybe the government should run ads for Craigslist . )
Or maybe it just takes time for all those former house - builders to learn new jobs .
( This despite the fact that unemployment is up in all industries . )
But they ’re typically forced back to the fundamental conclusion of the textbook : that people are just demanding to be paid too much .
It might be for the most innocent of reasons , but facts are facts .
John Maynard Keynes ’ great insight was to see that all of this was nonsense .
The job market is a very special market , because the people who get “ bought ” are also the people doing all the buying .
After all , why is it that people are hired to farm wheat ?
It ’s because , at the end of the day , other people want to buy it .
But if lots of people are out of a job , they ’re doing their best to save money , which means cutting back on purchases .
And if they cut back on purchases , that means there are fewer people for business to sell to , which means businesses cut back on jobs .
Clearly something is badly wrong with the basic economic theory .
So let ’s go through Keynes ’ masterpiece , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , and understand his theory of how the economy works .
When you get your paycheck at the end of the week , you spend it .
But presumably you do n’t spend all of it — you put some money away to save , like you were told as a child .
Saving is seen as a great national virtue — thus all those Public Service Announcements with talking piggy banks .
Everyone knows why : put some money away today and it ’ll be worth more tomorrow .
But there ’s a kind of illusion involved in this .
Money is n’t worth anything on its own , it ’s only useful because it can buy things .
And it buys things because it pays other people to make them for you .
But you ca n’t save people in your bank account — if fifteen million people are out of work , they ca n’t put their time in a piggy bank for when things are looking up .
The work they could have done is lost forever .
So yes , some people can save while others borrow from them — you can let your neighbor buy two iPods in exchange for letting you buy four next year — but the country , as a whole , cannot .
At the end of the day , someone has to buy the things we can make .
But if everyone ’s saving , that means people are n’t buying .
Which means the people making stuff are out of a job .
It ’s a vicious cycle : if people buy less , companies make less , which means people get paid less , which means people buy less .
And so on , until we ’re all out of work .
( Thankfully it does n’t get that bad — but only because some people are refusing to lower their wages .
The thing that mainstream economists said was causing unemployment is actually preventing it ! )
But this cycle can be run in reverse .
Imagine Donald Trump hires unemployed people to build him a new skyscraper .
They ’re suddenly getting paid again , which means they can start spending again .
And each dollar they spend goes to a different business , which can start hiring people itself .
And then those newly - hired people start spending the new money they make , and so on .
This is the multiplier : each dollar that gets spent provides even more than one dollar ’s worth of boost to the economy .
Now let ’s look at things from the employer ’s side — say you run an truck factory .
How do you decide how many trucks to make ?
Obviously , you make as many as you think you can profitably sell .
But there ’s no way to calculate something like that — it ’s a question about what customers will do in the future .
There ’s literally no way to know .
And yet , obviously , trucks get made .
It used to be , Keynes says , that wealthy men just thought investing was the manly thing to do .
They were n’t going to sit around and calculate what kind of bonds yielded the greatest expected return .
Bonds are for wusses .
They were real men .
They were going to take their money and build a railroad .
But they do n’t make rich people like that anymore .
Nowadays , they put their money in the stock market .
Instead of boldly picking one great enterprise to invest in , they shift their money around from week to week ( or hire someone else to do it for them ) .
So these days , it ’s the stock market that stimulates most new investment .
But how does the stock market figure out what profits are supposed to be ?
In truth , it has no more clue than you do .
It ’s really just based around a convention .
We all pretend that whatever the stock price is now is a pretty decent guess and then we only have to worry about the various factors that will cause the stock price to change .
We forget about the most basic fact : that nobody has any clue what the stock price should be to begin with .
So instead of people trying their best to figure out which businesses will make money in the future , and investing in those , we have people who try to figure out which stock prices will change in the future , and trying to get there first .
It ’s like a giant game of musical chairs — everybody ’s rushing not to be the one left standing when the music stops .
Or , you could say , it ’s like those newspaper competitions where you have to pick the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs .
The prize goes to the person who picks the faces that are most picked , so you do n’t pick the faces you find prettiest , but instead the faces you think everyone else will find prettiest .
But it ’s not even that , since everyone else is doing the same thing — you ’re actually picking the faces you think everyone else will think everyone else will find prettiest !
And no doubt there are some people who take this even further .
You might think this means that someone who actually did the work and tried to calculate expected profits would clean up , taking money from all the people playing musical chairs .
But it ’s not so simple .
Calculating expected profits is really quite hard .
To make money , you ’d have to be unusually good at it , and it seems much easier to just guess what everyone else will do .
And even if you were somehow good at guessing long - term profits , where would you get the money to invest ?
It ’s in the fundamental nature of your strategy that your investments seem crazy to everyone else .
If you ’re successful , they ’ll write it off as a lucky fluke .
And when your stocks are n’t doing well ( which is most of the time — they ’re long - term picks , remember ) , people will take this as evidence of your failures and pull their money out .
The scary thing is that the more open our markets get , the faster people can move their money around and the more trading is based on this kind of speculation instead of serious analysis .
And that ’s scary because — recall — the whole point of the stock market is to decide the crucial question of what we , as a society , should build for the future .
As Keynes says , “ When the capital development of a country becomes a by - product of the activities of a casino , the job is likely to be ill - done . ”
The best solution is probably a small tax on each trade .
Not only would this raise a ton of money ( modern estimates suggest even a tiny tax could raise $ 100 billion a year ) , it would help redirect all the brains on Wall Street from these wasteful games of musical chairs to something actually useful .
But even if we solve the problem of the stock market , there ’s still some irreducible uncertainty .
Because whether new investment makes sense always depends on whether the economy will be doing well in the future .
And whether the economy is doing well depends on whether there ’s new investment .
So , at the end of the day , investment does n’t depend simply on a careful calculation of future expected yield , but on our “ animal spirits , ” our optimism about the future .
It ’s this factor that exaggerates booms and deepens slumps and makes it hard to get out of a bad situation .
Even more perversely , it means economic performance depends in no small part on keeping businessmen happy .
If electing Obama gets businessmen depressed , they might pull back their investments and send the economy into a slump .
It does n’t even have to be intentional — they may very well believe that a President Obama is bad for the economy .
But when you have a system that only works when businesspeople feel good , their fears become a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The result , Keynes suggests , is that the government will have to step in to prevent the economy from crashing every time rich people get a bit of indigestion .
So that ’s how we calculate the income side of things , now what about costs ?
Most costs are pretty clear — you need to buy equipment and hire people .
But since you need to make stuff now that you can only sell in the future , one of your big costs is going to be money to use in the meantime .
And the cost of money is just the interest rate .
( If you get a loan for a million dollars at 5 % interest , you ’re essentially paying $ 50,000 for the right to use the money now . )
Thus lowering interest rates increases investment — it reduces the cost of getting money , which reduces the cost of making stuff , which means more things can make a profit .
And if more things can make a profit , more things get made , which means more people get hired .
So what determines the interest rate ?
Well , if the interest rate is the cost of money , the obvious answer is the amount of money in circulation .
If there ’s a lot of money lying around , you can get some pretty cheap .
Which means that , fundamentally , unemployment is caused by a lack of money : more money ( assuming people do n’t hoard it all ) means lower interest rates , lower interest rates ( assuming expected profits do n’t crash ) means higher investment , higher investment ( assuming people do n’t stop buying ) means more employment , and more employment means higher prices , which means we ’re going to need more money .
Money is created by the central bank ( the Federal Reserve in the US ) , which decides what they want the interest rate to be and then prints new money ( which they use to buy up government debt ) until the interest rate is where they want .
To get the economy back on track , all they have to do is keep lowering interest rates until investment picks up again and everyone has a job .
But there ’s one catch : the interest rate ca n’t go below zero .
( Keynes did n’t think this problem was very likely , but in the US we ’re facing it right now . )
What do you do if the interest rate is zero and people are still out of work ?
Well , you can pray that billionaires will start hiring us all to build them giant mansions , but that ’s no way to run a country .
The government has to step in .
Instead of waiting for billionaires to build pleasure - domes , the government can hire people to build things we all need — roads , schools , houses , high - speed Internet connections .
Although , honesty , it does n’t have to be things we all need .
They could hire people to do anything .
This is why inspecting the stimulus money for waste is so ridiculous — waste is perfectly fine , the important thing is to get the money into circulation so that the economy can get back on track .
Another good solution is redistributing income .
Poor people are a lot more likely to spend money than billionaires .
If we take some money from the billionaires and give it to the poor , the poor will use it to buy things they need and people will get jobs making those things .
Remember that money is just a kind of illusion .
In reality , there are just people who want things and people who make things .
But we ’re stuck in a completely ridiculous situation : there are lots of people who desperately want jobs making things — they ’re literally not doing anything else — while at the same time there are lots of people who desperately want things made .
It seems ridiculous not to do something about this just because some people have all the little green sheets of paper !
Capitalism seems to go through frustrating cycles of booms and busts .
Some people say the solution is just to prevent the booms — raise interest rates so the party does n’t get out of hand and we wo n’t all be sorry the next morning .
Keynes disagrees : the remedy “ is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi- boom . ”
Think back to the dot - com era , when venture capitalists were spending all their money laying fiber - optic cable under the street .
The right solution was n’t for the Fed to raise interest rates until even punch - drunk venture capitalists could realize all this investment in fiber would n’t be profitable .
The right solution was to take their money away .
Give it to the poor , who will spend it on something useful , like food and clothing .
So those are Keynes ’ prescriptions for a successful economy : low interest rates , government investment , and redistribution to the poor .
And , for a time — from around the 1940s to the 1970s — that ’s kind of what we did .
The results were magical : the economy grew strongly , inequality fell away , everyone had jobs .
But , starting in the 1970s , the rich staged a counterattack .
They did n’t like watching inequality — and their wealth — melt away .
There was a resurgence in classical economics , Keynes was declared to have been debunked , and interest rates were raised drastically , throwing millions out of work .
The economy tanked , inequality soared , and things have never been the same since .
For a while people talked about levels of inequality that had n’t been seen since the 1920s .
Then they talked about a recession the size of which had n’t been seen since the 1930s .
Once again , Keynes provides us with the instructions on how to get out of this mess .
The question is whether we ’ll follow them .
You should follow me on twitter here .
September 24 , 2009
Sometime last week Apache on one of the
servers that manages some websites I host stop responding to
requests , resulting in said websites being unavailable for a day and
half ( or so ) .
Unfortunately I did n’t know about the problem until
someone else notified me of the issue .
Opps .
Not good system
administration that .
There are plenty of solutions for
monitoring network services , but given that I ’m just running Apache
for a half dozen non-critical websites on the side , there ’s no reason
to go overboard .
Any sysadmin worth their weight in salt should be able
to whip something up with Perl in no time .
So , what ’s needed ?
Well , something that will remotely monitor the
pool of websites and notify me if something is amiss :
First up , making a simple HTTP GET request :
my $url = " http://$host " ; my $ ua = LWP :: UserAgent -> new ; my $ response = $ ua -> get ( $url ) ;
Now we test the response , was it successful ?
If so , Apache returns an appropriate status code and the requested resource .
If Apache is available , but unable to properly process the request it will responded with some relevant status code , which we wish to pass on for further troubleshooting :
if ( !$response->is_success ) { #
Do we have an error code ? if ( $ response -> code ) { reportError ( " $ host reports $ response -> message
" ) ; } else {
However a failed GET request will result in no status code since Apache probably failed to respond at all .
In this case it would be helpful to determine if the issue is with Apache or something else .
For that test a network ping is issued :
# HTTP is down , is the network connection down too ?
my $ p = Net : : Ping -> new ( " icmp " ) ; if ( $ p - > ping ( $ host , 2 ) ) { reportError ( " $ host is responding , but Apache is not .
" ) ; } else { reportError ( " $ host is unreachable .
" ) ; } }
Not too difficult that .
Now , how do we go about communicating the issue at hand ?
SMS has always been my preferred method since my phone is usually close at hand and , iPhone or not , SMS is widely implemented and easy to use .
# Send SMS via cellular Email to SMS gateway my ( $ msg ) = @_ ; my $ to = " 7735551234\@txt.att.net " ; my $ from = " pdw\@weinstein.org " ; my $ subject = " Service Notification " ; my $ sendmail = ' /usr/lib/sendmail ' ; open ( MAIL , " |$ sendmail - oi - t " ) ; print MAIL " From : $ from
" ; print MAIL " To : $ to
" ; print MAIL " Subject : $ subject
" ; print MAIL $ msg ; close ( MAIL ) ;
All ’s done ?
Not quite .
For the fun of it , I figured broadcasting a message that the server was unavailable might be of use to regular visitors .
What better way to broadcast a short message than via Twitter ?
my ( $ msg ) = @_ ; my $ nt = Net : : Twitter : : Lite -> new ( username => $ username , password => $ password ) ; my $ result = eval { $ nt -> update ( $ msg ) } ;
Bring this all together , with cron gives us :
# monitor remote httpd servers every 30 minutes */30 * * * * pdw /home/pdw/bin/monitor.pl >/dev/null 2>&1
Disturbing 911 Call Reveals Burned Boy's Agony " Help me !
Please !
Please ! " boy pleaded through his strangled cries of pain .
Oct. 16 , 2009  --
A boy allegedly set on fire by four teenagers in a dispute over a $ 40 video game can be heard screaming in pain as a woman calls 911 for emergency help .
" Help me ! " and " Please !
Please ! " are some of the few words that are understandable through Michael Brewer 's agonized pleas for relief moments after he was splashed with rubbing alcohol and set ablaze on Monday .
At times the obviously upset woman who is calling the Deerfield Beach , Fla. , 911 dispatcher can barely be heard over Brewer 's heartbreaking screams .
Nevertheless , the dispatcher asks how it happened , and the boy tells the woman , his voice frantic with pain , " Someone threw stuff on me . "
When asked who , Brewer wails , " I do n't know . "
Click here to listen to the 911 call
Five teens , including one who is 13 , have been arrested and charged with the assault on Brewer , who is 15 .
Police said the four older teens could be charged as adults because of the " degree of cruelty " involved in the attack .
A spokesman for the Broward County State Attorney 's office said today a decision has not yet been made on whether to prosecute the boys as adults .
Brewer , remains on a ventilator in Jackson Memorial Ryder Hospital 's burn unit .
Dr. Nicholas Namias said Brewer is critically ill with burns over 65 percent of his body .
" Every part of his body is affected …his torso , legs , arms and head .
It does look like the burns to his face and hands are not as bad as they could be , " said Namias .
The use of an accelerant means the burn injuries will likely get worse in the coming weeks .
" We consider flame burns to be worse that most other types of burns , " the doctor said .
Brewer is heavily sedated and his body is extremely swollen , doctors said .
Even if Brewer makes it through the next few weeks , there is still the likelihood of organ failures and the painful prospect of multiple operations to replace the burned skin , his doctors said .
Teens Who Burned Boy Were Laughing
The vicious assault has shocked the Deerfield Beach community nestled on the Florida coast just north of Fort Lauderdale , not only for the act of setting Brewer afire but for the teens ' chilling reaction .
" I 'll be honest with you , a couple of them were laughing about it last night .
[ Only ] one of them seemed genuinely sorry for what he did , " said Sgt. Steve Feeley , according to ABC News affiliate WPBF .
Charged in the attack are Steve Shelton , 15 , of Deerfield Beach , Jeremy Jarvis , 13 , Denver Jarvis , 15 , Matthew Bent , 15 , and Jesus Mendez , 15 , all of Pompano Beach .
The boys are all charged with aggravated battery , according to the sheriff 's office .
In addition , Mendez , who police allege actually flicked the lighter that caused the fire , is charged with attempted second degree murder .
Authorities are calling the crime a " torturous attack " and say it all may have started over a video game .
Authorities said Brewer owed Bent $ 40 for a video game .
When Brewer did n't pay up , Bent tried to steal a bicycle belonging to the Brewer family .
The attempted theft was reported to the police .
The next day Brewer went to an apartment complex where the five suspects cornered him near a swimming pool , according to authorities .
At that point , the sheriff 's office alleges , Denver Jarvis splashed Brewer with rubbing alcohol and Jesus Mendez used a lighter to set him on fire .
Brewer ran into the pool to try to douse the flames .
This is n't the first time we 've heard of an institutional virus outbreak -- even the crew of the International Space Station had a neat little scare not too long ago -- and now various outlets in Australia are reporting that Integral Energy , which supplies energy to homes and businesses in New South Wales and Queensland , has suffered a particularly nasty visit by the W32 .
Virut .
CF virus .
When all was said and done , the company had to repair all 1000 of the facility 's desktops .
Furthermore , the Sydney Morning Herald reports that the company 's anti-virus software had n't been updated since at least February .
Between the lack of anti-virus updates and the fact that segregation between the company 's main network and the grid was " typically none at all " this story has all the makings of a disaster .
Luckily , the grid itself runs on Sun Solaris -- and when control systems became infected , how did they fix the mess ?
That 's right : by replacing them with Linux machines .
A word to the wise : they do make anti-virus auto - updates for a reason .

Regular readers know that Dr. Joe Albietz sits in very rare company -- among people I call heroes .
He is smart , wise , funny , a great doctor , and he cares passionately about not just saving lives , but saving those of little kids : he 's a pediatrician who works at a pediatric intensive care unit in Denver .
I do n't use arguments from authority , but Joe walks the walk .
He has a tremendous amount of experience dealing with children and their illnesses .
And that 's why when he talks about why vaccines are so important , everyone should listen .
If you think vaccines are an evil conspiracy , are designed to make us sick , are filled with toxins , are a bad thing , then spend 6 minutes and 53 seconds educating yourself .
Because you 're wrong .
Tim was great as he helped me sell my condo through a short sale .
I had two mortgages with two different companies and he helped to coordinate everything and ensure that it went smoothly .
I questioned everything and needed to know what was happening at all times and Tim , thankfully talked me through the whole process .
He even made the time to get me in on the same day when I made my husband call him because I was beyond overwhelmed with my situation .
Thankful to have had his help !

La Secretar�a de Hacienda y Cr�dito P�blico ( SHCP ) culp� a los estados de la mala situaci�n financiera que enfrentan , ya que en 2008 recibieron ingresos extraordinarios que no utilizaron correctamente .
En entrevista , el titular de la Unidad de Coordinaci�n con Entidades Federativas de la Secretar�a de Hacienda , Jos� Antonio Gonz�lez Anaya , dijo que las participaciones federales de este a�o ser�n casi 40 mil millones de pesos superiores a las de 2007 , por lo que “ habr� que preguntarles por qu� tenemos tanto problema ” .
En 2008 , record� , los gobiernos locales tuvieron 90 mil millones de pesos adicionales en participaciones , respecto de 2007 , una cifra “ extraordinaria , con precios del petr�leo por arriba de 100 d�lares ” , expuso .
El funcionario destac� que los ingresos temporales no deben convertirse en gasto permanente , “ si se utilizaron para gasto permanente , pudo haber un problema ” , expres� .
Sin embargo , para 2010 la situaci�n ser� distinta .
De acuerdo con el reporte que Hacienda envi� al Congreso el viernes , el pa�s iniciar� 2010 con escasos recursos en el Fondo de Estabilizaci�n de Ingresos Petroleros .
Del saldo de 89 mil 311 millones de pesos reportado al final del primer semestre , dicho fondo iniciar� el a�o pr�ximo con apenas 12 mil millones , luego de que el gobierno federal disponga de la mayor �a de los recursos para aliviar la ca�da de ingresos que enfrenta el pa�s en este a�o .
Como consecuencia , una situaci�n similar enfrentar� el Fondo de Estabilizaci�n de Ingresos de las Entidades Federativas que se destina para apoyar a los gobiernos locales .
EL UNIVERSAL public� el lunes pasado que 95 % de los municipios est�n en quiebra , sin recursos para pagar n�mina , combustible o para servicios p�blicos ; adem�s de que han tenido que cerrar temporalmente oficinas , seg�n la Conferencia Nacional de Municipios de M�xico ( Conamm ) .

Remember back when you were a diapered enthusiast - to - be and you were n't allowed to venture beyond the end of your family 's tree lawn ?
The sum total of your ' driving ' experience was probably a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe .
If you were like us , your toddler self was all big dreams , bustling feet and arms akimbo , twirling around those front caster wheels , savoring your first taste of automotive freedom .
Small wonder , then , that Little Tikes ' now 30 - year - old bauble of rotation - molded plastic was last year 's best - selling car – it 's timeless .
Combine classic styling , unburstable robustness , an inexpensive sticker price and the fact that it remains just quick enough for its target audience , and you 've got a recipe for lasting success .
The CC's whimsical , animated face ; rounded , friendly styling ; unfussed interior ; nimble handling and general affordability has meant that despite a decidedly casual model update schedule , the folks at Little Tikes still have the whole fun - to - drive thing knocked .
Sound like anyone else we know ?
Oh , it may have taken them a decade longer to cotton on to the idea , but Mazda 's designers eventually stumbled upon the same secret sauce as those wondrous toymakers from Hudson , Ohio .
Perhaps inadvertently , they , too , created a timeless masterwork upon minting the very first MX - 5 Miata back in 1989 .
All these years later , just like the Cozy Coupe , you can't help but smile a little when you see one .
Just like the Cozy Coupe , you have to adopt the same mildly vulnerable , elbows - out - the - window driving position because of the cabin 's pronounced narrowness .
Just like the Cozy Coupe , both cars have more than their fair share of plastic in their interior .
Just like the Cozy Coupe , road imperfections are transmitted directly through the modestly sized wheels into the driver 's hands and back pocket – and in both cases , it 's part of the fun .
Most importantly , just like that Cozy Coupe of your youth , Mazda 's minimalist masterwork will help you rediscover your inner enthusiast 's childlike heart .

The Miata reminds us of the power and joy in momentum conservation .
The new Competition Yellow suits the Miata 's sunny disposition .
It all starts with the dimensions .
The Miata may have grown a bit over its twenty years , but unlike the rich kid down the street with his powerful , complex and expensive Power Wheels , it has n't sold out to whatever trendy of - the - moment fashion is popular , and it is n't larded down with gee - whiz technology .
It is still stubby at only 157.3 inches long and a titchy 67.7 inches wide .
Despite the fact that it has gained a bit of size over its original incarnation , the MX - 5 remains lightweight ( well under 2,500 pounds ) and significantly smaller than anything on the road this side of a Smart ForTwo Styling - wise , Mazda characterizes the 2009 Miata 's newly retouched nose as " more aggressive , " but the effect is very much like CARS ' Lightning McQueen trying to puff up when Sally nuzzles up to his bumper in Radiator Springs .
Even with its slightly larger five - pointed grille and marginally more intimidating headlamps , our Competition Yellow Miata still maintains a friendly googly - eyed countenance , only now its brows are wryly furrowed a bit .
As a side bonus , the touched - up front graphic is easier for the wind to look at , too .
Critically , even in the $ 29,170 full - house spec of our Grand Touring premium package tester ( complete with the bargain $ 500 suspension package that includes a more tightly drawn springs , Bilstein shocks and a limited - slip differential ) , you never feel overwhelmed by this Miata 's kit , crushed by its creature comforts or unnecessarily addled by additional features .
That 's just not its way .
Despite our tester being outfitted with everything from a keyless entry / start system to Bluetooth hands - free telephony , a six - disc CD stereo with MP3 input , heated leather seats and Xenon headlamps , the gauges remain simple , the controls uncluttered , and the general aesthetic of the interior is one of Zen - like minimalism .
That 's important , because a Miata remains as readily defined by what it is as by what it is n't .
It is n't a muscle car , it is n't a luxurious wafter – it is n't even particularly sophisticated – there are no sport modes , no active steering gewgaws , no THX - Certified surround sound systems , no pyrotechnic roll hoops , no baseball - stitched leather seats .
Want a nav system ?
You 'll have to revisit your old friends Messieurs Rand and McNally ( remember them ? ) or suction one of those TomTom boxes to the glass .
It 's all gleefully elemental , this Mazda .
Some cars take eons to figure out – you can put thousands of miles on the latest Shazam Gadzooks 5000 , only to reach the end of a cross-country odyssey and not know what to make of it .
The MX - 5's simplicity means the familiarization process is rather brief .
As in immediate .
Release the single latch on the windshield header , throw the top back and let it accordion over your shoulder , and just a few miles down the road , you know exactly what this car is , what it is capable of , and what your role is in the whole thing .
Part of this is due to the fact that the Miata 's limits are rather modest to begin with – a much greater percentage of its total performance envelope can be safely explored under normal motoring conditions than other performance cars .
With a powerful vehicle that has bigger dimensions and loftier limits , it often takes huge stretches of open road and confetti'd license velocities in order to even begin to feel entertained .
Not so with the Miata – an unscheduled squirt to the corner grocery can provoke more grins in a few minutes than roadsters with thrice its power might hope to exact in a week 's worth of driving .
If nothing else , a week 's refresher in our roadster proved that Miata drivers still wave at each other – when was the last time a fellow motorist made you smile ?
All of this talk of humble performance is not to say that the Miata is slow – it 's plenty potent for both canyon carving and the interstate drone , it 's just that it reminds one of the power and joy in momentum conservation and being economical with one 's movements .
Ultimately , the Littlest Mazda is still only capable of a modest turn of speed from to its sixteen - valve 2.0 - liter MZR four - cylinder – even when outfitted with an extra cog in its manual gearbox like our six - speed Grand Touring model .
If you 're a numbers type , the engine 's 167 horsepower and 140 pound - feet of torque yields 60 mph in 6.9 seconds , but thanks to the car 's small frame , tarmac - hugging stance and raucous engine note , it all feels infinitely quicker and more entertaining – in much the same way that a full - grown adult can still have a blast with a concessions kart at the local amusement park .
Unlike Little Tikes , however , Mazda has faithfully updated its cozy coupe at regular intervals .
Once again , evolution – not revolution – is at the heart of the Miata 's improved - for - 2009 driving experience , and that includes a revised gearbox that 's even more snickety - snick than before .
Credit goes to a new carbon treatment on the first - gear through fourth - gear synchros ( the synchros themselves are larger for cogs 3 and 4 , too ) , and six - speed manual cogswappers also benefit from a taller sixth gear ( 0.787 : 1 vs. 0.832:1 ) in order to provide more relaxed cruising and improved fuel economy EPA figures are 22 mpg city and 28 highway , the latter figure being one mpg greater than 2008 .
Did we mention that the MZR is even revvier than last year ?
Mazda has let out the redline on six - speed manual models to 7,200 rpm ( up 500 revs ) on account of a new crankshaft , con-rods , pistons , valve springs , and the inclusion of an engine oil cooler .
Better still , six - speed manual models also get something Mazda officials call an Induction Sound Enhancer .
Basically , it 's a network of tubes designed to deliver more of the engine 's noises to the cowl at the base of the windshield .
In most NVH update programs , engineers attempt to cover and smother engine sounds like an order of Waffle House hash browns .
In the MX - 5's case , Mazda 's boffins have dialed in additional sonics for the drivers that will appreciate them most .
God bless 'em .
The MX - 5's suspension has also received a once - over , including repositioned outer ball joints that lower the car 's front roll center by an inch and revisited dampers regardless of whether your car is fitted with the optional Bilstein package like our test car or the standard setup .
Other handling changes include revamped traction and stability control systems with less aggressive intervention logic .
Not keen on the added electronics to begin with ?
No problem – you do n't have to order them .
Either way , we found flatteringly progressive breakaway habits from the 17 - inch Bridgestone Potenza RE050A 's and a bit more lift - off throttle oversteer than before , and the four - wheel disc brakes deliver excellent feel and solid stopping power .
Interior updates are minor yet noteworthy , with a revised center console and armrest ( the old one was hard and could irritate on longer journeys – this new one could still use a bit more padding ) , as well as slightly recontoured seats and better bottle holders in the doors – useful , as the ones in the center console are n't terribly accommodating or well - placed .
These are incremental improvements to be sure , but ones that a 2008 Miata driver will come to covet .
So ... what else would we change ?
Well , aside from ditching the cheap plastic sunblockers that incorporate a strange bend ( precluding clipping things like garage door openers to them ) , not much .
At an as - tested price of $ 29,250 ( including $ 500 for the suspension upgrade , $ 1650 for the premium package and $ 750 in destination charges ) , our Grand Touring model was perhaps priced uncomfortably close to much more powerful fixed - head sports cars , but we enjoyed our week with the Miata more than we have with roadsters costing five times as much .
Besides , we could – and would – happily motor along in a more modestly spec'd example for years .
Pricing starts at $ 22,500 for the Miata 's honest balance of accessible performance , newborn kitty frolic and uncomplicated operation , and that still strikes us as great value .
Heck , we 'd even get ours in Competition Yellow , which suits the Miata 's sunny disposition while reminding us closet nostalgics of the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe .

June 1941 .
German tanks before the attack into Russia .
In the summer of 1941 , the Third Reich was at the apex of its power .
After the defeat of Poland in September 1939 , German troops had engaged in a series of spectacular blitzkrieg offensives against Denmark , Norway , the Benelux countries , and France , occupying almost the whole of Western Europe .
In Eastern Europe , the Nazi regime was allied with Romania , Hungary , and Bulgaria , and in the spring of 1941 it conquered Yugoslavia and Greece .
Hitler thought the time for " Europe 's crusade against Bolshevism " had come .
For the June 22 , 1941 , attack on the Soviet Union , Hitler assembled an invading force of unprecedented size .
In addition to 3.6 million German and allied soldiers , about 600,000 motor vehicles , 3,600 tanks , 7,200 artillery pieces , and 2,700 warplanes were deployment in the invasion .

WHY DID HITLER ATTACK RUSSIA AND SPARE BRITAIN ?
( From the BBC )
In the summer of 1940 Adolf Hitler , despite his swift and dramatic victory over France , faced a major military and political problem .
The British would not do what seemed logical and what the Führer expected - they would not make peace .
Yet Hitler was frustrated by geography - in the shape of the English Channel - from following his immediate instincts and swiftly crushing the British just as he had the French .
Hitler did in fact order preparations to be made for an invasion of England , but he was always half - hearted in his desire to mount a large seaborne landing .
Germany , unlike Britain , was not a sea power and the Channel was a formidable obstacle .
Even if air superiority could be gained , there remained the powerful British Navy .
And there was another , ideological , reason why Hitler was not fully committed to invading Britain .
For him , it would have been a distraction .
Britain contained neither the space , nor the raw materials , that he believed the new German Empire needed .
And he admired the British - Hitler often remarked how much he envied their achievement in subjugating India .
Worse , if the Germans let themselves be drawn into a risky amphibious operation against a country Hitler had never wanted as an enemy , every day the potential threat from his greatest ideological opponent would be growing stronger .
( It was just ironic that he was not yet at war with this perceived enemy , since in August 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union had signed a Non-Aggression Pact . )
All this meant that , from Hitler 's point of view , there was an alternative to invading Britain : he could invade the Soviet Union .
Both Hitler and his military planners knew that Germany 's best chance of victory was for the war in Europe to be finished swiftly .
Hubert Menzel was a major in the General Operations Department of the OKH ( the Oberkommando des Heers , the German Army headquarters ) , and for him the idea of invading the Soviet Union in 1941 had the smack of cold , clear logic to it : ' We knew that in two years ' time , that is by the end of 1942 , beginning of 1943 , the English would be ready , the Americans would be ready , the Russians would be ready too , and then we would have to deal with all three of them at the same time ....
We had to try to remove the greatest threat from the East ....
At the time it seemed possible . '

December 1941 .
A German tank stuck in the Russian snow .
Prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union , Hitler ’s army had won a number of quick military victories .
The campaign in the East , however , was a disaster for the Wehrmacht and proved to be a turning point in the war .
Strategic mistakes , inadequate supplies for troops , and insufficient equipment all contributed to the German defeat on the Eastern Front .
In many areas , German military equipment was not suited to the Soviet Union ’s climate and ground conditions , especially in the winter months .
This image shows a German type IV tank ( in snow camouflage ) stuck in the snow .
While soldiers attempt to free the tank with shovels and pickaxes , a war correspondent ( far right ) captures photographs the scene .
Germans invaded the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 , and looked poised to take Moscow by October that year .
With the benefit of hindsight , popular opinion has labelled Hitler as virtually insane for invading the Soviet Union , but at the time many people - including those influential in both Britain and America - thought his decision was a sound one .
Indeed ,
Hitler came much closer to pulling off his grand plan than the Soviet Union was ever prepared to admit .
The German Blitzkrieg technique was as devastating in Russia as it had been in the rest of Europe .
The scene was set for a war of annihilation waged by the Nazis against the Soviets with no mercy shown by either side .
One week into the German invasion , 150,000 Soviet soldiers were either dead or wounded - more than during the five months of the Battle of the Somme .
As the German armies swept further into the Russian heartland , one million Soviet troops were drafted to protect Kiev .
But despite Stalin 's ruthless order forbidding any city to surrender , Kiev fell and 600,000 Soviet soldiers were captured .
By October 1941 , three million Soviet soldiers were prisoners of war .
New testimony and documentary evidence can now reveal that Stalin was seriously considering suing for peace and had even organised a ' getaway ' train to take him to safety as German guns started pounding Moscow .
His decision to stay and fight was a crucial turning point in the war .
October , 1942 .
A German anti-tank unit on a Stalingrad street .
Hitler ’s Directive No. 45 of July 23 , 1942 , revised the original plan of the German summer offensive in southern Russia .
According to the directive , the offensives in Stalingrad and the Caucasus were equally important and would be pursued simultaneously .
Army Group A [ Heeresgruppe A ] was to occupy the oil fields of the Caucasus , while Army Group B [ Heeresgruppe B ] was to conquer Stalingrad , an important industrial city and rail hub on the Volga River .
In 1940 , Stalingrad ( named Zarizyn until 1925 , and Volgograd since 1961 ) had a population of 450,000 .
The battle for Stalingrad began on August 19 , 1942 ; on August 23 , the 6th Army , under the leadership of General Friedrich Paulus , was ordered to take the city .
Bitter fighting ensued and losses were extraordinarily high .
The battle for Stalingrad lasted until February 2 , 1943 , ending in a crushing German defeat .
Soviet POWs .
1942 .
German treatment of POWs varied greatly and was largely determined by the nationality of their captives .
Soviet POWs suffered the worst fate , since National Socialist racial policy held that the “ Eastern races ” were inferior , and since fighting Bolshevism was among the goals of Nazi political ideology .
Soviet POWs were kept in makeshift camps without sufficient food , medical care , or protection from harsh weather conditions .
Thousands of prisoners were used as forced laborers in the armaments industry and at mining sites .
More than 3 million Soviet POWs died in German prison camps .
This photograph was taken at a POW camp in Charkov ( Ukraine ) .
1943 .
Soviet partisans hanged to deter others by the Germans .
With the attack on the Soviet Union , the Nazi campaign assumed its full scope as a racial - ideological war of annihilation of unprecedented brutality and barbarity .
The Wehrmacht and the SS cooperated in the conquest of Eastern European “ living space ” [ Lebensraum ] and raw materials , in the systematic eradication of racial and political enemies , and in the decimation and enslavement of the Slavic peoples .
By the end of the war , an estimated 25 - 27 million Soviet citizens had died , including many civilians .
This photograph shows Soviet partisans who had been hanged to deter others from following a similar path .

WAR IN RUSSIA : HELL FOR THE PEOPLE ( Source : BBC )
Stalin and Hitler were together responsible for the leitmotiv of ruthless brutality that prevailed throughout the hostilities between Russia and Germany .
During the Battle of Moscow , in which 8,000 Soviet citizens were executed for perceived cowardice , the Russian armies were forced to stand their ground , despite perishingly cold conditions of 43 degrees below freezing .
To prevent his soldiers deserting the front line around the capital , Stalin ordered special ' blocking detachments ' to shoot all deserters .
The Soviet leadership also instructed Soviet partisans operating in the countryside to kill anyone whom they believed was disloyal .
This resulted in an effective carte blanche for partisans to abuse their power and extract whatever they wanted from helpless villagers .
A report from one partisan division shows that rape , killings and beatings were commonplace .
To make villagers ' lives still more hellish , in some areas , particularly the occupied Ukraine , nationalist partisans ( as opposed to Soviet partisans ) , who were bent on freedom from the Soviet regime , also started up their own brutal operations in the countryside .
Villagers were now faced with violence from three different fighting forces .
Russians did not suffer only from their own side .
Nazi rule over the territories they captured from Russia was draconian .
Erich Koch , Reich Commissar of occupied Ukraine stated that the ' lowliest German worker is a thousand times more valuable ' than the entire population of the Ukraine .
Starvation was widespread , with Soviet civilians forced to eat dogs - until the dog supply ran out and people were forced to turn to rats , crows and birch bark .
In the Ukrainian town of Kharkov , which was administered by the German army , 100,000 people died of starvation and disease .
The German army , faced with an ever growing partisan threat , became increasingly comprehensive in their view about what constituted a partisan .
One army document lists 1,900 partisans and their ' helpers ' , killed by the Germans in one action .
But only 30 rifles and a handful of other weapons were found with them - more than 90 % of those killed by the Germans had no guns .
And yet people still managed to survive .
Inna Gavrilchenko tells how lucky she was to get a job in a slaughter house during the occupation of Kharkov .
It gave her access to blood , which she smuggled out and cooked into a ' blood omelette ' .

January 1943 .
After the 6th Army surrendered at Stalingrad on January 31 and February 2 , 1943 , its surviving members were taken into captivity .
The battle for Stalingrad had lasted from August 1942 until February 2 , 1943 .
After months of heavy fighting with neither sufficient supplies nor suitable equipment , and under extremely harsh climate conditions , most surviving soldiers more or less looked like the soldier here : ravaged by injury , hunger , and cold .

According to the most recent research , however , it can be assumed that about 100,000 German soldiers were captured at Stalingrad ; only about 6,000 of them returned home after the war .
The Atlantic Wall .
To prevent an Allied invasion of what Hitler called “ fortress Europe , ” the Organization Todt ( OT ) began construction in the summer of 1942 on a 1,600 mile - long defensive fortification along the Atlantic coast .
Upon completion , this fortification ( which was referred to as the “ Atlantic Wall ” [ Atlantikwall ] in Nazi propaganda ) was to stretch from the Netherlands to the Spanish border .
Its completion , originally scheduled for May 1943 , was delayed by shortages in building materials .
By the time the Allies invaded Normandy on June 6 , 1944 , only a small section of it had been finished .
A Russian village burns , January 1944 .
“ The Marx­i­an view is that cap­i­tal­is­tic economies are inher­ent­ly unsta­ble and that exces­sive accu­mu­la­tion of cap­i­tal will lead to increas­ing­ly severe eco­nom­ic crises .
Growth the­o­ry , which has proved to be empir­i­cal­ly suc­cess­ful , says this is not true .
The cap­i­tal­is­tic econ­o­my is sta­ble , and absent some change in tech­nol­o­gy or the rules of the eco­nom­ic game , the econ­o­my con­verges to a con­stant growth path with the stan­dard of liv­ing dou­bling every 40 years .
In the 1930s , there was an impor­tant change in the rules of the eco­nom­ic game .
This change low­ered the steady - state mar­ket hours .
The Key­ne­sians had it all wrong .
In the Great Depres­sion , employ­ment was not low because invest­ment was low .
Employ­ment and invest­ment were low because labor mar­ket insti­tu­tions and indus­tri­al poli­cies changed in a way that low­ered nor­mal employ­ment . ”
Obvi­ous­ly , I did not write the above .
The author was instead Edward C. Prescott , who shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Eco­nom­ics for the devel­op­ment of real busi­ness cycle the­o­ry , in his 1999 paper “ Some Obser­va­tions on the Great Depres­sion ” ( Fed­er­al Reserve Bank of Min­neapo­lis Quar­ter­ly Review , Win­ter 1999 , vol. 23 , no. 1 , pp. 25 – 31 ) .
This state­ment is remark­able for a num­ber of rea­sons I ’ll dis­cuss below .
But though it is extreme , it does express a belief that is endem­ic in neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics , that a mar­ket econ­o­my is inher­ent­ly sta­ble and will always return to a sta­ble growth path after a shock .
That com­mon belief lies behind the expec­ta­tions of econ­o­mists that , now that the GFC has played itself out , the econ­o­my will return to trend growth and the emer­gency mea­sures that atten­u­at­ed its impact can be with­drawn .
From this per­spec­tive , the GFC was a “ pot­hole in the road ” caused by the Sub­prime cri­sis , a “ change in the rules of the eco­nom­ic game ” which is now behind us .
With the dam­age caused by the cri­sis large­ly con­tained , nor­mal eco­nom­ic growth can resume .
Over time , the unem­ploy­ment rate will return to pre-cri­sis lev­els as the eco­nom­ic car resumes its steady speed along the high­way of his­to­ry .
The alter­na­tive per­spec­tive is that the GFC was more akin to an abrupt change in the ter­rain .
The “ eco­nom­ic car ” had been coast­ing down­hill with the grav­i­ty of ever - increas­ing pri­vate debt adding to the speed of the car .
With the GFC we reached the bot­tom of the hill , and the car now has to dri­ve uphill as it attempts to main­tain its pre­vi­ous debt - enhanced speed while also reduc­ing debt .
Visu­al­ly at least , the “ change in ter­rain ” anal­o­gy stands up bet­ter than the pot­hole .
I nor­mal­ly show the debt to GDP ratio as a ris­ing func­tion , but the econ­o­my ’s speed gets a boost as the increase in debt makes a pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tion to aggre­gate demand , and is slowed down when delever­ag­ing reduces demand .
So turn­ing the ratio upside down may give a bet­ter idea of the depth of the “ Val­ley of Debt ” into which we have fall­en :
When Aus­tralia began its most recent descent into debt in mid-1964 , the aver­age annu­al increase of 4.2 % in the ratio added only a triv­ial amount to aggre­gate demand — since at the time debt was a mere 25 % of GDP .
But at the end of the debt bub­ble in 2008 , when debt had become 165 % of GDP , that same rate of debt growth added a huge amount to demand — the eco­nom­ic “ car ” gained speed as the slope of the debt moun­tain increased .
We hit the bot­tom of that moun­tain in March 2008 , and now we ’re start­ing to climb out of the valley — though not yet in absolute terms , since thanks to the First Home Ven­dors Boost , mort­gage debt is still grow­ing as busi­ness busi­ly delevers ( see com­ments on the data , below ) .
But once delever­ag­ing takes hold , the accel­er­a­tion caused by rac­ing down Debt Moun­tain will be replaced by an eco­nom­ic car strain­ing up the Mount Debt Reduc­tion .
This change in the ter­rain will con­strain pri­vate eco­nom­ic per­for­mance until debt has fall­en sig­nif­i­cant­ly , as it did after the 1890s and the 1930s .
A sim­i­lar , if more extreme , pic­ture applies in the USA , where pri­vate debt is now 300 % of GDP .
In con­trast to Aus­tralia , the USA ’s debt ratio began to rise as soon as WWII end­ed : on aver­age , US pri­vate debt rose 2.9 % faster than GDP every year until 2008 , tak­ing the debt ratio from 45 % at the end of the War to 300 % now .
Delever­ag­ing from this lev­el of debt must exert a sub­stan­tial break on eco­nom­ic per­for­mance , by divert­ing income from expen­di­ture to debt reduc­tion .
I am there­fore one of a minor­i­ty of eco­nom­ic com­men­ta­tors who regard “ defla­tion and delever­ag­ing ” as the main dan­gers fac­ing the glob­al econ­o­my in the near future ( curi­ous­ly , this minor­i­ty might include Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Kevin Rudd ) .
From my per­spec­tive , the Glob­al Finan­cial Cri­sis marks “ a change in the ter­rain ” : for decades , ris­ing debt has tur­bocharged eco­nom­ic per­for­mance ; now falling debt will be a drag on eco­nom­ic activ­i­ty .
The vast major­i­ty of econ­o­mists who per­ceive the GFC as a pot­hole on the road that is now behind us do not con­sid­er debt and delever­ag­ing in their analy­sis .
Their mod­els have nei­ther cred­it nor mon­ey nor pri­vate debt in them , so from their point of view , there is no ter­rain at all beneath the car — merely a long flat high­way of his­to­ry along which the eco­nom­ic car dri­ves at the speed it is under­ly­ing “ real ” eco­nom­ic per­for­mance .
This fail­ure to even con­sid­er the role of pri­vate cred­it in a cap­i­tal­ist econ­o­my is an endem­ic weak­ness in con­ven­tion­al “ neo­clas­si­cal ” eco­nom­ics , which ignores the dynam­ics of cred­it for a vari­ety of rea­sons that are both ide­o­log­i­cal and illog­i­cal .
The ide­ol­o­gy is appar­ent in Prescot­t ’s com­ments on the Great Depres­sion , quot­ed above .
The lack of log­ic is evi­dent when you com­pare a key state­ment in that paper — that “ Growth the­o­ry , which has proved to be empir­i­cal­ly suc­cess­ful , says this is not true ” — with the results of some very care­ful empir­i­cal research by the very same author just ten years ear­li­er .
There he ( and co-author and Nobel Prize recip­i­ent Finn Kyd­land ) con­clud­ed that the empir­i­cal data con­tra­dict­ed neo­clas­si­cal growth the­o­ry :
“ The pur­pose of this arti­cle is to present the busi­ness cycle facts in light of estab­lished neo­clas­si­cal growth the­o­ry , which we use as the orga­niz­ing frame­work for our pre­sen­ta­tion of busi­ness cycle facts .
We empha­size that the sta­tis­tics report­ed here are not mea­sures of any­thing ; rather , they are sta­tis­tics that dis­play inter­est­ing pat­terns , giv­en the estab­lished neo­clas­si­cal growth the­o­ry .
In dis­cus­sions of busi­ness cycle mod­els , a nat­ur­al ques­tion is , Do the cor­re­spond­ing sta­tis­tics for the mod­el econ­o­my dis­play these pat­terns ?
We find these fea­tures inter­est­ing because the pat­terns they seem to dis­play are incon­sis­tent with the the­o­ry . ”
( Finn E. Kyd­land & Edward C. Prescott , “ Busi­ness Cycles : Real Facts and a Mon­e­tary Myth ” , Fed­er­al Reserve Bank of Min­neapo­lis Quar­ter­ly Review , vol. 14 , no. 2 , pp 3 –18 , p. 4 ) .
One key pat­tern in actu­al eco­nom­ic data that went against the pre­dic­tions of neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ic the­o­ry was the rela­tion­ship between broad mea­sures of the mon­ey sup­ply and gov­ern­ment - cre­at­ed “ Base Mon­ey ” .
The stan­dard “ mon­ey mul­ti­pli­er ” view is that :
The gov­ern­ment cre­ates “ Base Mon­ey ” via deficit spend­ing , and cred­its that mon­ey to pri­vate indi­vid­u­als via social secu­ri­ty , goods pur­chas­es etc. ;
These pri­vate indi­vid­u­als then deposit that mon­ey in bank accounts ;
The banks then retain a pro­por­tion of these deposits and lend out the rest , cre­at­ing cred­it mon­ey ( and debt ) .
If this view were empir­i­cal­ly cor­rect , then an analy­sis of mon­ey over time would show that “ Base Mon­ey ” was cre­at­ed first and “ Cred­it Mon­ey ” was cre­at­ed lat­er , with a time lag .
In fact , what Kyd­land and Prescott found was that the empir­i­cal data was the oppo­site of this : cred­it mon­ey was cre­at­ed first , and Base Mon­ey was cre­at­ed lat­er , with a lag of up to a year :
“ There is no evi­dence that either the mon­e­tary base or M1 leads the cycle , although some econ­o­mists still believe this mon­e­tary myth .
Both the mon­e­tary base and M 1 series are gen­er­al­ly pro­cycli­cal and , if any­thing , the mon­e­tary base lags the cycle slight­ly .
The dif­fer­ence in the behav­ior of M1 and M2 sug­gests that the dif­fer­ence of these aggre­gates ( M2 minus M1 ) should be con­sid­ered . …
The dif­fer­ence of M2 - M1 leads the cycle by even more than M2 , with the lead being about three quar­ters .
The fact that the trans­ac­tion com­po­nent of real cash bal­ances ( M 1 ) moves con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous­ly with the cycle while the much larg­er non­trans­ac­tion com­po­nent ( M2 ) leads the cycle sug­gests that cred­it arrange­ments could play a sig­nif­i­cant role in future busi­ness cycle the­o­ry .
Intro­duc­ing mon­ey and cred­it into growth the­o­ry in a way that accounts for the cycli­cal behav­ior of mon­e­tary as well as real aggre­gates is an impor­tant open prob­lem in eco­nom­ics . ”
I could­ n’t agree more , but this is not what neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists did .
Instead they con­tin­ued to devel­op mod­els in which mon­ey and debt played no role .
Despite his excel­lent empir­i­cal work on mon­e­tary dynam­ics in “ Real Facts and a Mon­e­tary Myth ” , Prescot­t ’s “ Great Depres­sion ” paper made no ref­er­ence to cred­it at all as an explana­to­ry fac­tor in the Great Depres­sion .
Instead — I ’m not joking — he blamed the Depres­sion on a “ change in labor mar­ket insti­tu­tions and indus­tri­al poli­cies that low­ered steady - state , or nor­mal , mar­ket hours ” .
Except for this bizarre argu­ment that the Great Depres­sion was the result of the vol­un­tary response of work­ers to unspec­i­fied changes in labour mar­ket con­di­tions that made labour less desir­able , this lengthy quote from Prescott is rep­re­sen­ta­tive of stan­dard neo­clas­si­cal think­ing about crises like the GFC :
“ Essen­tial­ly , busi­ness cycles are respons­es to per­sis­tent changes , or shocks , that shift the con­stant growth path of the econ­o­my up or down .
This con­stant growth path is the path to which the econ­o­my would con­verge if there were no sub­se­quent shocks .
If a shock shifts the con­stant growth path down , the econ­o­my responds as fol­lows .
Mar­ket hours fall , reduc­ing out­put ; a big­ger share of out­put is allo­cat­ed to con­sump­tion and a small­er share to invest­ment ; and more time is allo­cat­ed to leisure .
Over time , mar­ket hours return to nor­mal , as do invest­ment and con­sump­tion shares of out­put , as the econ­o­my con­verges to its new low­er con­stant growth path .
The lev­el of the new path is low­er , not the growth rate along the path .
I ’ve just described the response of the econ­o­my to a sin­gle shock .
In fact , the econ­o­my is con­tin­u­al­ly hit by shocks , and what econ­o­mists observe in busi­ness cycles is the effects of past and cur­rent shocks .
A bust occurs if a num­ber of neg­a­tive shocks are bunched in time .
A boom occurs if a num­ber of pos­i­tive shocks are bunched in time .
Busi­ness cycles are , in the lan­guage of Slutzky ( 1937 ) , the “ sum of ran­dom caus­es . ”
The fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ence between the Great Depres­sion and busi­ness cycles is that mar­ket hours did not return to nor­mal dur­ing the Great Depres­sion .
Rather , mar­ket hours fell and stayed low .
In the 1930s , labor mar­ket insti­tu­tions and indus­tri­al pol­i­cy actions changed nor­mal mar­ket hours .
I think these insti­tu­tions and actions are what caused the Great Depres­sion . ”
So the Great Depres­sion was a con­scious choice by Amer­i­can work­ers to enjoy more leisure , in response to unspec­i­fied changes in the labour mar­ket ( [ Lat­er in the same essay , he states : “ Exact­ly what changes in mar­ket insti­tu­tions and indus­tri­al poli­cies gave rise to the large decline in nor­mal mar­ket hours is not clear . … ” ) .
It would be bad enough if Prescott were mere­ly an obscure aca­d­e­m­ic econ­o­mist , but he is far from obscure : he and Kyd­land shared the Nobel Prize in Eco­nom­ics for the devel­op­ment of neo­clas­si­cal growth the­o­ry .
As ridicu­lous as his argu­ment is , it does accu­rate­ly state the con­clu­sions of the neo­clas­si­cal “ real busi­ness cycle ” mod­el .
As is often the case , you find a much clearer — and there­fore far more obvi­ous­ly absurd — statement of neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ic the­o­ry when you go to the source , rather than rely­ing on a sec­ond - hand account from a text­book or run -of - the - mill prac­ti­tion­er .
So the con­fi­dence that the vast major­i­ty of econ­o­mists have that the GFC is now behind us , and the “ nor­mal ” trend rate of growth will resume , is fun­da­men­tal­ly based on the belief that cred­it and debt dynam­ics do not mat­ter .
I beg to dif­fer .
Though the enor­mous gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus has atten­u­at­ed the imme­di­ate impact of debt delever­ag­ing , it has done noth­ing to reduce the out­stand­ing lev­el of pri­vate debt .
Instead even sub -par growth has become depen­dent on con­tin­u­ing gov­ern­ment stim­uli , and when­ev­er those stim­uli are removed , the econ­o­my will fal­ter .
Total pri­vate debt rose by a mere A$ 1 bil­lion last month , ver­sus as much as A$ 30 bil­lion dur­ing the height of the debt bub­ble .
But were it not for the First Home Ven­dors Boost ( let ’s call it what it is ) , Aus­tralia would now be firm­ly in the grips of delever­ag­ing .
END OF COMMENTARY
COMMENTS ON THE DATA — A Mortgage & Government Led Recovery ?
Total pri­vate debt rose by a mere A$ 1 bil­lion last month , ver­sus as much as A$ 30 bil­lion dur­ing the height of the debt bub­ble .
But were it not for the First Home Ven­dors Boost ( let ’s call it what it is ) , Aus­tralia would now be firm­ly in the grips of delever­ag­ing .
Nonethe­less the debt to GDP ratio fell yet again , because the rate of growth of debt is now sub­stan­tial­ly below the rate of growth of GDP — even though that is now also anaemic .
The break­down of debt shows that the busi­ness sec­tor is rapid­ly delever­ag­ing , while mort­gage and gov­ern­ment debt is escalating — and both those are the result of gov­ern­ment pol­i­cy .
With­out the First Home Ven­dors Boost , it is high­ly unlike­ly that mort­gage debt would still be ris­ing today .
Mort­gage debt peaked as a per­cent­age of GDP in March 2008 , and fell for the remain­der of the year until the First Home Ven­dors Boost .
The quar­ter­ly change in mort­gage debt was also trend­ing down from the 2005 peak , and that down­ward trend has clear­ly been reversed by the impact of the Boost .
House Prices
The Boost has cer­tain­ly had the impact the gov­ern­ment desired , of arrest­ing the fall in Aus­tralian house prices .
It will also almost cer­tain­ly guar­an­tee that I ’ll be walk­ing ( and run­ning ) to Kosciuszko under the first half of the bet with Rory Robert­son .
[ 1 ]
The sec­ond half of the bet , that the fall from peak to trough will be of the order of 40 % , may still see Rory also walk­ing some years hence — and the with­draw­al of the Boost may make this occur soon­er rather than lat­er .
The rea­son is twofold .
First­ly , the Boost has obvi­ous­ly brought for­ward some buy­ing by First Home Buy­ers that would have occurred any­way , as well as entic­ing in oth­ers who might not have con­sid­ered it oth­er­wise .
The with­draw­al of that demand will have a strong impact on the sub - $ 500,000 price range .
But the with­draw­al will also affect hous­es in the $ 1 mil­lion to $ 1.5 mil­lion range as well , because the Boost did far more than mere­ly boost sub -$ 500,000 prices .
First Home Buy­ers who were enticed into the mar­ket by the addi­tion­al $ 7,000 geared that up with addi­tion­al debt by at least a fac­tor of 4 , to result in some­thing like a $ 35,000 price jump for sub -$ 500 K hous­es .
But the sell­ers of those houses — the real ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Boost — then received an extra $ 35,000 in cold hard cash .
They then used this as a boost to their own deposits on their pur­chas­es of hous­es fur­ther up the chain — and if they also geared by a fac­tor of 4 ( ie a 80 % mar­gin­al lev­el of gear­ing , which is well with­in cur­rent lend­ing prac­tice ) , then the prices they paid for hous­es in the $ 750 K ‑1.5 M range would have risen by $ 140,000 .
This works in reverse as well .
When the Boost is with­drawn , not only will sell­ers of sub -$ 500 K hous­es find that buy­ers have $ 35 K less to spend than dur­ing the boost , the sell­ers of $ 750 K ‑1.5 M abodes will find their buy­ers short about $ 150 K com­pared to dur­ing the boost .
2010 could be an inter­est­ing year for Aus­tralian house prices .

The chart below requires no substantial commentary suffice it to say that since the launch of the Fed 's Quantitative Easing , aka Monetization , program , the value of the Total Securities Held Outright on the Fed 's Balance Sheet has increased by $ 917 billion - from $ 584 billion to $ 1.5 trillion .
This has been accompanied by an almost linear increase in the S&P 500 Index , from 721 at QE announcement on March 18 to 1033 yesterday .
This $ 917 billion in extra liquidity , instead of igniting an inflationary spark , as the QE program was designed to do , is now ( metaphorically ) sloshing around bank basements .
As a reminder : the most recent reading of Total Deposit Reserves was ... $ 886 billion dollars :
An almost dollar for dollar match with the increase in Securities Held Outright of $ 917 billion .
And instead of this excess money hitting broader aggregates such as M2 or MZM , it is held by the banks , who proceed to buy securities outright on their own , either Treasuries or Equities .
Apply the proper " money multiplier " to get the monetary impact on the S&P 500 , as a result of the banks not lending these excess reserves , and instead simply speculating with it , and you will likely get the increase in the market cap of the S&P since the launch of QE .

It might be perfectly obvious to you that the answer to this calculation is 1 – but apparently it's not to Google
Computers might struggle to exhibit intelligent behaviour , but blindly performing arithmetic calculations is surely their forte .
Or is it ?
The failure of Google 's online calculator and Excel 's apparent inability to give correct answers to simple calculations are both well - known problems among programmers , but these are n't really bugs in the normal sense of the word .
Instead they 're just a consequence of the fact that computers suck at maths .
Computers perform calculations in quite a different way from the methods that humans use to do arithmetic – and that means that they habitually come up with the wrong answer .
Here we investigate some of the shocking consequences of this revelation before delving into the reason why computers suck at maths .
Close is n't close enough
For anyone still to be convinced that computers can't get simple arithmetic right , let 's start off with a few examples that you can try out yourself .
First up , Google 's calculator .
If you 've never tried it out before , to get a feel for how it works , surf to www.google.co.uk, type 5 * 9 + ( sqrt 9 ) ^3 into the search box and click on ' Search ' .
You 'll find that it comes back with the correct answer : ' 5 * 9 + ( sqrt 9 ) ^ 3 = 72 ' .
Now let 's try another calculation .
Type in 599,999,999,999,999 - 599,999,999,999,998 .
Quite clearly , this should give an answer of 1 .
Unbelievably , however , Google responds with this : ' 599,999,999,999,999 – 599,999,999,999,998 = 0 ' .
Just a rare and unfortunate example , perhaps ?
OK then , let 's try another simple calculation .
Type =850*77.1 into cell A1 of an Excel 2007 workbook ( it does n't work – or should that be it does work – in earlier versions of Excel ) .
A bit of mental arithmetic suggests that the answer ought to be in the region of 60,000 ; in fact the correct answer is 65,535 .
Excel has other ideas .
It will tell you that the result of this multiplication is 100,000 , which is out by a massive 34,465 .
And to prove that this is no flash in the pan , how about using a selection of online calculators to work out 1.0 - 0.9 - 0.1 ?
You 'll probably find at least half of them will come up with an answer of - 2.77555756 E- 17 – scientific notation for - 0.0000000000000000277555756 .
( If all the ones you try give the right answer , take a look at www.calculator.net.)
BAD MATHS : Since 1.0 - 0.9 - 0.1 equals 0 , why are so many online calculators convinced that this value is the answer instead ?
OK , this answer might not be far removed from the correct answer of 0 , but why can't the calculator come up with the right answer – an answer that 's blatantly obvious to anyone who is conversant with simple arithmetic ?
How computers do maths
Although computers can handle integers ( whole numbers ) , for general - purpose arithmetic they store numbers in floating point format because it 's so much more efficient in memory use .
Let 's take the double precision floating point representation as an example .
It uses 64 bits to store each number and permits values from about - 10308 to 10308 ( minus and plus 1 followed by 308 zeros , respectively ) to be stored .
Furthermore , fractional values as small as plus or minus 10 - 308 ( that 's a decimal point followed by 307 zeros and then a 1 ) can be stored .
By way of contrast , if the same 64 bits were used to store integers , the range would be −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807 , and fractional values could n't be represented .
The secret to this apparently amazing efficiency is approximation .
Of those 64 bits , one represents the sign ( so whether the value is positive or negative ) , 52 bits represent the mantissa ( that 's the actual numbers ) and the remaining 11 bits represent the exponent ( how many zeros there are or where the decimal point is ) .
So although a much greater range of numbers can be stored using floating point notation , the precision is actually less than can be achieved in integer format , since only 52 bits are available .
In fact , 52 bits of binary information represents a 16 - bit decimal number , so any values that differ only in their 17th decimal point will actually be seen as identical .
The situation with Google thinking that 599,999,999,999,999 - 599,999,999,999,998 equals 0 is similar , although it 's evident that Google 's calculator actually uses less than the normal 52 bits for the mantissa .
That some calculators give a non-zero result to the calculation 1.0 - 0.9 - 0.1 might seem different since we appear to be nowhere close to the limit of 64 - bit floating point arithmetic .
But that 's forgetting one important fact – that computers work in binary .
And although 0.1 might have only one significant digit in decimal , in binary notation the mantissa is a repeating sequence .
This means that 0.1 can never be represented accurately in binary , no matter how many bits you use .

As Steve Jobs ' reputation continues to sink , we receive word that the Apple boss tried to make a deal with Palm not to poach each other 's employees .
Palm rebuffed the suggestion as " likely illegal . "
It does n't surprise me that former Palm CEO Ed Colligan would turn Jobs down , even though communication between the two included an implied legal threat by Apple against Palm , Bloomberg reported .
“ Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other ’s employees , regardless of the individual ’s desires , is not only wrong , it is likely illegal , ” Colligan said to Jobs last August , according to the news agency .
Colligan said he thought about Jobs ’ proposal and considered offering hiring concessions , before deciding against it .
Not surprising as Colligan is a good guy .
Jobs succeeded in making such an arrangement with Google , according to published reports .
The feds are investigating and the Palm allegations only make Apple look worse .
It is disappointing , but hardly amazing , that Jobs would try to do something that shows such disrespect to the engineers and others who actually create the products he gets credit for .
The Palm discussion occurred after the company hired away Jon Rubenstein , a longtime Apple exec now credited with the smartphone strategy that resulted in the Palm Pre , released earlier this year .
“ We must do whatever we can to stop this , ” Jobs said in the communications , reported by Bloomberg .
Steve , there is an easy way to " stop this " that is n't nearly so likely to trigger a federal investigation :
Stop treating your people like indentured servants .
Treat them well , pay them what they are worth , and accept that even then some will want to leave for different , even greener pastures .
Trying to stop employees from talking jobs elsewhere is simply wrong and , as Ed Colligan warned , " likely illegal . "
Jobs has already avoided the bullet in a scandal over backdated stock option grants , which put money in chosen employees pockets at the expense of shareholders .
With the Obama justice department and other federal regulators already looking closely at Apple over the iPhone and handset exclusivity and the sharing of board members , Jobs ' alleged anti-poaching efforts only add to the fire that is growing around him .
It is always fun to watch supposed champions of free enterprise do their very best to squelch its magic and get caught .
Also very sad .

Westword , an alternative weekly newspaper in Denver , has the standard lineup of film , food and music critics .
But in what may be a first for American journalism , the paper is shopping around for a medical marijuana critic .
The idea is not to assess the green stuff itself , but to review the dispensaries that have sprouted like , um , weeds in Denver this year .
“ We want to see what kind of place it is , how well they care for you and also how sketchy the place is , ” said Patricia Calhoun , editor of Westword .
“ Do they actually look at your medical marijuana card ?
Do they let you slip some cash under the counter and bypass the rules ? ”
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
As many as 5.7 million Americans were infected with the H1N1 virus between April and late July , U.S. researchers said on Thursday , offering the clearest picture yet of how quickly and widely swine flu can spread .

Researchers used computer models to estimate the number of people who have contracted swine flu , which began infecting Americans in April .
They estimated that 1.8 million to 5.7 million cases of swine flu occurred between April and July 23 , sending between 9,000 and 20,000 people to the hospital .
About 6 percent of people who were hospitalized with the virus died , the team , led by Carrie Reed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , reported in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases .
This suggests that as many as 1,300 people died from their infections between April and July .
Officially , 1,000 U.S. deaths have been attributed to H1N1 since April .
Dr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC said on Thursday the agency does not have an update beyond July 24 .
“ We do believe many millions of people have already contracted this virus in the United States , ” Schuchat said .
“ It ’s probably now well more than 20,000 hospitalizations , ” she said .
“ Really , the priority is to minimize illness and death . ”
Part of the U.S. plan to do that was through widespread vaccinations , but manufacturing delays have stalled those efforts .
“ We had all hoped to have more vaccine now than we have , ” Schuchat said .
Earlier government estimates had suggested there would be as many as 40 million vaccine doses available for state and local health authorities to distribute by the end of October .
Schuchat said 24.8 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine are available , 1.6 million more doses than on Wednesday .
The United States has ordered up to 250 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from five companies -- MedImmune , a unit of AstraZeneca , Sanofi- Aventis , Australia ’s CSL , GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis .
Except for MedImmune , all had problems making vaccine at first and are still struggling to make the virus grow in eggs , the first step to manufacturing influenza vaccine .
Schuchat said state and local health departments have had to adapt their vaccination plans to cope with the delays , and dole out a limited number of doses to people at greatest risk of developing severe disease from H1N1 , including people with underlying health conditions and women who are pregnant .
Several studies released at the meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America in Philadelphiaon Thursday showed that vaccinating pregnant women protected their babies , also .
They said babies were less likely to be premature and were bigger if their mothers were vaccinated against flu .
A separate study showed that people who had been taking cholesterol lowering drugs called statins were less likely to die from flu .
DALLAS - Dallas police are looking for a man who they say repeatedly sneaks into back yards , dances around naked and then runs away .
Police believe the man has been exposing himself in the same neighborhood since 2005 .
The most recent incident was on Sept. 30 .
Police say he usually climbs a fence or goes through a gate and either dances naked or jumps in a swimming pool naked .
Police say he also has danced naked on top of a backyard air conditioning unit .
Police say they 're looking for a pudgy man who is about 6 feet tall and covers his face while dancing .
Dallas Police Senior Cpl. Janice
Crowther says police want to catch him before it escalates into something worse .
Pre-orders for Windows 7 have already topped the sales of copies of Vista sold in the first year at stores run by DSGi , according to category director Jeremy Fennell .
Windows 7 officially goes on sale 22 October , but has been available for pre-order since July at a huge discount .
Since then , it 's already outdone the first year of Vista sales at stores such as PC World and Dixons .
" We 've sold more copies on preorder than we sold of Vista for the whole year , " he said , speaking today at the Windows 7 launch in London .
Fennell credited this with the quality of the operating system , rather than the skill of Microsoft 's marketing machine .
" It 's a good product ... it has n't taken Microsoft to hype the product , " he claimed , adding Windows 7 was " better than the product we 've seen before . "
He said customer research conducted by DSGi showed that 60 per cent of consumers looking to buy a new PC had delayed buying to wait for Windows 7 to arrive .
The survey also showed that while 44 per cent were not planning on upgrading and 22 per cent were n't sure , 19 per cent of people were looking to buy a new PC and 15 per cent were looking to buy a Windows 7 upgrade .
For some reason , a PerlMonks post from last year , Perl Cannot Be Parsed , has resurfaced in online discussions .
As you might expect , most comments are ill informed and blatant in their wrongness .
At least half of the comments are the equivalent of " OH noes i cant n't read PERL LOLLERS now i is nos Y !!! " , but that 's what you get for reading Twitter , Digg , YouTube , and occasionally Reddit .
( If no one 's invented the phrase " The Eternal 4 channing of the Internet " , I claim it . )
Another significant portion of the comments come from people who 've read only the headline and feel sufficiently enlightened that they can proclaim their wisdom to the world at large , despite comments and clarifications on that PerlMonks post from people who 've actually worked on the Perl 5 internals and understand the implications of that statement and their limitations .
A few comments are from people who know what this means and what it implies and those ( few ) cases where it applies .
I suspect the rest of the programming world which might care persists in a limited state of confusion .
What does this mean ?
Why does it matter ?
What happens now ?
This is especially true for people who use Perl but do n't necessarily consider themselves programmers .
They do n't have computer science backgrounds , but they 'd use good tools like Perl : : Critic if they knew they were available .
On Static Parsing
The unparsability of Perl 5 is a static unparsability .
" Static " is a specific term of art which means , basically , " You ca n't run any part of the program to determine what it means . "
One of the most common points of confusion in the discussion is a misunderstanding of what " static " means .
This does n't mean that it 's impossible to parse Perl 5 .
The files perly.y and perltoke.c in the Perl 5 source tree do just that .
However , the existence of subroutine prototypes and bareword declarations combined with the possibility of running arbitrary code during compilation with BEGIN blocks introduces ambiguity to the process .
That 's all the proof addresses .
I realize that 's not obvious to everyone reading this so far .
That 's fine .
Just remember that the proof addresses important but limited circumstances .
Why limited ?
It is possible to parse Perl 5 code statically in many cases -- most cases , even .
PPI is an example of this .
PPI can build a document object model representing Perl 5 programs sufficient to perform static analysis ; this is why Perl : : Critic works .
PPI is n't perfect , and it can't resolve all possible Perl 5 programs to unambiguous object models .
Part of that is the malleability of Perl 5 syntax .
Changing the Parse
I mentioned subroutine prototypes and barewords ; these are two cases where predeclaration changes how Perl 5 will parse existing code .
Subroutine prototypes can change the expected arity and parse and runtime behavior of subroutines .
In general , you should avoid them unless you know exactly what this means and what it implies .
Changing Expectations
In specific circumstances , they 're useful to change how Perl 5 passes arguments to the functions .
My favorite prototype lets you pass blocks as anonymous subs :
sub wrap ( & ) { ... } my $ wrapped = wrap { do_this ( ) ; do_that ( ) } ;
Without the & prototype character , you 'd have to call wrap ( ) with more verbosity :
my $ wrapped = wrap ( sub { ... } ) ;
It 's a small prettification , but it 's occasionally useful .
There are two important points to note about this example .
First ,
Perl 5 must encounter the sub declaration with its prototype prior to the point at which it parses the call to wrap .
The prototyped declaration changes how Perl 5 parses that construct -- otherwise the curly braces would run through the " is it a hash reference or a block ? " heuristic and would not get promoted to an anonymous subroutine declaration .
Second , a smart and stateful static parser could identify this type of declaration and parse the code the same way the Perl 5 parser does .
This is not by itself sufficient to make parsing Perl 5 statically indeterminate .
( Some people might object that statefulness in a static parser violates some rule of computer theory somewhere , which is a true point but practically useless ; you need at least some statef in your parser to find the end of a double - quoted string if you allow escaped embedded double quotes .
The question is not if you allow lookahead but how much lookahead you need .
Also parser people , remember that I reserve the right to tell small fibs to explain things to an audience that wo n't ever take a class about automata . )
Changing Arity
Arity can be more interesting ; this is a fancy programming term which means " how many arguments a function or operator takes " .
Perl 5 subroutines are usually greedy ; they 'll happily slurp up all arguments in a big list .
Certain subroutine prototypes allow you to change this .
For example , you can define a foo subroutine which only takes two arguments :
sub foo ( $ $ ) { return " < @_ > " ; } say foo 1 , 2 ;
The prototype changes the parsing of foo calls so that providing more than two arguments is a syntax error :
say ' Parsing done ' ; say foo 1 , 2 , 3 ; $ perl protos.pl
Too many arguments for main : : foo at protos.pl line 13 , near " 3 ; " Execution of protos.pl aborted due to compilation errors .
Again , Perl 5 must have encountered the prototyped declaration before it can apply the parsing rule changes to any code .
Again , a clever and stateful static parser could detect these parser changes and adapt to them .
Barewords
The Perl 5 parser has a complex heuristic for figuring out what a bareword actually means .
It could be a filehandle , a class name , a function , or more .
Several good Perl 5 programmers recommend against the indirect object invocation syntax ( though dative is a description with more technical accuracy for linguists ) because it can parse differently depending on code Perl 5 has already executed .
my $ obj = new Class foo => ' bar ' ; # do not mimic this example
Perl 5 has heuristics to determine what new and Class mean in this context .
It may be obvious to readers that this code really means :
my $ obj = Class -> new ( foo => ' bar ' ) ;
... but if the parser has already seen a subroutine declaration for Class in this particular namespace ( in certain circumstances , I believe it 's possible to fool the parser with a specific way of declaring new ) , the heuristic may choose the wrong option .
The indirect pragma is an effective way to root out this ambiguity from your code .
There are some seven cases in which you can run afoul of this bareword heuristic ; you can tell who 's a real Perl 5 guru by asking him or her to list at least five .
See Matt S. Trout 's Indirect but Still Fatal for a fuller discussion of the issues here .
A very clever , very careful static parser could still replicate the complex heuristic in the Perl 5 parser and parse code appropriately .
The Real Problem
What 's the source of the ambiguous parsing issue ?
If Perl 5 requires predeclaration of all parse modifications , and if they 're declarative , why is writing a static parser which can parse all Perl 5 programs in the same way that the Perl 5 parser does impossible ?
Perl 5's compilation phase parses Perl 5 code into a parse tree .
The execution phase traverses this tree .
They 're two separate stages ...
... except that BEGIN and implicit BEGIN blocks can run arbitrary code during the compilation phase .
That is , you can write code that will not compile successfully :
sub foo ( $ $ ) { return " < @_ > " ; } say foo 1 , 2 , 3 ;
... and insert a BEGIN block to change the way Perl 5 will parse subsequent code :
sub foo ( $ $ ) { return " < @_ > " ; } BEGIN { no warnings qw ( prototype redefine ) ; eval ' sub foo { return " < @_ > " }' } say foo 1 , 2 , 3 ;
Even though the eval code would n't normally run until after the compilation stage has finished and the execution stage has begin , the BEGIN block causes the Perl 5 parser to execute its contents immediately after its parsing has finished -- before parsing the very next line .
This is a contrived example -- why would anyone write this code ? -- but you should start to see the problem .
Even though this syntax is declarative to the Perl 5 parser , a static analysis tool would have to analyze the semantic meaning of code within the BEGIN block to determine if it has any effects .
That means peeking into double - quoted strings used as arguments to eval .
Even if a static parser could do that , it'd be easy to confuse it again :
BEGIN { no warnings qw ( prototype redefine ) ; eval ' sub ' . ' foo ' . '{ return " < @_ > " }' }
Even though Perl 5 can coalesce those three concatenations to a single constant string during its optimization phase , the parser must get more complex to detect this case .
You can see where this is going .
Ultimately , completely accurate static parsing of Perl 5 programs is impossible in certain cases because I could write :
BEGIN { no warnings qw ( prototype redefine ) ; eval ' sub ' . ' foo ' . '{ return " < @_ > " }' if rand ( 1 ) > 0.5 ; }
The static analysis tool can't even tell if this program would parse successfully .
About half the time , Perl 5 will report that it has a syntax error .
Half of the time it will succeed .
Thus there exist pathological cases written by curious ( and potentially malicious ) people such as myself where a static Perl 5 parser cannot predict what the actual Perl 5 parser will do .
If you 're morbidly curious , consider changing the prototype of a symbol already parsed through raw typeglob access .
The Implications
Do n't panic .
Static analysis tools can't parse all valid Perl 5 programs , but they can parse many Perl 5 programs .
While the Perl 5 parser is complex with many special cases , it 's possible to write a clever tool such as PPI which is good enough for almost all code .
Besides that , the language - bending manipulations that could trip up a static analysis tool are mostly declarative and mostly decidable , unless you 're doing something beyond weird .
In most cases this does n't matter .
That example code is completely unreliable .
There are ways to disambiguate potentially ambiguous code -- and good Perl 5 hackers recommend using those approaches anyway .
Most languages without a very strict homoiconic representation have parsing ambiguities ( and if you allow arbitrary code execution in templates or reader macros , even homoiconicity can't always save you ) .
Besides that , once you allow loading language extensions from languages with access to raw memory , all bets are off .
With a bit of work , I 'm sure I could come up with ways to confuse static Ruby and Python parsers without resorting to C. Implicit variable declarations seems like one perilous approach ....
Hot news from PC - land today , gentletypes .
Seems the ever - controversy - free Valve Software have a new project up their sleeves , and one that probably is n’t related to Deads or Teams or Halves .
Probably .
Turns out they ’ve just hired the mysterious IceFrog , the chap who has been developing Defense of the Ancients Allstars for the last couple of years , the huge and influential ( see : Demigod ) Warcraft 3 mod .
I ’ve just had confirmation from Valve that his claim he ’s off to lead one of their team on a secret new project is true .
Goodness gracious me , whatever could it be ?
Whatever else people might accuse Valve of , what they ca n’t say is that they ’ve abandoned their long - running tendency to recruit talented modders to their ranks .
It ’s this strategy that led to TF2 , Portal and Counter - Strike , so this is news to cheer about .
Even though we do n’t know anything about it .
Here ’s FrostToad ’s official memo about his new job :
I have some really awesome news I ’d like to share with you guys .
I am now leading a team at Valve !
I finally have all the resources needed to do some very exciting stuff that you guys will love .
I look forward to revealing more specific details when the time is right .
My goal and top priority in the future is to solve the surrounding issues that affect the DotA experience in order to allow it to reach new heights .
Addressing these issues will enable us to further enjoy aspects of DotA such as the gameplay , mechanics , and in - game feel that currently work well and ought to be maintained .
As I ’ve said many times in the past and especially after today ’s developments , I am very excited about DotA ’s future !
Again , Valve ’s Doug Lombardi gives the official nod to this news .
“ I can confirm it is true .
And , as you ’ve guessed , that is all I can say . ”
Boo .
But still yay !
So , time to saddle up the Speculation Donkey .
What could it be ?
Seems more than likely it ’s strategy - related – is it standalone , Blizzard - free DOTA ?
A Team Fortress 2 - themed RTS - RPG thing ?
Something entirely new ?
Spying an opportunity to do a professional DOTAlike after Demigod got itself into a spot of bother with the tech - fault plagued launch ?
Fascinating and exciting stuff – most especially because it might just be Valve ’s first major foray outside of FPS .
It ’s worth noting that IceFrog did n’t create DOTA - Allstars , but rather has been continuing its development since the original creator ( it ’s also worth nothing that DOTA Allstars is a modification of the original DOTA mod .
Jeezum , this is confusing ) stepped down .
That chap , one Steve Feak , is now heading up Riot Games , a new team also currently engaged on a pro version of DOTA ’s principles .
That ’s the upcoming League of Legends : Clash of The Fates , to be specific .
As far as I can tell , IceFrog is n’t and was n’t involved with that .
But he is now a Valve employee , which is the important bit .

Yoani Sanchez 's blog is one of Cuba 's most popular A dissident Cuban blogger cannot go to New York to receive a top journalism prize , after the authorities upheld a ban on her travel abroad .
Yoani Sanchez , 34 , won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for Generacion Y , a blog critical of Cuba 's one - party Communist government .
The prize is the oldest international award in journalism .
It is given by Columbia University to journalists who have furthered inter-American understanding .
" The immigration office just informed me that the ban remains on my leaving the country , " Ms Sanchez said on Monday via the social networking website Twitter , where she has 6,638 followers .
" I am going to celebrate on the night of the award with some friends .
I am not going to let the refusal to travel ruin the happiness of the prize , " she added .
" I dream of an island where nobody needs to ask permission to enter and leave . "
' Better future ' Generacion Y has become a trusted source for news on Cuba , with the site receiving 14 million hits a month .
Nicholas Lemann , dean of Columbia 's Graduate School of Journalism , released a statement expressing his disappointment over the Cuban government 's refusal to allow Yoani Sanchez to travel to New York .
Generacion Y was also given an award by Spain 's El Pais " The Cuban government ought to value Ms Sanchez 's work as a sign that young Cubans are ready to take Cuba into a better future - one that will have the free press the Cuban people deserve , " Mr Lemann said .
Last year Time Magazine named Ms Sanchez as one of the world 's most influential people , and this year it listed Generacion Y as one of the world 's top 25 blogs .
But in Cuba readership is limited due to restricted internet access .
Only about 2.1 % of Cubans have regular access to the global internet and 11.5 % to the Cuban intranet , according to the Washington - based democracy and human rights organisation Freedom House .
" Bloggers can go online at government - owned internet cafes , at universities and hotels , " it says .

Standard ideals of facial beauty and harmony may differ depending on geographic location , with a specific difference between North American beauty ideals and those of Brazilians .
In a paper presented at the 2009 American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery Foundation ( AAO - HNSF ) Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO in San Diego , researchers studied the preferences of a group of health professionals who work with facial aesthetics , a group of artists and sculptors , and a group of general citizens .
They were asked about their aesthetics impression of three nasal root height variations , produced with computer imaging from the profiles of six women between the ages of 18 and 30 years .
The low position of the nasal root , between the upper eyelid crease and the pupil level , was considered the most beautiful by the Brazilian health professionals , artists , and lay public ( 53 % ) , followed by the regular position ( 36 % ) .
When asked about the worst profile , the high level was chosen ( 73 % ) .
The researchers note that it is very important for health professionals who work with aesthetics to know the preferences and standards of their patients , as the main goal of facial plastic surgery is subjective satisfaction .
Much of the literature on the theme is written by researchers from North America and Europe , regions where the cultural and ethnic background is different from the population of Brazil , where the research was conducted .
This new research provides a refined view of the preferences among Brazilians , and can help surgeons to tailor strategies to meet their patients ' needs more accurately .

( CNN ) --
The whole world watched Thursday as a lighter - than - air craft set loose by a 6 - year - old boy floated above eastern Colorado .
Several media outlets offered to help track the balloon with their helicopters , a sheriff 's spokeswoman says .
Web sites as diverse as Al - Jazeera and Australia 's Sydney Morning Herald carried news of the wayward aircraft with reports that authorities feared the boy , Falcon Heene , was inside .
The Web sites for The Sun , Britain 's largest newspaper , as well as the BBC , posted by - the - minute updates on the aerial odyssey , as did many international sites .
The story was a bonanza for social networking sites .
Facebook , in a little more than an hour , had three fan pages and three groups dedicated to " Balloon Boy . "
Members were piling on as the story developed .
After the balloon landed near Colorado Springs , law enforcement authorities found it empty , according to CNN affiliate KMGH , which cited a police report .
But while the aircraft was airborne , it was the saucer seen round the world .
Watch " unbelievable " footage of " homemade flying saucer " »
Michael Karns , director of marketing at Zazzle , an online customized products platform tied to trends and ideas , said the balloon excursion sparked the creation of 6,000 " products , " ( shirts , bags , shoes , doggie attire , etc. ) tied to the news event .
" What 's interesting about this story is that it played out over a significant period of time , " Karns said .
" Expressions [ on the T - shirts ] changed from " Go , Falcon , Go " ( when the boy was believed afloat ) to " I Believe " ( when he was reported missing ) and once it came clear the kid , Falcon , was hiding in the attic , the products changed to sort of making fun of the whole thing . "
Karns said the Redwood City , California , company received about 200 orders of shirts related to the event by 8 p.m. ET Thursday .
Karns predicted the " Balloon Boy " may become a hot Halloween costume as well .
The attention it garnered also gave some indications of how a real - life flying saucer , an unidentified flying object , may be documented in a high - tech world .
Watch report on shifting attitudes towards '' balloon boy ' saga »
Twitter was inundated with news about Falcon , with the updates occupying seven of the 10 trending topics on the site from 3:30 p.m. to nearly 5 p.m. ET .
While most of the tweets were repeating national headlines about the balloon , some people expressed their opinions along the way .
Mleswan tweeted , " Oh sweet irony .
The kid 's name is FALCON ?!?!
Oh that 's classic . "
Tmilewski tweeted , " I call both horrible parenting AND horrible craftsmanship on this one ! "
On Reddit , a social networking site known for its hilarious discussion threads about news events , the topic elicited fun and fast dialog .
Neoncow said : " I do n't care what they say .
A father who builds a flying saucer hot air balloon with his son is a good father . "
Lyrus said : " What did Beyonce say to the parents of the 6 - year - old kid that flew away in a balloon ?
If you liked it then you should have put a string on it . "
Mossyskeleton : " I wonder if his dad is going to ground him when he gets back . "
Falcon 's parents , identified as science enthusiasts and storm chasers Richard and Mayumi Heene , were featured earlier this year on ABC 's prime - time program " Wife Swap , " ABC said .
The Heene family was involved in " scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research - gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm , " the network 's Web site said .
Richard Heene , who has posted at least one iReport , calls himself a general contractor , published scientist and inventor .
The aircraft , which appeared to be a Mylar - coated helium balloon , had been tethered to the Heene home in Fort Collins , Colorado , the Larimer County Sheriff 's Office said .
Falcon evidently untied the rope anchoring the balloon , and it was feared that he had fallen from the craft .
Authorities say that after ground and air searches , he was found hiding in a box in the attic of his family 's home Thursday .

US Treasury Staff Made Millions From Wall Street
Perhaps the biggest news of the day , while not at all surprising , is intensely frustrating .
Several top aides at the US Treasury have previously worked at Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , and other financial services firms , and have pocketed millions of dollars in compensation in the process .
In his election campaign , President Obama made promises that he would steer clear of lobbyists and keep special interests at arms length .
It was an attempt to avoid appointing officials with obvious financial connections to the private sector , that owe favors , and that are driven by anything other than the public good .
When it comes to the Treasury in particular , which has a leading role in guiding our nation through the present financial crisis , this promise has not been fulfilled .
Here are two of the top offenders …
* Gene Sperling : Earned over $ 900,000 from companies like Goldman Sachs and Stanford Financial .
* Lee Sachs :
Took home more than $ 3 million from the New York hedge fund Mariner Investment Group .
The two advisors to Geithner are in counselor positions that do not require Senate confirmation .
Yet , they have been deeply involved in the $ 700 billion bank system rescue plan , the development of financial regulations , and in determining executive compensation rules .
How can regular Americans be treated fairly when coalitions of the elite run the private and public sector ?
It just does n’t seem possible .
Even more officials are described and exposed in this Bloomberg article on Geithner aides reaping millions .

More than a million people are said to have taken part in a march in Madrid to oppose government plans to liberalise Spain 's abortion law .
Several dozen centre - right opposition party joined the demonstration , which was backed by Roman Catholic bishops .
Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero wants to introduce abortion on demand .
At present , a pregnancy can only be terminated in mainly Catholic Spain under specific circumstances .
The government wants the procedure to be available to all women up until the 14th week of pregnancy .
Most controversially , the draft law currently before parliament would also permit girls aged 16 and 17 to have an abortion without their parents ' knowledge .
It is the latest in a series of ethical issues which have pitted the Catholic right against the government , which has legalised gay marriage and made divorce easier .
Police estimates put the crowd at 250,000 , but the regional government said that over a million had turned out , with the organisers claiming a turnout of two million .
' Every life matters '
The march brought together more than 40 religious and civil society groups calling for the government to withdraw the draft bill .
The march drew together more than 40 religious and other groups " This new law is a barbarity , " said one protester , Jose Carlos Felicidad , from the southern town of Algeciras .
" In this country , they protect animals more than human beings , " he told AFP news agency .
A broad cross-section of Spanish society were represented , says the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid - old and young , parents with babies , priests , nuns , immigrant families and organised groups coached in from all over the country .
They gathered in the heart of Madrid under an enormous blue banner the height of a two - storey building emblazoned with the simple message : " Every life matters . "
The crowd stretched all the way up the city 's main avenue in what our correspondent says was a show of strength by Spain 's traditional Catholic right .
The demonstrators would have been hoping that lawmakers at the parliament nearby were listening , our correspondent adds , because it is they who in due course will vote on this controversial legislation .
Respect and rights ?
Spain 's existing law , dating from 1985 , allows abortion in cases of rape and when there are signs of foetal abnormality .
Spanish women can also end a pregnancy if their physical or psychological health is at risk .
In practice , the last category has been used to justify the vast majority of abortions - of which there were 112,000 in 2007 .
The government says the new law is about respect and rights for women , and that anyone wanting to terminate a pregnancy will first be explained the alternatives - including state help for young mothers .
It also claims its proposal will make abortion safer - by ensuring the procedure does not happen beyond 22 weeks of a pregnancy .
In recent years shocking cases have emerged in which doctors performed abortions on women eight months pregnant , with the justification that their mental health was under threat .

Strikers vote at Glasgow mass meeting ( Pic : Duncan Brown )
Postal workers across much of the West of Scotland have walked out on unofficial strike after management punished drivers at Glasgow mail centre for refusing to cross their colleagues ’ picket lines .
Management suspended the pay of six drivers at 10 pm last night after they refused to sign a statement saying they were prepared to cross official picket lines in Ayr and Irvine .
In response , the entire night shift at the mail centre walked out in support .
They were followed by the early shift today .
A senior rep from the Glasgow CWU union told Socialist Worker that the strike had “ spread like wildfire ” across delivery offices and that so far over 2,000 union members had joined the action .
“ Every postal worker is experiencing the most extreme management provocation at the moment , ” he said .
Workers at Glasgow mail centre plan to meet later this afternoon to discuss whether they continue their action .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Health insurance premiums for the typical American family would increase by another $ 4,000 by 2019 under a key Senate overhaul plan , according to an industry trade group analysis .
Sen. Max Baucus ' Finance Committee is likely to vote Tuesday on an $ 829 billion bill to overhaul health care .
The report raised new questions about the political viability of the 10 - year , $ 829 billion compromise bill drafted under the guidance of Sen.
Max Baucus , D - Montana , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
The Finance Committee is expected to vote on the plan Tuesday .
The vote represents a potential turning point in the health care debate .
Baucus ' committee is the last of five congressional panels to consider health care legislation before debate begins in the full House of Representatives and Senate .
The report from the group America 's Health Insurance Plans concludes that , under the Baucus plan , the costs of private health insurance would rise by 111 percent over the next decade .
Under the current system , costs would rise by 79 percent , the report said .
Premiums for individuals could rise by an extra $ 1,500 if the Baucus plan is implemented , the report said .
It said premiums will rise faster under the Baucus plan in part because it does n't do enough to require individuals to purchase coverage .
A failure to draw enough young , healthy people into the insurance system would drive up rates for everyone else , the report concluded .
Under the plan , individuals who did not buy coverage would face a fine of up to $ 750 .
At the same time , a proposed tax on employer - sponsored , high - cost " Cadillac " plans could result in higher premiums for many private consumers , the report said .
It also highlighted likely cost - shifting due to Medicare cuts and an array of new taxes and fees on industries tied to the health care sector .
Watch as the insurance industry issues a warning before a key vote »
The White House blasted the report Monday , calling it inaccurate and self - serving .
" This is a self - serving analysis from the insurance industry , one of the major opponents of health insurance reform , " White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said .
" It comes on the eve of a vote that will reduce the industry 's profits .
It is hard to take it seriously .
The analysis completely ignores critical policies [ that ] will lower costs for those that have insurance , expand coverage and provide affordable health insurance options to millions of Americans who are priced out of today 's health insurance market or are locked out by unfair insurance company practices . "
Finance Committee spokesman Scott Mulhauser called the analysis " a health insurance company hatchet job -- plain and simple . "
The analysis from America 's Health Insurance Plans , first reported by The Washington Post , was conducted by the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers .
A separate analysis last week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that the Baucus bill would reduce the national deficit by slightly more than $ 80 billion over the next decade .
The office asserted the plan would provide insurance to an additional 29 million people and extend coverage to 94 percent of the country 's nonelderly population .
The measure initially was drafted after months of negotiations among the Finance Committee 's so - called Gang of Six , a group of three Republicans and three Democrats .
It represents the only proposal so far with the potential to attract any Republican support .
The Baucus plan is also the only plan under serious consideration that excludes a government - run public health insurance option .
Several top Democrats -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California -- have questioned whether it is possible contain costs without creating a public option to serve as a check on private insurers .
Republicans and some conservative Democrats oppose the government - run insurance option , saying it would drive private insurers from the market and eventually bring a government takeover of the health care system .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Global consumer confidence is rebounding , and in the United States has risen for the first time since 2007 , amid signs the world economy is picking up although spending is still restrained , a survey showed on Wednesday .
Confidence was highest in India , followed by Indonesia and Norway , and was weakest in Japan , Latvia , Portugal and South Korea , although in Korea it had improved markedly , according to a quarterly survey by The Nielsen Company , conducted between September 28 and October 16 .
“ Consumer confidence is rising faster in BRIC countries than other markets , driven by increasing job prospects , ” Oliver Rust , managing director of Nielsen Hong Kong , told Reuters .
In the United States and Europe , high unemployment continued to discourage spending on big - ticket items although confidence had improved as the worst appeared to be over for those economies , New York - based Nielsen said .
In the United States -- the world ’s biggest consumer market -- consumer sentiment rose from three months ago for the first time since early 2007 .
The data contrasts with a Conference Board index of U.S. consumer confidence , released on Tuesday , which showed a sharp deterioration in confidence this month .
The U.S. reading in The Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence survey at 84 was up 4 points from a similar survey in July but just below the global average reading of 86 and well below India ’s score of 120 and Indonesia on 115 .
“ While consumer confidence in the United States edged up 4 index points , that has n’t translated into spending confidence for the vast majority of American consumers , ” said James Russo , vice - president , global consumer insights at The Nielsen Company .
“ Clearly , this recovery will be manifested in measured and restrained spending as consumers work to repair their balance sheets . ”
A reading above 100 is considered optimistic .
The global average was up four points from a similar survey in July .
BRAZILIANS BULLISH
Japan and Spain were the only markets in the latest survey to register a decline in confidence from July .
Japan ’s score dropped by 2 points while the reading for Spain -- which the IMF has predicted will be the only Eurozone economy to contract in 2010 -- fell 4 points to 74 .
Hong Kong , which pulled out of recession in the second quarter , marked the biggest increase in confidence as its score jumped 14 points from the July survey to 93 .
South Korea ’s score rose by 13 points to 53 although it ranked third - lowest among markets covered .
Brazil ’s score increased by 12 points to 108 , or fifth place .
Australia and New Zealand also saw double - digit increases in their scores to 106 and 100 respectively .
The survey polled more than 30,500 consumers in Europe , the Asia - Pacific , North America and the Middle East about their confidence levels and economic outlook .
Confidence in major European markets remained low with Germany scoring just 77 , up from 72 previously ; the UK on 75 , up from 72 ; and France on 67 , up from 60 .
More than 60 percent of French , German and Irish consumers believed that economic recovery was more than a year away , Nielsen said .
Europe , especially Eastern Europe -- where scores were on average 10 points below those of Western Europe -- expected a longer road to recovery than all other regions including the United States , the survey showed .
Among the other BRIC economies -- Brazil , Russia , India and China -- Russia ’s score rose 4 points from the previous survey to 85 while China ’s increased by 6 points to 101 .

After recent Pakistani military operations in Pakistan 's own Swat Valley to push out Taliban insurgents who had taken control of the region , its operations are now more focused on the Taliban strongholds in the South Waziristan region .
Pakistani troops and Taliban militants have been locked in intense clashes recently in the tribal area which has killed more than 150 people .
Relief workers say that more than 120,000 people have been displaced by the fighting .
Insurgent responses to the increased military pressure have included numerous bombings and suicide attacks , killing and injuring scores across Pakistan in recent weeks .
Just today a car bomb in a busy marketplace in Peshawar killed more than 93 people , as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an official visit - announcing the latest in a series of U.S. aid packages to Pakistan .

ONE of the few calamities that has not befallen the world economy during the past two years is a dollar crash .
During the bubble era that preceded it , many ( including The Economist ) fretted that foreigners , tiring of America 's gaping external deficits , would send the greenback slumping and interest rates soaring .
In fact , the opposite occurred .
The crisis began within America , and the deeper it became , the more the dollar strengthened as fearful investors sought safety in Treasury bills .
Between September 2008 ( when Lehman Brothers failed ) and March 2009 ( when America 's stockmarkets hit bottom ) , the dollar rose by almost 13 % on a trade - weighted basis .
That history is worth bearing in mind when assessing the latest bout of fretfulness about the dollar 's future .
For the past six months the greenback has been sinking steadily , hitting a 14 - month low against a basket of leading currencies and $ 1.50 to the euro this week .
The slide has unnerved policymakers in economies whose currencies are rising ( see article ) , notably Brazil , where a 2 % tax on foreign capital inflows has been imposed .
Coupled with the extraordinary looseness of American policy , the weak dollar has also revived fears of a currency crash .
With the budget deficit in double digits and the Federal Reserve 's balance - sheet swollen , dollar bears are once again forecasting that the slide could become a rout and spell the end of America 's status as the world 's reserve currency .
This dollar declinism is overblown .
It exaggerates the scale of the slide and misunderstands its cause .
Much of the recent weakness simply reverses the earlier safe - haven flight to dollars , a sign of investors ' optimism about riskier assets rather than their fears about America 's currency .
On a trade - weighted basis the dollar today is close to where it was before Lehman failed .
Yields on Treasuries have not risen and spreads on riskier dollar assets continue to shrink .
If investors were growing leerier of dollars , the opposite should have occurred .
Furthermore , a weaker dollar is what you would expect , given the relative cyclical weakness of America 's economy .
Thanks to the hangover from its financial crisis , America 's recovery will be slower than that of other economies , especially emerging ones .
That suggests America 's monetary policy will stay looser for longer , pushing the dollar down .
A weaker dollar should also assist global economic rebalancing by helping to reorient America 's economy towards exports .
So in general , it should help rather than hinder the global recovery .
Still worried after all these years
That does not mean the worriers ' fears are baseless .
Three dangers remain .
First , the dollar 's decline is distorted .
The world 's most buoyant big economy , China , has kept its currency tied firmly to the greenback .
This is stymieing the adjustment of China 's economy , fuelling dangerous domestic asset bubbles and placing an unnecessary burden on other , more flexible currencies .
Second , America 's fiscal and monetary policies are unsustainable .
The public - debt burden is set to double and , on today 's policies , will still be rising in a decade 's time .
Third , the financial crisis has accelerated the relative shift of economic heft away from America — which will hasten the eventual erosion of the dollar 's dominance .
Even so , this is unlikely to provoke a sudden crisis .
Although America 's fiscal mess will last for years , it is not acute ( see article ) .
Inflation will not soar suddenly .
With neither the euro nor the yuan yet ready to usurp it , the dollar will not quickly lose its reserve - currency status .
The lesson of the past year is that it is still a currency to flee to , not from .
None of this absolves American policymakers from hard choices .
But a dangerous collapse in the greenback is unlikely .
Who has done a better job of keeping the country safer - George Bush or Barack Obama ?
Well , as soon as it we make it past the morning of 9/11 , then Obama will have officially kept us safer longer than George Bush did .
It 's empirical .
You can't argue with it .
One of the contributors to our show , Malcolm Fleschner , made this point to me .
I found it rhetorically enjoyable .
Of course , in reality the circumstances are different and you can't necessarily compare one time period to another .
And Bush supporters could even make an argument that we have not been hit on Obama 's watch because of what a great job Bush did to keep us safe earlier .
But that leads us to the second point about 9/11 .
Republicans would love to take credit for the safety we are enjoying under Obama , but do you think that they would say the same thing if the shoe was on the other foot ?
If we were attacked right now , do you think a single one of them would say it 's because Bush did n't do enough to keep us safe on his watch ?
Not one , right ?
Do you think a single one of them would say that it was n't Obama 's fault because it 's too early in his administration ?
Not one , right ?
In fact , so far they have done nothing but the exact opposite .
They have blamed every single thing on Obama .
The economy , the deficit , unemployment and even the Afghanistan War .
It 's all Obama 's fault in less than nine months .
Do you remember what they said when we got hit by the worst terrorist strike in US history on this same date in Bush 's first term ?
Bush could not be blamed at all !
It was far too early in his administration !
It was considered nearly unpatriotic to suggest such a thing .
No one could blame him for anything that happened before 9/11 in his first term .
Now , do you think they 've used that same standard for Obama ?
No one in their right mind could think that .
Perhaps the media should keep that in mind as they evaluate what Obama has done so far and what Bush failed to do at this point in his administration .
We could call that the 9/11 standard .

The ' telepathy ' chip that lets you turn on the TV using the power of thought
A ‘ telepathy ’ chip that allows people to control computers , televisions and light switches by the power of thought is being developed by British scientists .
The tiny sensor would sit on the surface of the brain , picking up the electrical activity of nerve cells and passing the signal wirelessly to a receiver on the skull .
The signal would then be used to control a cursor on a computer screen , operate electronic gadgets or steer an electric wheelchair .

The chip is the brainchild of Dr Jon Spratley , 28 , from Stevenage , Hertfordshire , who developed a prototype during his PhD at Birmingham University .
' We are just trying to help people with severe communication problems or motor neurone disease - like Dr Stephen Hawking or Christopher Reeve , ' he said .
' What we have designed would allow them to control a computer with their thoughts .
If they imagine their muscles moving , that could flick a light switch for example .
' It 's an area that is being heavily researched in America but so far all the tests have involved wired sensors .
This prototype uses wireless technology to remove the risk of infection and that 's the real drive of our work .
' The eventual aim would be to see these systems fully working so they are available to help patients communicate .
That 's the future . '
Breakthrough :
The ' telepathy ' chip could help quadriplegics such as Dr Stephen Hawking - and could have given the late Christopher Reeve ( right ) muscle control
The 1.3 mm ' multi-contact brain probe ' has yet to be tested on a living person or animal .
However , tests on brain slices in a laboratory have been promising .
Earlier this year , Japanese researchers unveiled a wheelchair powered by brainwaves .
The user wears a cap fitted with electrodes that monitor brain activity .
Scientists have also developed a robotic arm controlled by thought .
In tests , monkeys were able to feed themselves using the mechanical limb .
Dr Spratley 's invention is a tiny sensor designed to be injected by needle into the brain .
The chip has 50 ' contact spikes ' that connect to nerve cells in the brain .
As the needle is withdrawn , four coil antennae - each just 1 mm across - are unfurled on the surface of the brain .
These communicate wirelessly with a ' base station ' - a 16 mm diameter receiver that is permanently placed in the hole left by the needle .
The device picks up neural signals from the brain 's motor cortex and transmits the impulses via the base station to a receiver connected to a computer .
Dr Spratley said just seven unique ' thought commands ' are needed to provide mouse - like controls for a computer .
He believes implanting the chips will require minimal invasive surgery - yet could change the life of a quadriplegic or motor neurone disease sufferer .
' It began as an investigation into what signals paralysed people can generate , ' he said .
' If they can imagine using a limb , even if they can't move it , you can tap into that signal .
' Then you just have to imagine moving the muscle and the leg will move , the brain will train itself .
' Stephen Hawking could just think about using his muscles to operate his machine , rather than have to move his cheek .
' And yes , it would have worked for Christopher Reeve .
Muscle control comes back .
' My work was only ever going to be the tip of the iceberg and I hope eventually it will help people .
I am glad they are taking it forward . '
Previous chips have relied on cables and wires to send brain signals from a sensor to a controller outside the body .
Dr Spratley , who now works for Cambridgeshire - based company 42 Technology , says the wireless chip is safer .
He is now looking for funding to start human trials .
Investors ’ lawyers hailed the decision .
“ This is a first step in a decision by a federal judge that says even after the servicers ’ safe harbor was enacted and even after all the wrangling in Congress , we are still going to allow people to enforce their contract rights when it is appropriate , ” said Owen L. Cyrulnik , counsel at Grais & Ellsworth in New York , which is representing investors in the suit against Countrywide .
The lawsuit was filed in December after Bank of America struck a predatory lending settlement with attorneys general in 11 states .
In that deal , the bank agreed to modify thousands of mortgages written by Countrywide , providing $ 8.4 billion in loan aid to an estimated 400,000 Countrywide borrowers .
Under the terms of the settlement , Countrywide said it would cut principal balances on some loans and reduce interest rates on others .
Rates could decline to 2.5 percent , depending upon a borrower ’s ability to pay , and remain at that level for five years .
But it turned out that Bank of America owned only a small portion of the mortgages it had agreed to modify .
Investors who owned the largest share of the loans had not agreed to the settlement and would bear the brunt of the reduced payments .
Two investment funds holding Countrywide mortgages sued Bank of America , contending that the regulatory deal ran afoul of promises Countrywide had made when it issued the mortgage securities .
The funds , Greenwich Financial Services Distressed Mortgage Fund and QED L.L.C. , are owned by Mr. Frey , who contended that the mortgage securities contained pledges by Countrywide to repurchase from investors any loans it agreed to modify .
On later mortgage securities , Countrywide changed the agreements , eliminating the language about buying back modified loans .
According to the lawsuit , which is asking for a declaration from the court to make Countrywide live up to its contracts , some 374 mortgage pools issued by Countrywide contain language pledging to buy back modified loans from investors .
UNITED NATIONS
 A United Nations fact - finding mission investigating the three - week war in Gaza last winter issued a highly critical report on Tuesday detailing what it called extensive evidence that both Israel and Palestinian militant groups took actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity .
While the long - anticipated , 575 - page report condemned rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israeli civilians , it reserved its harshest language for Israel ’s treatment of the civilian Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip , both during the war and through the longer - term blockade of the territory .
The report called Israel ’s military assault on Gaza “ a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorize a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself , and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . ”
The mission  led by Richard Goldstone , a respected South African judge and once the lead war crimes prosecutor for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  did not attempt an exhaustive look at the war , instead focusing on 36 cases that it said constituted a representative sample .
In 11 of these episodes , it said the Israeli military carried out direct attacks against civilians , including some in which civilians were shot “ while they were trying to leave their homes to walk to a safer place , waving white flags . ”

Despite Javascript 's ubiquity , it 's a hard language to like .
Until the advent of VMs like Google's V8 , Apple / WebKit's Nitro / SquirrelFish Extreme and Firefox ' TraceMonkey , Javascript 's performance was abysmal .
Incompatible implementations across browser make development painful as well .
Libraries like jQuery and many others offer convenient abstractions and allow to program to one API and even out the incompatibilities .
Another approach to solving the problems is to hide Javascript completely and use it as a compilation target .
Google 's GWT is a mature example that takes Java code , written to a subset of the Java API , and compiles it into browser specific Javascript .
One example of a real world application of GWT is the Google Wave client .
Recently , a few more language implementations have joined the trend .
Avi Bryant , creator of the Smalltalk Seaside web framework , has created Clamato , a Smalltalk dialect that compiles to idiomatic Javascript .
Avi described the design principles of Clamato in the InfoQ interview with him taped at FutureRuby .
The tutorial page for Clamato allows to open a Clamato ( Smalltalk ) class browser in the web browser and inspect and edit the Clamato source code .
To look for classes , use the text field in the left upper corner of the browser .
Interesting bits are the selfhosting PEG - based Clamato parser ( enter " PP " in the textfield to see the classes for the parser and the various combinators ) .
A certain Seaside influence is visible in the Seaside - style HTML builder ( the HTMLCanvas class in the Clamato browser ) .
Visual components can use it to build their GUIs , for instance , the counter component from the tutorial :
renderOn : html html h3 with : @counter .
html button with : '+ ' ; onClick : [ @counter := @counter + 1. self reload ] .
html button with : '-'; onClick : [ @counter := @counter - 1. self reload ] .
The renderOn : html line defines a new method and the rest of the sample is the method body , which builds the HTML with a header and two buttons , which are set up with event handlers .
As it happens , another browser - based Smalltalk has appeared recently : GWT Smalltalk .
The creator Peter Fisk has previously created the .NET and alternatively ActionScript - based Vista Smalltalk .
GWTSmalltalk is written using GWT which generates Javascript that runs in the browser .
GWT Smalltalk is in an early stage right now but progresses quickly .
It has support for using XMPP , which puts it in a good place to interact with with Google Wave ( XMPP is an essential part of Google Wave ) .
More details are available in the Industry Misinterpretations podcast interview with Peter Fisk and on the GWT Smalltalk blog .
Stepping outside the Smalltalk sphere , Python also has its Javascript compiler in pyjamas :
pyjamas is a stand - alone python to javascript compiler , an AJAX framework / library and a Widget set API
The best place to start is the online pyjamas book .
Another language that compiles to Javascript is Moby Scheme .
What makes Moby - Scheme stand out is the way it 's targeting mobile devices , for the moment Android , by compiling to Javascript instead .
This is possible because of PhoneGap and because Android ships an efficient Javascript VM with its WebKit based browser .
PhoneGap is a library that allows Javascript to access native device functionality , such as accelerometers , GPS , cameras , as well as other features such as address books .
The creators of PhoneGap built it to bridge all the disparate smartphone devices which have very different programming environments , yet share one thing : WebKit and fast Javascript VMs .
By giving Javascript access to device features , cross platform apps are possible for smartphones .
See InfoQ 's interview with the PhoneGap creators for a thorough overview of PhoneGap .
I had the most interesting encounter in Reddit recently with a user who accused me of blog spam .
Of course , having a slight understanding of what the term was , but not that it was a real term , I decided to do a little research .
I know this might sound a bit know - it - all , but I am almost certain other bloggers have run into these type of users who really have no idea what spamming entails , especially in regards to blogging and using social media in the social networking and social bookmarking communities .
In fact , not one , but 2 of my articles that were top roundups about WordPress layouts I found that were handy for certain webmasters looking for those type of themes were accused the the same user .
So , here is what I found and how not to blog spam .
According to Wikipedia ,
Spam in blogs ( also called simply blog spam or comment spam ) is a form of spamdexing .
It is done by automatically posting random comments or promoting commercial services to blogs , wikis , guestbooks , or other publicly accessible online discussion boards .
In my case , I manually bookmark and share my links , or my visitors graciously do this , so in my case , and since my posts really have not been commercial in nature do not constitute as such .
You are within your rights to share your blog or other links in any social network or social bookmarking system .
In fact , most of their services highly encourage it , but they also warn about spamming .
So it is a use at your risk type of situation .
If the article is not yours , you are required to give credit , but you are still able to share those links anywhere .
It is when you post unrelated material to those networks and keep doing so in a manner that may be assumed that you are trying to force people to go to that link .
No matter if your articles or the ones you plug are commercial or not , you have to be certain that others will not take offense to such material .
For example , in Twitter , there are users that will send you reply messages and try to get you to try their product .
After further look into the matter , you will find that the person has contacted many other users with the same or similar message .
That is spam .
Even if the message is to go to a blog , that is blog spam .
You could also create this when publishing paid to blog articles as well .
How ?
Well , if your sponsored posts have no relevancy to your site ’s focus , some of your visitors may feel that you are spamming them .
Make sure to choose paid post opportunities that fit as closely to your blog ’s niche .
What constitutes as blog spam to you ?
What other suggestions can you make to avoid the possibility of blog spamming ?
Have you ever been accused of spamming with your blog ?
US House Rep. Tom Price , the Georgia Republican who introduced a motion to condemn Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson for saying that the Republican health care plan amounts to hoping that the sick “ die quickly , ” said he would withdraw the motion to give Rep. Grayson ( D - FL ) a chance to apologize .
Well , Grayson has apologized — just not to the Republicans he offended .

“ I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n’t voted sooner to end this holocaust in America , ” a defiant Grayson said on the House floor Wednesday .
The “ holocaust ” Grayson was referring to was the 44,000 Americans that a recent study says die each year because of inadequate access to health care .
The representative cited the Harvard study ( PDF ) in what appeared at first to be an apology , but quickly turned into a retort .
The number of dead “ is 10 times more than the number of Americans who have died in Iraq and who died in 9/11 , ” Grayson said .
“ But that was just once .
This is every single year .
That ’s right .
Every single year . ”
On the House floor Tuesday night , Grayson caused a stir among opponents of health care reform when he said the Republican model for health care is “ a very simple plan .
Do n’t get sick .
That ’s what the Republicans have in mind .
And if you get sick in America , the Republican health care plan is this : die quickly . ”
House Republicans quickly issued demands for an apology , and on Wednesday Rep .
Price tabled his motion to condemn the comment .

But , as some commentators have pointed out , that move — had it not been withdrawn — could have opened House Republicans to accusations of hypocrisy , as 166 of them voted against the motion to censure Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - SC ) over his exclamation of “ You lie ! ” during the president ’s address to Congress .

While the super - rich can pay millions to experience weightlessness at the International Space Station , some college kids have figured out how to experience the thrill of zero gravity for the student - friendly price of $ 0 .
Through NASA 's Microgravity University program , teams of college students get to ride in and conduct experiments on a NASA jet that simulates zero - gravity conditions .
Undergrads around the country will be sending their letters of intent to apply to this year 's competition this week , with completed applications due next month .
" It 's really an 'as only NASA can ' program , " said Sara Malloy , coordinator of the Microgravity University office at Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Students spend 10 days preparing for and going on their flights .
Though the program 's science does n't get piped directly into NASA 's high - profile programs , some of the research can end up in the hands of engineers .
And the students themselves get unique training in one of the strangest environments a human can experience .
The Microgravity University program has n't been heavily publicized , but it has reached more than 2,800 students at more than 165 colleges and universities since it first began in 1995 .
The trips on NASA 's Weightless Wonder , known more informally as the Vomit Comet , would cost more than $ 5,000 per person through the Zero Gravity Corporation .
Justin Nieusma headed up the College of New Jersey 's team , which flew this summer .
( Some of Nieusma 's cohorts , though not him , are pictured above . )
Their participation grew out of research some students were doing with the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab that required access to microgravity to continue .
" We got amazing scientific data that could never be reproduced on Earth or any other program I know of , " said Nieusma , now a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at University of Michigan .
Their experiment looked at how " dusty plasmas " like the ones that compose Saturn 's rings and comet tails react under different conditions .
The experiments that College of New Jersey designed and built have been good ( and lucky ) enough to fly both of the past two years .
" You have to go through a very rigorous application process .
These applications are like 50 , 60 pages long , full of details that they want out of you , " Nieusma said .
" It 's a crazy program , competitive , and we were so happy we got in the second year . "
By flying up , then nosing down , microgravity conditions are obtained for 18 to 25 seconds a time , and engineering students attempt to do science as their feet float above their heads .
Conducting research while floating in the main cabin of a McDonnell Douglas C - 9B Skytrain II is n't the easiest thing , as YouTube videos of the microgravity experiments can attest .
Students bolt their experiments to the floor of the plane .
When the plane dips , and the pull of the Earth 's gravity is counteracted by the force of the airplane 's descent , they attain weightlessness .
Holding on to their experiment boxes , they race to complete whatever tasks they can before the plane levels off .
As the microgravity conditions ease , NASA personnel yell out , " Get down ! " and the students bring their bodies out of dangerous positions and closer to the ground before gravity itself puts them there .
They also have time for some fun , floating and spinning in microgravity or doing one - armed pushups in simulated lunar gravity only one - sixth the strength of Earth's .
" It 's the opportunity of a lifetime , " Niusma said .
Not everyone 's proposals get accepted , unfortunately .
Recent budget cuts have made the program , which used to accept about half of the applicants , more competitive .
Sean Currey , a junior at Dartmouth who wants to go into aeronautics , led a dedicated team that wanted to study how IV - fluid–bag preparation works in microgravity .
The team went through the entire process , but did n't get to fly .
Still , Currey 's team will try again this year .
" The people who read over the proposal thought it was a great idea , but they wanted more technical writing and background in the proposal , " Currey said .
" We 're going to take the comments that NASA gave us last year , and resubmit it . "

There may soon be a run on coconut futures .
Vintage 2002 Indonesian coconut - shell charcoal is being used to help build what may become the first commercially viable Tokamak fusion power electrical generating facility near Cadarache in the south of France – about 38 miles from the Mediterranean .
Tokamak ( from the Russian for “ toroidal chamber with magnetic coils ” ) is a type of magnetic confinement device for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion power .
The coconut charcoal is an environmental sponge that “ adsorbs ” the helium and hydrogen byproducts of the thermonuclear fusion reaction .
In what sounds like it could be the beginnings of a Star Trek - like Federation , the United States has joined the European Union , Japan , the Russian Federation , China , Korea , and India in negotiations for the establishment of the burning plasma prototype facility called ITER , which in Latin means " the way . "
The fusion power produced by ITER will be at least 10 times greater than the external power delivered to heat the plasma .
It ’s not quite a Starship warp drive , but it does harness the power of the sun .
ITER is expected to cost more than $ 10 billion .
Skeptics point out that ever since the idea of fusion power was first touted in the 1950s , fusion ’s promise of clean power has receded endlessly into the future .
Here ’s a short video on the promise of ITER :
The Tokamak building is the core of ITER , where fusion experiments are planned to start in 2018 .
The reinforced concrete structure will sit with 5 1/2 stories underground and nineteen stories above .
Adjacent to the main building , an assembly hall will be the location for pre-assembly of Tokamak components .
In ITER , the fusion reaction is achieved in Tokamak using magnetic fields to contain and control hot plasma .
The fuel –- a mixture of deuterium and tritium , both isotopes of hydrogen –- is heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million°C , forming helium and neutrons in addition to the hot plasma .
A helium nucleus carries an electric charge that responds to the magnetic fields of the Tokamak , and remains confined within the plasma .
Approximately 80 % of the energy produced is carried away from the plasma by neutrons — a neutron has no electrical charge and is unaffected by magnetic fields .
The neutrons are absorbed by the surrounding walls of the Tokamak , transferring their energy to the walls as heat .
This is where the coconuts come into the picture .
The coconuts will be used to generate a cooling vacuum essential to ITER ’s operation .
In the central chamber , some of this vacuum separates the plasma from the surrounding solid walls and allows fusion to proceed unhindered by air molecules .
The vacuum pumps suck air out of ITER and “ adsorb ” waste helium from the fusion reaction , along with other debris created when hot plasma smashes into the reactor wall .
" This can only be done with very large cryogenic pumps , " says Christian Day of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany .
The cryogenic pumps capture loose helium and hydrogen through a process that involves atoms of the gases sticking loosely to a solid surface — the greater the surface area , the better .
" We wanted a material that behaves like a sponge , with lots of internal surfaces , " Day adds .
After 20 years searching for the ideal adsorber –- including sintered metals and porous minerals called zeolites –- Day ’s team decided on charcoal .
And not just any charcoal .
" We found that coconut - shell charcoal is the best , " Day says .
" It is somehow strange that you need this very natural material to make a fusion device . "
Only one immediately available source does not cause global warming and that is nuclear energy , says Lovelock .
Thermonuclear fusion and coconuts – strange bedfellows .
But is fusion energy really " the way ? " as the name ITER suggests ?
Why bother to build a fusion reactor when there is an almost inexhaustible supply of energy from the sun ?
Why not spend the $ 10 billion ( or probably more ) on wind or solar power instead ?
A New Scientist editorial makes the case : " Compared with the more exotic schemes for large - scale manipulation of the environment now coming under serious consideration –- which do look 50 years away –- fusion power is a racing certainty .
It ’s safer too .
A technology that messes with our planet ’s climate is what got us into trouble in the first place . "
Ecologist James Lovelock –- concerned that humanity will shortly be facing a series of catastrophes from global warming –- might agree with this assessment .
“ By all means , let us use the small input from renewables sensibly , but only one immediately available source does not cause global warming and that is nuclear energy , ” says Lovelock .
Lovelock – famous for the “ Gaia hypothesis ” – refers to conventional nuclear fission power generation ( with all its attendant radioactive waste byproducts ) , but he is essentially making the case that humanity can’t afford to wait for “ more exotic ” technologies like solar and wind ( and possibly fusion ) to come online because he feels that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needs more immediate action .
This is n’t to say that both sun-based solar and man-made fusion ca n’t coexist to help meet the world ’s energy needs .
According to ITER , fusion power stations producing 1 - 2 GW should be feasible within ten years – much the same size as standard fossil fuel power stations .
Proposed space - based solar power from Solaren Corporation ( see the h+ article Space - based Solar is Coming ! ) offers the possibility of scaling up to the same 1 - 2 GW range by 2020 .
Nanosolar , another solar start - up company , is building a solar cell production facility projected to generate 430 MW annually .
It ’s good to know that there are options — and it ’s ironic that the world ’s 21st Century energy future could end up being a race between harnessing power from real and artificial suns .
With fossil fuels “ messing ” with our climate , as both Lovelock and New Scientist suggest , it seems we ’d best keep all our cards ( and coconuts ) on the table .
So here 's my exam question :
If all cricket matches were filmed , and if one had access to the infinite number of television channels on which all these matches were broadcast , would it be possible to watch cricket being played live , somewhere in the world , all the time ?
Sadly , even if the conditions existed for perpetual cricket - watching , we fans would have to take a break now and then : to sleep , or earn a living , or sometimes read a book .
Last week someone gave me one ( a book , I mean ) called We Need To Talk About Kelvin ( not Kevin , Kelvin - as in the temperature scale ) .
This book is published by Faber and written by American cosmologist Marcus Chown .
It is supposed to be about quantum theory , or " how familiar features of the world reveal profound truths about the ultimate nature of reality " .
Actually , it 's about cricket .
Unusually for an American , Chown knows a lot about spin , and explains it with great clarity .
" The spin of an electron behaves like a tiny compass needle , " he says .
" Actually , it behaves like a quantum compass needle .
Unlike a familiar compass needle , it cannot align itself in any direction whatsoever , but only in two possible directions : along the direction of the field or against it . "
That sounds like something Richie Benaud might have said .
He was equally profound on several occasions .
He once said , for instance , " His throw went absolutely nowhere near where it was going " .
See , it 's not only scientists who can master the art of the non-statement .
But back to spin .
There was a lot of talk , after the slow wrapping up of Shane Warne 's career , about the slow death of spin bowling .
Luckily for admirers of the art , it appears to be creeping back into fashion .
Being an American , Chown may not yet have noticed this .
He says , " It turns out that microscopic particles such as photons possess a quantum property called ' spin ' .
In common with irreducible randomness , it has no analogue whatsoever in the everyday world . "
Really ?
Tell that to Mushtaq Ahmed and Graeme Swann .
Or Donald Swann , for that matter , who knew a thing or two about elementary science .
He and cohort Michael Flanders famously explained the first law of thermodynamics in just seven words : " Heat is work and work is heat . "
Ever felt a cricket ball right after it 's flown from a spinner 's hand towards a distant bat ?
Nor have I , but I 'm sure it would be hot , because it 's been working .
Which reminds me of that famous cricketing quote by William Herbert , first Earl of Pembroke , born in 1501 .
There must have been a shortage of bowlers in Herbert 's time too , otherwise he would n't have ranted : " Out ye whores , to work , to work , ye whores , go spin ! "
But back to quantum theory .
" A photon has two possibilities open to it , says Chown .
" It can behave as if it is corkscrewing in a clockwise manner about its direction of motion at a particular spin rate ; or it can behave as if it is corkscrewing in an anticlockwise manner at the same rate . "
Does that mean , with the right measuring device , the tactics of Swann and other spinners , like the lovely Johan Botha , might become entirely predictable and therefore harmless ?
Thanks to irreducible randomness , and thankfully for the future of spin , it seems not .
" It is impossible to predict for certain which way the photon will be spinning , even in principle , " says Chown .
" All we can know is that there is a 50 percent chance that when we detect the photon , we will find it spinning clockwise , and a 50 percent chance we will find it spinning anticlockwise . "
Again I am reminded of Richie Benaud .
" That slow - motion replay does n't show how fast the ball was travelling , " he said .
Incidentally Chown 's previous book was called Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You .
Tell that to anyone facing an Anil Kumble delivery .
A condensed transcript of our conversation follows .
— John Meroney
You said earlier this month that you now wish you had supported Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries instead of Barack Obama .
You said that she would make a better president .
Well , I was in a thoughtful mood .
Do you really wish you had supported Mrs. Clinton ?
She would have been a wonderful president .
As for my support for Obama , remember that I was brought up in Washington .
It was an all - black city when I was a kid .
And I ’ve always been very pro-African - American – or whatever phrase we now use .
I was curious to see what would happen when their time came .
I was delighted when Obama appeared on the scene .
But now it seems as though our original objection to him – that experience mattered – was well - founded .
Barack Obama ’s books seemed to persuade many people to support him .
Have you read them ?
No .
Does one ever read a politician ’s books ?
Well , Obama actually wrote them himself .
I ’m sure he did .
He ’s highly educated – and rather better than a country like this deserves .
Put that in red letters .
The President is having some difficulty getting his health care program through .
Well , if I were he , I would just give up .
He should say to the country , “ The Republicans will not allow these things to come to a vote without a filibuster .
We ca n’t get anything through .
So , good luck .
Take two aspirin – and you ’ll all die of the next epidemic . ”
The death of Sen. Edward Kennedy prompted a flood of coverage about him and his career .
In 1969 , you said in an interview , “ By 1972 , Kennedy will be just another politician whom we have seen too much of , no doubt useful in the Senate but nothing more .
By 1976 , Camelot will not only be forgot but unrestorable , if for no other reason than that Arthur ’s heir will by then be – cruelest fate of all – unmistakably fat . ”
I should think that ’s rather well observed .
What is Ted Kennedy ’s real legacy ?
It ’s nothing .
But I predicted that at the beginning , when Jack started backing him for his U.S. Senate seat .
Historian Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , who was a loyal Kennedy courtier , agreed .
But Jack was funny about it .
He never took Arthur seriously .
He always called him “ the movie critic . ” ( Imitating JFK ’s accent )
“ What does ‘ the movie critic ’ have to say about this issue ? ”
He liked to tease Arthur .
What did Schlesinger say about Ted Kennedy ?
On his own , he went to Jack and said , “ It ’s in the papers that you ’re working behind the scenes to support Teddy .
You ca n’t do that .
You ’re making an awful lot of trouble for yourself .
You ’re going to be accused of nepotism and worse for backing a boy who is n’t considered first - rate . ”
Teddy had been caught cheating at Harvard – and all the things that Republicans like to write about .
I asked Arthur , “ What did Jack say to that ? ”
And he answered , ( imitating JFK ’s accent ) “ Teddy ’s not running against George Washington . ”
WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain on Friday pressed President Barack Obama to give a posthumous pardon to Jack Johnson , the black heavyweight boxing champion who was imprisoned nearly a century ago because of his romantic ties with a white woman .
Jack Johnson was convicted of transporting a woman across state lines for immoral purposes and served nearly a year in prison .

McCain , R - Ariz. , and Rep. Peter King , R - N.Y. , noted in a letter to Obama that both houses of Congress this summer passed their resolution urging a pardon .
After the vote , the lawmakers wrote to Obama in August asking him to issue the pardon .
" Regrettably , we have not received a response from you or any member of your administration , " they wrote in Friday 's letter , adding they hoped that Obama would be eager to " right this wrong and erase an act of racism that sent an American citizen to prison . "
The White House had no immediate comment .
Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion on Dec. 26 , 1908 -- 100 years before Obama was elected the first black president .
Johnson won the title after police in Australia stopped his 14 - round match against the severely battered Canadian world champion , Tommy Burns .
That led to a search for a " Great White Hope " who could beat Johnson .
Two years later , Jim Jeffries , the American world titleholder Johnson had tried for years to fight , came out of retirement but lost in a match called " The Battle of the Century , " resulting in deadly riots .
Johnson was convicted in 1913 of violating the Mann Act , which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for immoral purposes .
He fled the country after his conviction , but agreed years later to return and serve a 10 - month jail sentence .
One lesson from the Great Depression is that you should never underestimate the destructive power of bad ideas .
And some of the bad ideas that helped cause the Depression have , alas , proved all too durable : in modified form , they continue to influence economic debate today .
What ideas am I talking about ?
The economic historian Peter Temin has argued that a key cause of the Depression was what he calls the “ gold - standard mentality . ”
By this he means not just belief in the sacred importance of maintaining the gold value of one ’s currency , but a set of associated attitudes : obsessive fear of inflation even in the face of deflation ; opposition to easy credit , even when the economy desperately needs it , on the grounds that it would be somehow corrupting ; assertions that even if the government can create jobs it should n’t , because this would only be an “ artificial ” recovery .
In the early 1930s this mentality led governments to raise interest rates and slash spending , despite mass unemployment , in an attempt to defend their gold reserves .
And even when countries went off gold , the prevailing mentality made them reluctant to cut rates and create jobs .
But we ’re past all that now .
Or are we ?
America is n’t about to go back on the gold standard .
But a modern version of the gold standard mentality is nonetheless exerting a growing influence on our economic discourse .
And this new version of a bad old idea could undermine our chances for full recovery .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Liabilities at Japan Airlines
Corp would exceed its assets by as much as $ 8.8 billion if Asia ’s largest airline by revenues were liquidated , a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday .

The estimate of JAL ’s negative net worth , calculated by a government - led task force in charge of its restructuring , underscores the depth of the problems facing the airline as it seeks aid from banks and the state to avoid bankruptcy .
Shares of JAL , which are down more than 40 percent this year and hit a record low last week , slid 6.6 percent , extending losses after the Nikkei newspaper said some creditors wanted JAL to cut its capital to hold shareholders accountable .
The task force , which is led by turnaround specialists and reports to Transport Minister Seiji Maehara , is seeking a bridge loan of about 180 billion yen to prevent JAL from running out of cash next month and a total capital boost of 300 billion yen from both the government and the private sector , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ It ’s a ‘ national flag ’ kind of thing and allowing it to fail would damage trust in Japan , ” said Koichi Ogawa , chief portfolio manager Daiwa SB Investments .
“ It ’s even more symbolic than GM , and an airline is essential .
They ’ll inject public funds . ”
JAL is headed for its fourth annual loss in five years , weighed down by roughly $ 15 billion in debt and a bloated cost base that makes it less efficient than domestic rival All Nippon Airways Co .
Maehara told a news conference he met Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii earlier on Friday to discuss the state ’s role in supporting JAL , and that a final decision on the matter would fall to Hatoyama .
“ The reality is that 60 percent of the flights flying over Japan are JAL flights .
If the situation becomes such that these do n’t fly , then that would make things difficult .
We need to understand that , ” Hatoyama told reporters .
A JAL spokesman said : “ We have not decided anything .
We are crafting a revival plan from various viewpoints . ”
NEW SCHEME
The task force also wants to use a scheme recently introduced in Japan called “ Alternative Dispute Resolution ” under which a third party would mediate between JAL and its creditors on an out - of - court debt restructuring , according to the source .
But creditors , which include the country ’s top three lenders and the state - owned Development Bank of Japan , have so far rebuffed the plans presented by the task force , arguing they are being asked to carry too much of the burden to revive JAL .
The task force , which has asked creditors for 250 billion yen in loan waivers and debt - for equity swaps , needs to offer details on the use of public funds and map out a better plan to cut pension obligations and boost margins , bankers have said .
JAL ’s two likely options for a public fund injection would be to tap a revised law used earlier this year to prop up struggling chipmaker Elpida Memory or a government - backed corporate turnaround organization established this month to buy the debt of and invest in struggling but viable firms .
Some creditors have suggested that JAL be forced to reduce its capital to clarify the responsibility of shareholders .
One idea being floated is for JAL retire about 99 percent of its common shares but remain listed , the Nikkei newspaper said .
“ There are problems from the perspectives of the viability of the restructuring plan and the fairness of who shoulders the burden , ” a banker involved in the discussions told Reuters .
The task force ’s plan also includes JAL halving the number of subsidiaries and affiliates from 290 and about 8,000 job cuts , almost a fifth of its work force , the source said .
The negative net worth figure of 800 billion yen is significantly higher than a 600 billion yen estimate reported by the Nikkei this week and the 250 billion yen assumed by Citigroup Global Markets Japan in evaluating JAL ’s shares .
Citigroup halved its target price on JAL to 80 yen on Thursday .
It rates the stock “ sell / high risk . ”
“ It is not certain whether JAL will go through a private reorganization or file for bankruptcy , but even if it stays clear of bankruptcy , we think value for existing shareholders will be substantially reduced on dilution accompanying a big capital increase , ” analyst Naoko Matsumoto wrote in a note to clients .
The task force believes its restructuring plan would allow JAL to cut its negative net worth to 270 billion yen and enable creditors to collect on 20 - 30 percent of their loans , as opposed to just 2 to 3 percent in a bankruptcy , the source said .
Despite its woes , JAL ’s extensive network in Asia and access to the Chinese market has made it attractive to U.S. airlines .
JAL , a member of the Oneworld airline alliance , has held separate talks about business ties and possible capital injection with AMR Corp ’s American Airlines , its alliance partner , and Delta Air Lines of the rival SkyTeam group .
AMR Chairman Gerard Arpey and other American Airlines executives met with JAL executives in Tokyo last week to continue discussions about bolstering their ties , a person with knowledge of the meeting said .

Last month , Xeni blogged about the photoshop disaster that is this Ralph Lauren advertisement , in which a model 's proportions appear to have been altered to give her an impossibly skinny body ( " Dude , her head 's bigger than her pelvis " ) .
Naturally , Xeni reproduced the ad in question .
This is classic fair use : a reproduction " for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , " etc .
However , Ralph Lauren 's marketing arm and its law firm do n't see it that way .
According to them , this is an " infringing image , " and they thoughtfully took the time to send a DMCA takedown notice to our awesome ISP , Canada 's Priority Colo .
One of the things that makes Priority Colo so awesome is that they do n't automatically act on DMCA takedowns .
Instead , they pass them on to us and we talk about whether they pass the giggle - test .
This one does n't .
So , instead of responding to their legal threat by suppressing our criticism of their marketing images , we 're gonna mock them .
Hence this post .
As Wendy Seltzer from the Chilling Effects project said , " Sounds like a pretty solid fair use case to me .
If criticism diminishes its effectiveness , that 's different from the market substitution copyright protects against .
And I 've rarely seen a thinner DMCA
form - letter . "
So , to Ralph Lauren , GreenbergTraurig , and PRL Holdings , Inc : sue and be damned .
Copyright law does n't give you the right to threaten your critics for pointing out the problems with your offerings .
You should know better .
And every time you threaten to sue us over stuff like this , we will :
a) Reproduce the original criticism , making damned sure that all our readers get a good , long look at it , and ;
b ) Publish your spurious legal threat along with copious mockery , so that it becomes highly ranked in search engines where other people you threaten can find it and take heart ; and
c ) Offer nourishing soup and sandwiches to your models .
Update : Looks like Photoshop Disaster 's ISP caved to a similar notice .

In this article , I provide an explanation of Ajax with a historical introduction and WITHOUT the use of any frameworks such as jQuery .
If you are eager to start seeing the code , please scroll down .
What is Ajax ?
Ajax stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML .
It ’s a way to call back - end scripts asynchronously – that is , without impacting user experience / flow .
Basically , you do n’t even see the cursor become an hourglass or whatever other “ waiting / processing ” icon your system uses .
It ’s not a language , but a technique .
As for back - end scripts , you can use whatever you feel more comfortable with : PHP , Perl , Java , JSP , Shell , C , etc .
The way to choose which technology to use as back - end is outside the scope of this article .
Historical approach for calling back - end apps
Throughout web - development history , the very first way used to achieve back - end processing followed by front - end display was to create a form and set the back - end script as the action to that form .
Upon submission , the form fields would be sent to the back - end script as a series of special environment variables , which would then be handled by the programmed logic .
The back - end output would be displayed on the screen ( either the same page / frame or a different page / frame , depending on the target attribute of the form ) .
The catch 22 of this approach is that if you want to present another form after processing , that form must be produced by the back - end script , which leads to maintenance mayhem – to add or remove a field , you have to do so in both the original HTML and in the HTML of the back - end script .
Hidden IFRAMES and Javascript to the rescue
The natural evolution of the regular form submission was to avoid having to generate HTML from the back - end script .
A technique that I eventually came up with ( had never seen it before , but it was probably already out there ) prior to adhering to Ajax was using a hidden IFRAME as target to a simple form containing an action_cd field and a data field .
There would not be a regular submit button , but a set of input elements with onclick or onchange events and a regular ( non-submit ) button at the end .
In this approach , Javascript did all the work – when the user clicked the pseudo - submit button , an onclick event would read all the input fields and join them like a regular HTTP query ( field1=val1&field2=val2 … ) .
The action_cd value would be dynamically evaluated and the back - end script would receive the data string and action code and process it .
Javascript would perform the submission when , say , a value of a drop - down field was selected , and the output would be a series of dynamically generated Javascript commands inside the IFRAME .
Those commands would manipulate the user ’s form ( e.g. Auto - populate a “ state ” drop - down after selecting a “ country ” value ) .
Although this approach successfully handled the no-longer - need to submit and reload a form , it still had 2 main downsides : generating and maintaining Javascript code is not a simple task ( especially due to having to escape quotes ) , and the whole procedure was still synchronous – you could see the hourglass , browser process bars , clicking sounds ( IE ) , etc .
It ’s much better user experience , but still not the real deal , seamless / transparent back - end processing .
The XmlHttpRequest object
Javascript back - end calls are made possible thanks to the XmlHttpRequest object that most modern browsers now support .
For IE 6 and older , it is done through an ActiveXObject .
Javascript code to initialize Ajax object
var xmlHttp ; // global variable .
It ’s important for later on function GetXmlHttpObject ( ) { if ( window.XMLHttpRequest ) { // code for IE7 + , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari return new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; } if ( window.ActiveXObject ) { // code for IE6 , IE5 return new ActiveXObject ( " Microsoft.XMLHTTP " ) ; } return null ; }
It ’s important to have a global variable in which to assign the XMLHttpRequest object , since this technique has its shortcomings when dealing with passing variables around .
We ’ll understand that better shortly .
The function checks for the existence of window .
XMLHttpRequest which is used in IE7 ( finally , it complies to standards ! ) , Firefox , and other non IE browsers , and checks for window .
ActiveXObject existence for IE6 and 5 .
I ’m not sure if this works on IE4 – it probably does not , but hopefully IE4 is already in extinction .
If neither checks work , it returns null , which will be handled in the function calling the XMLHttpObject .
Making Synchronous
Ajax calls ( GET method )
Although the hype of Ajax is due to the “ Asynchronosity ” of the technique , it is also capable of making synchronous calls .
Synchronous calls are important in cases where you do n’t want to allow the user to do something while the back - end is checking a previous action , but also do n’t want to have to submit the whole form .
function synch_call ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var url =
“ /url/to/your/backend/script?with=var1&and=var2 ” ; // Synchronous call xmlHttp.open ( " GET " , url , false ) ; // " false " means asynchronous = false xmlHttp.send ( null ) ; // the code above does the back - end call .
Now we handle the response // this function continues further down in the tutorial }
Ajax calls can be done using GET or POST methods .
I recommend GET methods for small queries , POST for large ones .
There used to be a limit of 255 characters on URL fields – not sure if a ) this is still true ; b ) this could apply to these Ajax techniques .
The call to the back - end is done by 2 commands : xmlHttp.open ( Method , url , async ) , and the xmlHttp.send ( null ) calls .
For POST method , this is a little different , so we ’ll stick to GET calls for the time being .
Handling back - end reply
Asynchronous Javascript
And XML is n’t the perfect name for Ajax .
It should be more like AjaR , where R stands for Reply .
The reason is because the reply can be either an XML structure or a plain text .
We use xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement if we ’re handling XML , or a plain xmlHttp.responseText for plain text .
Actually , we can use the latter for XML as well , especially when debugging the code ( when you want to pop up the XML reply ) .
We use a try / catch block to capture any errors :
function synch_call ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var url =
“ /url/to/your/backend/script?with=var1&and=var2 ” ; // Synchronous call xmlHttp.open ( " GET " , url , false ) ; // “ false ” means asynchronous = false xmlHttp.send ( null ) ; // the code above does the back - end call .
Now we handle the response try { alert ( " Ajax Response : n"+xmlHttp.responseText ) ; // Just pop - up the reply return false ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; // if error , show it as a pop - up return false ; } }
To handle the reply as XML , you need to a ) make sure your back - end script outputs an XML structure , and b ) , replace xmlHttp.reponseText for xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement .
// Just the try / catch block changed try { data = xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; return false ; }
The data variable now holds a DOM object of the XML structure .
To access its elements , we use DOM functions .
Example XML structure :
< OUT > < STATUS > Success</STATUS > < MSG type=" some_type " >
This is a test message </ MSG > </ OUT >
Accessing Example XML through DOM :
// gets the Success text var msg_status = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ STATUS ’) [ 0].childNodes[0].nodeValue ; // Assign MSG object to msg variable var msg = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ MSG ’ ) [ 0 ] ; // gets the attribute “ type ” var msg_type = msg.getAttribute(‘ type ’ ) ; // gets the text inside the MSG node var msg_text = msg.childNodes[0].nodeValue ;
Putting it all together
function synch_call ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var url =
“ /url/to/your/backend/script?with=var1&and=var2 ” ; // Synchronous call xmlHttp.open ( " GET " , url , false ) ; // " false " means asynchronous = false xmlHttp.send ( null ) ; // the code above does the back - end call .
Now we handle the response try { data = xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; return false ; } // gets the Success text var msg_status = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ STATUS ’) [ 0].childNodes[0].nodeValue ; // Assign MSG object to msg variable var msg = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ MSG ’ ) [ 0 ] ; // gets the attribute “ type ” var msg_type = msg.getAttribute(‘ type ’ ) ; // gets the text inside the MSG node var msg_text = msg.childNodes[0].nodeValue ; alert ( " Got the following backend reply : " + msg_status + " n " + msg + " n " + msg_type + " n " + msg_text ) ; return true ; }
Making Asynchronous
Ajax calls ( GET method )
We saw on page 2 that what controls synchronicity of the Ajax call is the true / false value in the open ( ) command .
However , we also need changes in the way we handle the reply .
We do that by setting onreadystatechange property on the xmlHttp object .
OnReadyStateChange should be a function that will check the readyState attribute of the xmlHttp object .
Understanding readyState
readyStates are the way Javascript controls what stage of the process the call is in .
It ranges from 0 to 4 , where 4 is the completed reply from the back - end script .
We normally only care about readyState == 4 .
Here are the codes and meaning :
Value State 0 Uninitialized 1 Loading 2 Loaded 3 Interactive 4 Complete
Setting onreadystatechange
onreadystatechange can be assigned a anonymous function ( ) { } block , or a named function .
Just be careful with function parameters – to this day , I have not been able to pass any parameters to the functions set to onreadystatechange .
Hence the need for some global variables in play .
Let ’s copy over our sync_call ( ) function and make it Async_call ( )
function Asynch_call ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var url =
“ /url/to/your/backend/script?with=var1&and=var2 ” ; // onreadystatechange must be set BEFORE making the call // it takes the response handling code that we had in the sync_call ( ) previously xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xmlHttp.readyState == 4 ) { // Complete //
Now we handle the response within the onreadystatechange try { data = xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; return false ; } // gets the Success text var msg_status = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ STATUS ’) [ 0].childNodes[0].nodeValue ; // Assign MSG object to msg variable var msg = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ MSG ’ ) [ 0 ] ; // gets the attribute " type " var msg_type = msg.getAttribute(' type ' ) ; // gets the text inside the MSG node var msg_text = msg.childNodes[0].nodeValue ; alert ( " Got the following backend reply : " + msg_status + " n " + msg + " n " + msg_type +
" n " + msg_text ) ; return true ; } } ; // do n’t forget the ' ;' at the end of the function ( ) {} block !! // Asynchronous call xmlHttp.open ( " GET " , url , true ) ; // ' true ' means asynchronous = true xmlHttp.send ( null ) ; }
As mentioned before , you can separate the anonymous function assignment into a named function .
The good side of this is that your functions get more manageable , but the downside is that you might need global variables in order to share values between the main function and the onreadystatechange , / code > function .
function Asynch_call ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var url =
“ /url/to/your/backend/script?with=var1&and=var2 ” ; // onreadystatechange must be set BEFORE making the call // it takes the response handling code that we had in the sync_call previously xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerfunction ; //
See separate function below // Asynchronous call xmlHttp.open ( " GET " , url , true ) ; // “ true ” means asynchronous = true xmlHttp.send ( null ) ; } function handlerfunction ( ) { if ( xmlHttp.readyState == 4 ) { //
Complete – must be global xmlHttp variable //
Now we handle the response within the onreadystatechange try { data = xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; return false ; } // gets the Success text var msg_status = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ STATUS ’) [ 0].childNodes[0].nodeValue ; // Assign MSG object to msg variable var msg = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ MSG ’ ) [ 0 ] ; // gets the attribute “ type ” var msg_type = msg.getAttribute(‘ type ’ ) ; // gets the text inside the MSG node var msg_text = msg.childNodes[0].nodeValue ; alert ( " Got the following back - end reply : " + msg_status + " n " + msg + " n " + msg_type + " n " + msg_text ) ; return true ; } }
Parsing forms to create the GET / POST strings
Since we are not submitting the form with the usual submit button , we have to handle building the queries ourselves .
I came up with a function that mimics the way browsers handle function calls .
function build_post_string ( frm ) { var str ; var poststr_array = [ ] ; if (! frm.id ) { // assume it 's a string .
get the form object frm = document.getElementById( frm ) ; } for ( i=0;i< frm.elements.length ;i++ ) { var elem = frm.elements ; if ( !elem.id ) { // skip any fields that do n't have IDs continue ; } if ( elem.type == ' radio ' || elem.type == ' checkbox ' ) { // only grab radio buttons and checkboxes that are checked if ( !elem.checked ) { continue ; } } // get select values if ( elem.nodeName.match(/SELECT/i ) && elem.multiple ) { var sel_array = [ ] ; for ( var o=0;o< elem.options.length ;o++ ) { if ( elem.options [o] . selected ) { sel_array [ sel_array.length ] = elem.id+" =" +elem.options[o].value ; } } var sel_str = sel_array.join ( '&' ) ; // build key / value pairs for SELECTs poststr_array[ poststr_array.length ] = sel_str ; } else if ( elem.nodeName.match(/SELECT/i ) ) { poststr_array[ poststr_array.length ] = elem.id+'='+elem.options[elem.selectedIndex].value ; } else { // build key / value pairs for everything else poststr_array [ poststr_array.length ] = elem.id+ " =" +elem.value ; } } // build and return str str = poststr_array .
join ( " & " ) ; return str ; }
This function takes a given form by ID and iterates through all of its elements .
It is important that all fields you want in the query have an ID attribute .
Otherwise they will be skipped .
The return from this function can be used for both GET and POST requests .
Using POST method for Ajax calls
So far we saw that making GET calls is pretty straight - forward .
POST calls are different in the way that they are not put in the HTTP Header , but rather in a separate packet .
In order to do that , we need to set a few header variables :
function Asynch_call_with_post ( ) { // initialize Ajax object var xmlHttp = GetXmlHttpObject ( ) ; //
Set the URL to your backend script with query vars var post_str = build_post_string (‘ my_form ’ ) ; var url = “ /url/to/your / backend / script ? ” + post_str ; // onreadystatechange must be set BEFORE making the call // it takes the response handling code that we had in the sync_call previously xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xmlHttp.readyState == 4 ) { // Complete //
Now we handle the response within the onreadystatechange try { data = xmlHttp.responseXML.documentElement ; } catch (e ) { alert(e ) ; return false ; } // gets the Success text var msg_status = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ STATUS ’) [ 0].childNodes[0].nodeValue ; // Assign MSG object to msg variable var msg = data.getElementsByTagName(‘ MSG ’ ) [ 0 ] ; // gets the attribute “ type ” var msg_type = msg.getAttribute(‘ type ’ ) ; // gets the text inside the MSG node var msg_text = msg.childNodes[0].nodeValue ; alert ( " Got the following backend reply : " + msg_status + " n " + msg + " n " + msg_type + " n " + msg_text ) ; return true ; } } ; // do n't forget the ' ;' at the end of the function ( ) {} block // Asynchronous call xmlHttp.open ( ' POST ', url , true ) ; // Replace " GET " with " POST " // Set headers xmlHttp.setRequestHeader( " Content - type " , " application/x-www-form-urlencoded " ) ; xmlHttp.setRequestHeader( " Content- length " , url.length ) ; xmlHttp.setRequestHeader( " Connection " , " close " ) ; //
Send the packet .
Note that it ’s no longer null as parameter to send xmlHttp.send ( url ) ; }
Showing / Hiding “ Processing … ” messages
Since Ajax in Asynchronous mode is 100 % transparent to the user , it is necessary to handle our own messages asking the user to wait until processing finishes .
The simplest way to do this is by using a DIV element with initial display property set as none , or visibility set as hidden ( the difference is that visibility = " hidden " makes the element still occupy its space in the page , whereas display = " none " effectively removes the element from the page and the space that it occupied ) .
Typically , I include code to show the element in the Ajax function , and code to hide it again in the onreadystatechange function ( where ready State == 4 ) .
document.getElementById(‘wait_image’) .display = ‘ block ’ ; document.getElementById(‘wait_image ’) . display = ‘ none ’ ;
Third - Party AJAX Libraries
There are several Ajax in a box libraries out there , and for a time I was not comfortable with using them for company applications .
The reason being is that Ajax is very powerful and can very well make calls to the maintainer ’s website to steal / capture sensitive information .
However , I ’ve since given into using j Query through jQuery. post ( ) or jQuery.ajax ( ) methods which really come in handy .
Testing the back - end script
There are 2 simple ways of testing the back - end script .
With PHP , you can access both GET and POST variables through the $ _REQUEST array .
Perl CGI does n’t really care if it ’s GET or POST .
I do n’t know how JSP can handle it .
With this being said , I simply have the Ajax alert the URL variable and return false .
I then copy the URL variable and paste it in another window to see the output .
I strongly recommend debugging with Firefox – it has a handy error console and also parses the output XML or complains if it ’s not built right .
Keeping IE from crashing with the XMLs
I ’m pretty sure that Microsoft IE developers have some satisfaction in making web developers go crazy .
That ’s how I felt when I started working with XML and Ajax , and although my app was working fine in Firefox , it kept crashing bad in IE .
After some googling , I found out that I needed to set some headers in order to keep IE from blowing up .
I already had the " Content - type : text / xml " header in place , but it appears that IE needs some caching control and expiry headers as well .
This is what I use in PHP :
header ( " Expires : Fri , 09 Jan 1981 05:00:00 GMT " ) ; header ( " Cache - Control : no - store , no - cache , must - revalidate " ) ; header ( " Cache - Control : post - check=0 , pre-check=0 " , FALSE ) ; // FALSE means add this Cache - Control line instead of replacing the previous one header ( " Pragma : no- cache " ) ; header ( " Content - type : text / xml " ) ;
In Perl , setting headers is simple : just print them before printing any content .
When you ’re done printing all your headers , print an empty newline to indicate where the page content will go .

The Palestinian envoy in Geneva , Ibrahim Khraisha , told his Israeli counterpart Aharon Leshno Yaar that the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) plans to announce that it will be withdrawing its support for the adoption of the Goldstone Report during the UN Human Rights Council 's vote on Friday .
Operation Cast Lead Goldstone defends Gaza war crimes report Associated Press UN investigator rejects criticism that report which accused Israel , Hamas of war crimes during Operation Cast Lead was politically motivated .
' Culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , ' he tells Human Rights Council Goldstone defends Gaza war crimes report
The report accuses Israel and Hamas of war crimes during their conflict in Gaza in January , an allegation Israel condemns and claims is the result of bias against the Jewish state .
Leshno Yaar , who spoke with the Palestinian envoy Thursday evening , said the development proves Israel 's strategy to declare that the adoption of the report may hinder the peace process was correct .
Following his recent meeting with US President Barack Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in New York , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the adoption of the Goldstone Report by the UN would prevent Israel from taking any risks within the framework of the peace process , as the report would limit the Jewish state 's ability to defend itself .
Netanyahu and other Israeli ministers said adopting the report would also hurt the democratic regime 's war on terror .
Israel and the US have called on the PA to withdraw its support for the report .
Leshno Yaar told Ynet that Netanyahu 's remarks contributed to the PA 's decision , as have Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman 's diplomatic efforts to " undermine this political report . "
Earlier Thursday , Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon told foreign ambassadors in Israel that approving the report will render the Human Rights Council a ' terror rights council . '
Richard J. Goldstone , the South African judge who led the inquiry into Operation Cast Lead rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that the report would compromise the Middle East peace process .
" I think he got wrong what our report is all about .
He talked about Israel 's right to self - defense .
That is not what the report was about , " Goldstone told reporters in Washington Thursday .

The older I get and the more I work on growing my online empire , the more I realize that there is a direct correlation between frame of mind and success .
If you act like The Man , you will be .
If you do n’t , well , let ’s not go there .
One of the most important things you can do to make sure you ’re in the right frame of mind for success is to focus on what you have and what you ’ve accomplished instead of what you do n’t have or what you have yet to accomplish .
The moment I started focusing on the positives of my current state – while still keeping true to my long term goals – is when everything turned around for me and I started making my biggest gains , both in terms of my business and my life in general .
When I first started my online business I really had no idea where it would take me .
It was just something fun to do in my spare time .
If I made money from it that would be great , if I did n’t , I was still being productive and doing things I thought were fun , like writing and website creation .
Unfortunately , as my business started doing better and I started making more money my focus and mind set began to shift .
Working on my business was no longer something I did just for fun ; I started to do it solely to make as much money as possible .
At first , when money started coming in , it was easy to justify this new mind set .
After all , this was what I wanted , right ?
Waking up and seeing my Adsense account grow every day , or seeing that I made three more sales on Clickbank was what got me going in the morning and drove me throughout the day .
But when the growth leveled off and I was n’t seeing more gains , I started freaking out and focusing on what I was n’t getting , which was more traffic , sales , or money .
Then it just sort of snowballed and I started focusing on what I did n’t have — hundreds of thousands of dollars in my bank account , a big house and a 7 series BMW — than what I did have .
This made me feel frustrated , tired and burned out .
Doing something I had previously loved – writing and developing websites – became something I loathed .
In short , I felt like a failure .
After finally reaching the breaking point and nearly deciding to delete all of my sites , I decided to take a couple of days off and get my head straight .
After thinking things through it finally dawned on me : in order for me to be successful I had to completely change my frame of mind .
I had to appreciate what I had accomplished thus far .
After all , how many people talk about starting a business yet never follow through on it ?
Plenty !
So that put me ahead of the game right there !
Simply attempting to grow a successful business was a huge accomplishment in and of itself .
While my business was still small and not generating “ yacht club ” money , it was still my business and was generating enough money that it would help me achieve my modest goals of paying off my mortgage and being able to do nice things for the people I care about .
By realizing I should be proud of what I ’d accomplished so far and be grateful for everything that I had and all the help I had received along I was able to turn a corner and get back to growing my business .
Writing and website creation became fun again .
I stopped worrying about money , traffic and sales and just started focusing on being good at what I was doing .
Not coincidentally , my revenue started growing again , too !
I promise that if you stop focusing on what you do n’t have and start focusing on what you do have and all the great things going on in your life , you ’re going to set yourself up to be an incredible success , not just in business but in life too .
There are many parents throughout the world that are concerned about some of the ideas their children learn in school .
In the past few days I have heard different examples of parents that do n't want their kids learning about certain topics .
For example , parents in Gaza do n't want their children to learn about the Holocaust .
The fact is that it was a major event in modern world history and it's the reason that millions of people from all corners of the world are dead .
Granted , parents are responsible for their children and have the right to question what their children are learning in schools .
After all , parents are the most influential people in their children 's life and it's important that they are involved with their children 's education .
However , sometimes I think parents are worried about what their children might learn in school because it is different from the beliefs that they hold .
So where is the balance ?
Should parents be able to determine what the lesson plan is in schools ?
Even though there were 6 million Jews killed in the holocaust and thousands of civilians died , parents in Gaza do n't want the information about the Nazi genocide being introduced into curriculum in U.N. schools .
This displays a major barrier between Jews and Arabs .
Jews see this inaction by Arabs as a denial of Israel 's right to exist , while Arabs see the Holocaust as an excuse for Israel 's creation .
This is controversial and I can see both sides of the argument , but children need to learn what is and has been going on in the world .
Finding the right balance is also a hot topic in the United States as well .
Parents were upset about President Obama 's speech to students .
I guess a major factor is how old the student is , older students are less likely to buy into ideas as younger children .
Parents were especially worried about what the pamphlets would say and what kind of an influence they would have on their young children .
School districts in this event did the proper thing by notifying parents about the speech and what would be going on .
They also allowed parents to check their children out of school or to keep them home for the day .
I think what much of this boils down to is that parents need to allow their children to learn about different topics in school but then discuss them at home .
Education is supposed to be where individuals learn about general knowledge , and develop reasoning and judgment , in order to prepare for life .
Students need to be learning about important events and different theories so that they can make educated decisions .
They do n't need to believe everything that they hear , but at least they will understand different theories , perspectives , and aspects of our history .
Some of the lessons students learn from a well rounded education , can help students understand one another and therefore find a peaceful solution that can improve everyone 's life .
History cannot be repeated if it is remembered .

Well , what do you know ?
After a few months spent watching every Republican imaginable verbally thrashing the Speaker of the House for stating that the CIA had misled Congress , it seems that she was right .
We find that the CIA DID mislead Congress by order of former Vice President Dick Cheney .
Hello out there in GOP - Land — Speaker Pelosi was absolutely correct , and I do n’t believe I ’ve heard any apologies !
In fact Republican Senator Cornyn of Texas actually had the temerity to ascribe suspicious motives to the timing of Leon Panetta ’s statement .
Pete Yost of the Associated Press quoted him as saying that it : “ looks to me suspiciously like an attempt to provide political cover ” to Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats .
After more and more hideous revelations about the covert , illegal and immoral actions of the Bush administration , why is there a woman in the cross -hairs ?
Advertisements
American women have spoken for decades and seemingly in a vacuum about the difficulty of overcoming sexism in our political theater .
The barracuda - like feeding frenzy that is still occurring around Ms. Pelosi and her comments regarding the saintly brotherhood of the CIA is certainly a case in point .
The sanctimonious outrage that flared up around Madame Speaker was hot enough to light the kindling underneath the stake she ’d been tied to .
As we have been told , during this sort of CIA briefing Ms. Pelosi could neither take notes nor discuss anything that was said with anyone .
Yet it seems unlikely to certain Republicans that she could have forgotten details under such circumstances .
The supposed briefings about waterboarding took place years ago .
Let ’s say for the sake of argument that at some point somebody did mention something about “ enhanced techniques ” to her during one of those meetings where notes were n’t allowed .
How does that make her complicit ?
I think it implausible that before actually seeing the horrendous visuals of Abu Ghraib Nancy Pelosi had any idea what really occurred in those wretched places : hearing words about “ techniques ” does n’t conjure up visions of bruised , naked bodies in a degraded heap .
But let us say for the sake of the fair and the balanced that Ms. Pelosi has been guilty of mis-representing the date she found out these things occurred — my God , what is that compared to the actions of Dick Cheney while in office ?
Where is the outrage against Cheney or former President Bush for bringing this country to the brink of ruin ?
For involving us in bank - breaking , soul destroying , endless wars because they wanted to ???
For torturing in our name in order to get the information they wanted to justify a war they had already waged ?
For continuing to justify torture ?
These guys are our “ Masters of War ” but they never get the bilious , nasty level of contempt reserved for women , either with power or without .
I think for some reason of Deborah Jean Palfrey , the “ DC Madam ” who hung herself rather than face jail time …
To finish the example of Nancy Pelosi , somehow , in the tortured logic of the GOP ( and before the breaking news that Vice President ordered the CIA to mislead Congress – ! ) , all the crimes of Bush - Co are as nothing compared to the possible perfidy of Pelosi .
What incredible nonsense .
The level of virulence is puzzling , and I must say I did n’t at first consider sexism as a core reason for the viciousness of these attacks .
But then I remembered Hillary Clinton and the way every anchorman in the States ( including most of the guys at relatively liberal MSNBC ) laughed at her voice and even her freaking pantsuits .
How people tried to trivialize that formidable woman !
In the words of Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls : “… you saw it with Hillary ’s campaign .
She either was n’t womanly enough or too much of a woman .
Sexism still rules all .
We do n’t like to admit that . ”
I woke up and started noticing the tone of the running commentary in the media on public , political women .
Ladies , there is a fire in the House !
And the Senate and the Judiciary and the Executive Branch as well !
Up to today and forevermore in the American news cycle was Sarah Palin , another woman politician who must be mentioned , because she was brought down ( err , thank the gods ) in a particularly brutal fashion .
Although I consider Ms. Palin unfit for public office , there is something about the way she has been targeted that happens primarily to women .
She has compared the way that she was treated to Hillary Clinton , and I understand her point .
I do not think a comparison between the two women in terms of gravitas is relevant when it comes to sexism , which hurts women of all political persuasions .
While researching this piece I ran across a blog by Wesleyan Assistant Professor of Government , Elvin Lims .
He too was troubled by the what he termed the “ feeding frenzy ” around Governor Palin , and made some interesting comparisons between Ms. Clinton and Ms. Palin .
When quoting Mr. Lims
I realized I had already used the term “ feeding frenzy ” relative to Ms. Pelosi earlier .
I chose to mention this and let it remain , as it speaks to the kind of negative energy vortex in which women in public life often find themselves .
Next for your consideration is the exhausted , beleaguered and kind face of Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
Soon - to - be - Justice of the Supreme Court Sotomayor .
This woman , to quote Senator Patrick Leahy , with “ more federal court judicial experience than any nominee to the United States Supreme Court in nearly 100 years ” has been on the receiving end of graceless , futile bullying by a bunch of older white gentlemen who should know better !
To hear Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , a fellow known in his past to make racist comments lecture Judge Sotomayor on racism would have been laughable had I not been busy with nausea .
For months now , even though they knew that it was almost inevitable that she would be confirmed , the cacophony from the conservative members of Congress has been repetitive , mindless , shrill , rude and graceless .
Despite her extraordinary record and her grace under ceaseless fire , they could n’t stop themselves from a continual process of humiliating , abusive and hypocritical rhetoric .
As I watched her today , my empathy levels surging , I could n’t help but think “ when will the beating stop ? ”
She has the look of someone who has been greatly suffering of late , and I think if she ’d been male , even a male Democrat , the steady thumping on bruised flesh would have stopped long ago .
Look how gently that same clique of privileged white men has treated Senator Ensign and Governor Sanford , to name but two Republicans in the scandal spotlight lately .
These men have had the veritable milk of human kindness showered upon them by their fellows , and not because they deserve it .
I really , truly do n’t understand !
Why do hard - working , relatively virtuous women such as Pelosi , Clinton and Sotomayor get the sh*t kicked out of them when mendacious hypocrites like these guys get a pass ?
To really regard the level of animosity directed at these women is to see , to comprehend a virulent strain of a particularly American sexism that is ignored because it is commonplace .
Like racism and the other ‘ isms , it ’s just always been that way .
But really now , this does n’t have to continue .
Does it ?

New Senate bill introduced to eliminate crack / powder federal sentencing disparity
The Senate 's second - ranking Democrat introduced a bill Thursday that would eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine , an issue that has frustrated judges , civil rights advocates and drug reform proponents for more than two decades .
Under current law , it takes 100 times more powdered cocaine than crack to trigger the same mandatory minimum sentence .
Activists say that disparity disproportionately impacts African Americans .
" The sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine has contributed to the imprisonment of African Americans at six times the rate of whites and to the United States ' position as the world 's leader in incarcerations , " Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said in a statement .
" It 's time for us to act . "
Durbin 's bill would also increase the volume of crack cocaine required to trigger a mandatory prison term , as well as stiffen penalties for large - scale drug traffickers and violent criminals .
The Fair Sentencing
Act is co-sponsored by Democrats including Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy ( Vt. ) , Russell Feingold ( Wis. ) , Benjamin L. Cardin ( Md. ) and Sheldon Whitehouse ( R.I. ) ....
Some law enforcement officials have advocated eliminating the disparity by increasing the penalties for possession of powder cocaine , rather than , as Durbin 's bill does , lowering the sentence for crack .
But those calling for a change in the law also cite economic reasons at a time when budgets are tight , noting that half of federal inmates are imprisoned for drug offenses .
The U.S. Sentencing Commission has estimated that wiping away the sentencing disparity could save more than $ 510 million over 15 years , lawmakers said ....
A companion bill in the House has passed the House Judiciary Committee and awaits action in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
The idea won support from President Obama and Vice President Biden on the campaign trail , and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has also been supportive , but the administration has yet to announce a formal position on the bills before Congress .
As detailed in this new Washington Post article , which is headlined " Senate Bill Would Eliminate Cocaine Sentencing Disparity , " Senator Richard Durbin is championing a new bill to eliminate the crack / powder sentencing disparity in federal law .
Here are some of the basics :
I am pleased to hear this news , but I will not start getting too excited about this bill unless and until some some Republican Senators get behind it or until at least the White House and the Attorney General start expressing support .
In other words , I fear it is going to take a lot more than the usual political suspects to turn these kinds of ( long - overdue ) proposed reforms into a legal reality .

It would be nice if WaPo 's coverage could note the disproportionate victimization caused by these criminals and what demographics would likely suffer with increased lenience .
As for cost savings , you 'd also have to factor in the increased costs of the crimes committed by these people who , absent the change in the law , would not be incarcerated .
I 'm betting that a good chunk of that half a Bill would be lost .

Dr. Phil is being sued by a woman who claims the TV shrink held her captive inside his production offices , forced her to stare at a naked man -- and then grabbed her left breast .
According to the suit , filed today in L.A. County Superior Court , a woman named Shirley Dieu claims she went to Phil to seek therapy in 2007 -- but instead she claims the doc tried to " brainwash " her and force her to endure all sorts of physical and emotional abuse .
In the docs , Shirley claims Phil forced her to " be in the same room with a completely naked live man while he exposed his entire naked body , genitals and all . "
Shirley alleges she tried to escape the building , but " was blocked by the staff to prevent her from leaving . "
In the docs , Shirley also claims Phil " touched her left breast during her therapy session . "
Shirley also claims
Phil lied to her about being a " real " doctor -- alleging that the TV shrink " is not licensed to practice in the state of California . "
Shirley does n't specify how much money she wants from Phil -- but we 're assuming it 's an insane figure .
The last lawsuit that Dr. Phil was slapped with was just weeks earlier -- five " Dr. Phil " fans sued the very show they once loved -- after a road trip to catch a taping of the program allegedly turned into the worst experience of their lives .
According to the lawsuit , filed last month in L.A. County Superior Court , the brakes on the bus " failed and lost power , making the bus unable to stop " ... causing it to collide with " another vehicle , two concrete curbs , an iron fence and two trees . "
Dr. Phil -- I Did n't Touch Any Boobs !
A rep for Dr. Phil just sent TMZ the following statement vehemently denying the TV shrink did anything wrong to the woman accusing him of holding her captive in his offices , forcing her to stare at a naked man and grabbing her breast :
" All of Shirley Rae Dieu 's claims are without merit .
As with all of the occupants of the DR .
PHIL House , Ms. Dieu participated voluntarily , having submitted her personal story with the hope that she could confront , and overcome , her individual issues .
Dr. Phil is never alone in the House with any of these guests and all of his interactions are captured on video and / or audio tape .
All guests are , of course , free to come and go as they please and once Ms. Dieu expressed her discomfort , and producers ascertained there was nothing they could do to help her , they called a car service to return her to her home .
Ms. Dieu filed a claim with the Los Angeles Police Department some 9 months after the incident , which was investigated and ultimately not pursued by the Los Angeles City Attorney .
All guests of the show are treated with dignity and respect and the show stands by the manner in which she was handled while participating on the show . "
Dieu is suing Dr. Phil for an unspecified amount of money .
Levi Johnston -- No Palin , No Gain
We 're not sure if he 's gonna show his front or backside , but one thing 's certain : Levi Johnston wants to make sure both sides look good for his upcoming Playgirl spread just in case .
Johnston 's handler tells us the 19 - year - old father of one is preparing for the shoot by hittin ' the gym hard -- at least six days a week for the last three weeks -- with the help of a newly hired personal trainer .
Levi agreed to pose for Playgirl last month for an undisclosed amount ... but the real question is what he 's willing to bare .
We 'll find out soon enough -- the photo shoot happens sometime this month .

Fleiss Exploits Horrific Car Crash for Reality TV
TMZ has learned former Hollywood madame Heidi Fleiss survived a high - speed , window - smashing , Toyota - flipping car wreck back in June -- and then proceeded to make the whole thing part of an upcoming reality show .
Sources close to Fleiss tell us it all started when Heidi got into a fight with a castmate during a taping of " Celebrity Rehab " in Los Angeles .
Heidi was so upset , she ditched the production and got a ride back to her home in Pahrump , NV .
But during the trip home , the car swerved and hit a dirt patch , causing it to flip several times .
The Nye County Sheriff 's Office -- located near Pahrump -- tells us Heidi was n't driving when the SUV lost control ... but she was in the passenger seat and thankfully wearing a seat belt .
We 're told Heidi and her friend suffered some minor scrapes and bruises -- but essentially walked away with no serious injuries .
But here 's the catch -- sources tell TMZ a camera crew showed up to the crash scene the very next day and shot the site for " Celebrity Rehab . "
In classic Hollywood form , we 're told VH1 did n't want people on the show talking about the accident publicly .. hoping to keep the story arc on the down - low until it airs sometime in the near future .
A rep at VH1 had no comment .

In the first part of the article we looked at some of the UFC ’s most dominant champions of all time .
In the second we look at more ageing stars currently fighting for the promotion including both former UFC and Pride champions .

Dan Henderson ( 25 - 7 ) – Age : 39 – UFC 17 Middleweight Tournament Winner
One of the remarkable statistics in Dan Henderson ’s 12 year mixed martial arts career is that he has never been finished by KO or TKO .
Considering that his opponents have included some of the sports most dangerous strikers such as Wanderlei Silva ( twice – both in Pride ) , Quinton ‘ Rampage ’ Jackson and Vitor Belfort that is quite an achievement for the former Pride middleweight and light heavyweight champion .
This durability may partially explain why , at the age of 39 , Henderson still appears to be in excellent condition and has been a legitimate contender for a title shot in recent times .
It should not be forgotten that he has already won a UFC middleweight tournament back at UFC 17 , defeating Carlos Newton , but since his return to the UFC from Pride in 2007 he has failed in back to back attempts to claim the light heavyweight and middleweight belts .
As for his long term future , Henderson revealed earlier this year that , “ I feel like I ’ve still got a few good years ahead of me , but there ’s no way I ’ll still be fighting at 44 . ”
Verdict : Like Randy Couture , Dan Henderson is a fighter who still appears able to compete at the highest level as he approaches his 40’s , and remains a credible threat in whichever division he fights in .
He is currently out of contract with the UFC , but despite rumors he may go elsewhere it is more than likely that he will spend the remaining years of his career in the sports leading organization before retiring .

Frank Trigg ( 19 - 7 ) – Age : 37
With a record of 2 - 4 in the UFC Frank trigg has n’t exactly set the welterweight division on fire .
He has however competed twice for the welterweight title in that time .
Unfortunately for him both times were against Matt Hughes during his dominant reign as champion .
His other losses came from Georges St. Pierre which ended his first run in the promotion , and most recently against Josh Koscheck in his return to the fold at UFC 103 .
After his most recent loss rumors surfaced that the 37 year old was to be cut from the UFC after just one fight back .
Reacting to the news he told mmajunkie , “ If the UFC cuts me , I ’m done fighting .
I do n’t have the strength or determination to go fight in the minor leagues anymore . ”
It gave an interesting insight into a man who has fought professionally in a number of different organizations , both large and small , for the past 12 years .
As it turns out the UFC have thrown him a career life - line – offering him one more chance to prove himself , with fellow veteran Matt Serra rumored to be his likely opponent .
Verdict :
His confession that Josh Koscheck was a ‘ younger , stronger version ’ of himself sums up Trigg ’s current position in the UFC .
Much like his nemesis Matt Hughes , he now finds himself in a position where he is being surpassed by the next generation and thoughts of retirement are clearly on his mind .
Though Trigg is not to be taken lightly , he will struggle to see out the remainder of his three fight contract .

Sean Sherk ( 33 - 4 -1 ) – Age : 36 – Former UFC Lightweight Champion
A dominating wrestler known for grinding down his opponents , Sean Sherk has amassed an impressive thirty three wins with only four losses in a pro career that began back in 1999 .
His record inside the octagon currently stands at 7 - 4 and includes a win over Kenny Florian for the vacant lightweight championship at UFC 64 in 2006 .
Having only lost four times in his career , the fact that Sherk has lost two of his last three fights must be a cause of concern .
Despite turning 36 recently it is unlikely that his age is affecting his performance however .
He is well known for being a cardio machine with one of the toughest training regimes in the sport .
Instead it it appears that a change in strategy – dispensing with the wrestling base that has proved successful for him in the past and replacing it with a boxing based stand up game – is part of the reason for his recent results .
Speaking earlier this year on his thoughts on retirement Sherk said , “ I ’m not ready to walk away from this sport anytime soon .
As long as I ’m performing at a top level I ’ll keep fighting . ”
Verdict : Still in excellent shape ,
Sherk should be able to compete at a good level for several more years .
How he chooses to use that time remains to be seen .
He must re-connect with his wrestling and focus on a more well rounded strategy if he wants to make the most of the remainder of his career .

Matt Serra ( 9 - 6 ) Age : 35 – Former UFC Welterweight Champion
With an MMA career that spans a decade it ’s perhaps surprising that Matt Serra ’s record only contains 15 fights .
Many of them have taken place in the UFC where he holds a somewhat chequered record of 7 - 5 in the lightweight and welterweight divisions .
He does hold some notable accomplishments in the UFC including winning season four of The Ultimate Fighter ( featuring former UFC fighters ) and then topping that he then went on to shock the world by handing Georges St Pierre only the second defeat of his career to claim the welterweight belt .
His reign at the top of the division was however short - lived as St Pierre defeated him in a rematch a year later .
Since then Serra has fought in a grudge match with Matt Hughes , being edged out by the former champion by a split decision which he claims he should have won .
Having only fought once a year since winning against Ivan Menjivar at UFC 48 in 2004 , questions have to be asked whether Serra still has a strong desire to compete .
A highly regarded coach , Serra currently runs three martial arts schools and admitted prior to his fight with Matt Hughes that thoughts of retirement had crossed his mind , saying , “ I feel like if I retired tomorrow , I have enough to tell my grandkids what I was doing . ”
Verdict : Serra showed in his last fight that he is still a game competitor , but at this stage he is unlikely to gain another title shot and questions must be asked whether he still has the hunger to compete in the long term .
If he can convince the UFC to set up a rematch with Matt Hughes in the coming year then that may well prove to be his final curtain call .

Mirko Cro Cop ( 27-7 - 2-1 ) – Age : 35
If you had only seen Mirko Cro Cop ’s past few fights in the UFC you may wonder what all the fuss is about .
The Croatian does however hold a fearsome reputation from his days in Pride and as a K1 kick - boxer where his ability to take out opponents with a single leg kick became the stuff of legend .
There is no doubt that the years of competition have taken there toll on the fighter though .
He has had to contend with a number of injuries over the years , not least of which was a knee reconstruction after his frontal cruciate ligaments , collateral ligaments and meniscus were destroyed .
It would appear his mental game has also suffered .
After his most recent loss to Junior Dos Santos , Cro Crop confessed , “ Maybe the ones who have said that I ’m done are right .
Obviously I can’t break my mental block in the octagon .
Besides , I ’ve been training like a spartan for 20 years now , my body is worn out .
The years caught up to me , I ’ve been worn out . ”
Despite many news outlets reporting that the 35 year old had retired Cro Cop recently stated that he intends to see out the remaining two fights of his current UFC contract .
Verdict : Sadly Mirko Cro
Cop would appear to be an example of a fighter who ’s desire to compete has left him as years of relentless training , hard fought battles and past injuries catch up with him .
No longer the feared opponent he once was , retirement in the near future would appear to be the sensible option for this once deadly competitor .

Rich Franklin ( 26 - 5 -1 ) – Age : 34 – 3 time UFC Middleweight Champion
Since his arrival in the organization back at UFC 42 in 2003 , Rich Franklin has played a leading role in many of the promotions cards .
Until his first loss to Anderson Silva in 2006 the former teacher had racked up seven wins without defeat in the octagon .
He has struggled to maintain that form in recent times with a less impressive 5 - 4 record .
At 34 , Franklin ’s career is currently at a cross-roads .
Earlier this year he admitted that the new six fight deal he had just signed with the UFC could be his last , though physically he still appears in good shape .
His previous two fights have been at a 195 lb catch - weight between middleweight and light - heavyweight , somehow fitting for a man who appears stuck between a rock and a hard place having already been defeated by the current champions in both divisions .
Whichever division he fights in Rich Franklin ’s place in the UFC is not under threat as Dana White confirmed after his loss at UFC 103 .
“ Rich Franklin is one of those guys that when I talk about people that have been loyal to me and helped build this company …
He ’s not going anywhere . ”
Verdict :
With five fights remaining on his contract this once dominant champion still has time left to get back to winning ways .
A likely move to 205 lbs could prove a risky strategy at this stage of his career however , especially if he continues to rely largely on his stand - up despite having a solid ground game .

Wanderlei Silva – ( 32-10-1 1 NC ) – Age : 33
As fearsome a competitor as has ever fought in MMA , Wanderlei Silva has already secured his place in the history books regardless of what his future may hold .
Is 33 to young to be included in the list ?
In Silva ’s case , such is the ferocity of the battles he has been involved in that questions over his possible retirement were raised even before his return to the UFC in 2007 .
Having fought for the light heavyweight title back in UFC 25 in 2000 ( losing a unanimous decision to Tito Ortiz ) , Silva went on to become a legend in the Pride Fighting Championships , going on a four year winning streak as their middleweight champion with ‘ Rampage ’ Jackson ( twice ) and Dan Henderson amongst his list of 15 victims .
Remarkably 13 of those wins were by either KO or TKO making him one of the most lethal finishers ever .
Silva has found wins harder to come by in recent times however .
After his reign of dominance in Pride , he left on a low note with back to back K.O losses to Mirko Cro Cop and Dan Henderson .
His return to the octagon has not seen a change in fortune .
He has won only once in four fights – a knockout victory over Keith Jardine .
Meanwhile he suffered his third K.O defeat in three years in a rematch with Quinton Jackson which has left questions over how much longer he can continue to take punishment before he hangs his gloves up .
His situation echoes Chuck Liddell ’s who was asked to retire by UFC president Dana White himself .
For a warrior like Wanderlei Silva it may take a similar intervention before he finally calls time on his career .
Verdict : Unfortunately for this much loved legend , his recent facial surgery is only skin deep and cannot erase the toll that a career based on a fighting philosophy of ‘ kill or be killed ” takes .
Despite this his fighting spirit will never be broken , but even at the age of 33 this fan favourite ’s time competing at the highest level looks to be limited unless he can find a way to break his losing streak .

Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira ( 32 - 5 -1 ) – Age : 33 – Former UFC interim Heavyweight Champion
Another legend of the Pride Fighting Championships , Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira has crammed a lifetime of battles against the odds into his 33 years on this planet .
Even as a youngster he knew more than most about surviving adversity having been run over by a truck in Brazil at the age of 11 which left him in a coma for four days and cost him the loss of a rib and part of his liver .
In Pride he quickly gained a reputation for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat despite taking heavy punishment , often thanks to his word class Brazilian Jiu-Jistu skills .
Whilst it was a style that was exciting to watch and has brought him a great deal of success including becoming the Pride heavyweight champion , years of absorbing damage that would have stopped a lesser man appear to be taking their toll on the 33 year old fighter .
After a winning start to his UFC career in 2007 against Heath Herring , and then taking the interim light heavyweight belt at the expense of Tim Sylvia , Nogueira suffered the first TKO loss of his career at the hands of Frank Mir who knocked the fighter down several times with punches before the referee mercifully called a stop to the action .
Later Nogueira would claim that a staph infection and knee injury were to blame for his poor performance in the ring that night .
The fight did raise doubts over Nogueira ’s future though and in the lead up to his next fight with Randy Couture rumors that he had been getting knocked out in sparring also began to surface .
If this is the case it certainly did n’t show in the fight as he won a unanimous decision in a competitive and entertaining ‘ Fight Of The Night ’ performance that has put him right back into the mix in the heavyweight division .
Verdict :
In a heavyweight division that is becoming increasingly populated by significantly bigger men than his 230 lb frame , even Nogueira ’s legendary ability to take punishment will be severely tested .
Whilst he possesses the skills to remain a threat in the heavyweight division for years to come , only time will tell whether his body will carry him that far .

I 'll keep this diary brief .
I 'm here to listen to all of you .
I 've been talking about a Harvard study that shows over 44000 American deaths a year because they have no health coverage .
I heard this weekend that a Republican Senator said he was n't sure that anyone is dying .
I launched a site today where people can just name the dead , the victims of our sadly deficient health care system .
If you know one of these victims , you can honor him or her here :
http://namesofthedead.com/
We need to stop these needless deaths .
Last week , I launched another site , CongressmanWithGuts.com .
This is a moneybomb site collecting pledges to be honored on November 2 , one year before the next election .
The National Republican Party says that I am their number one target for next year , so I need your help .
Over 1000 people have pledged over $ 40,000 already .
Please visit and help .

The Beaufort Sea contains an estimated 8.22 billion barrels of oil and 27.65 million cubic feet of natural gas .
Oil operations on the North Slope at Prudhoe Bay have already begun to move into the near - coastal waters , but Shell 's drilling plan would take place in two leases located 16 and 23 miles offshore .
" We sincerely believe this exploration plan reflects concerns we have heard in the North Slope communities which have resulted in the programs being adjusted accordingly , " Pete Slaiby , Shell Alaska 's vice president , said in a statement .
The company has agreed to take a mid-season break in its drilling program , scheduled to begin in July 2010 , to accommodate the fall hunting season on bowhead whales undertaken by Native Alaskan villagers , who had feared that noisy drilling activities could injure or scare off the whales .
Conservationists have been fighting in the courts to delay further offshore oil development until studies of the Arctic 's fragile and interconnected ecosystem can be done .
But the minerals agency said it will work with the company to make sure the development can be conducted " in a safe and environmentally responsible manner . "
The march of offshore oil development into the Arctic has been given a boost by the federal Minerals Management Service , which approved Shell Offshore Inc. 's plan to drill exploratory wells in the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska .
The plan calls for an ice - breaking drilling rig as part of a fleet of 14 ships , boats , tankers , barges , tow vessels and specialized ice and water containment equipment .
" We just do n't know enough to be going forward with industrial activities in the Arctic , " said Michael Levine of Oceana , which has urged a time - out in offshore drilling until effects on endangered whales and polar bears and other Arctic species can be assessed , along with the potentially devastating effects of climate change on the region .
" The reality of offshore oil drilling is that accidents will happen .
And when oil spills in Arctic ice , there is no cleaning it up , " Chuck Clusen , director of Alaska projects at the Natural Resources Defense Council , said in a statement .
" A blow - out like the one that recently despoiled waters off the coast of Australia would leave oil in the waters off the coast of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for decades , illing whales , seals , fish and birds and turning irreplaceable spawning and feeding grounds into an ecological wasteland . "
In its official comments on the Minerals Management Service 's 2010 - 15 leasing plan for the entire outer continental shelf , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in September also urged the agency to " more directly address the challenges of Arctic and subarctic spill response ... before proposing further oil and gas development in Alaska . "
The agency said " no leasing should occur in the Arctic Sea under this proposed plan until additional information is gathered and additional research is conducted and evaluated regarding oil spill risk ... and possible human dimension impacts on Alaska Native cultures from oil and gas exploration activities and potential oil spills . "
Download NOAA comments
The two Shell leases were sold under a previous five - year leasing program for the 2002 - 07 period .
Alaskan officials have long sought to expand both onshore and offshore oil development in the Arctic , and U.S. Sen.
Mark Begich ( D - Alaska ) applauded the agency 's approval , saying it will allow the state to help meet the nation 's shortfall in domestic energy production .
" This decision shows ... the Obama Administration recognize[s ] the importance of Alaska ’s abundant offshore oil and gas resources , and it brings us one step closer to environmentally - responsible development offshore of Alaska , " Begich said .
" They are getting the balance right : including safeguards for important subsistence resources and allowing drilling to go forward . "

PESHAWAR , Pakistan -- Like Bill Mahrer or John Stewart , Badr Zaman Badr and his brother Abdurrahim Muslim Dost relish writing a good joke that jabs a corrupt politician or distills the sufferings of fellow Afghans .
Badr admires the political satires in " The Canterbury Tales " , " Gulliver 's Travels , " William Burroughs and Gore Vidal and Dost wrote some wicked lampoons in the 1990s , accusing Afghan mullahs , who were emulating there Western neo-con counterparts , of growing rich while preaching and organizing oil jihad .
So in 2002 , when the U.S. military shackled the writers and flew them to Guantanamo among prisoners whom Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld declared " the worst of the worst " violent terrorists , the brothers realized that the U.S. policy apparatus was not just too authoritarian to take a joke albeit from 11,000 miles away by two obscure Afghan comics but too fucking stupid to even identify one .
For months , grim interrogators grilled them over a satirical article Dost had written in 1998 , when the Clinton administration offered a $ 5 - million reward for Osama bin Laden .
Dost responded that Afghans put up 5 million Afghanis -- equivalent to $ 113 -- for the arrest of President Bill Clinton , a proposition that apparently originated with the jihadists of the American Religious right .
" It was a fuckin ' lampoon ... of the poor Afghan economy for Christsake , " Badr said clearly exasperated with the obtuseness of the Americans .
Taking a page from the way U.S. cops go after a black suspect , the article instructed Afghans how to precisely identify Clinton if they stumbled upon him spotting soft targets ala Serbia for U.S. bombers .
" It said he was clean - shaven , had light - colored eyes and he had been seen involved in a scandal with Monica Lewinsky , " Badr said .
" This is Afghan humor .
We can't say getting his hammer honed , his pecker polished , or caught with his nads in the saliva jacuzzi which we admit are far funnier American euphemisms and that the Americans may have better appreciated and understood as humor . "
The interrogators , some flown down from Washington , did n't get the joke , he said .
" Again and again , they were asking questions about this article .
We had to explain that this was a satire . "
He paused .
" It was really pathetic . "
It took the brothers three years to convince the Americans that they posed no more of a threat to Clinton or the U.S. than any of the other 600 or so detainees at Guantanamo , and to get released -- a struggle that underscores the enormous odds weighing against innocent foreign Muslim comics caught by America 's humorless and stupid military intelligence .
In recent months , scores of Afghans interviewed by Newsday -- including a dozen former U.S. prisoners , plus human rights officials and senior Afghan security officials -- said the United States is detaining enough innocent Afghans in its war against the Taliban and al - Qaida that it is seriously undermining popular support for its presence in Afghanistan and emptying the Kabul comedy clubs .
As Badr and Dost fought for their freedom , their cosmopolitan sense of humor became a liability compared with Guantanamo 's 500 - plus other innocent captives .
The brothers are university - educated , and Badr , who holds a master 's degree in English literature , was one of few prisoners able to speak fluently to the interrogators in their own language so was universally held in suspicion by the slack - jawed , ape - like Americans .
And since both men are writers , much of their lives and political ideas are on public record here in books and articles they have published .
But to the undereducated and xenophobic U.S. military that meant little .
A Pentagon spokesman , the comically named Lt. Cmdr. Flex Plexico , declared this summer in a clear military colon blow that " there was no mistake " in the brothers ' detention because it " was directly related to their combat activities [ or support ] as determined by an appropriate Department of Defense official . "
U.S. officials declined to discuss the case , so no full picture is available of why it took so long for the pair to be cleared .
" We fucked up .
We can see why we fucked up .
We 're fuckin idiots .
And I 'm chief idiot .
But we 're gonna stand behind our fuck up like ignorance is ex cathedra , " said Don Rumsfeld at a recent news conference .
" Stay the fuckin ' course .
Stay the fuckin ' course .
What part of stay the fuckin ' course do you people not understand . "
The Pentagon 's prison network overseas is not assigned to help prevent attacks on the United States like those of Sept. 11 , 2001 , so " you cannot equate it to a justice system , " said Army Col .
Samuel Rob , who was serving this summer as the chief lawyer for U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
He added , innocent victims of the system are " ubiquitous , I 'd say .
But Americans do n't know or care what ubiquitous means .
So as long as we 're locking so colored fuckers up , everybody on Main Street is happy and everybody on Wall Street is making money on razor wire and Port - A - Johns . "
The military is slow to clear innocent prisoners , because " we got nothin ' on any of these fucks and they 're harder to replace now that we been bombing the shit out of Afghanistan these last few years , " said Rob .
" Imagine this is a truly bad individual , the next World Trade Center bomber .
How would we know ?
We routinely let them fucks go by accident .
Like bin Laden .
But if we got a few Afghan goatherds and comics we got something to tell the families of the 9/11 victims , we get our paychecks and , believe me when I tell you , a 16 year old goatherd is easier to control and more fun to rape and torture than a trained terrorist .
Them terrorist fuckers give me the fuckin ' hee - bee jee - bees quite frankly , " said Rob .
Rob and the Defense Department say the prison system does not perform satisfactorily in freeing innocents and letting military investigators focus on prisoners who really are part of terrorist networks .
" That 's not our concern .
Identifying real terrorists would be beyond our intelligence capacity as military intelligence , " Rob said once again alluding to the famous oxymoron .
" Besides , why blur the line .
I mean , we 're the terrorists .
' Shock and Awe ' baby .
The ' awe ' part being our mock sympathy after we 've applied the shock part .
Do you want to go into a cage on Gtmo and , for all intents and purposes , interrogate yourself all fuckin ' day .
That could play with your head , man . "
Badr and others -- including some former military intelligence soldiers who served in Guantanamo and Afghanistan -- emphatically disagree .
" Those American fucks are so fucked up they make the Taliban look like Unitarians , " Badr said .
" They got issues that banging their bacon while their girlfriend 's pissing in my face is not gonna solve . "
The United States for years called Badr and his brother " enemy combatants " because they had such a way with words .
The men say they never saw a battlefield , not even with the Pakistani USO .
And for an America that seeks a docile Afghanistan run by a hand chosen stooge , they once seemed , potentially , allies .
Americans " have freedom to criticize your government as long as it does n't translate into real power because then they leave you bleeding on a motel balcony or the street , and this is very good , " said Badr .
Also , " we know that America 's laws pay lip service to the idea that a person is innocent until he is proven to be guilty if he is white .
But now with the catholic school mafia taking over the Supreme Court the expanded role of bigotry in your judicial system is inevitable and I understand much welcome in the boardrooms and pulpits . "
Badr and Dost are Pashtuns , members of the ethnic group that spawned the Taliban .
But the family library where they receive their guests is crammed with poetry , histories and religious treatises -- mind - broadening stuff that Christian Americans , especially the American Christian military , are more inclined to burn than read .
For years , the brothers ' library has served as a salon for Pashtun intellectuals and activists of many hues , including some who also have been arrested in the U.S. - funded dragnet for suspected Islamic militants .
Like millions of Afghans , they fled to Pakistan during the Soviet occupation of their country in the 1980s and joined one of the many anti-Soviet factions that got quiet support from the CIA through Pakistan 's military intelligence service .
Their small group was called Jamiat - i- Dawatul Quran wa Sunna , and Dost became editor of its magazine .
Even then , " we were lovers , not fighters , " said Badr .
" We took part in the war only as writers like Hemingway . "
After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , the men split with Jamiat , partly over its promotion of the extremist Wahhabi sect of Islam and partly because they considered it too dangerous to cross the CIA .
For the Americans , Dost wrote lampoons against the group 's leader , a cleric named Sami Ullah , portraying him as a corrupt pawn of its sponsor , Pakistan , working against Afghan interests .
But the humor was too subtle and U.S. intelligence became convinced that it was code .
In November 2001 , as U.S. forces attacked Afghanistan , the mullah 's brother , Roh Ullah , " called us and said if we did n't stop criticizing the party he would have us put in jail , " said Badr .
Ten days later , men from Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence Directorate hauled the brothers off to grimy cells .
Another Ullah brother , Hayat Ullah , insisted in an interview that their family had not instigated the arrests .
Dost is a political rival , but " a very simple man , " Hayat Ullah said .
" We have many powerful rivals .
If I were going to get ISI to pick up an enemy , why would I choose an ordinary person like him ?
Now , think who is simple enough to pick up such a simple man . "
Pakistan - U.S. Black Market In Prisoners
But two Pakistani analysts with sources in ISI said the Ullah family has been accused in several cases of using its links to the CIA to have rivals arrested .
And Roh Ullah himself is now imprisoned at Guantanamo .
In the midnight chill of Feb. 9 , 2002 , ISI officers led Badr and Dost , blindfolded and handcuffed , onto the tarmac of Peshawar International Airport .
When they heard airplanes , " we knew they were giving us up to the Americans , " Badr said .
Beneath the blindfold , he stole glimpses of grinning Pakistani officers , high U.S. soldiers , mountains of Afghan heroin and a cargo plane .
" It was a big festival atmosphere , as though the Pakistanis were handing over Osama bin Laden to the United States , " Badr said .
Shouting and shoving , American troops threw the brothers to the asphalt and bound their hands behind them with plastic ties .
" They chained our feet , " Badr said .
" Dogs were barking at us .
They pulled a sack down over my head and pulled down our pants .
It was very difficult to breathe ... and I saw the flash of cameras .
They were taking pictures of us and pleasuring themselves . "
Flown to U.S. prisons at Bagram and Kandahar air bases in Afghanistan , the brothers eventually learned from their interrogators that for $ 50,000 the ISI had denounced them to the U.S. as dangerous supporters of the Taliban and al - Qaida who had threatened President Clinton .
" The ISI thought it was a big joke to play on the gullible , bloodthirsty Americans , " said Badr .
" I 'm sure the $ 50,000 in laundered twenties and fifties did n't hurt either . "
In the three - plus years that the brothers spent in U.S. prisons abroad , violent abuse and torture were widely reported .
Take My Life , Please
Eight of 12 men interviewed after their release in recent months from U.S. prisons in Afghanistan told Newsday they had been beaten or had seen or heard other prisoners being beaten .
" We 're gonna beat a fuckin ' joke out of you , funnyboy , " Dost remembers his captors telling him .
The brothers escaped the worst abuse , partly because of Badr 's entertained them with flawless Lenny Bruce routines like Father Flotsky 's Triumph , The Palladium and Religions Incorporated .
At times , prisoners " who did n't speak English got the shit kicked out of them by the MPs because they did n't understand what the soldiers wanted even when the MP 's loosened their belts and pointed to their rock hard love batons , " he said .
And both men said that while many prisoners clammed up under questioning , they were talkative and able to pretend to cooperate .
" We were not tortured because we knew schtick from Blue Collar TV and Hee - Haw , " Badr said , " but we heard torture . "
At Bagram , " We heard guards beating people on the backs of their legs to make them stand up all night without sleeping . "
At Kandahar , prisoners caught talking in their cells " were punished by being forced to kneel on the ground with their hands on their head and not moving for three or four hours in hot weather .
Some became unconscious , " he said .
The U.S. military last year investigated abuse at its prisons in Afghanistan but the Pentagon ordered the report suppressed pending negotiations with Sadism & Bestiality Magazine .
Routine interrogations : " If Who 's On 1000volts , What 's On a 10,000 . "
Badr and Dost were humiliated routinely .
When being moved between prisons or in groups , they often were thrown to the ground , like that night at Peshawar airport .
" They put our faces in the dust , " Badr said .
Like virtually all ex-prisoners interviewed , he said he felt deliberately shamed by soldiers when they photographed him naked or gave him regular rectal exams because " they got off on it and covered the ground with the seed of their unborn children . "
The brothers were flown to Guantanamo for a three year run in May 2002 as soon as the Camp Delta Comedy Club , the permanent prison there , was opened .
" Before Badr and Dost arrived the funniest thing in the camp was the commanding officer 's malaprops , " offered MP Opie Tucker .
For more than two years , they sat in separate cells , waiting days between comedy stints with interrogators to explain and re-explain their lives and writings .
" 25 Different Lead Interrogators --- An Oil Painting . "
In his 35 months in U.S. captivity , Badr said , he had about 150 interrogation sessions with 25 different lead interrogators from several U.S. agencies .
" And , just like Lenny Bruce , satire was the biggest cause of their suspicion , " he said .
" They did n't get it .
They 'd wrinkle their brows making that same ape face that Bush makes .
That distinctly American ape face and then they would throw their feces at us . "
When one team of interrogators " began to finally grasp that this was satire , the whole process would begin anew with interrogators from another agency who were just as dense as the last group . "
In all , Badr said he was told that four U.S. agencies -- including the CIA , FBI and Defense Department -- would have to claim they understood their humor before the men could be released .
" We gave up hope , " sputters Dost .
And their names would be circulated to 40 other countries so their cabaret cards would be stripped and they could n't work there .
" We did n't want to fuckin ' work Vanuatu any the fuck way , " Badr claimed .
Because the Americans were n't too bright and loved their sadism and their little brown sex slaves , the investigations seemed to take forever to confirm even where they had lived and studied .
" I would tell him [ the interrogator ] something simple like the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in the fifties or Burt Reynolds wears a hairpiece or that Scooter Libby has a child raping bear in one of his novels , or that Rush Limbaugh is a drug addict , or that Don Rumsfeld did a lot of business with Saddam Hussein , or Ed Lansdale was in Dallas the day Kennedy was shot , or that the Gulf of Tonkin Incident was a complete fabrication and ... two or two - and - a - half years later , he would come back and say , ' We checked , and you were right about that , ' " Badr said .
Another problem was that " Many of the interpreters were not good because all the competent interpreters were discharged for being gay , " said Badr .
" They sounded like Jed Clampitt talking in Persian . "
He recalled an elderly man , arrested by U.S. forces for shooting his rifle at a helicopter , who explained that he had been trapping hawks and fired in anger at one that flew away .
But the interpreter mistook the Persian word " booz " ( hawk ) for " baz " ( goat ) .
" The interrogator was such a typically American idiot filled with disappointment , despair and misplaced hostility that he became very angry , " Badr said .
" He thought the old man was making a fool of him by claiming to be shooting at goats flying in the air .
Then when the lame fucker figured it out , he avoided being reprimanded by claiming the old man said he was shooting at Black Hawk 's and they beat the old coot to death . "
Angered By Ordeal
Rob conceded that " obviously , we could use more translators .
I mean we all fuck boys .
But were not gay .
We 're Homeric . "
He said the pace at which prisoners are processed -- and innocents released -- is adequate for the Americans to satiate themselves .
That idea angers Badr .
" They detained us for three and a half years , " he said .
" Then they said to us , 'all right , you 're innocent , so go away and gave us the name of a good colon reconstruction surgeon who worked for Doctors Without Borders . ' "
Of that anger , Rob said , " that 's understandable .
Especially if he 's the breadwinner for his family and there 's no one ... "
The sentence hung uncompleted as a little light bulb went off in the shitkicker 's head .
The brothers ' anger is deepened by the abusiveness of many U.S. soldiers , whom Badr compared to " Yahoos , " the thuggish characters of Jonathan Swift 's " Gulliver 's Travels . "
And they are upset that U.S. officials confiscated all of their prison writings and have published them under pseudonyms as a series of graphic novels published by Regnery .
Still , Badr sounds neither bitter nor an enemy of America .
" I am curious to meet ordinary Americans .
Not the sadistic perverts in military intelligence and the CIA , " he said .
" I appreciated my interrogators in Guantanamo . ...
Though one assume their roles as torturers would not require urbanity and sophistication , they were extraordinarily misguided and uninformed , for example about my religion .
...
But I must say all Americans cannot be such uncivilized , brutish and ignorant people . "

Collaborative Filtering with Ensembles
One of the most interesting insights from the results of the Netflix challenge is that while the algorithms , the psychology , and good knowledge of statistics goes a long way , it was ultimately the cross - team collaboration that ended the contest .
“ The Ensemble ” team , appropriately named for the technique they used to merge their results consists of over 30 people .
Likewise , the runner up team ( “ BellKor ” ) is a collaborative effort of several distinct groups that merged their results .
It is easy to overlook this fact , except that it is not a one - time occurrence .
The leaderboard for the recent GitHub contest also clearly shows over half of the top ten entries as ensemble techniques !
Few people would argue against the idea of consulting several experts on any complex subject - as the saying goes : “ two heads are better than one ” .
Having said that , the ensemble techniques which leverage this exact strategy are rarely a hot topic in the machine learning communities , or at least , up until now .
Given their recent success this is likely to change , but perhaps even more importantly , their effectiveness may actually force the ‘ collaborative filtering ’ space to become , well , a lot more collaborative .
GitHub Contest : The Good , The Bad
Religious arguments about the merits of each distributed version control system aside , one thing GitHub does really well is allow users to follow and discover new open source projects .
In that light , a competition for a recommendations engine makes perfect sense .
As part of the challenge you get access to records of over 56 K users , 120 K repositories , and 440 K relationships between each .
Great data set , immediate feedback via post - commit hooks , all results available in the open , and a few people even shared their code !
If there was one thing to improve about the contest , then it would have to be the ranking methodology .
The goal was to “ guess ” the 4,788 removed repositories , which I would argue , is optimizing for the wrong thing .
The goal should have been not to guess what users are already watching , but to produce a more general predictor for what users should be watching - the former is a subset of the latter .
To see why , think of the case where a general predictor might actually have a set of better recommendations ( based on other user ’s patterns ) than the few repos that the GitHub team hid from the dataset for any user .
Ensemble Techniques & Machine Learning
Ranking methodology aside , perhaps the most interesting result of the GitHub contest is due to how it was setup : each submission is a push into a public
Git repo , which means that each entry is automatically in the public domain .
Unlike the Netflix contest , where all submissions were private and teams had to agree to merge their results , the GitHub contest became a free - for - all and a fertile crowd for testing ensembles !
While the topic of Ensembles is a rich one , the general idea is remarkably simple : instead of attempting to build one general model to capture all the subtleties of the data , use multiple predictors and combine their results .
For an illustrative example , assume that we were trying to build a model that would separate the data in the diagram above .
After a brief examination , we form a simple hypothesis ( call this hypothesis family H ) : we could separate the data using simple geometric shapes such as a circle ( H1 ) , or a square ( H2 ) .
Visually we can clearly see that neither one by itself will do a good job , but applying them both gives us a pretty good approximation while the model remains very simple ( we want our model to be simple , for computational reasons ) .
So what do we do ?
We train two independent classifiers and then merge their results , aka , use an ensemble of classifiers .
The description above sweeps a lot of details under the rug , but core of the idea is there .
Boosting , bagging , consensus aggregation , dynamic classifier selection , and dozens of other techniques have been developed on top of this process and have proven to be very successful .
The overarching principle of ensemble techniques is to make each predictor as unique as possible : use a different learning algorithm ( decision trees , svm , svd ) , or use a different feature ( random subspace method ) .
Then , once you have many individual classifiers , determine a mechanism to join the results ( simple method : each predictor votes on each point , then tally up the votes ) and make a final prediction using the new classifier .
GitHub Ensembles
Perhaps the most illustrative example of this simple technique is John Rowell ’s entry into the GitHub contest , which is best described by a snippet right from the source :
require ' nokogiri ' require ' open - uri ' class Crowdsource def initialize load_leaderboard # scrape github contest leaders parse_leaders # find their top performing results fetch_results # download best results cleanup_leaders # cleanup missing or incorrect data crunchit # build an ensemble end #... end Crowdsource .
new
Because all the entries in the GitHub contest are in the public domain ( actually , a few people caught on and started deleting their repos immediately after their submissions because of this technique ) , we can download the best predictions of other users , construct an ensemble , and then submit our own set of results .
Collaborative , Collaborative Filtering : CCF !
While on first examination the ensemble technique may have a flavor of cheating , I think it can actually have a significant effect on how future challenges of this sort could be structured .
Do n’t fight it , embrace it .
Instead of focusing on individual effort or insight , it is not hard to imagine much more collaborative , collaborative - filtering competitions ( CCF’s ) .
Some teams can focus on building great independent predictors , while others can focus on developing and improving the methods for constructing ensembles ( a mashup , of sorts ) .
In other words , collaborative filtering has the potential to become a lot more collaborative !
And in the meantime , I wish the GitHub guys luck in trying to determine the winner .
Update : GitHub removed most ensemble submissions / released the code to power the challenge .
Google will launch an e-book store called Google Editions with a " do n't be evil " twist .
Unlike Google 's biggest competitors , Amazon and Barnes & Noble , which rely heavily on restrictive DRM , Google 's store will not be device - specific -- allowing for e-books purchased through Google Editions to be read on the far greater number of e-book readers that will flood the market in 2010 .
Google 's e-books will be accessible through any Web - enabled computer , e-reader , or mobile phone instead of a dedicated device .
This will allow content to be unchained from expensive devices such as Amazon 's Kindle e-book reader .
However , as democratizing as this sounds , it 's still unclear how many people are ready to curl up with a Google Editions title on their laptop or smartphone , instead of the traditional paper format .
Google Editions : The Basics
The new e-book store will launch sometime during the first half of 2010 , and will have about 500,000 titles at launch .
Under Google 's payment scheme , publishers will receive about 63 percent of the gross sales , and Google will keep the remaining 37 percent .
Google also hopes to offer Editions titles through other online book retailers .
In this scenario , online retailers would get 55 percent of revenues minus a small fee paid to Google , and publishers would get 45 percent .
Google may also create deals to sell Google Editions books directly through a book publisher 's Web site , but no details have been announced for how that scenario would work , according to Read Write Web .
Google Editions as Web Apps ?
Google 's e-books would reportedly be indexed and searchable like many books are now through Google 's Book Search , according to Reuters .
Unlike titles offered through e-readers , Google Editions books would not have to be accessed through a dedicated reader or special application .
Instead , any device with a Web browser will be able to access a Google Editions book .
After you purchase and access your online book for the first time , it will be cached in your browser making the book available when you 're offline .
To me this sounds like Google wants to turn the e-book , or more accurately the e-reader , into a Web App.
Considering Google 's push with its yet - to - be- unveiled Chrome OS and the Chrome browser , turning books into Web Apps is n't a particularly surprising move .
But Is Google Editions a Game - Changer ?
Whenever Google gets involved with any new business , the immediate assumption is that the company will be able to reshape the market .
From the sounds of it , Google 's plans may do just that , since it will make reading and accessing e-books nearly universal on almost any device that can get to the Web .
However , Google is not the first company to deliver e-books to your PC .
Companies like Buy Ebook and eBooks.com already do this , and the online social publishing site , Scribd started selling e-books earlier this year .
Google 's use of the Web browser as an e-reader may make it slightly easier to access an e-book than these other retailers since Google will essentially shun the ePub and PDF formats .
But one hurdle Google can't overcome is the fact that you 'll be reading your book on a computer screen .
And so far , reading e-books on a PC has not caught on .

Seattle writers Mark Rahner and Robert Horton host a Halloween party celebrating Rotten , their zombie - Western comic series ( from Moonstone Books ) .
The authors promise a highly animated — you might say " re-animated " — time including a film screening ( title will be a surprise ) , selected shorts and various unhealthy high jinks .
Rotten follows the bloody exploits of government agents as they roam the West , fighting to explain and contain a mysterious outbreak of the undead in 1877 .
Along with head - splattering action , Rotten offers distinct parallels with recent political events — a world in which fear threatens to trump reason .
Costumes encouraged !
Wood has pledged $ 150,000 toward a new meat processing plant on campus .
In his letter , he said Pollan 's scheduled solo appearance had prompted him to " rethink my continued financial support of the university . ''
He also criticized an animal sciences professor who said that conventional feedlots like the one run by Harris Ranch were not a form of sustainable agriculture .
" While I understand the need to expose students to alternative views , I find it unacceptable that the university would provide Michael Pollan an unchallenged forum to promote his stand against conventional agricultural practices , '' David E. Wood , chairman of the Harris Ranch Beef Co. , wrote in a scathing Sept. 23 letter to the Cal Poly president .
Threatening to pull donations from the school , a major California agribusiness has succeeded in turning what was to be a campus lecture by Pollan tomorrow into a panel discussion involving Pollan , a meat - science expert and one of the largest organic growers in the U.S .
Agribusinesses across the U.S. have a beef with sustainable food guru Michael Pollan , but at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo it has taken on a definite sizzle .
Cal Poly officials said they had contemplated using Pollan 's talk as the basis for a panel discussion at some point , but the negative reaction to the scheduled lecture from Harris and other agricultural interests propelled the plan onto the front burner .
" When we realized how significant a backlash was coming , we thought of having the panel right after his speech , " said David Wehner , a Cal Poly dean .
" I 'm frustrated and saddened by some people 's attitudes , '' he said .
" They 've looked at this as us supporting his views and not supporting them .
We do n't have a political position -- we only educate students . ''
In an interview , Pollan said he rejected the idea of appearing on a panel after his scheduled talk .
" I thought , ' Wow !
You 're going to add some whole other event at the behest of some cranky donors ? ' " he said of his response to the change .
Pollan said he offered the university a choice of either having him lecture or participate in a panel .
Pollan , who teaches in the journalism program at UC Berkeley , has encountered resistance to his campus appearances from farm businesses in Washington and Wisconsin .
" It 's part of what appears to be a more aggressive industry pushback against critics of industrial agriculture , '' he said in an interview .
He said the Harris letter raised troubling questions about academic freedom .
" The issue is about whether the school is really free to explore diverse ideas about farming , '' he said .
" Is the principle of balance going to apply across the board ?
The next time Monsanto comes to speak at Cal Poly about why we need [ genetically modified organisms ] to feed the world , will there be a similar effort ?
Will I be invited back for that show ? "

SANTA MONICA , California — J.J. Abrams ' rebooted Star Trek could hardly have been more successful with critics and the general public , but some Trekkers found the film 's script to be rife with plot holes that spoke more to convenience than good storytelling .
At a recent press event for the movie 's upcoming DVD release , Abrams and his writers told Wired.com what they were thinking during the Enterprise 's first cruise with them at the helm , and what course they plan to set during the ship 's next voyage , the as - yet - untitled Trek sequel planned for 2011 .
( Spoiler alert :
If you 're one of the handful of people who have n't yet seen Abrams ' Star Trek , * consider yourself warned .
Major plot points ahead . ) *

Tiny Enterprise Models Channel Quirky Star Trek Visions
At Star Trek 's halfway mark , evil Romulans have changed the time line and created an alternative * Star Trek * universe .
Cadet Kirk ( played by Chris Pine ) mutinies against acting captain Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) aboard the Enterprise following the destruction of the planet Vulcan .
Rather than putting Kirk in the brig , Spock shoots him off the ship in an escape pod .
Kirk lands on a primitive ice planet , where he runs into the original Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) from the original time line .
The pair then travel through the snow and ice to meet up with the only other human on the planet — Montgomery Scott ( Simon Pegg ) .
That 's a reach , even for Star Trek .
" I know there are some fans out there who watch the movie and say , ' How could Kirk land on that planet and meet up with Spock ? ' "
Abrams told Wired.com .
" But I think ( screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman ) handled it by doing it .
They went at it directly and decided to do it because this film is about fate and friendship . "
When Star Trek arrives on Blu-ray and DVD Nov. 17 , extras like deleted scenes and commentary will answer some lingering questions .
Abrams said the DVD includes a scene cut from the film that features Spock Prime ( Nimoy ) dropping some logic about the unlikely chance meeting .
" In the scene , Spock explains that ( the encounter of Kirk and Spock Prime ) is a result of the universe trying to restore balance after the time line is changed , " Abrams said .
" They acknowledged the coincidence as a function of the universe to heal itself . "

Abrams said he cut that scene because he liked the mystery the chance meeting provided — and the idea that Kirk and Spock are destined to be friends .
( Another DVD mini- feature , titled " The Shatner Conundrum , " will tackle the absence of William Shatner , the original Captain Kirk , from Abrams ' movie , according to io9.com . )
Abrams said the planned Star Trek sequel will offer more freedom to him and his writers .
" Now that we 've established these characters , it opens up a lot of opportunities for future stories , " Abrams said .
" At this point , we 're just starting to discuss the sequel and discussing ideas .
We have n't even started breaking down a story yet . "
Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman , who wrote Abrams '
Trek , confirmed the sequel 's early stages and took a moment to counter some of the rumors already circulating online .
Pundits are reporting the next Star Trek film will take a page from the original 1960s series and comment on current political conditions .
" We 're not writing about Guantanamo Bay , " Kurtzman said with some measure of fatigue .
" When we say we want to include allegory in the next film , it does n't mean we 're looking to inject politics into the story . "
Orci added : " The original series did such a great job of connecting a science fiction story to larger themes .
That 's what we 're looking to do with the next film .
But first and foremost , it 's going to be an exciting adventure . "
" That 's what Star Trek has to be , " Abrams said .
" Now that our characters have come together — now that Kirk and Spock are Kirk and Spock — we can tell that adventure story . "

Like all new frontiers , social media is a lawless place where anything goes , especially when it comes to brand .
Everyone seems to have moved into these boom towns with a population of more than 12 million people projected for Twitterville alone this year .
It ’s a on - line , communications gold - rush , a world of wonderful opportunity – but exactly what is social media ?
Is it a tool for social interaction or business commerce ?
At the moment it ’s both .
So with a poorly defined and misunderstood purpose , how should businesses of one to a thousand employees build their brand image on - line ?
Like all brand building exercises , your social media presence should be consciously directed by a brand strategy ; it should be strategic first and tactical second .
Currently the vast majority of business presence in social media is driven by what we call ‘ Scategy ’ , a tactically obsessive approach of trying to do a little bit of everything and trying to mean a little bit of something to everyone .
The result – your brand ends - up meaning nothing to anyone .
Here are what I believe to be the crucial five steps to building your brand image on social media .
Step 01 .
Why am I here ?
The first and most critical step is to ensure you have clarity around why you are utlising social media in the first place .
Is your Twittering , Facebook - ing and Linked In - ing a social pursuit , or does it have a commercial focus ?
Presently there are many Tweeters who seem to have a foot in each camp .
If your social media activities have a commercial role , then you need to be clear on the role your activities play in building your brand .
Tip : ‘ Everyone is talking about Facebook and Twitter , so I did n’t want to miss the action ’ is n’t a strategy .
Step 02 .
How ’s my hair ?
Your brand strategy should drive the thinking for the rest of the steps , including the biggest of all social media questions ; photo or no photo ?
The answer to the photo question is dictated by the nature of the presence .
As a brand presence it is expected that you present a well designed brand mark and brand image .
As an individual representing a brand it is acceptable to use either a photograph or a brand image , but your photograph must be a reflection of the brand .
Tip : I ’m rather partial to kayaking down the amazon with kids - in - tow myself , but it is not how I wish to communicate my brand as a professional business person .
Step 03 .
What ’s the word ?
Like all things in life , the fewer there are , the more precious they become .
The same goes for those 140 - odd characters we use to communicate in Twitter or those short paragraph updates we use in Linked In or Facebook .
What you write is a direct reflection of your brand ’s expertise , professionalism and personality .
Tip : ‘ Good night peeps , I ’m off to sleep ’ is not considered a professional conversation unless you ’re in the bedding business .
And when it comes to words , none are more important than the handful you choose to position yourself with in your description .
Think long and hard about these , they should reflect your business , your role within that business and your brand personality .
Step 04 .
Do I look good in this ?
Your social media backgrounds are one of the strongest opportunities you have to present your brand image to market .
A well - designed background provides a glow of professionalism and brand persona to the information presented and communicated from that site .
Tip :
The available background templates usually provide a clean and professional canvas for you to build your brand presence upon .
They may not be original , but the templates provided are often a better result than many of the personalised backgrounds haunting the net .
Step 05 .
Do you love me ?
The thing about social media is that by its very nature it is social .
And like any social interaction , you need to be either interesting , informative , an expert , offering me something , or at the very least amusing if you want people to stick around .
You need to be clear on the role that social media will play for your business and it ’s market .
Are you :
• Conducting customer conversations like Starbucks
• An expert advisor like Brandscientist Peter Singline
• Telling me what you are selling or where you are selling it like Kogibbq
• Building a brand personality like urbansmiler
Whatever you do for business and wherever you do it , do it with conscious consideration and your leave the ‘ scategy ’ for those without strategy .
Dave .
Until the day he was outed , the most influential commentator on South Korea 's economy lived the life of a nobody .
Park Dae - Sung owned a small apartment in a middle - class neighborhood of Seoul and freelanced part - time at a telecom company .
Thirty years old , he still hoped to earn a four - year degree in economics .
In the mornings , he would bicycle to the public library to study for the university entrance exam .
His standard uniform was slacks , loafers , and wrinkle - free button - down shirts , as though he were going to work in an office .
But with his slightly chubby moon face , glasses , and neatly parted hair , he easily blended in among the rows of students .
While they worked through school assignments , he immersed himself in the text of his chosen profession .
In the evenings , Park would go online , frittering away the hours like millions of other geeks .
He often played the simulation game Capitalism II , where he'd assume the role of a blue - chip investor , closing million - dollar deals and speculating on skyscrapers .
Nothing that he did earned him any attention .
Then , in March 2008 , Park opened an account on South Korea 's popular Daum Agora forum .
Here , he decided , he would call himself Minerva , after the Roman goddess of wisdom , and write exclusively on economics , drawing on both public reports and his years in the stacks poring over Adam Smith and Joseph Stiglitz .
Affecting the effortless command of a seasoned investor , he strove to project the authority that had eluded him in real life .
The world economy is in the midst of collapse , he warned , so pay your debts and stock up on noodles and drinkable water .
He made pronouncements on when to buy or sell a home , exchange Korean won for dollars , and pull out of the financial markets altogether .
As the financial crisis deepened , events confirmed Minerva 's prophecies all too terribly .
By early fall , each new dispatch would rise into Daum Agora 's top five headlines , carried by a tide of user votes and drawing hundreds of thousands of pageviews .
South Korea 's daily press began publicizing Minerva 's predictions and speculating about his identity .
The more the newspapers tried to pierce the veil of Minerva , the more their readers devoured his posts , until it seemed the goddess was giving marching orders to the entire economy .
The post that would bring Minerva worldwide fame appeared on August 25 , 2008 , under the florid title " Overture to the 2008 Financial Wars : Apocalypse Now in Korea . "
It attacked a plan , floated three days before by the Korea Development Bank , to purchase a large chunk of Lehman Brothers .
Minerva held forth at length on the stupidity of this idea , given that Lehman was groaning under $ 50 billion in debt .
If KDB invested in Lehman , Minerva wrote , the people of Korea stood to lose as much as $ 80 billion .
Once again , his pessimism proved to be deadly accurate .
KDB and Lehman were unable to agree on a sale price .
A few weeks later , Lehman filed for bankruptcy .
The newspapers hailed Minerva as " the Internet economic president . "
The prediction , Park reflected later , was all in the data : " I looked at the mortgage market in America , the oil market , the economic cycle , the circulation of capital .
I analyzed all of these and determined the result . "
Under the cloak of anonymity , Park believed he could insulate his real life from the adulation surrounding his online presence .
Minerva had no published email address , and Park read only a few of the hundreds of comments that accumulated beneath his posts .
Wearing the mask of Minerva allowed him to set aside the polite restraint that characterized his personal emails .
As Minerva , he wrote with fiery bombast , comparing the gravity of the crisis to Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima .
Minerva 's ascendance , he now believes , was due to the " pure purpose " of his writing — the sincere desire to help his readers ride out the crisis .
" Some people use the Internet for money or fame , " he said later .
" I did n't . "

When the media began hailing Minerva as an oracle , Park did not revel in the glory .
If anything , awareness of his growing authority made him take more care with his predictions .
He worried about leading his frightened countrymen astray .
And as weeks flew by and Minerva 's name towered in the headlines , Park began to fear that he might be unmasked .
Names are supposed to function like credit ratings : one account per person ; one person per account ; the account sticks with you for life .
Good credit builds up gradually , and a few bad decisions can undo years of steady responsibility .
Tell some lies or make wild predictions and soon no one will listen to you .
For those who already hold authority , the best way to keep it is to speak carefully and conservatively .
This is why the people we listen to most closely in times of economic uncertainty — the central bankers and finance ministers — have trouble warning of impending crises until they are obvious to just about everyone .
The authorities have too much at stake to risk being wrong .
Writing as a Roman goddess , Park discovered the power of taking on another name .
Had he posted under his own , no one would have paid attention .
As Minerva , however , he could easily be mistaken for a powerful official who had assumed a pseudonym for an entirely different reason : to speak the truth without imperiling his career .
Park did nothing to discourage this inference , referring , for example , to his extensive Wall Street experience .
The press could n't resist trying to puzzle out his identity .
Anonymous Internet posters are often denounced as hit - and - run artists who intimidate the polite and the sincere .
Indeed , online spaces that are rich in anonymity and poor in moderation risk devolving into a cesspool of trolls , flacks , and flame warriors .
But here and there , the Internet elevates anonymous voices who speak unvarnished truths that would have gone unrecognized had they appeared below their authors ' real names .
Zero Hedge 's Tyler Durden , The Funded 's ( formerly anonymous ) Adeo Ressi , and the irascible Bike Snob NYC are all credits to the equalizing power of anonymity .
This phenomenon predates the Internet by centuries .
In 16th - century England , a band of heretics moved an illegal printing press around the countryside , publishing a series of anticlerical pamphlets under the name Martin Marprelate .
In Rome around the same time , the Italian public took to criticizing the powerful in long , humorous , unsigned verse , surreptitiously slapped up on the base of a statue in the Piazza Pasquino , a tradition that continues to this day .
Two hundred years later , Alexander Hamilton , John Jay , and James Madison aired early arguments for the founding of the US in the Federalist papers under the handle Publius .
The last time the US fell under a Minerva - scale pseudonymous sensation was in 1996 , when Joe Klein 's Primary Colors — a novel signed Anonymous — satirized the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton ( in the guise of silver - tongued governor Jack Stanton ) .
The narrator nailed such particulars as Clinton 's " furrowed brow , pouty - mouthed , elementary - school - penitent look . "
The book sold about 3 million copies .
Park updated this tradition for the Internet , where archival facts are available on demand , the stream of international news never stops , and sites like Wikileaks and Cryptome make anonymity available to anyone with an ax to grind , a secret to share , or a document to leak .
Like the pamphleteers of earlier days , Minerva established himself as a consistent character on the public stage .
His writing was distinctive enough for readers to feel they knew him , while the vagueness of his identity allowed them to idealize him as a sage who would guide them through the crisis .
The Minerva case is a reminder that anonymity has uses beyond the incognito bashing of enemies .
A carefully crafted pseudonymous voice can seem to come from a hidden spring of wisdom — enunciating what everyone wants to hear and what no one is willing to say .
But the illusion is fragile .
When the person behind the name is revealed , everything comes crashing down .
The first sign of trouble came when Park 's phone rang in early October .
It was a representative from Daum asking if he would be willing to speak with a journalist .
Park hung up in a panic .
He had told no one about his secret , not even his sister .
But he had submitted his national ID and phone numbers when setting up the Minerva account .
So someone at Daum , he assumed , must have handed it over .
Then , a few weeks later , the government 's finance minister reportedly urged Minerva to step forward so that he could correct the blogger 's faulty notions about the country 's financial policy ( the minister later denied having made such a statement ) .
When this invitation went unanswered , the attorney general announced an investigation into Minerva 's true identity .
Fearing exposure , Park began to scale back his blogging .
" I will shut my mouth because the nation ordered me to be silent , " he wrote .
A few days into 2009 he posted an epic farewell , which he hoped would cement Minerva 's legacy .
Entitled " We Must Rely on Hope , " it contained fantastical confessions about Minerva 's life as a selfish financier and begged his readers to turn away from a life of greed : " Devils finance capitalism .
Do n't live like me .
Please take care of your family and yourself ...
Rescue yourself from money .
It 's made of paper and ink . "
His farewell ends , " I apologize again .
I 'm really sorry .
I can only say sorry , nothing else . "
Two days later , Park was packing up his cell phone and laptop , getting ready to meet some friends , when the doorbell rang .
Looking through the peephole he saw nothing .
Whoever it was had covered the lens .
Tentatively , he cracked the door open .
Four plainclothes investigators pushed past him , displaying a warrant .
" Would you come with us ? " one asked .
" We need to ask you some questions . "
Even after Minerva had become a regular topic on the evening news , a part of Park continued to believe the world of Daum and the world of his apartment would remain forever separate .
Now they had collided , and the police were gathering up his two computers , his external hard drive , his CDs and books .
Soon the terrified Park was on his way to an interview room near the city courthouse .
" Are you Minerva ? " a detective asked .
" Yes , " said Park Dae - Sung , for the first time .
" I am Minerva . "
The more notorious a pseudonymous writer becomes , the more fame itself begins to threaten the author 's anonymity .
Journalist Joe Klein repeatedly denied any connection to Primary Colors , at one point swearing on his professional credibility that he was not the book 's author .
He kept up these repudiations for months until a reporter from The Washington Post got his hands on a manuscript and established that notes made on the pages matched Klein 's handwriting .
When the truth came out , many journalists were outraged .
Of course , the fallout can be much worse :
The printer who produced Martin Marprelate 's pamphlets in the 1500s was hanged .
Today anonymous dissenters are unlikely to be punished in democratic countries .
But the law in South Korea makes it easy for the government to unmask troublesome writers .
Every account on Daum and other major sites is associated with a national ID number .
In Minerva 's case , Daum promptly handed over his IP address , which led the police directly to Park 's door .
Even without government intervention , most well - known pseudonymous writers are eventually exposed .
Daniel Lyons ' Secret Diary of Steve Jobs blog followed a classic rise - and - fall story line : a moderate stream of attention boiling into a torrent of public speculation about who was behind it , and then a complete loss of interest after the mystery was solved .
( Lyons is now a columnist for Newsweek . )
Still , a few pseudonymous writers have escaped exposure .
The most prominent is probably Junius , who penned a series of popular open letters that ran in the Public Advertiser in late - 18th - century England .
Written in disguised handwriting , the letters contain a mixture of musings on the rights of man and blistering attacks on the corrupt ministers of King George III .
Whoever Junius was , he took his anonymity to the grave .
Almost 240 years later , historians still have n't settled the question of the vindictive scribe 's true identity .
Occasionally , a writer can export his credibility from his online persona to his real one .
In early 2008 , Nate Silver had a double identity , analyzing baseball statistics under his real name and polling data under the handle Poblano .
When Poblano 's predictions began to gain a following , he revealed himself , noting , " It just ai n't very professional to keep referring to yourself as a chili pepper . "
Soon his FiveThirty Eight became one of the most prominent political blogs in the US .
Silver , the great exception , took control of his own outing , never lying to the public about his true identity and possessing real credentials to back up his virtual authority .
His pseudonymity worked as marketing , but the world probably would have paid attention had he written under his own name .
Park , on the other hand , was totally dependent on being unknown .
At their heart , most pseudonymous identities are collaborations between the author , who provides the outline of a persona , and the audience , which fills in the blanks .
The result is a sort of virtual superhero , an oracle more accurate than any mortal could hope to be .
Compared to the elusive mastermind of the collective imagination , the real author inevitably disappoints .
For 103 days , the South Korean government held Park in a 50 - square - foot cell at a Seoul detention center .
Interrogators asked about his family , whether he had a girlfriend , whether he was a spy .
He tried to keep calm , meeting with his volunteer legal team and studying the writings of the early - 20th - century Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci .
" I felt so isolated , " he says .
" They accused me of selling out my country .
No !
I 'm not a spy .
I wanted to help through my criticism .
I had thought that South Korea was a democratic country .
I felt as though my nation betrayed me . "
Then , in April , when the bedraggled young Park anxiously took a seat in the courtroom , Minerva 's world collapsed .
Now the whole country could see that the brilliant financier they had been betting their livelihoods on was an impostor , the sort of schlumpy nobody who might show up to install your cable .
In the glare of public scrutiny , Park not only lost his authority , he began to lose his sense of self .
At trial , the government argued that false information published by Park had rattled currency markets and panicked thousands of citizens into selling off dollars , at a cost to the government of $ 2.2 billion .
This , asserted the prosecution , violated a law forbidding the use of a computer to " spread a false rumor maliciously intending to damage the public interest . "
They asked for a prison sentence of 18 months .
Among the experts who testified on Park 's behalf was Kim Tae -Dong , an economics professor at Seoul 's Sungkyunkwan University who once served as an adviser to South Korea 's president .
" Minerva is a much better teacher than I am , " Kim said later .
" His writing is so easy for ordinary people to understand .
I was surprised about his lack of a formal economics background . "
The judge agreed with Kim 's argument : Even if the Minerva posts about the government 's policies were false , Park sincerely believed them .
Park was acquitted of all charges .
Waiting outside the prison gates were his mother , his legal retinue , and news photographers .
But Park 's legal vindication did n't solve his problems .
For one , South Korean law allowed the government to appeal the case in the hopes of prosecuting Park again .
Worse , media ambushes left him fearful of returning home in the days and weeks after his release .
" He 's been anxious since he went to jail , " one of his attorneys says .
" He 's been forgetting things .
It 's hard for him to communicate . "
Prosecutors still had his computers and hard drive .
He had n't been blogging or writing email or even answering his phone .
After his trial , Park likened his situation to that of a soldier who had fought in Iraq : " Losing Minerva ... it 's like post - traumatic stress disorder .
Consciously , I think I 'm all right .
But unconsciously , I know something is wrong .
I have n't been writing at all .
I 'm feeling a lot of mental pressure .
I had to stop writing not because I wanted to stop but because they forced me to stop .
Now I 'm having trouble starting again .
It feels like I lost a part of myself . "
When Park lost his anonymity , he lost his credibility as well .
Rather than accept that the ramblings of a self - educated freelancer were superior to their daily newspapers , most of the public wrote off the cult of Minerva as a fad .
Daum 's hardcore readership became consumed by conspiracy theories about the identity of the real Minerva , who must have set up Park through some Byzantine plot .
A few weeks after his release , the apartment where Park invented Korea 's foremost economic authority looked immaculate .
A wall calendar was X'ed up through January 7 , the day of his arrest .
On the wall above the desk in his bedroom were no stock indexes or candlestick charts , just inspirational magazine clippings — images of cars , sneakers , Jesus nailed to the cross , and ads for MBA programs .
One read : must be a success .
Hanging on the wall was an empty diploma frame .
" It does n't mean anything , " Park said flatly .
He added , " I used to have friends , but not since my arrest .
The police called them up and now they 're frightened . "
From time to time , a grateful reader who saw his picture in the newspaper or online recognizes him on the street .
One woman even sent him a thank - you box of ginseng , in care of his attorneys .
His plans are unclear .
He mentions fantasies of fleeing his homeland for somewhere that would appreciate him .
This fall , he wrote periodically about personal finance for a local newspaper .
Next he plans to write a book .
His predictions are more conservative now , though , and the earth - shattering power of a national following has not returned .
The government may have failed to obtain a conviction , but in unmasking Park it succeeded in destroying most of Minerva 's public standing .
Prosecutors will have another chance to put Park behind bars this winter , when their appeal reaches South Korea 's second - highest court .
It is very difficult to find anyone in the South Korean government willing to talk about Minerva .
The prosecutors say they can't discuss the case until the appeal is over .
Two spokespeople for the Korea Communication Standards Commission explain that they were n't directly involved with the case , though they do have as many as 50 employees watching Daum and other sites at any given time .
" We have to protect our children and our public , " one of them explains .
" That 's the government 's job , to maintain a nice , clean Internet . "
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Strategy and Finance says Park was beneath their notice .
" If his theories were made by a publicly recognized institute , we might have some comment .
And it is not appropriate for the government to comment on forecasts published by citizens on the Internet . "
Months before , the head of the same ministry had argued that Minerva 's influence over exchange rates had cost billions .
Now , however , the government had nothing to fear .
Once again , as it had been during his whole previous life , Park could be treated like any other nobody .

This could have been a year of joy for Europe .
The 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall will be commemorated in November , and it has been five years since the European Union 's " Big Bang " enlargement .
The Cold War division of the continent is well and truly over .
But , instead of setting off fireworks , the EU finds itself under fire as the global economic crisis confronts it with the greatest challenge it has seen since 1989 .
After years of strong growth and remarkable resilience , the EU 's new member states in Eastern Europe are being hit hard by the economic turmoil that started in the West .
Integration into the global economy - a crucial source of capital , stability and innovation - has become a threat to many of these countries .
This is true both of the region 's financial sectors and its real economies .
But the tough question that has to be asked is whether the crisis could lead to the unraveling of European integration .
There are four key issues that need to be tackled to ensure that Europe emerges from this crisis strengthened .
The first issue concerns the continuation of enlargement .
The EU is an indisputable success , constituting the largest integrated economic area in the world and accounting for more than 30 percent of world gross domestic product and about 17 percent of world trade .
But EU membership has always been about more than economic integration and trade flows .
Today , membership is a more powerful incentive than ever for what the EU calls three " candidate countries " - Croatia , Macedonia and Turkey - and five " potential candidate countries " - Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 , Montenegro and Serbia .
The second key issue concerns the EU 's internal structure .
The Lisbon Treaty offers a fundamental redesign of how the union works , but despite the pressing need to enhance EU institutions ' mobility and flexibility it is still awaiting ratification .
The economic crisis makes it more important than ever to introduce these reforms .
Third , there is the euro .
The 12 new member states that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 committed themselves to its adoption , but with no set date .
Expansion of the euro zone has therefore been slow , especially in Central and Eastern Europe , where to date only Slovenia and Slovakia have become members of the single currency .
But the financial and economic crisis has demonstrated the benefits of euro membership .
Ten years after the common currency 's introduction , the 16 - member euro zone has the world 's second - most important currency , accounting for more than a quarter of all central banks ' foreign - exchange reserves and having overtaken the dollar as the currency of choice for global bond issues .
The final issue concerns European solidarity .
EU enlargement brought greater prosperity , with living standards improving throughout the union , particularly in the new member states .
But many of the older members also benefited and not only in economically measurable ways .
The growing together of people , regions and countries underpins the foundations on which Europe rests .
The EU 's newcomers have adopted growth models that rely to varying degrees on foreign capital to finance domestic investment and on banking systems that are largely owned by West European banks .
It is a model that has served new and old member states well .
This process enabled West European companies and banks to expand into new markets with higher growth rates and thereby satisfying pent - up demand and tapping unrealized potential .
This has created jobs in Central and Eastern Europe , while boosting prosperity in the older member states .
To turn our backs on these countries would have serious economic ramifications .
The EU drew the right conclusions when it stressed that national bank rescue packages must not be designed in ways that starve subsidiaries , and also by doubling - to 50 billion euros ( $ 71.8 billion ) - the crisis funds available to EU countries outside the euro zone .
The EU must not stand aside when solidarity is needed .
Today 's crisis offers an opportunity to show that the EU can provide stability , support and solidarity .
By taking the right steps now , the EU is laying the foundations that will enable it to emerge from today 's difficulties strengthened and more united .
There once was a huge boulder , perched precariously , on the edge of a cliff .
For hundreds of
years this boulder was there , rocking and swaying , but always keeping its balance just perfectly .
But one year , there happened to be a sever windstorm ; severe enough it was , to topple the
boulder from its majectic height and dash it to the bottom cf the cliff , far far below .
Needless to
say , the boulder was smashed into many pieces .
Where it hit , the ground was covered with a
carpet of pebbles -- some small and some large -- but pebbles and pebbles and more pebbles for
as far as you could walk in an hour .
One day , after all this , a young man by the name of Ichabod happened on the area .
Being a
fellow of keen mind and observational powers , naturally he was quite astounded to see so many
stones scattered so closely on the ground .
Now Ichabod was very much interested in the nature
of things , and he spent the whole afternoon looking at pebbles , and measuring the size of
pebbles , and feeling the weight of pebbles , and just pondering about pebbles in general .
He spent the night there , not wanting to lose this miraculous find , and awoke the next morning full
of enthusiasm .
He spent many days on his carpet of stones .
Eventually he noticed a very strange thing .
There were three rather large stones on the carpet
and they formed a triangle -- almost ( but not quite ) equilateral .
He was amazed .
Looking further
he found four very white stones that were arranged in a lopsided square .
Then he saw that by
disregarding one white stone and thinking of that grey stone a foot over instead , it was a perfect
square !
And if you chose this stone , and that stone , and that one , and that one and that one
you have a pentagon as large as the triangle .
And here a small hexagon .
And there a square
partially inside of the hexagon .
And a decagon .
And two triangles inter-locked .
And a circle .
And a smaller circle within the circle .
And a triangle within that which has a red stone , a grey
stone and a white stone .
Ichabod spent many hours finding many designs that became more and more complicated as his
powers of observation grew with practice .
Then he began to log his designs in a large leather
book ; and as he counted designs and described them , the pages began to fill as the sun
continued to return .
He had begun his second ledger when a friend came by .
His friend was a poet and also
interested in the nature of things .
" My friend , " cried Ichabod , " come quickly !
I have discovered the most wonderous thing in the
universe . "
The poet hurried over to him , quite anxious to see what it was .
Ichabod showed him the carpet of stones ... but the poet only laughed and said " It 's nothing but
scattered rocks ! "
" But look , " said Ichabod , ' see this triangle and that [ square ] and that and that . "
And he
proceeded to show his friend the harvest of his many days study .
When the poet saw the designs
he turned to the ledgers and by the time he was finished with these , he too was overwhelmed .
He began to write poetry about the marvelous designs .
And as he wrote and contemplated he
became sure that the designs must mean something .
Such order and beauty is too monumental
to be senseless .
And the designs were there , Ichabod had showed him [ that . ]
The poet went back to the village and read his new poetry .
And all who heard him went to the cliff
to see first hand the [ carpet ] of designs .
And all returned to the village to spread the word .
Then
as the enthusiasm grew there developed a group of those who love beauty and nature , all of
whom went to live right at the Designs themselves .
Together they wanted to see every design
that was there .
Some wrote ledger about just triangles .
Others described the circles .
Others concentrated on
red colored stones -- and they happened to be the first to see designs springing from outside the
carpet .
They , and some others , saw designs everywhere they went .
" How blind we have been , " they said .
The movement grew and grew and grew .
And all who could see the designs knew that they had
to have been put there by a Great Force .
" Nothing but a Great Force , " said the philosophers ,
" could create this immense beauty ! "
" Yes , " said the world , " nothing but a god could create such magnificent order .
Nothing but a
God . "
And that was the day that God was born .
And ever since then , all men have known Him for His
infinite power and all men have loved Him for His infinite wisdom .

Mail - followup - to : Andreas Barth < aba@not.so.argh.org > , debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org
Hi , since our recent release update , things have been moving a bit .
We 'd like to give you the basic status of all our architectures for Squeeze , for details please see the individual mails ( and " basic status " does n't cover all details of course ) .
kfreebsd ~~~~~~~~
It looks like we could really release Squeeze with both a Linux port and a non-Linux port ( i.e. kfreebsd-{amd64,i386} .
However , we still have about 250 packages in Squeeze which are not installable due to missing dependencies , and 4000 packages not at all in Squeeze for kfreebsd .
On the other hand , most of the issues are just " part of a larger transition " and will clear up by itself over time .
Also there are good news on the debian - installer for kfreebsd .
In all , the port looks very promising , but of course there are still many topics to tackle .
For this reason , our testing migration scripts will soon start to treat out - of - date on kfreebsd as a blocking issue for testing migration .
Also normal bug severities apply now for kfreebsd - specific bugs ( meaning : there could be RC - bugs that are specific for kfreebsd ) .
We will however still allow testing migrations to happen which increase the count of uninstallable packages on kfreebsd only , as the uninstallability - count needs to be a bit lower to turn that off - nothing too dramatic should happen there though .
alpha ~~~~~
After we sent mails to debian - alpha last month we came together with the porters to the conclusion that we cannot keep up this port for Squeeze .
We will start purging the packages from testing in about a fortnight .
Bugs specific to alpha are no longer release critical .
amd64 ~~~~~
Everything ok .
armel ~~~~~
The buildd speed is n't always as wanted , but work is underway to replace machines with newer hardware .
Also there are discussions on getting the buildds within DSA - control after that ; we would appreciate that .
Anyways , nothing really worries us .
hppa ~~~~
Porters have pushed this architecture much forward .
The architecture looks overall quite better than it did 6 weeks ago .
We hope that this continues this way .
Contrary to what we discussed , we will not push hppa to " out - of - date - packages are ok " for testing migration at this time .
There is no final decision yet from our side , but we want to avoid the additional effort that putting hppa to " out - of - date - packages are ok " requires from the porters .
However to be included within Squeeze , more issues like e.g. the current stability problems need to be resolved .
i386 ~~~~
Everything ok .
mips * ~~~~~
Mipsel is also suffering from low buildd speed sometimes , but new boards are currently being shipped to hosting , so this should resolve soon .
We do n't expect really issues for Squeeze .
powerpc ~~~~~~~
Nothing to worry right now .
s390 ~~~~
Porters spoke to us that there are issues to worry about , especially lack of access to newer hardware .
We received generous offers from users of that port , so we currently assume that the issues will be resolved in time for Squeeze .
We would like to get buildds DSAed on this architecture as well .
sparc ~~~~~
Nothing that needs to worry us for Squeeze but only long - term is how to transition sparc to sparc 64 .
Upstream slowly starts to consider sparc ( 32 ) outdated and deprecated , and we need to get to an decision how to deal with that .
Might be that multiarch is part of the answer , but deciding what the best answer is needs to be done by porters , and the answer should be given pre-Squeeze ( does n't necessarily need to be fully implemented ) .
Cheers , Andi Debian Release Team
Cell phones smell .
You would n’t think so , but they do .
The K - 9 Unit of the New Jersey Department of Corrections , while training seven recently acquired cell - phone - sniffing dogs , first put a whole bunch of cell - phone parts in a plastic box to create a kind of sachet of cell - phone scent for use in imprinting .
The basic , pervasive cell - phone smell that built up in the closed box was powerful — a sweetish , metallic , ozoney , weird robotic reek .
People would never carry such a rank object as a cell phone in their pockets if their noses were as good as a dog’s .
To Troy , Ernie , Chance , and the other muscular , well - fed , and extremely enthusiastic dogs who search for illegal cell phones inside New Jersey ’s thirteen state prisons , the smell of a cell phone is bliss .
They love to follow it , love finding its source even more .
While held in restraint , just before the search , they emit low , well - disciplined whines of almost unbearable expectation .
And when they do find the cell phone — or the cell - phone charger , the earpiece , the battery , or any other related object that somehow picked up cell - phone scent ( recently a cell - phone - sniffing dog , though not trained to search for narcotics , found some narcotics that had evidently been stored next to a cell phone ) — the dogs react with a panting , whining , scratching happiness greater than any human happiness by a factor similar to that by which a dog ’s sense of smell is said to be better than ours .
Inside a prison , cell phones defeat some of the purpose of incarceration .
They ’re among the biggest problems prison officials face .
Criminals with cell phones continue to run their gangs even while locked up .
How do they get the phones ?
“ Oh , gee — all kinds of ways , ” Thomas Moran , the New Jersey D.O.C. chief of staff , said the other day .
“ Their friends shoot ’em over the fence with potato guns , fly ’em in on model airplanes , arrows . . .
Body cavities , of course , when a girlfriend visits .
Packages .
Food deliveries .
F.C.C. regulations say we ca n’t interfere with cell - phone transmissions by jamming .
Going after the illegal phones with dogs is by far the most efficient means . ”
Recently , the officers of the K - 9 Unit held a demonstration with their cell - phone dogs on the grounds of the Albert C. Wagner Youth Correctional Facility , in central Jersey farm country .
The officers are so proud of their dogs they beam .
As the dogs found cell phones hidden in lockers and near bunks in an unused dorm building , and sniffed out a dog - tooth - marked cell phone in the weeds of a field , the officers explained the program .
Captain Matthew Kyle :
“ We do n’t want to publicate what the cell - phone smell is exactly .
It ’s an organic substance that ’s in all cell phones — leave it at that .
The dogs can smell it even when it ’s masked .
They can find it if the cell phone ’s in water , oil , peanut butter — anywhere . ”
Sergeant William Crampton : “ Only time we ever had a dog indicate inaccurately was on a diabetic test kit one individual had . ”
Officer Donald Mitchell : “ We worked with thirteen dogs to get the seven we have now .
Some dogs we had to fail out for environmental reasons .
The dog ca n’t work in the prison environment .
Maybe a dog do n’t like the slippery floors in the cellblock , or the noise , or the food odors .
Some dogs do n’t like heights .
On the top tier of cells you ’re looking down through a floor grating four or five stories .
There ’s dogs wo n’t walk on that .
Or they do n’t like the heat up there in the summer . ”
Officer Joseph Nicholas : “ All our dogs right now are German shepherds or Labs .
We did try one golden retriever , but we had to fail him out .
That dog was too easygoing .
He ’d come in a room on a search and just lay down .
We sent him back to the Seeing Eye dog center in Morristown , where all our cell - phone dogs came from .
That golden was a lover , not a fighter . ”
Captain Kyle : “ Very few other states have cell - phone - dog programs like ours — Maryland and Virginia are two of them .
There ’s a private contractor in California that trains dogs for cell - phone work , but they charge twenty - one thousand dollars for three dogs .
We trained all our dogs ourselves , saving the taxpayers money .
Since we started with our first three dogs , in October of 2008 , we ’ve found a hundred and thirty - three cell phones , a hundred and twenty - eight chargers , and I ’m not sure how many earpieces , batteries , and other items .
We believe that eventually every prison system in the country will be using cell - phone dogs . ” ♦
The shield protected Lanni from the downward blows , but Chitwood said had the sword gotten past the shield , it would have been " sturdy enough to put in your heart and rip it out . "

I 'm married .
NY recognizes it .
They want to take it away .
This sh*t be personal .
by Jeremy Hooper
FACT : New York has a history of recognizing marriages that were legally performed elsewhere , even if they were n't legal in the Empire State itself .
Common - law marriages are one instance .
Another is in the case of unions from states where the legal age to marry is / was lower than in NY .
And there have even been instances where certain kinds of relatives were able to legally hitch it in another state , so NY had to obey the union .
FACT : Recent polling data shows that New Yorkers support same - sex marriage .
More here .
FACT : New York state basically has de facto marriage right now .
But by forcing couples to go across state lines in order to get married , the state is simply exporting the economic benefits .
FACT : New York state does not have a so - called DOMA law .
FACT : Some of the arguments that have been used to deny comity in the past are quite unfortunate to look back upon now .
If you get some time , check out some of these snippets from author and researcher Peter Wallenstein .
Some of the interracial marriage comments are beyond hostile .
it seems that when it comes to denying something as easy and natural as love , short - sighted bias has tended to play a role in the arguments of those who wish to deny comity .
That 's how this writer , an actual gay New Yorker in a legally - recognized same - sex marriage , see things .
Now listen to how the Colorado Springs - based activists with Focus on the Family view the Arizona - based Alliance Defense Fund 's attempt to f*** with Empire State law :
ADF Lawsuits Try to Stop New York from Recognizing Out - of - State Gay Marriages [ FOF ]
FACT : These folks would force us at cross - point to take back our wedding - gifted waffle irons if they thought they could get away with it .
FACT : They can't and they wo n't .
Our victory is inevitable .
never forget that .
Your thoughts
I find it somewhat amusing that one of the voices says ( paraphrased ) : " Let the citizens of New York vote for themselves . "
How can they vote for themselves when groups like FOF , NOM etc pour tons of money to SWAY the opinions ( facts ) to those voting ?

Thank you for the talking points .
This absolutely pisses me off , ' cause my wife and I are in the same situation as you and your husband .
Actually , L'Ailee and I were forcibly legally divorced by Massachusetts judges once ( like other out - of - state same - sex couples ) , but went back there to get legally married again last year .
To have these carpetbaggers come in and try to yank it out from under us and couples like us again has us so angry we see white .
And you know , I think the ADF and FOTF really * would * like to make us take back our wedding gifts ( and spend the money on ex-gay " therapy " ) if they could !

Barack Obama 's speech to Wall Street guardian.co.uk
President Barack Obama delivered a stern warning to Wall Street today that bankers must scrap " quick kills and bloated bonuses " in favour of a new sense of social responsibility as the first anniversary of Lehman Brothers ' spectacular bankruptcy dawns with a sense of fragile hope for an economic recovery .
On a visit to the heart of New York 's financial district a year on from the collapse of Wall Street 's fourth largest bank which threw the global financial system into disarray , President Obama expressed confidence to an audience of senior figures in the financial world that " the storms of the past two years are beginning to break " .
But during an address inside a hall directly opposite the New York Stock Exchange which briefly quieted Wall Street 's usual hubbub , the White House incumbent ordered the financial community to move further in cleaning up its act .
" There are some in the financial industry who are misreading this moment .
Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are recovering , they are choosing to ignore them , " said Obama .
" We will not go back to the days of reckless behaviour and unchecked excess that were at the heart of this crisis , where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses . "
Obama has come under pressure from liberal Democrats , and from leaders of European nations , to be tougher in cracking down on bonuses and on unfettered risk taken by top US institutions .
His appearance brought hundreds of financiers onto the street to stand outside Federal Hall , site of the inauguration of George Washington , and his language was far from sympathetic .
Obama urged the leaders of top financial institutions to " embrace serious financial reforms " rather than fighting them , with a pledge of the biggest overhaul of regulation since the Great Depression . "
" It was a collective failure of responsibility in Washington , on Wall Street and across America that led to the near collapse of our financial system one year ago , " said Obama .
He told bankers that they should not wait for legislative action forcing them to translate financial products into plain language , put executive pay up for shareholder votes and alter bonuses to focus on long - term , rather than short - term , performance .
" Many of the firms that are now returning to prosperity owe a debt to the American people , " said Obama .
" It is neither right nor responsible after you 've recovered with the help of your government to shirk your obligation to the goal of wider recovery , a more stable system and a more broadly shared prosperity . "
Although the president 's address was billed in the US media as a " cautious victory speech " , experts warn that the world 's largest economy is far from free of trouble .
More than 450 US banks and mortgage lenders have gone out of business and a further 416 are on a regulatory watch list of troubled firms .
With 6.9 million people out of work , US unemployment stands at 9.7 % , its highest since 1983 .
Nouriel Roubini , the economist nicknamed " Doctor Doom " for his accurate early forecasting of the credit crunch , said vast losses in credit cards , student loans , commercial property and car loans are still working their way through the system , inhibiting any return to growth .
" All these losses , slowly , slowly , are adding up .
It 's going to be death by a thousand cuts .
You 're not going to have another blowout like Lehman because we decided nobody systemically important is going to be allowed to collapse but the financial system is severely damaged , " said Roubini .
The Obama administration 's plans to avert future crises include a sharpening of financial regulation to cover hitherto free - for - all markets in hedge funds and exotic derivatives , tougher powers for the Federal Reserve to monitor banks considered " too big to fail " and shareholder votes intended to counter excessive pay deals in corporate boardrooms .
Mortgage companies will be obliged to hang onto part of every loan , rather than selling them on to shed risk .
But the White House has backed away from earlier efforts to cap bankers ' pay .
Stocks were subdued on both sides of the Atlantic as analysts reflected on a year 's progress in cleaning up the banking system .
The FTSE 100 index closed with a rise of 7 points to 5,018 and by lunchtime in New York , the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 27 points to 9,578 .
The public have not forgiven bankers for their role in the global economic downturn .
An international opinion poll across the G20 member nations by Globespan / PIPA for the BBC World Service found that only 32 % of people are satisfied with the actions of banking executives to address the crisis .
In Britain , views of the City are particularly negative with only 20 % declaring themselves satisfied with bankers ' behaviour and 78 % unhappy after a year in which bonuses , derivatives and trading have become a subject of vitriolic popular discontent .
A sense of suspicion is mutual .
Among financial professionals , few are willing to extend gratitude to government officials and taxpayers for intervening to prop up the banking system .
Bob Iati , global head of consulting at the strategic advisory firm Tabb Group , said : " Those in the industry are very reticent to give the government credit for turning business around .
Most are in favour of less regulation and certainly do n't believe politicians have a good sense of what 's going on . "

Bernie Ecclestone now doubts that Donington Park will be ready in time to host the 2010 British Grand Prix even if the circuit bosses can secure the required funding package .
Donington had been given until the end of this week to prove to Ecclestone that it had the finance in place to complete the comprehensive rebuild required to host Formula 1 next year .
The F1 commercial rights - holder hinted that he had not written off the circuit completely at this stage - replying " wait until Monday to write the truth " when asked by the Daily Telegraph if the latest deadline had been missed .
But he admitted that he was now very pessimistic about Donington 's chances .
" It 's not good , is it ? " Ecclestone told The Times .
" Even if they get the money , I can not see how it will all be ready in time to go .
" It is very disappointing because we thought it would happen , but they can not go on missing deadlines .
" They could still come to us saying they have the money , but there is no way the circuit would be ready at this late stage .
It looks as though we will have to start planning again . "
Donington has a 17 - year deal to hold the British GP , but needed to make substantial changes to its infrastructure , access , and paddock facilities as well as redesigning the circuit to feature an additional infield loop .
This work began earlier in 2009 , but is a long way from completion and has been delayed by both planning and financial issues .
Ecclestone had initially been adamant that Donington was the only option for the British GP 's future , but he has since indicated that present home Silverstone would be allowed to step in if Donington was not ready .
Next year 's British GP is provisionally scheduled for 9 - 11 July .
A report to be published this month by the U.S. government ’s prestigious National Defense University warns that the Iraqi army and police are becoming pawns of sectarian political parties — a trend that it calls “ a recipe for civil war . ”
The report by Najim Abed al - Jabouri , a former Iraqi mayor and police chief who helped run the first successful counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq after the U.S. invasion , also concludes that U.S. forces have failed to use their remaining leverage as trainers to insulate the Iraqi army and police from the influence of powerful Shi’ite and Sunni Muslim and Kurdish parties .
“ U.S. efforts to rebuild the [ Iraqi security forces ] have focused on much needed training and equipment , but have neglected the greatest challenge facing the forces ’ ability to maintain security upon U.S. withdrawal : an ISF politicized by ethno - sectarian parties , ” he wrote .
“ These ties pose the largest obstacle to the ISF in its quest to become genuinely professional and truly national in character .
A professional military force holds the best prospect of gaining and keeping the trust of the people , but a force riven with destructive sectarian and ethnic loyalties is a recipe for civil war . ”
The paper , made available to The Washington Times , carries particular weight considering its author .
Mr. al - Jabouri was the police chief and later the mayor of Tal Afar , a city in Ninevah province , in 2005 and 2006 when he and then - Col .
H.R. McMaster waged a counterinsurgency campaign that became the model for the strategy that was successfully employed in 2007 and 2008 throughout Iraq .
In a March 20 , 2006 , speech , President Bush singled out Mr. al - Jabouri , saying the U.S. was “ proud to have allies like Mayor Najim . ”
The strategy , which is now being applied in Afghanistan , requires the armed forces to earn the trust of the local population by providing security and by proving to be an honest broker of internecine disputes .
“ What gives this piece its particular value is that it comes from someone who provided the leadership necessary to help stop a brutal localized civil war , ” said Brig .
Gen. McMaster , who was promoted last year .
“ If it had not been for his courage and nonpartisan leadership and his reform of the police , we could not have moved the various communities in Tal Afar toward the political accommodation necessary to break the cycle of sectarian violence , ” he told The Times .
Under a U.S. - Iraq status of forces agreement , the U.S. is to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of 2011 .
The hope is that by then , Iraq will have security forces trusted by Shi’ite and Sunni Arabs , Kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities .
Adm . Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said in a recent interview with The Times that sectarian conflict poses the greatest challenge to Iraq ’s stability .
“ The biggest threat long - term would be the breakout of sectarian violence , ” he said last week .
“ I would extend that to your question about the sectarianism inside the military . …
The sectarian issue is one that we are very focused on .
It was a brutal , brutal teacher to so many of us .
I do n’t think Iraq has much of a future if that breaks out . ”
Adm .
Mullen said , however , that authorities had defused several potentially explosive incidents over the past few months without sectarianism raising “ its ugly head . ”
“ It did n’t happen , ” he said .
“ That is not a prescription for [ saying ] it wo n’t happen , for sure .
Except that all the leaders , political and military , recognize this could be their undoing . ”
Mr. al - Jabouri ’s assessment suggests that Iraqi restraint may melt away as U.S. troops withdraw and leave the Iraqis to their own devices .
He notes , for example , that many of Iraq ’s army divisions are more loyal to their political patrons than to the central government .
“ The majority of these divisions are under the patronage of a political party , ” he writes .
“ For example , the 8th [ Iraqi army ] division in Kut and Diwaniyah is heavily influenced by the Dawa Party [ of Shi’ite Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ] ; the 4th IA division in Salahuddin is influenced by President Jalal Talabani ’s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ; the 7th IA division in Anbar is influenced by the [ Sunni ] Iraqi Awakening Party , and the 5th IA division in Diyala is heavily influenced by the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , ” a Shi’ite political party with some ties to Iran .
“ The political parties are able to maintain influence over the divisions because the commanders and many of the soldiers were hired by the party , ” Mr. al - Jabouri wrote .
Iraq ’s ambassador to the United States , Samir Sumaida ’ie , told The Times that the report was too “ alarmist ” and “ a little bit out of date . ”
The ambassador , who served as Iraq ’s interior minister in 2004 , said , “ We went through a time when it was a serious concern , and there was a time when the security forces could become part of the problem and not the solution .
But we have gotten past that .
“ There has been very active and serious purging of officers and personnel who acted in a sectarian or party political sense .
Thousands were expelled .
The culture that prevails now is much more encouraging toward a national awareness and loyalty to the law of the land rather than ethnic or sectarian affiliation . ”
Mr. al - Jabouri ’s critique in some ways echoes an e-mail made public last month by the New York Times , from a U.S. military adviser in Baghdad .
Col. Timothy R. Reese concluded that Iraq ’s military has little interest in becoming a Western professional force .
But unlike Mr. Reese , Mr. al - Jabouri said the United States still has leverage and a window to push for reforms .
He recommended , for example , that Iraq ’s Ministry of Defense begin moving battalions to different divisions to break up the monopolies of some political parties in various regions .
The former police chief also said Iraq should “ redouble efforts at national reconciliation , ” remove corrupt ISF commanders , particularly in the Ministry of Interior , and enforce existing laws that prohibit political parties from meddling with the military .
On the last point , Mr. al - Jabouri said the government should allow more Iraqi media coverage of the military and national police and protect Iraqi judges investigating cases inside security services , particularly when they involve political parties .
His harshest charge was that the U.S. military has stood idly by as segments of the security services have become more beholden to political parties .
This is a particularly stinging indictment considering that U.S. policy since 2003 has been to train the Iraqi police and military to be a bulwark against civil war .
While some recent actions by the Iraqi military suggest progress — such as an offensive in 2008 in the southern city of Basra that pitted mostly Shi’ite Iraqi soldiers against renegade Shi’ite militias — Mr. al - Jabouri says Iraqi forces have a long way to go .
“ What the United States fails to realize is that the ISF itself is the battleground in the larger communal struggle for power and survival .
Middle Eastern concepts of civil - military relations are fundamentally different than Western concepts , ” he writes .
“ Western militaries have developed a culture of political control over armed forces .
While this may have been a tool for the development of Western democracies , this is not the established culture in either Iraq or the greater Middle East .
In Iraq , there is a culture of ‘ he who owns the security forces owns the politics . ’ ”
Adm . Mullen said the U.S. mission in Iraq was well aware of the problem and was responding to it .
“ I know this is something that Gen . [ Ray ] Odierno [ commander of U.S. forces in Iraq ] and his commanders address , ” Adm .
Mullen said .

Is it sexy to be spiritual ?
New research has found that spirituality has a greater effect on the sex lives of young adults — especially women — than religion , impulsivity , or alcohol .
“ I think people have been well aware of the role that religious and spiritual matters play in everyday life for a very long time , ” said Jessica Burris , one of the study ’s researchers at the University of Kentucky .
“ But in the research literature , the unique qualities of spirituality — apart from religiousness — are not usually considered . ”
According to a research measure known as the Spiritual Transcendence Scale , those qualities are connectedness , universality , and prayer fulfillment .
But the data found that of the three , connectedness plays the largest role in spiritual sexuality and leads to more sex with more partners , often without the use of condoms .
“ Believing one is intimately tied to other human beings and that interconnectedness and harmony are indispensible may lead one to believe sexual intimacy possesses a divine or transcendent quality in itself , ” Burris writes .
“ In fact , ascribing sacred qualities to sex has been positively associated with positive affective reactions to sex , frequency of sex , and number of sexual partners among university students . ”
The study ’s participants indeed were university students ; 353 undergraduates ( 61 percent of whom were female ) answered a questionnaire that asked them about their alcohol use , impulsivity , religiousness , spirituality , and sexual practices .
The statements on spirituality , which were ranked by level of agreement , included “ In the quiet of my prayers and / or meditations , I find a sense of wholeness , ” and “ Although individual people may be difficult , I feel an emotional bond with all of humanity . ”
The study found that spiritual men were n’t sexually affected — in fact , their frequency of sex decreased .
The researchers figure men might not view spirituality as sexual because they biologically do n’t think of sex as a gateway to emotional intimacy .
For women , however , spirituality was the strongest predictor for the number of sexual partners , the frequency of sex , and the tendency to have sex without a condom .
“ It is possible female young adults yearn for greater connectedness with other humans , ” Burris writes .
“ Spirituality , at least for women , could be considered a risk factor . ”
[ A separate review of studies last year found that sexually unsatisfied women who practiced the Eastern techniques of mindfulness and yoga reported improvements in levels of arousal and desire , as well as better orgasms . ]
But is it really spirituality that makes women more sexual , or does spirituality just imply an open - mindedness that manifests itself through sex ?
“ Research suggests that spirituality provides predictive utility over and above personality traits such as conscientiousness , extraversion , and openness , ” Burris told LiveScience .
“ So while it may be the case that spirituality is correlated with other variables that show similar relationships with human sexuality and sexual practices ( such as openness to experiences ) , the relationship we observed , in my opinion , cannot simply be explained away by other variables . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Half of those hospitalized with the new H1N1 virus are under 25 , a clear illustration that the pandemic is affecting the young disproportionately , U.S. health officials said on Tuesday .
They said reports from 27 U.S. states show 53 percent of people sick enough to be hospitalized with H1N1 flu are under the age of 25 , with only 7 percent of hospitalizations among people 65 and older .
“ This is really , really different from what we see with seasonal flu , ” the CDC’s Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters .
“ With seasonal flu , about 60 percent of hospitalizations occur in people 65 and over .
She stressed the report was incomplete but said if anything , it was underestimating the extent of the pandemic .
And an analysis of 292 deaths from 28 states showed that younger people than usual are also dying , she said .
“ Almost a quarter of deaths are occurring in young people under the age of 25 .
Specifically , 23.6 percent of the deaths are in that age group .
About 65 percent of the deaths are in people 25 to 64 years of age , ” Schuchat said .
Just 12 percent of deaths were among people over 65 .
In a normal year , 90 percent of those who die from flu are over 65 .
With cooler weather , other viruses and infections are showing up , making the picture confusing .
Schuchat said influenza is being diagnosed in about 30 percent of all people showing up with “ influenza - like illness , ” symptoms that include cough , sore throat , fever and aches .
Almost all influenza is turning out to be H1N1 rather than seasonal influenza and Schuchat said the tests often miss cases of H1N1 , so the percentage may be higher .
Ordinary colds , group A streptococcus , which causes “ strep throat ” , and other infections can cause similar symptoms .
The U.S. government is trying to vaccinate people against both seasonal influenza and H1N1 at the same time , making both vaccines available as manufacturers finish , bottle and get them approved batch by batch .
Five companies make both types for the U.S. market : Sanofi-Aventis SA , CSL Ltd , Novartis AG , GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca unit MedImmune .
Schuchat said H1N1 vaccine was becoming available slowly .
“ As of yesterday , 12.8 million doses were available for the states to order .
More than half of that was available in the injectable form .
So that ’s helpful , with giving us a variety of formulations , ” she said .
She said states had ordered 10.8 million doses so far .
Fallout MMO Licensing Dispute
Interplay 's Opposition To Motion For Preliminary Injunction
OriginalIP owner and current licensee Interplay has filed a counterclaim accusing currentowner Bethesda for breach of contract , claiming that Interplay 's ownMMO has a playable demo -- indicating production status -- and that Bethesda tried to grantMMO rights to sister company ZeniMax Online .
Interplay , which sold the rights of the venerable PC - derivedseries to Bethesda in 2007 for $ 5.75 million , alleged in an October 16 court filing that Bethesda breached theseries asset purchase agreement -- the same allegation that Bethesda put to Interplay .
" As a result of Bethesda 's breach of the [ asset purchase agreement ] , Interplay has suffered , is suffering , and will continue to suffer substantial damages and irreparable harm in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of this Court , " said Interplay 's filing , which was obtained by Gamasutra .
Bethesda filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of Maryland on September 9 requesting a preliminary and permanent injunction against Interplay 's manufacture , sale , and distribution of , which includes the classic PC gamesand .
Interplay retained the rights to sell the catalog titles as part of its deal with Bethesda .
But Bethesda accused Interplay of violating the deal , claiming that while Interplay was permitted to sell pre-existinggames , it was required to submit to Bethesda all relevant packaging , advertising , and promotional material prior to bringing the catalog titles to market .
Bethesda alleged that Interplay did not do so , causing confusion in the market , a claim that Interplay denied in its answer to the complaint .
Along with the asset purchase agreement , the two companies signed a trademark licensing agreement .
After Interplay sold off theseries , it licensed back from Bethesda the rights to develop an MMO based on the franchise .
The terms of the agreement stipulated that Interplay gather at least $ 30 million in funding and that full - scale development begin on aMMO within the 24 months after the deal was signed , or else license - owner Bethesda could take over full control of the MMO license .
Interplay 's counterclaim alleges that Bethesda is trying to grant the rights to develop aMMO to " another party . "
Detailing further , Interplay alleged , " On information and belief , Bethesda 's ultimate goal is to recapture through gamesmanship theMMOG rights and award them to its sister company , ZeniMax Online Studios , formation of which was announced in August 2007 , just four short months after the APA [ licensing agreement ] was signed .
" Interplay is suing for damages , legal fees and is asking a court to declare that Interplay still holds the particularrights originally detailed in the agreements .
Alternatively , Interplay said if Bethesda terminates its asset purchase agreement , the court should rescind the agreement and return the parties to the " status quo prior to that agreement 's execution " -- when Interplay still owned .
In that case , Bethesda might owe Interplay as much as $ 15 million or more from royalties toand its expansions .
In a separate court filing from October 26 in opposition to Bethesda 's motion for a preliminary injunction , Interplay reiterated its claims that it did not violate either of the agreements , that Interplay did not infringe on thetrademark , that Bethesda " cannot show imminent irreparable harm " from Interplay 's actions , and that the asset purchase agreement " contains no termination provision .
" That filing also said that Interplay originally sought " a much higher price " for thefranchise .
But Interplay agreed to the $ 5.75 million because it believed that it would be able to " exceed [ that amount ] by millions of dollars , " as its oldergames could ride the popularity of October 2008 's blockbuster , developed by Bethesda .
As for the MMO -- confirmed to be -- Interplay said that it has created over 600 pages of " extensive " design documents that include characters , weapons , concept art and other elements .
( Interestingly , Bethesda refused to approve use of thename for use with , and there 's now legal controversy around Interplay 's allusive workaround .
Interplay commented on the current name choice for the MMO , " Even if V13 is evocative of ' Vault 13 , ' the starting location of the originalgame developed by Interplay , Bethesda presents no evidence that it has used this or a substantially similar mark in commerce . " )
Interplay also said it , along with MMO studio Masthead , created agame demo " that included a playable portion of the 3D environment " as well as network code partly based on previous Masthead gameInterplay claimed this qualifies as " full production , " thus meeting the licensing agreement 's requirements .
The filing also said that Bethesda did not allow Interplay to announce its MMO asdue to trademark concerns .
"
The harm to Interplay 's business from an improperly granted preliminary injunction decidedly outweighs the risk to Bethesda of maintaining the status quo during litigation , " the filing read , noting that Interplay makes much of its current revenues from selling older versions of Gamasutra will continue to follow the ongoing litigation in the case .
Thus far , both sides are laying out their arguments , and no rulings have been made .
Yesterday , Mitch McConnell once again made it clear that Republicans are the party of no health care reform .
Today , speaking at the National Press Club , Michael Steele explained why :
Transcript :
260 million Americans currently have health insurance coverage , the great majority through private insurers , and polls consistently show that they are overwhelmingly pleased with their current coverage .
...
The vast majority of Americans like their health care coverage .
The vast majority of Americans like the quality of their health care .
The vast majority of Americans do n't want Uncle Sam to touch their health care .
What a stupid thing to say .
You can't make an argument that Americans do n't want health care reform when the fact is that a staggering majority supports getting something done to fix the system .
85 % of Americans support " fundamental changes " to or a " complete rebuild " of the health care system .
64 % believe the government should guarantee insurance for all Americans and 72 % think the government should offer a public option styled after Medicare to compete with private insurers .
Despite all this , Michael Steele -- along with every single Republican at the Federal level -- opposes health care reform .
It turns out The Waterloo moment Jim DeMint dreams of may in fact be on them .
The GOP is n't just pursuing bad policy , they are practicing bad politics .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  Pakistan moved thousands of troops into the militant stronghold of South Waziristan on Saturday , the army said , beginning a long - anticipated ground offensive against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in treacherous terrain that has stymied the army in the past .
The operation is the most ambitious by the Pakistani Army against the militants , who have unleashed a torrent of attacks against top security installations in the last 10 days in anticipation of the military assault .
The militants ’ targets included the army headquarters where planning for the new offensive had been under way for four months .
The United States has been pressing the army to move ahead with the campaign in South Waziristan , arguing that it is vital for Pakistan to show resolve against the Qaeda - fortified Pakistani Taliban , which now embrace a vast and dedicated network of militant groups arrayed against the nuclear - armed state .
The groups include some nurtured by Pakistan to fight India .
American officials have said the fighting there would probably not substantially help the American and NATO effort in Afghanistan because most militants who cross the border to fight there are from a different area in Pakistan and because the Taliban stronghold within South Waziristan is not directly along the border .
Existing Home Sales fell 5.4 % last month , despite the nonsense you have read elsewhere .
NAR continues to bullshit America with their garbage data and spin , month after month , with few people calling them on it .
Well , I ’ve had it up to here with their garbage : .
Big Rebound in Existing - Home Sales Shows First - Time Buyer Momentum Existing - home sales bounced back strongly in September with first - time buyers driving much of the activity , marking five gains in the past six months , according to the National Association of Realtors
No , home sales did not rebound — that was purely the result of SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS
As you can see on the NON SEASONALLY adjusted chart below , from August to September ( Red Bar ) Sales actually dropped .
In prior years — 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 — there was always a big fall from August to September .
This year , the fall was more modest .
Why was this year so different ?
We have ZIRP ( which will eventually go up ) and a large 1st time buyers tax credit that is scheduled to expire .
Hence , the unusual September activity that dos not reflect the traditional drop off .
Mark Hanson notes that on a NSA basis , Existing Home Sales actually dropped 5.2 % — this was the second straight monthly drop on an NSA basis .
Mark adds :
The NAR ’s attempt to annualize seasonality never before seen has resulted in a headline very far off base . . .
The fact is , Sept NSA sales were above last year ’s 438 k but below last month ’s 498 k coming in at 472 k as shown below .
In addition , sales prices fell .
This pulled - forward demand sets up the slow season to be one of the slowest on record .
The tax credit effectively extended the purchase season which is why sales were even this strong .
But when you consider the hundreds of billions spent to prop up the housing market , which only resulted in 34 k additional sales over last September ( one of the worst years on record for housing ) and fewer sales YoY in CA , sales were really not that great .
When organic sales go away suddenly for the season , which will happen in the near - term whether the tax credit is extended or not , it sets sales and prices up for the largest swings lower we have seen since all this began two years ago .
That ’s precisely correct — the usual selling season was extended due to the tax credit .

Ca n't sleep at night ?
A new study published in the journal Sleep has found that people who suffer from insomnia have heightened nighttime blood pressure , which can lead to cardiac problems .
The investigation , which measured the 24 - hour blood pressure of insomniacs compared to sound sleepers , was conducted by researchers from the Université de Montréal , its affiliated Hôpital du Sacré - Cœur de Montréal Sleep Disorders Centre and the Université Laval .
" Over many years , chronic insomnia can have negative effects on the hearts of otherwise healthy individuals , " says lead author Paola A. Lanfranchi , a professor in the Université de Montréal Faculty of Medicine and researcher at the Hôpital du Sacré - Cœur de Montréal Sleep Disorders Centre .
" Whereas blood pressure decreases in regular sleepers and gives their heart a rest , insomnia provokes higher nighttime blood pressure that can cause long - term cardiovascular risks and damage the heart . "
The findings are important given that insomnia , which is a chronic difficulty falling or staying asleep , affects up to 48 percent of the population at some point in their lives .
As part of the study , the scientific team recruited 13 otherwise healthy chronic insomniacs and 13 good sleepers .
Subjects spent 40 hours in the sleep laboratory : two nights for adaptation and one for monitoring followed by the intervening day .
" Blood pressure cycles are mainly linked to the sleep - wake cycle , " says co-author Jacques Montplaisir , a professor in the Université de Montréal Department of Psychiatry and director of Hôpital du Sacré - Cœur de Montréal Disorders Center .
" Since blood pressure is heightened among insomniacs , those with overt cardiac disease are particularly at risk for progression of the disease . "
The article " Nighttime Blood Pressure in Normotensive Subjects With Chronic Insomnia : Implications for Cardiovascular Risk , " published in Sleep was authored by Paola A. Lanfranchi , Marie - Hélène Pennestri , Lorraine Fradette , Marie Dumont and Jacques Montplaisir of the Université de Montréal and its affiliated Hôpital du Sacré - Cœur de Montréal , as well as Charles M. Morin of the Université Laval .

Pinch Media recently shared some data that they presented at the 360iDev conference regarding the state of piracy in the App Store and the results are definitely interesting , if not somewhat surprising .
Pinch Media decided to start tracking jailbreak users in response to developers seeing unusual spikes in their userbase , spikes that did n't mesh with what iTunes Connect was reporting for new downloads .
As it turns out , those spikes were from pirated apps on jailbroken devices .
According to Pinch Media 's analytics , about 38 percent of jailbreak users run pirated apps .
Their data consists of about 4 million jailbroken devices , which means about one and a half million of those devices have a pirated app on them .
Piracy is obviously a global phenomenon , but apparently it 's worse in some countries than in others .
Their results indicate that piracy is much more rampant in countries like China , Russia , Brazil , and Mexico , with the U.S. , Great Britain , and Japan having the lowest rates .
This indicates that piracy is negatively correlated with per capita national GDP .
Out of all of the apps using Pinch Media 's analytics , over 60 percent have been pirated .
According to Pinch Media , this estimate is actually low considering pirates will occasionally disable their tracking .
And when an app is pirated , about 34 percent of all installs are cracked .
Just like legitimate paid app downloads , pirated apps are used quite a bit at first , but the usage drops of much more rapidly over time than with legitimate app downloads .
Pinch Media claims there are three reasons for this .
The first being that since the user did n't actually pay for the app , they have less invested in using it .
Second , pirates usually install apps in bulk , meaning that they have a lot more apps to choose from to suit their specific tastes and needs .
Third , all jailbroken devices suffer from increased app crash rates , leading to more frequent app un-installs .
The final point they make , and the biggest point as far as I am concerned , is that the " try before you buy " motto that pirates use is completely bogus .
Pinch Media 's analytics show that about 7.4 percent of legitimate " Lite " app users go on to purchase the full paid version , which is about a 1 in 14 ratio .
If you apply the " try before you buy " theory to all pirated app users the results should be about the same , right ?
Well , according to Pinch Media , only .43 percent of pirated app users go on to purchase the full version , resulting in a 1 in 233 ratio .
Pinch Media 's findings are rather disappointing , especially for developers .
It 's important to note once again that even Pinch Media admits their numbers are quite a bit lower than one would expect thanks to the great lengths some jailbreakers go to to avoid being tracked .
At this point there is n't a whole lot any one person can do to stop app piracy , so just be accountable for your own actions .
So jailbreakers , what do you think about Pinch Media 's findings ?
STANFORD , Calif . - Scientists have long struggled to understand the body 's biological clock .
Its tick - tock wakes us up , reminds us to eat and tells us when to go to bed .
But what sets that circadian rhythm ?
New research now shows that daily fluctuations in powerful hormones called glucocorticoids directly synchronize the biological clock as an integral part of our mechanism for regulating blood sugar .
" The most surprising part of our findings is that our internal biologic rhythms are embedded directly into another pathway , one that is essential to regulate metabolism , " said senior study author Brian Feldman , MD , PhD , assistant professor of pediatric endocrinology at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
Feldman also practices at Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital .
The new findings give the first in vivo evidence of a direct link between glucocorticoid hormones and genes that regulate our biological clock .
The research may eventually help doctors reduce disabling side effects of glucocorticoid drugs such as prednisone , Feldman said .
The work could also help diabetics control their blood sugar levels and may shed light on why night - shift workers are at risk for obesity and diabetes .
The study will be published online Oct. 5 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Feldman worked previously at the University of California - San Francisco , where much of the research was conducted .
Feldman 's team began their experiments by applying a synthetic glucocorticoid to dishes of mouse and human stem cells to see which genes responded .
To the team 's surprise , three genes known to control the biological clock changed their activity in a direct response to the hormone .
Next , the researchers tested how the hormone 's effect on the biological clock is linked with its other functions .
The scientists gave the synthetic glucocorticoid to genetically engineered mice lacking a specific gene involved in regulating biologic rhythms .
As the team expected , genetically normal control mice responded to the glucocorticoid with blood glucose changes associated with increased diabetes risk .
In contrast , the genetically engineered mice were protected from harmful side effects on blood sugar levels .
The result shows that blood sugar regulation and the biological clock are closely entwined .
The close link between daily cycles of glucocorticoids , the body 's daily rhythms and blood sugar fluctuations should prompt doctors to examine how they use glucocorticoid drugs , Feldman said .
For instance , prednisone is a powerful immune - suppressing glucocorticoid used to treat everything from severe asthma to cancer .
Unfortunately , its side effects include poor regulation of blood sugar , weight gain and diabetes .
" Some very simple modifications in how we use glucocorticoids may change whether these drugs cause diabetes , " Feldman said .
Giving prednisone in a daily pattern that matches the body 's natural glucocorticoid cycle -- with a daily peak in the early morning -- might help solve the problem , he said .
And because prednisone is already approved for human use , clinical trials of this idea would be fast and simple .
Feldman 's findings might also be applied to aid people who already have diabetes , possibly making it easier for them to artificially control their blood sugar with medications .
And the work provides the beginnings of a concrete explanation for the down side of night - shift work .
" We know that disturbed sleep patterns predispose people to metabolic syndrome , " or a combination of obesity and elevated diabetes risk , Feldman said .
" But our molecular understanding has been poor .
Now we 're fleshing out the beginnings of those molecular details . "

The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the release of thousands of pages of sealed documents concerning sexual abuse by priests in the Catholic diocese of Bridgeport , Conn .
The court 's decision Monday effectively lifts a stay that has delayed the release of the documents since 2006 , when four newspapers persuaded a Connecticut court to unseal them .
The materials were filed in 23 lawsuits against the Catholic diocese by parishioners during the 1990s , alleging that the church failed to supervise its priests and reassigned those suspected of abusing children .
The cases were settled in 2001 , as the Catholic abuse scandal grew in national prominence .
The sealed documents are said to include transcripts of depositions of church officials , including Cardinal Edward Egan , and files from the investigation of priests accused of abuse during the 1960s and 1970s .
A 2002 article in the Hartford ( Conn . )
Courant described some of the documents , which the newspaper said it obtained from sources it did n't name .
The other newspaper plaintiffs were the New York Times , the Boston Globe and the Washington Post .

THERE is a pervading myth that efforts to fight climate change and other environmental perils will be to no avail unless we “ do something ” about population growth .
Even seasoned analysts talk about the threat of “ exponential ” population growth .
But there is no exponential growth .
In most of the world fertility rates are falling fast , and the countries where population growth continues are those that contribute least to our planetary predicament .
Back in the late 1960s , when Paul Ehrlich wrote his seminal book The Population Bomb , rapid population growth was arguably the number 1 threat to the planet ’s future .
Many believed that only strict birth control could prevent doomsday .
But after scandals about forced vasectomies in India and China ’s draconian one - child policy , such views fell into disrepute .
What ’s more , Ehrlich ’s prediction of hundreds of millions of deaths from famine in the 1980s fortunately failed to be borne out .
Now the demographic monster has become a hot topic again .
Yet the arguments still do n’t fit the reality .
The population “ bomb ” is fast being defused .
Women across the poor world are having dramatically fewer babies than their mothers did – mostly out of choice , not compulsion .
Half a century ago , the worldwide average for the number of children a woman had was between five and six .
Now she has 2.6 .
In the face of such a fall it is hard to see what more “ doing something ” about global population might achieve .
Half the world now has a fertility rate below the replacement level , which , allowing for girls who do n’t make it …
Proof That God Loves Britain
Last week Benny Hinn went on one of his annual simony tours to Great Britain .
However , God decided that enough was enough and intervened and stopped the lover of Mammon and the high priest of Mammonianity from spreading his gospel of the love of money disguised as some sick form of Christianity .
An American Christian preacher has been turned away from Britain , leaving thousands of people stranded at an evangelical rally in London this weekend .
Benny Hinn , from Texas , who draws large crowds to his Pentecostal revival rallies , was turned back at Stansted airport under new rules on visiting ministers of religion .
Many thousands of Pentecostal Christians travelled from across Britain and Europe and booked long weekend breaks in the capital ’s hotels for his mission at the ExCeL exhibition centre in Docklands , East London , which had been due to begin on Thursday night .
They were left disappointed after Border Agency officials turned him back when he landed with his private jet because he had failed to obtain a “ letter of sponsorship ” from a church .
Those people do n’t know how lucky they are .
But would this sort of roadblock really happen to a man of faith ?
I mean , could n’t he just slain all of the border crossing guards in the spirit ?
Does n’t he have some sort of charismatic power like Obi Wan Kenobi .
Benny waves his hand in front of the Stormtrooper ’s eyes , “ You will let me into the country .
You ’re not looking for this plane … ”
Of course , Mr. Hinn tried to put a positive spin ( read revisionist history ) on this after he appeared to the conference live via satellite .
Says Pastor Benny , “ When I landed in the United Kingdom , I was informed that under British law , there is now a recently passed regulation called a Tier 5 Concession , which meant that I could not enter the country to preach without a visa .
Attorneys sought to work out this challenge , and the officials treated me very well , yet in the end , the result was that I could not participate in the conference or Miracle Service in person . ”
Citing clear instruction in God ’s Word , Pastor Benny explained , “ I am not an attorney ; I am a man of God .
I have always obeyed the laws of men , and I will continue to obey the laws of men to the minutest details .
I ask the people who attended the services to forgive me for not having known prior to my arrival that such a law existed in the United Kingdom .
Even though neither I nor my staff was informed of this regulation , we are still responsible in the sight of God to obey the laws of men .
I promise you , my partners — and I promise you before God — this will not happen again .
You have my promise and my word as one who fears the Lord that this situation will be corrected and it shall not happen again ! ”
Make sure you read that second paragraph with the blabbering about “ clear instruction in God ’s word and obeying the minutest details of men . ”
Got it ?
OK , read what this Bible following , man -rule follower did after being denied entrance in Britain the first time because he “ fears the Lord . ”
Mr Hinn flew on to Paris and tried to enter Britain at Luton airport but was again turned back .
He was on his way back to France last night .
Example one million of why you do n’t trust a single word that comes from this wolf ’s mouth .
He was told by immigration why he could not enter the country and steal money .
Did he follow that by going back to the States and getting proper paperwork ?
No , he instead tried to enter at a different airport hoping they would not be aware of the new rules .
Shameful lying and revisionist history followed of course .
Benny has always followed the rules of men to the minutest details far more than any clear instruction in the Bible from God .
It is following those rules of men and the tax loopholes that he uses to justify raping and pillaging the sheeple .
However , when those rules get in the way of his stealing money he will gladly try something else even if it is illegal , and then of course , as usual , lie about it .

University of Michigan mathematicians and their British colleagues say they have identified the signal that the brain sends to the rest of the body to control biological rhythms , a finding that overturns a long - held theory about our internal clock .
Understanding how the human biological clock works is an essential step toward correcting sleep problems like insomnia and jet lag .
New insights about the body 's central pacemaker might also , someday , advance efforts to treat diseases influenced by the internal clock , including cancer , Alzheimer 's disease and mood disorders , said University of Michigan mathematician Daniel Forger .
" Knowing what the signal is will help us learn how to adjust it , in order to help people , " said Forger , an associate professor of mathematics and a member of the U - M's Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics .
" We have cracked the code , and the information could have a tremendous impact on all sorts of diseases that are affected by the clock . "
The body 's main time - keeper resides in a region of the central brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei , or SCN .
For decades , researchers have believed that it is the rate at which SCN cells fire electrical pulses --- fast during the day and slow at night --- that controls time - keeping throughout the body .
Imagine a metronome in the brain that ticks quickly throughout the day , then slows its pace at night .
The rest of the body hears the ticking and adjusts its daily rhythms , also known as circadian rhythms , accordingly .
That 's the idea that has prevailed for more than two decades .
But new evidence compiled by Forger and his colleagues shows that " the old model is , frankly , wrong , " Forger said .

The true signaling mechanism is very different :
The timing signal sent from the SCN is encoded in a complex firing pattern that had previously been overlooked , the researchers concluded .
Forger and U - M graduate student Casey Diekman , along with Dr. Mino Belle and Hugh Piggins of the University of Manchester in England , report their findings in the Oct. 9 edition of Science .
To test predictions made by Forger and Diekman 's mathematical model , the British scientists collected data on firing patterns from more than 400 mouse SCN cells .
The U - M scientists then plugged the experimental results into their model and found that " the experimental data were almost exactly what the model had predicted , " Forger said .
Though the experiments were done with mice , Forger said it 's likely that the same mechanism is at work in humans , since timekeeping systems are similar in all mammals .
The SCN contains both clock cells ( which express a gene call per1 ) and non-clock cells .
For years , circadian - biology researchers have been recording electrical signals from a mix of both types of cells .
That led to a misleading picture of the clock 's inner workings .
But Forger 's British colleagues were able to separate clock cells from non-clock cells by zeroing in on the ones that expressed the per1 gene .
Then they recorded electrical signals produced exclusively by those clock cells .
The pattern that emerged bolstered the audacious new theory .

" This is a perfect example of how a mathematical model can make predictions that are completely at odds with the prevailing views yet , upon further experimentation , turn out to be dead - on , " Forger said .
The researchers found that during the day , SCN cells expressing per1 sustain an electrically excited state but do not fire .
They fire for a brief period around dusk , then remain quiet throughout the night before releasing another burst of activity around dawn .
This firing pattern is the signal , or code , the brain sends to the rest of the body so it can keep time .
" The old theory was that the cells in the SCN which contain the clock are firing fast during the day but slow at night .
But now we 've shown that the cells that actually contain the clock mechanism are silent during the day , when everybody thought they were firing fast , " Diekman said .
Piggins said the findings " force us to completely reassess what we thought we knew about electrical activity in the brain 's circadian clock . "
In addition , the results demonstrate the importance of interdisciplinary collaborative research , he said .
" This work also raises important questions about whether the brain acts in an analog or a digital way , " Belle said .

It ’s Always Bloody In Philadelphia
Oh Philadelphia
Flyers fans , you crazy , bloodthirsty miscreants .
You know you have a pretty surly fanbase when they start going after each other after a bus ride back from another arena .
But that is precisely what happened Saturday night when a group of fans returning from watching a game against the New Jersey Devils in Newark had a bit of a dustup – including a couple of stabbings – when they returned to Philly .
And this comes after they brawled with Devils fans outside the arena before they left Jersey .
Here is what transpired before the bus trip back to Philly , according to a person who was there ( via The700Level )
There were about thirty Flyers fans waiting for one of the busses to take us back to Philly .
This dude walks up with a Broduer jersey that he had on backwards for some reason .
He just stood there staring us all down , not saying a word .
It was really weird .
But then he takes a swing at my buddy .
Those two started wrestling a little , a few shots connected but then the security came to break it up .
They broke it up for about two seconds and another fight broke out .
After that the cops showed up and that was it .
My buddy ( who looks like he is about to be arrested at the end of the video ) somehow managed to escape and met us on the bus !
And then here is what transpired after the bus departed Newark :
On the way back from the game in Newark , in which the Flyers defeated the New Jersey Devils 5 - 2 , one of the men on the bus called his brother , an off - duty police officer from the 18th District , and told him that there might be trouble when the bus got back in the city , according to Northeast Detectives .
And that ’s when things got even uglier .
It is unclear why some of the occupants of the fan bus expected trouble upon their return , but according to police , when the off - duty cop showed up at the bus ’ final destination , at the Arena Bowling Alley on Roosevelt Boulevard near Rhawn Street , he saw a group of 10 to 15 men waiting for it to arrive .
When the bus pulled up shortly after midnight , three to four of the men who were waiting attempted to board the bus , police said .
The off - duty officer got out of his vehicle and , as he did so , the men trying to get on the bus instead ran towards him and began kicking and punching the officer , Northeast Detectives said .
After verbally identifying himself as a police officer , the off - duty cop grabbed a hold of one of the men and held him against his car while the others continued to beat the officer , police said .
Meanwhile , the cop ’s brother and the other fans got off the bus and engaged in a verbal dispute with the opposing group , according to police .
During the course of the argument , the cop ’s 28 - year - old brother was stabbed once in the chest and once in the back by a man in a Flyers ’ jersey , Northeast Detectives said .
Another occupant of the bus , a 26 - year - old man , was stabbed once in the back by a different assailant who also wore a Flyers jersey , this one with ripped sleeves , police said .
Now , there is no reason to get all stabby over a simple disagreement .
Both stabbing victims are at a hospital in Philadelphia in critical condition .
Hopefully , the two men injured make it out okay , but thanks for helping to reaffirm the stereotypes regarding typical Philly sports fans .
Here ’s an account from a bystander , once again via The700 Level :
When we got back to the The Arena bowling alley in the Northeast , there were cop cars everywhere and a big brawl taking place .
These were all Flyers fans fighting .
I do n’t know why .
I guess drinking all day had something to do with it ?
Anyway , some guy comes walking by with his buddy screaming , “ Call an ambulance ! ”
He had been stabbed and his intestines were literally hanging out !
There was blood everywhere .
We were just a little freaked out and did n’t want to be stabbed so we left .
Good call on leaving .
Fat , drunk and stabby is no way to go through life , kids .

The other days somebody asked on IRC for help with this question :
He was looking for all 9 digit numbers that did n't contain a zero digit anywhere , and the first digit should be divisible by one , the number formed from the first two digits should be divisible by 2 , the number formed from the first three digits should be divisible by 3 etc .
The first such number is 1232525616 , because 1 can be divided by 1 , 12 can be divided by 2 , 123 can be divided by 3 etc .
Since finding one is n't really a challenge , let 's focus on finding them all .
The easiest approach is , of course , brute force .
There are 109 numbers with 9 digits , that 's quite a manageable number for a modern computer .
On my laptop it takes perl about 45 seconds to loop over all 109 numbers , doing nothing else .
So all you 've got to do is iterate over all numbers , test if they meet the criterion stated above , and print them out if they do :
use strict ; use warnings ; sub test { my $ z = shift ; for ( 2..9 ) { return if ( substr ( $ z , 0 , $ _ ) % $ _ != 0 ) ; } return 1 ; } for ( my $ i = 1 x 9 ; length ( $ i ) == 9 ; $ i += 9 ) { next if $ i =~ / 0 / ; if ( test ( $ i ) ) { print $ i , $/ ; } }
This uses a small trick : the first number that does n't contain any zero is 111111111 , or short 1 x 9 .
It takes 4 minutes and 20 seconds , produces the right answer , and we 're happy .
But it wastes a lot of resources , and would n't scale for larger numbers .
So for the sake of fun I tried a few different optimizations .
The first one is quite simple : the second digit must always be even , otherwise the number consisting of the first two digits could not be even .
Likewise the fifths digit must be 5 or 0 to ensure that it can be divided by 5 .
Since 0 is forbidden anyway , it has to be 5 .
So let 's skip the expensive check if those conditions are n't fulfilled :
for ( my $ i = 1 x 9 ; length ( $ i ) == 9 ; $ i += 9 ) { next if $ i =~ / 0 / ; next if $ i =~ / ^ . [ 13579 ] / ; next unless $ i =~ / ^ .... 5 / ; if ( test ( $ i ) ) { print $ i , $/ ; } }
This speeds up the computation to roughly a minute .
Since 40 seconds are minimum for the iteration alone , it 's nearly as good as it gets with this approach .
But of course there 's still room for improvement : when the second digit is odd , the program iterates over a hundred million of numbers without finding one .
Instead of skipping them each time , it would be much more efficient to generate the number digit by digit , checking divisibility at each step of the way .
for my $ a ( 1..9 ) { for my $ b ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) { for my $c ( 1..9 ) { next if ( $ a + $ b + $ c ) % 3 ; for my $d ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) { next if ( 10 * $ c + $ d ) % 4 ; my $e = 5 ; for my $f ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) { next if ( $ a + $ b + $ c + $d + $e + $ f ) % 3 ; for my $ g ( 1..9 ) { my $ so_far = " $ a$ b$ c$ d$ e$ f$g " ; next if $ so_far % 7 ; for my $h ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) { next if ( $ so_far . $ h ) % 8 ; for my $ i ( 1..9 ) { my $ so_far = $ so_far . " $ h$i " ; next if $ so_far % 9 ; print " $ so_far$h
" ; } } } } } } } }
Wow , that 's ugly code , but it works and it 's fast .
Very fast .
27 milliseconds , or more than 2000 times faster as the previous version .
Bug it contains lots of duplicated code , and again it would n't scale for finding larger numbers , this time because for digit a loop needs to be written .
Whenever I find myself repeating some piece of code a few times , but in slightly different forms , I try to pack the code into a data structure instead .
For each digit position there needs to a list of digit to try , and a test that determines if the newly added digit violates its divisibility rule .
use strict ; use warnings ; my @config = ( [ [ 1..9 ] , sub { 0 } ] , [ [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] , sub { 0 } ] , [ [ 1..9 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 3 } ] , [ [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 4 } ] , [ [ 5 ] , sub { 0 } ] , [ [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 6 } ] , [ [ 1..9 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 7 } ] , [ [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 8 } ] , [ [ 1..9 ] , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 9 } ] , ) ;
The nested loops from the previous script can be emulated by recursion , passing the previous digits along ( and the configuration for all digit positions that still need to be tested ) .
sub f { my ( $ so_far , $ config ) = @_ ; $ config = [ @ $config ] ; if (! @$config ) { print " $ so_far
" ; } else { my $c = shift @$config ; for my $ current ( @{$c - > [ 0 ]} ) { next if $ c - > [ 1 ] ->( $ so_far . $ current ) ; f( $ so_far .
$ current , $ config ) ; } } } f ( '' , \ @config ) ;
With 46 ms runtime it 's still acceptably fast , and much leaner than the nested loops .
Actually a rough sketch of the configuration table can also be generated automatically , and then optimized manually :
my @config ; for my $n ( 1..9 ) { push @config , [ ( $n % 2 ? [ 1..9 ] : [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] ) , sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % $n } , ] } $ config [ 4 ] = [ [ 5 ] , sub { 0 } ] ;
Now the script contains as little duplication as possible , is reasonably fast , and I 'm happy .
( Just one final note : there 's no scalability problem in this particular task , because it can't be extended to more than nine digits : if no zero is allowed , there wo n't be any numbers divisible by 10 . )
The group began 25 years ago as a vigilante organization aimed at removing the influence of drug dealers in the state of Michoacán , but it has evolved into a ruthless cartel itself .
For years , members of La Familia were allied with the Gulf Cartel , based in Tamaulipas , and fought against the Sinaloan gangs for control of the local police and officials in Michoacán .
But that alliance fell apart in 2004 , and La Familia has since gone into business for itself .
Now it competes with both the Gulf and Sinaloa Cartels , and has become a major exporter of methamphetamine to the United States , officials said .

“ This is an organization that just recently we started calling a cartel because of how they ’ve grown and the violence that they spread , ” said Michele Leonhart , the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ And it is the first time we have seen a cartel take on meth trafficking , where they are the direct pipeline from Mexico to the U.S. of multi-hundred - pound quantities of methamphetamine . ”
The group first gained attention in 2006 when more than a dozen masked gunmen burst into a nightclub in Uruapan and tossed five heads of drug dealers on the dance floor , with the message : “ The family does n’t kill for money .
It does n’t kill women .
It does n’t kill innocent people , only those who deserve to die .
Know that this is divine justice . ”
Last July , the cartel ’s gunmen tried to liberate one of their lieutenants who had been arrested , and , when their effort failed , they attacked federal police stations in a half - dozen cities .
Three days later , on July 14 , cartel members tortured and killed 12 members of the Mexican Federal Police .
In the past year , the Mexican authorities have made some progress against the cartel , arresting two capos .
But Mr. Moreno González and his top lieutenants have eluded capture .
One of those lieutenants is Servando Gómez Martinez , who was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Manhattan as part of the nationwide crackdown .
Though Mr. Gómez remains in Mexico , federal prosecutors in New York have linked him to a cocaine shipment in the city .
After the murder of Mexican federal officers in July , Mr. Gómez gave a recorded statement to a local television station in which he said the cartel was locked in a battle with the Mexican police , the indictment said .

NEW YORK — When American diplomats sat down for the first in a series of face - to - face talks with their Iranian counterparts last October in Geneva , few would have predicted that what began as a negotiation over Tehran 's nuclear programs would wind up in a stunning demand by the Security Council that Israel give up its atomic weapons .

When confronted by a predator , some animals fight , others run while a few hide , hoping not to be noticed .
The pebble toad of Venezuela does something altogether different : it curls up like a ball and throws itself down the side of a mountain .
By doing so , the tiny creature bounces down the rocks just like a rubber ball .
This extraordinary tumbling behaviour has been filmed in slow motion by a BBC crew for the natural history programme Life .
The pebble toad ( Oreophrynella niger ) is tiny , measuring just a few centimetres long .
It was an unusual thing to see at the top of a mountain .
They just curl up and flop
Life assistant producer Adam Scott
It lives on the top of a type of mountain known as a tepui , which occur across the Guiana Highlands in South America .
These table - topped mountains rise out of the rainforest , isolating the animals and plants that live upon them .
As a result , many of the creatures have evolved differently .
For example , the pebble toad is unable to jump very far , an inch being the furthest it can hop .
While there are no snakes living on the tepui , this lack of athletic prowess makes the toads vulnerable to marauding tarantulas , an ambush predator .
The ball position
So the toads have evolved a unique escape mechanism .
A threatened toad folds its arms and legs under its body , tucks in its head and tenses its muscles , assuming a " ball position " .
Because the amphibian is mostly likely resting on an incline , it then rolls downhill like a dislodged pebble .
The toads travel far enough to escape the attentions of the tarantulas and often tumble into a crack or crevice where they are out of sight or difficult to reach .
The toad 's black and grey colour also helps it blend in with its sandstone habitat .
Camouflage is another defence
The toad is so small and light that the forces of impact are too tiny to cause it any harm .
However , as well as being less than impressive jumpers , the toads do not swim well .
So while most that land in puddles survive , there are reports of toads drowning after tumbling into deeper pools of water .
The team located the toads with the help of biologist Dr Bruce Means , an Adjunct Professor at Florida State University , US and head of a non-profit conservation organisation called the Coastal Plains Institute and Land Conservancy , based in Florida .
Dr Means ventured up the tepui , located in southeast Venezuela , to find the toads .
Life assistant producer Mr Scott and cameraman Mr Rod Clarke then followed a few days later to film the action , using slow motion cameras capable of recording up to 2000 frames per second .
" The first time I saw one of the toads on a rock one morning , we saw each other , and I made some sudden movement , and it flicked itself back and flopped down into a channel at the bottom of the rock , " says Mr Scott .
" We 'd been told they do this thing and then it did it to me .
It was an unusual thing to see at the top of a mountain .
They just curl up and flop . "
The tumbling pebble toad can be seen on the BBC series Life , which is broadcast at 2100BST on BBC One on Monday 19 October .

War memorials and museums are temples to the god of war .
The hushed voices , the well - tended grass , the flapping of the flags allow us to ignore how and why our young died .
They hide the futility and waste of war .
They sanitize the savage instruments of death that turn young soldiers and Marines into killers , and small villages in Vietnam or Afghanistan or Iraq into hellish bonfires .
There are no images in these memorials of men or women with their guts hanging out of their bellies , screaming pathetically for their mothers .
We do not see mangled corpses being shoved in body bags .
There are no sights of children burned beyond recognition or moaning in horrible pain .
There are no blind and deformed wrecks of human beings limping through life .
War , by the time it is collectively remembered , is glorified and heavily censored .
I blame our war memorials and museums , our popular war films and books , for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as much as George W. Bush .
They provide the mental images and historical references to justify new conflicts .
We equate Saddam Hussein with Adolf Hitler .
We see al - Qaida as a representation of Nazi evil .
We view ourselves as eternal liberators .
These plastic representations of war reconfigure the past in light of the present .
War memorials and romantic depictions of war are the social and moral props used to create the psychological conditions to wage new wars .
War memorials are quiet , still , reverential and tasteful .
And , like church , such sanctuaries are important , but they allow us to forget that these men and women were used and often betrayed by those who led the nation into war .
The memorials do not tell us that some always grow rich from large - scale human suffering .
They do not explain that politicians play the great games of world power and stoke fear for their own advancement .
They forget that young men and women in uniform are pawns in the hands of cynics , something Pat Tillman ’s family sadly discovered .
They do not expose the ignorance , raw ambition and greed that are the engine of war .
There is a burning need , one seen in the collective memory that has grown up around World War II and the Holocaust , to turn the horror of mass murder into a tribute to the triumph of the human spirit .
The reality is too unpalatable .
The human need to make sense of slaughter , to give it a grandeur it does not possess , permits the guilty to go free .
The war makers — those who make the war but never pay the price of war — live among us .
They pen thick memoirs that give sage advice .
They are our elder statesmen , our war criminals .
Henry Kissinger .
Robert McNamara .
Dick Cheney .
George W. Bush .
Any honest war memorial would have these statesmen hanging in effigy .
Any honest democracy would place them behind bars .
Primo Levi , who survived Auschwitz , fought against the mendacity of collective memory until he took his own life .
He railed against the human need to mask the truth of the Holocaust and war by giving it a false , moral narrative .
He wrote that the contemporary history of the Third Reich could be “ reread as a war against memory , an Orwellian falsification of memory , falsification of reality , negation of reality . ”
He wondered if “ we who have returned ” have “ been able to understand and make others understand our experience . ”
He wrote of the Jewish collaborator Chaim Rumkowski , who ran the Lodz ghetto on behalf of the Nazis , that “ we are all mirrored in Rumkowski , his ambiguity is ours , it is our second nature , we hybrids molded from clay and spirit .
His fever is ours , the fever of Western civilization that ‘ descends into hell with trumpets and drums . ’ ” We , like Rumkowski , “ come to terms with power , forgetting that we are all in the ghetto , that the ghetto is walled in , that outside the ghetto reign the lords of death , and that close by the train is waiting . ”
We are , Levi understood , perpetually imprisoned within the madness of self - destruction .
The rage of Cindy Sheehan , who lost her son Casey in Iraq , is a rage Levi felt .
But it is a rage most of us do not understand .
A war memorial that attempted to depict the reality of war would be too subversive .
It would condemn us and our capacity for evil .
It would show that the line between the victim and the victimizer is razor - thin , that human beings , when the restraints are cut , are intoxicated by mass killing , and that war , rather than being noble , heroic and glorious , obliterates all that is tender , decent and kind .
It would tell us that the celebration of national greatness is the celebration of our technological capacity to kill .
It would warn us that war is always morally depraved , that even in “ good ” wars such as World War II all can become war criminals .
We dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The Nazis ran the death camps .
But this narrative of war is unsettling .
It does not create a collective memory that serves the interests of those who wage war and permit us to wallow in self - exaltation .
There are times — World War II and the Serb assault on Bosnia would be examples — when a population is pushed into a war .
There are times when a nation must ingest the poison of violence to survive .
But this violence always deforms and maims those who use it .
My uncle , who drank himself to death in a trailer in Maine , fought for four years in the South Pacific during World War II .
He and the soldiers in his unit never bothered taking Japanese prisoners .
The detritus of war , the old cannons and artillery pieces rolled out to stand near memorials , were curious and alluring objects in my childhood .
But these displays angered my father , a Presbyterian minister who was in North Africa as an Army sergeant during World War II .
The lifeless , clean and neat displays of weapons and puppets in uniforms were being used , he said , to purge the reality of war .
These memorials sanctified violence .
They turned the instruments of violence — the tanks , machine guns , rifles and airplanes — into an aesthetic of death .
These memorials , while they pay homage to those who made “ the ultimate sacrifice , ” dignify slaughter .
They perpetuate the old lie of honor and glory .
They set the ground for the next inferno .
The myth of war manufactures a collective memory that ennobles the next war .
The intimate , personal experience of violence turns those who return from war into internal exiles .
They can not compete against the power of the myth .
This collective memory saturates the culture , but it is “ a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . ”
Chris Hedges , whose column is published on Truthdig every Monday , spent two decades as a foreign reporter covering wars in Latin America , Africa , Europe and the Middle East .
He has written nine books , including “ Empire of Illusion : The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle ” ( 2009 ) and “ War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning ” ( 2003 ) .
A newspaper in the former steel town of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , has taken a giant leap for the US news industry by starting to charge for some of the content it posts on its website .
With proprietors of many of the top US newspapers now actively considering charging for web content amid dire financial projections , the decision by the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette marks one of the first examples of a general interest title to make the jump .
Until now the rare examples of charging – notably the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times – have tended to be specialist financial publications .
The Post - Gazette , known locally simply as the PG , is the largest Pittsburgh newspaper , providing readers through its circulation of about 209,000 daily with the usual menu of local and national news , sports and features .
It has for many years been in financial difficulties , and has come close to being put up for sale .
The new charging scheme has been branded PG+ , and attempts to attract paying readers to its internet content by giving them the cachet of belonging to an exclusive club .
It promises to give subscribers extra content they will not find on the newspaper 's website , as well as direct access through web chat conducted through the site to columnists and reporters , invitations to special events and offers and perks .
" We wanted to create an experience for members only that gives them an exclusive and more intimate interactive experience of all things Pittsburgh , " said the Post - Gazette president , Chris Chamberlain .
The company has pitched the scheme at $ 2.99 a month , or $ 35.88 a year , for which subscribers will be sent a membership card that gives access to all the additional features .
The success or otherwise of the payment plan will be closely watched by other US newspaper outlets as they deliberate over if and when to take the plunge into charging for web content .
The obvious risk for any early attempt to do so is that readers will simply defect to other non-charging websites .
In the case of the Pittsburgh experiment , it hopes to minimise the risk of defections by assuring the readers of its free website that PG + will consist entirely of new material not currently found on the site .
" We are trying to avoid our various product offerings getting in the way of each other .
We are adding to the brand rather than putting existing content behind a paywall , " Chamberlain said .
Pennsylvania papers have been among the hardest hit by the advertising slump and the move online .
Both main titles in Philadelphia – the Inquirer and Daily News – are embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings .
The Post - Gazette has already been through a round of job cuts as well as changes in the health and other benefits of its staff in an attempt to improve its bottom line .
Management will be hoping that PG + offers a way ahead via a new income stream .

Advertisement Police have arrested a man over an alleged assault on 2006 X Factor winner Leona Lewis at a book signing .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called to Waterstone 's book store at Piccadilly , London , but Lewis did not need hospital treatment .
Lewis 's spokesman said the singer had been signing autographs for around 90 minutes when " a guy came up and punched her to the side of the head " .
The spokesman added that Lewis was " understandably badly shaken " .
In a statement , Waterstone 's said : " There was an incident at our Leona Lewis signing this afternoon and the event was immediately stopped .
The security all jumped on him and they were trying to pull him out and he was just laughing
Eyewitness " We are now doing everything we can to support the police in their inquiries . "
Lewis had been signing copies of her new autobiography , Dreams , which is due to be released next month .
One fan at the scene told the BBC : " My brother saw the whole incident .
He [ the attacker ] walked up there with the book , she signed it and , as she looked up , he just punched her .
" He [ my brother ] actually heard the impact . "
Another eyewitness added : " She was running out with her hand over her eye and I just saw a man on the floor .
" Suddenly the security all jumped on him and they were trying to pull him out and he was just laughing , he thought it was funny . "
Lewis 's spokesman added : " The police were called immediately and medical attention has been sought .
" Leona 's understandably badly shaken and apologises to the fans she was unable to meet and complete signings for . "
' Professionalism ' Waterstone 's said it took security at book signings " extremely seriously " and this was the first incident of its kind it had encountered .
" We would like to thank Leona for her professionalism and we are extremely sad that this event was ruined for her , and her fans , many of whom queued from the early hours of the morning to meet her , " it added .
Lewis had been scheduled to appear on the BBC's The One Show on Wednesday night ; however a spokesperson confirmed she had pulled out .
BBC sports presenter Gabby Logan was brought in to replace her .
Lewis 's second album , Echo , is scheduled for release in November .
The three - time Grammy Award nominee released her debut single A Moment Like
This shortly after winning the ITV1 show .
She is due to play a gig in her native Hackney in east London on 2 November .

For all its talk , China bought a further $ 25bn of US Treasuries in June and $ 25bn in July .
The weak yuan has helped to keep China 's factories open – and to preserve social order – during the economic crisis , though exports were still down 23 pc in August .
But this policy is on borrowed time .
Reformers in Beijing are already orchestrating a profound shift in China 's economy from export reliance ( 38 pc of GDP ) to domestic demand , and they know that keeping the dollar peg too long will ultimately cause them to lose export edge anyway – via the more damaging route of inflation .
例えば、学校などの学園祭や体育際でクラスの団結力を上げたいと思った時、何をしますか。作戦会議をしたり、ひたすら練習したりしますね。つまり、みんなが一団となって何かをする事が大切になってきます。そういった意味でもオリジナルTシャツを作るという行為は理にかなっています。オリジナルTシャツを作るのには、さまざまな事を決めていかなくてはなりません。その人数が多くなればなるほど、ひとつの事を決めるのが大変になってきます。それは、それぞれの意見があるからです。しかし、そういった難しい事をクリアしていく事や話し合う事によって、今まで知らなかった相手の一面や好みなどがわかってきて、結果的に団結力が増していくのです。みんなでひとつの事に向かって進む事は決して簡単ではありません。
オリジナ ルTシャツを決める為の会議をしましょう
ではオリジナ ルTシャツを作る為の会議をしていきましょう。もちろん、全員参加です。時間が無い場合ありますでしょうが、会議は必要です。多くの事を決めなくてはならない為、多少の時間を割きましょう。まず、どんなTシャツにするのか、案を出していきます。何色にするのか、半袖なのか長袖なのか、素材は何にするのか、デザインはどうするのか。いちから決めなくてはなりません。男女で意見が分かれるようならば、色違いなどパターンを分けるのもいいですね。ロゴなどのデザインは、絵の得意な人にお願いしましょう。素材は、体育祭などでは汗をかくので速乾吸水などの機能を持つものもいいかもしれません。さまざまな意見を出し合いましょう。そうして決めていく事が、団結力を上げる近道です。頑張りましょう。
オリジナ ルTシャツを作るメリットについて
会議をしていく中で、全員の意見が全て通る事などあり得ません。多数派の意見が通っていくでしょう。そうやって意見をすり合わせていくのも大切な作業です。どんなオリジナルTシャツを作るのかが決まったら、自分たちでTシャツを購入して印刷するのか業者に依頼するのか決めましょう。自分で作れば安くすみますが、ミスをする可能性もあります。また、枚数が多い大変です。業者に依頼すれば、綺麗に仕上がりますが値段は高くなります。いずれにしても出来上がるまでに日数がかかりますので、早めに決める事が肝心です。そして、皆で意見を出し合って、妥協して、時にはヒートアップして、団結力を上げる為に作ったオリジナルTシャツは、生涯の思い出になるでしょう。記念になるでしょう、戦いの証になるでしょう。それを着て行った事を遠い未来に思い出すでしょう。きっとそれはあなたの宝物になる筈です。
This plays out like the opening scene of an 80s sci - fi film :
Eight foot tall robot appears in a shopping mall , sings " What a Wonderful World " and " My Way , " dances around a bit to a chorus of oohs and aahs from the audience , launches into a series of silly demo movements , and then ...
Well , we wo n't spoil it for you .
Let 's just say that at eight feet tall ( and with tons of menace ) we have to wonder if Titan the Robot could be stopped should some sort of cinematic " glitch " should cause him to " freak out " amongst the onlookers at Dubai's GITEX 2009 .
Like most man-made disasters , this one starts innocently enough : with a show - stopping rendition of a Paul Anka tune .
Curious ?
Peep it after the break .
Just make sure you do n't get close .
Here 's something Goldman Sachs , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , American International Group 's former CFO , and Goldman 's former chairman have all declined to comment on :
While negotiating how much loss large banks would have to take on credit default swaps with the bankrupt insurer AIG , the New York Fed , then under Geithner , rejected a 40 cents - on - the - dollar deal in the works and made taxpayers pay at least $ 13 billion to ensure the banks suffered no losses :
Geithner 's team circulated a draft term sheet outlining how the New York Fed wanted to deal with the swaps — insurance - like contracts that backed soured collateralized - debt obligations .
CDOs are bundles of debt including subprime mortgages and corporate loans sold to investors by banks .
Part of a sentence in the document was crossed out .
It contained a blank space that was intended to show the amount of the haircut the banks would take , according to people who saw the term sheet .
After less than a week of private negotiations with the banks , the New York Fed instructed AIG to pay them par , or 100 cents on the dollar .
The content of its deliberations has never been made public .
The New York Fed 's decision to pay the banks in full cost AIG — and thus American taxpayers — at least $ 13 billion .
That 's 40 percent of the $ 32.5 billion AIG paid to retire the swaps .
Under the agreement , the government and its taxpayers became owners of the dubious CDOs , whose face value was $ 62 billion and for which AIG paid the market price of $ 29.6 billion .
The CDOs were shunted into a Fed- run entity called Maiden Lane III .
Full , excellent story by Bloomberg 's Richard Teitelbaum and Hugh Son .
I 'm not sure this stuff counts as an outrage anymore .
After all , $ 13 billion is range - finding to these guys .
Maybe 2009 1040 forms should have a special checkbox to send a strippergram to Geithner to thank him for saving us so much money .
This is more of a personal recommendation than it is an application review .
Â
Anyone who does work on the go nowadays knows just how essential “ all over ” internet access is .
Â
But wireless data - only plans are often expensive and require another piece or two of hardware , and their respective chargers that you have to manage .
Â
With my new Google Voice account , PC Skype availability , and continuous e-mail connectivity , I almost need a mini-PBX to take with me .
Â
That ’s where Wireless Tether comes in .Â
This application has transformed my T - Mobile G1 and myTouch 3G into must - have devices far beyond their phone calling capabilities .
Actually , Wireless
Tether ’s name may be it ’s biggest offense in that it does not tether in the traditional sense like I use to use with my BlackBerry Curve via Bluetooth .
Â
When I used my Curve it was a one - to - one ratio , one BBerry to one PC and it was usually a Windows PC unless I was willing to get under the CLI ( command line interface ) hood on my Linux machines .
Â
So while this setup was fine for a short burst of communication and albeit unreliable Bluetooth connectivity over EDGE , it cannot match Wireless Tether ’s abilities .
Â
The application lets you choose between two types of connectivity : Bluetooth and WiFi .
I have only used the WiFi option but it lets you change SSID ’s , create / change passphrases , change channels , and also notifies when you or anyone else connects and disconnects to your PAN ( personal area network ) .
Wireless
Tether basically converts the 3G signal of my phone into a WiFi frequency and in effect makes my phone a hotspot that can be used anywhere I can get a signal and shows up as just another wireless network .
Â
I usually get 1 mbps down when I test the speed so I cannot tell if there is any degradation of the signal as that is about what I get when I test it on my G1 .Â
This application can only be loaded via your Android browser or as an .apk from your SDcard and requires root access to your device .
Â
Bundled with T - Mobile ‘s unlimited data plan this app is an absolute savior for the Road Warrior Robot .
You probably have some idea about what you can do with lucid dream , but you are not exactly sure .
This part will give you the details about lucid dreaming applications .
First and foremost , you are spending 8 hours sleeping every day and you do n’t even remember what you were dreaming .
Well with lucid dreaming this time can be reclaimed .
Not only you will start to remember your dreams but you will also gain the ability to control them .
This ability opens many possibilities
_
1. Adventure and Fun
Have sex –
You can have any kind of sex you can imagine and with anyone you can imagine ( or already know ) .
Fly – Someone once sad that its the same feeling as jumping with a parachute in the real world .
Travel Time
Have a chat with your favorite person from history –
This will be a cool experience and it may give you some a deeper understanding of things you already know ( realizations ) .
_
2. Unlock Creativity
Did you know that Walt Disney invented Mickey Mouse in a dream ?
When you are in a lucid dream it is really easy to be creative because logical part of your brain is partially shut down .
You can use this to ask smart questions and get innovative and creative answers back from your subconscious mind .
An effective application for a profession like : Artist , Designer or Inventor
_
3 . Taking down nightmares
Lucid dreaming gives you a chance to become aware that the nightmare is only a dream and then face the thing that scares you the most in a position of power and control .
A study was performed in 2006 that showed that lucid dreaming was a successful treatment for nightmares .
_
4.Self Development
We have all heard of affirmations and visualizations …
Try doing them in a lucid dream and see what happens .
Say I am rich once and BAM !
you are the richest person on earth .
And after you have experienced how it feels like to be super rich , you have a reference experience that you can aim towards with your affirmations .
You can practice public speaking , approaching strangers , or having a stand up comedy show in the same way .

Analog - to - Digital Converter ( ADC ) .
This peripheral is used when you have an analog sensor providing data ( like temperature , light , acceleration , etc ) and need to convert it to a digital value .
Serial Peripheral Interface ( SPI ) .
The SPI bus is used to communicate with other SPI - enabled devices , like external memories , LED drivers , external ADC's , etc .
Parts of the SPI are used for ISP programming , or at least the pins are , so be careful when shutting this down if you are programming via ISP .
Two - Wire Interface .
Some external devices use the I2C bus to communicate , although these are rapidly being replaced by SPI - enabled devices as SPI has a greater throughput .
USART .
This is your serial interface .
You probably do n't want to turn this off if you are connected to the AVR via the serial connection !
However , I added this in here as a skeleton for porting to devices that have multiple USART 's like the ATmega 162 or ATmega644P .
all .
This argument to the powerup or powerdown command turns on all of the peripherals mentioned or turns them all off with one command .
Again , use this command wisely .

There are several other commands that the default command interpreter understands that you may find useful .
You can see all the implemented and future - release commands by issuing help or menu at the prompt .
I 'll quickly cover them here as they are mostly self - explanatory .
You can find out what your firmware has been configured to use as the CPU clock settings with the fcpu command :
That 's 16 million , or 16 million herz , more commonly known as 16 MHz .
You can change this on the fly , for whatever reason , with the clock command .
This command takes one argument : the prescaler to use when dividing your clock speed .
The clock command understands these prescaler values : Using the command : when your cpu speed is 16MHz would result in your clock speed being changed to 8MHz .
Using a prescaler of ckdiv64 with an initial clock speed of 16MHz will result in a final clock speed of 250 KHz .
Why on Earth would you want to make your MCU slower ?
Well , for one , a lower clock speed consumes less power and if you have your MCU running off of a battery in a project enclosure you may not need it to run at top speed , and could therefore , lower the speed and reduce it 's power consumption , increasing the battery life .
Also , if you are using the clock for any sort of timing issues with another MCU , say , implementing a software UART or some such thing , you may want to set it to a particular value that is easy to get a nice even baud rate with lower error rates .
On the same note as reducing power consumption mentioned earlier , you may want to further reduce power by shutting down some of the on - board peripherals that you are not using .
The command interpreter and shell can currently power up and power down the following peripherals :
The shell has a built - in 16 - bit timer that is available for use .
You start the timer with the timer command : and stop the timer with the stop argument :
This timer will not conflict with the internal USART timer .
See the code for the implementation details of the USART timer , if that sort of gory detail interests you .
The shell can store an 8 - character password into EEPROM .
This password mechanism was created to support the telnet login capabilities , but could be expanded to protect other things .
For example , you could require certain commands , like changing register values , through the authentication mechanism .
Set the password with the password command : Authorize against he password ( or require authorization programatically through the code ) with the auth command .
Note , that if you attempt to change the root password and there is already a root password set , you must authorize yourself against the old password before being allowed to change it to a new password .
Of course , you will need to load the avrsh .eep file if you erase the firmware to have your old values and variables restored .
The Makefile will create the EEPROM file for you .
The shell understands the notion of user - defined variables .
The code limits this to 20 , but you can change that if you like by changing the define MAX_VARIABLES in script.h .
You can save any 16 - bit value ( that is , any number up to 65,536 ) to a variable to be recalled later .
The syntax is similar to registers except a dollar sign ( $ ) is used to denote variables to the shell .
List all your variables with the print variables command .
Set a variable :
Get the value of a given variable :
You can see what all variables you 've currently instantiated with the print command that you already know .
The $ FREE $ name just indicates that that variable location is free and has not been assigned a variable name yet .
PORT ST .
LUCIE — A spectacular case of poor criminal planning played out late Wednesday afternoon inside the western regional police station .
A couple of boys , ages 12 and 14 , tried to rob two employees behind a protective window , demanding cash , before being handcuffed at gunpoint by about a half dozen officers .
" They were either very brazen or very dumb , but I think the latter , " Officer Robert Vega , police spokesman , said .
The incident happened about 4:30 p.m. at the Rosser Boulevard station after the boys , one dressed in blue and the other red , walked through the glass doors .
The 12 - year - old sauntered to the records counter and then proceeded to another counter where he picked up a phone to talk to a service aide behind a protective window , demanding her money .
"
Not only did he pick up the phone and say , ' Put your hands up and give me your money , ' he had his hand in his jacket insinuating that he had a gun , " Vega said .
The boys each face an attempted armed robbery charge .
Although only the 12 - year - old demanded money , the other boy also is being charged in connection with the incident because he " knew what was going to happen , " Vega said .
" He was a willing participant in the entire event , " Vega said .
The 14 - year - old also faces a violation of probation charge .
A referendum to change Britain 's first - past - the - post voting system could be held on the same day as the general election next spring , under proposals being discussed by ministers .
The idea is gaining support in the Cabinet , and Labour now looks certain to fight the next election on a firm commitment to scrap the current voting system .
Although ministers have ruled out a switch to the fully proportional system sought by the Liberal Democrats , they plan to allow voters to list candidates in order of preference , with the bottom candidate dropping out until one contender enjoys more than 50 per cent support .

This Australian - style alternative vote ( AV ) system is one leading option .
Another is " AV - plus " , recommended by an inquiry chaired by the late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead in 1998 but left on the shelf by the Blair government , which commissioned it .
This would also see the election of " top - up " MPs in proportion to the votes cast .
The Government 's Democratic Renewal Council , chaired by Gordon Brown , met this week .
Although no final decision was taken , The Independent has learnt that the options it is considering include :
* Rushing through legislation before the election to allow a referendum on electoral reform shortly afterwards ;
* A polling day referendum on the principle of changing the system , to be followed by a second plebiscite if there were a " yes " vote ;
* A polling day referendum on a switch to AV or " AV plus " , to be implemented at the following general election ;
* A Labour manifesto commitment to change the system if the party retains power .
One cabinet source said : " The idea of a referendum on election day is on the agenda .
It is a very live issue . "
Yesterday , senior Labour figures denied that the move was a desperate attempt to cling on to power by muddying the waters at the election and pitching for the votes of people who support reform .

" People have a way of getting the government they want , " one Labour source said .
" It could easily go the other way – voters might be more likely to vote against a proposal made by the government of the day . "
The driving force for the last - minute push by Labour after 12 years in power is the expenses controversy .
The party 's internal polls show it remains a huge issue for the public .
" Two things matter on the doorsteps : the economy and expenses , " one Labour adviser said last night .
" The expenses row means people are not listening to us on the economy .
So we have to try to restore trust , and one way is to change a discredited voting system . "
The Tories strongly oppose electoral reform , and are bound to accuse Labour of " moving the goalposts " and trying to curry favour with the Liberal Democrats in case there is a hung parliament .
Tories point to a YouGov survey for the Electoral Reform Society which found that , among people intending to vote Liberal Democrat , 9 per cent say a referendum would make them " much more likely " to vote Labour and 21 per cent " somewhat more likely " to do so .
Only 4 per cent would be deterred .
Even if the public voted for reform in an election - day referendum , a Cameron government would be unlikely to act on it .
Similarly , if legislation were forced through calling for a post-election referendum , it could be overturned by an incoming Tory administration .
Labour officials say that raising the issue could allow the party to portray Mr Cameron as " anti-reform " .
There is frustration in Labour circles that the Tory leader has appeared to outflank the Government by responding quickly during the expenses saga .
Many Labour
MPs oppose reform and grassroots activists who want to keep the present system are calling for a debate on the issue at the party 's annual conference in Brighton this month .
Electoral reform :
The options
The Alternative Vote ( AV )
Instead of voting for one candidate , people can rank the candidates in order of preference .
The candidate coming last drops out and second preferences are redistributed until one candidate enjoys more than 50 per cent .
Retains link between MPs and their constituents .
Used in Australia .
AV Plus
People would have two votes – one for constituency MP ( as under AV ) and one for a top - up list in 65 areas in England , eight in Scotland , four in Wales and two in Northern Ireland .
Some 80 to 85 per cent of MPs would be elected in individual constituencies .
The rest would be " top - up MPs " to reduce disproportionality and geographical divisions of first - past - the - post system .
A federal judge has dismissed the music industry contention that when a cellphone 's ringtone begins playing , copyright infringement starts happening since others can hear the song , essentially arguing that a mobile phone is a portable concert hall .
That argument meant that millions of mobile phone users were copyright scofflaws anytime anyone called them .
The American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers , known as ASCAP , was attempting to wring even more royalties from music lovers , who already pay ringtone royalties when they buy ringtones .
Additionally , ASCAP collects royalty payments for public performances of songs from venues as divergent as a summer camp and a stadium .
While ASCAP 's much - ridiculed argument in the case was a legal long shot , copyright chaos might have ensued had the royalty - collecting group actually prevailed .
" The ruling is an important victory for consumers , making it clear that playing music in public , when done without any commercial purpose , does not infringe copyright , " wrote Fred von Lohmann , a copyright attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
ASCAP was suing AT&T and Verizon in a New York federal court , seeking more revenue for its members .
But U.S. District Judge Denise Cote wrote Wednesday that " ASCAP has not shown any infringement of its members ' rights by the playing of ringtones in the public from Verizon 's customer 's telephones . "
The decision ( .pdf ) also set aside ASCAP 's arguments that it was entitled to double its royalties , from 24 cents to 48 cents , for the reproduction of a ringtone .
The group , which represents artists and songwriters , claimed that the mobile phone carriers were publicly performing the song when it enabled the ringtone to be downloaded by a music fan .
" ASCAP has failed to raise a question of fact that the downloading of a ringtone from Verizon to a customer 's cellular telephone is a public performance of a musical work , " Cote ruled .

The Swedish armed forces have been hit by a major equipment problem , according to reports .
Flimsy military brassieres are unable to stand up to the strains imposed when female Swedish troops perform " rigorous exercises " , routinely bursting open or even catching fire - so forcing busty young conscripts to hurriedly strip off in the field .
The revelations come courtesy of the Gothenburg Post and English - language Swedish journal The Local .
The Post reported yesterday on concerns raised by the Swedish Conscription Council , an organisation concerned with the rights of conscript troops in the Swedish forces .
Council spokesperson Paulina Rehbinder told The Local that government - issue military brassieres supplied to young female soldiers have long been unfit for combat .
According to the paper :
The women complained that the bras ’ fasteners have a tendency to come undone when the women performed rigorous exercise , forcing the female soldiers to take off all of their equipment in order to refasten the brassieres .
The Post apparently brought the related bosom - combustion issue to light , noting that bras can catch fire during combat and then " melt onto conscripts ’ skin " .
“ Our opinion is that the Swedish Armed Forces should have ordered good , flame - proof underwear , ” Rehbinder said .
“ There should be suitable apparel for women . ”
Rehbinder reportedly added that the problems have persisted for twenty years , with generations of young Swedish womens ' tophamper routinely breaking free of confinement to oscillate wildly during army PT sessions and field exercises - presumably often followed by impromptu stripteases as the more jubtabulously fortunate female troops sought to re-fasten their flimsy government lingerie .
The problems would apparently be easy to sort out .
Unaccountably , however , it appears that the male - dominated Swedish military hierarchy has failed to act .
Rehbinder reportedly - though perhaps mistakenly - believes that change is on the horizon .
She told The Local that 2,000 new young female recruits are to enter the Swedish forces next year , and that top brass had been informed of this recently .
" That got them moving , ” she said . ®
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - U.S. auto sales tumbled by 23 percent in September as showrooms emptied after the government - funded boom from the “ cash for clunkers ” program , with General Motors Co and Chrysler hardest - hit .
An employee stands amid cars at the stockyard of General Motors India Ltd. plant at Halol , about 150 ( 93 miles ) east from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad August 28 , 2009 .

Sales for General Motors Co and Chrysler -- the two U.S. automakers struggling to regain momentum after emerging from bankruptcy -- dropped by 45 percent and 42 percent , respectively .
Ford -- the only U.S. automaker to have avoided bankruptcy -- managed to hold its sales decline to 5 percent from a year earlier despite low inventories and reduced incentives for car shoppers .
Automakers had braced for a sharp pullback in September after the clunkers program and taxpayer - funded credits of up to $ 4,500 drove sales sharply higher the month before .
The overall result was in line with those forecasts as industry - wide U.S. auto sales dropped 41 percent from August , according to Autodata Corp .
On the annualized basis tracked by analysts , industry - wide U.S. auto sales dropped to 9.2 million vehicles in September , the weakest sales rate since April .
In a reversal of fortune that underscores how deep the decline in U.S. auto sales has cut over the four - year - long slump , China ’s overall vehicle sales for September were almost twice as large as the industry - wide U.S. tally , according to an estimate provided by GM .
Meanwhile , U.S. sales for the three major Japanese automakers were also lower in September after gains in August during the short - lived cash - for - clunkers boom .
Honda Motor
Co sales were down 20 percent in the month .
Toyota Motor
Co sales fell almost 13 percent .
Nissan Motor
Co sales were down 7 percent .
“ Consumer traffic at dealerships evaporated in the absence of the incentive program , which ended in August , ” Standard & Poor ’s equity analyst Efraim Levy said in a note .
“ However , we expect the September lull to be temporary , as the comparisons get easier and we see the economy improving . ”
Hyundai Motor
Co , which has taken market share through the U.S. recession on a growing reputation for low - cost and high - quality vehicles , was the only big winner .
Its sales jumped 27 percent in September .
Combined with its affiliate Kia , Hyundai now ranks as the sixth - largest automaker in the U.S. market , having outstripped Nissan over the first nine months of the year .

Major automakers held out hope for a gradual recovery in sales in the fourth quarter once dealer stocks of cars and trucks are built back up in the coming weeks and showroom traffic recovers from the slow pace of early September .
Sales in September 2008 were rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial crisis , events that pushed both GM and Chrysler to seek a federal bailout .
With consumer uncertainty rising , sales in September a year earlier had dropped to a 12.2 million unit rate .
Ford economist Emily Kolinski Morris said the automaker believed that recent economic indicators and the monthly sales figures pointed toward “ continued gradual recovery albeit with some fits and starts . ”
Ford said it would step up its leasing program with dealers .
Analysts said they expected the No. 2 U.S. automaker was poised to take more share from its rivals in the months ahead .
“ In the short term , I do n’t see much of change for GM and Chrysler in terms of sales declines .
The No. 1 reason really is their product lineup , ” said Jesse Toprak , an analyst at Truecar.com .
“ The bigger question is whether they can restructure themselves to make money at lower sales levels -- it ’s going to be tough , obviously , ” he said .
Morningstar analyst David Whiston said the auto industry would face continued economic uncertainty in the months ahead .
“ With no government stimulus , you have a weak consumer who is reluctant to make a big - ticket purchase unless they have to , ” Whiston said .
“ It ’s not just a Detroit problem . ”
‘ WE ARE NOT BLEEDING LIKE PEOPLE THINK ’
Fiat SpA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne , who has taken charge of Chrysler ’s turnaround plan after the Italian automaker took management control at the U.S. automaker , said reduced incentive spending had contributed to the depressed sales result for September .
“ We are not bleeding like people think we are , ” Marchionne told reporters .
Marchionne , who is due to detail his plans for a revival of Chrysler ’s vehicle line - up to Obama administration officials this week , said Chrysler would bounce back stronger , just as Fiat did five years ago .
“ The future is going to be a lot better , ” he said .
GM said it was sticking with plans to increase production in North America by 20 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter .
GM , which launched an ad blitz in September challenging consumers to compare its cars to rivals , remained the largest automaker by U.S. market share at 21 percent compared with 17 percent for Toyota , now No. 2 in the United States .
“ Clearly , the economy is starting to gain some momentum , ” said GM sales analyst Mike DiGiovanni .
“ But we know it ’s still going to be bumpy and clearly the economy is still dependent on policy stimulus . ”
Auto industry tracking firm Edmunds.com estimated that the average discount on a new car was $ 2,557 in September , down about 12 percent from a year earlier .
That incentive spending is closely tracked by analysts and investors as a measure of the industry ’s pricing power and the pressure to move inventory .
Not one of the 30 Republican senators who voted against Sen .
Al Franken ’s anti-rape amendment agreed to explain their rationale when MSNBC came calling , news host Rachel Maddow told her audience Wednesday evening .
Jamie Leigh Jones , the woman whose alleged gang rape at the hands of co-workers at defense contractor KBR was the inspiration for the amendment , appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show Thursday night to laud its passing in the Senate earlier this month .
The amendment prohibits the government from contracting with companies that refuse to allow employees to pursue rape allegations in court .
ADVERTISEMENT
As Jones explained to Maddow , that was the case with KBR — then a subsidiary of Halliburton — when the company responded to Jones ’ allegations of rape by locking her in a shipping container and refusing to give her access to medical treatment or contact with the outside world .
“ I cannot even understand the reasoning as to why anyone would vote against ” the Franken amendment , Jones told Maddow .
“ I ’m thrilled it ’s gotten as far as it has gotten . ”
But , according to a report at the Huffington Post , the amendment — though considered to be wildly popular — may have trouble getting any further .
Reporter Sam Stein cites “ multiple sources ” who told him Sen.
Daniel Inouye , Democrat of Hawaii , is considering watering down the amendment , or eliminating it altogether , when it goes to a vote on the Senate floor as part of a defense appropriations bill .
Stein reports :
Inouye ’s office , sources say , has been lobbied by defense contractors adamant that the language of the Franken amendment would leave them overly exposed to lawsuits and at constant risk of having contracts dry up .
As Rachel Slajda reported at TalkingPoints Memo , despite the horrible optics of appearing to be in favor of rape , both the White House and the Pentagon are opposed to the amendment , at least in its current form .
ADVERTISEMENT
The [ Pentagon ] argued that it and its subcontractors “ may not be in a position to know about such things , ” i.e. , whether contractors employ the mandatory arbitration clauses .
“ Enforcement would be problematic , ” the note read , because contractors may not be privy to what ’s in their subcontractors ’ contracts .
The department suggests that “ it may be more effective ” to seek a law that would prohibit the clauses in any business contracts within U.S. jurisdiction .
A White House spokesman told Slajda that President Obama supports “ the intent of the amendment , ” and is working with legislators to rewrite the amendment so as “ to make sure it is enforceable . ”
But even as the wheeling and dealing over the Franken amendment continues inside the Beltway , on Main Street the GOP ’s opposition to it has been turned into a powerful talking point for Democrats and progressives .
A Web site entitled Republicans For Rape has sprung up , satirizing the 30 senators ’ opposition to the amendment .
ADVERTISEMENT
On her show Thursday night , Maddow listed the names of all 30 senators who voted against the amendment , and suggested she continues to hope they will eventually speak up about their vote .
“ Senators , I want you to know , the invitation [ to appear on the show ] remains open , ” she said .

Enlarge AFP / Getty Images Arnold Schwarzenegger signed an amendment that permits lawsuits against media outlets who pay for material that they know was illegally obtained .
LOS ANGELES ( AP )  California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed an anti-paparazzi bill making it easier to sue media outlets that use photos that invade celebrities ' privacy .
The former Terminator star signed an amendment Sunday to a decade - old law that allows fines against paparazzi who illegally or offensively take photos or recordings .
The amendment permits lawsuits against media outlets that pay for and make first use of material they knew was improperly obtained .
Tabloid magazines , TV shows and Internet sites sometimes pay millions for celebrity fodder .
In 1998 Schwarzenegger had his car surrounded by paparazzi as he picked up his child from school .
Other stars have had car accidents while trying to flee swarms of photographers .
The amendment takes effect in January .

You have to hand it to the folks at Apple Inc .
Once they get the bit between their teeth , no matter how long it takes , a race to the front can be reasonably predicted .
On Monday , the Cupertino company rocked the world - at least the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's world - by abruptly quitting the business lobby on account of the latter 's " recent comments opposing the EPA 's effort to limit greenhouse gases . "
Such comments , like putting climate change through a " Scopes monkey trial , " already have prompted PG&E and others to exit the chamber .
" Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions , and it is frustrating to find the Chamber at odds with us in this effort , " Apple VP for worldwide government affairs Catherine Novelli wrote to chamber President Thomas Donohue .
So , " we have decided to resign our membership effective immediately . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Up to now , Apple has been slapped around for appearing slow to embrace the green mantra .
It was a lowly No. 133 in Newsweek 's environmental ranking of 500 U.S. companies .
HP and Dell were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 , respectively .
Microsoft , ranked No. 31 , beat Apple , for heaven 's sake .
Admittedly stung by the perception - or so I was told by an Apple insider - CEO Steve Jobs ordered the company to " be much more transparent " about its 10.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions , and what it was doing about them .
Accordingly , last week , the company revealed a Web site that tracks the " environmental footprint " of the cycle of each of its products , from manufacturing to transportation to consumer use and recycling , along with energy efficiency measures and steps to reduce emissions ( www.apple.com/environment).
The chamber , meanwhile , must be feeling the lash .
It insisted in a hurried statement last week that it " support (s ) strong federal legislation and a binding international agreement to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change . "
( Just not any legislation it 's seen going through Congress . )
That may not be enough to stanch the flow .
Remember the saying , " monkey see , monkey do " ?
Full faith and credit required : Today , California rolls another $ 4.5 billion worth of tax - exempt and taxable bonds .
Individual buyers get first crack , until Thursday , when the big institutions weigh in .
One might think , with all its fiscal woes , that anything the Tarnished State put on the market would be a tough sell .
But no .
Just two weeks ago , $ 8.8 billion worth of bonds flew off the shelves , despite California 's near - junk credit rating .
Of course , that might have something to do with the decent yields and investor fears about buying anything but government bonds these days .
Much of the money raised is serving a less - than - inspiring purpose - to help pay off and fund the state 's existing debt .
If you 're looking for something more constructive in the latest offering , go for the federally subsidized Build America Bonds , a creation of the Obama administration 's stimulus package designed to finance projects such as schools , parks , hospitals and housing .
There is a price to pay , of course .
More bond sales add to the state 's humongous debt , which currently stands at $ 67 billion .
According to Treasurer Bill Lockyer 's just - released " debt affordability report , " paying off interest and principal on them is estimated to account for more than 10 percent of the state 's General Fund by 2014 , " unless the budget improves . "
President Barack Obama received a great deal of media attention on Wednesday for signing a historic hate - crimes bill into law .
But , on the same day , the US president also signed a Homeland Security spending bill that received far less attention , even though it effectively blocks efforts by activists to reveal photos of detainee abuse in US custody .
“ We are disappointed that the president has signed a law giving the Defense Department the authority to hide evidence of its own misconduct , and we hope the defense secretary will not take advantage of that authority by suppressing photos related to the abuse of prisoners , ” Jameel Jaffer , national security director for the ACLU , said in a statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier this month , the House and Senate inserted language into the Homeland Security appropriations bill that would shield photos of detainees in the US ’s war on terror from the Freedom of Information Act .
The language , which was added at the prodding of Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , effectively blocks an ACLU lawsuit currently before the courts that would have forced the government to release the photos under Freedom of Information statutes .
As Daphne Eviatar noted at the Washington Independent , “ President Obama initially agreed to release the photos , but changed his mind after consulting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others at the Pentagon , who warned the photos would endanger US servicemen in Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
At issue are 21 photos of detainees in US custody that the Department of Defense has been fighting tooth and nail from releasing .
As Raw Story reported earlier this year , those photos may show acts of sexual abuse being carried out against detainees .
Major General Antonio Taguba , the author of a report on allegations of detainee abuse in U.S. prisons in Iraq , said that photos exist depicting the following :
– An American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner .
– A male translator apparently raping a male detainee .
– A female prisoner having her clothing forcibly removed to expose her breasts .
ADVERTISEMENT
Other photographs depict sexual assaults on prisoners with a truncheon , wire and a phosphorescent tube , according to Taguba .
TRANSFER OF GITMO PRISONERS NOW LEGAL
However , there was some good news for human - rights advocates in the Homeland Security bill .
Another provision in the law allows for the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to US soil for trial .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The administration should now do exactly that , ” the ACLU ’s Jaffer said .
“ The military commissions at Guantanamo are not just unlawful but unnecessary .
The federal courts are fully capable of prosecuting terrorism suspects while protecting both national security interests and fundamental due process . ”
President Obama made closing the detention facility for terrorism suspects in Guantanamo Bay a cornerstone of his electoral campaign .
Since coming into office , the president has struggled to make good on the promise , slowly shifting detainees out of the facility whenever possible , and facing opposition to the idea that prisoners should be tried in the US from political opponents concerned about national security .

MORE TORTURE DOCS MAY ARRIVE FRIDAY : MOTHER JONES
Some 224 documents related to the Bush administration ’s “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” could be released by the government as early as Friday , says a report at Mother Jones magazine .
Among those documents could be a 59 - page , 2002 top secret memo from the Pentagon detailing torture techniques .
The Obama administration had intitially believed the documents could be kept from the public under current laws , but upon closer inspection , found that Freedom of Information laws could apply to them , reports Nick Baumann .
ADVERTISEMENT
However , as Baumann noted , the documents could still be blocked from release — ironically , by the person appointed to look into criminal prosecution of CIA torturers .
John Durham , the special prosecutor appointed by Attorney General Eric Holder this summer to investigate abuses in the CIA ’s interrogation program , “ could conceivably preempt the release of any documents . ”
Baumann reported :
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki asked Turkey on Thursday to stop crossing the border to launch military operations targeting Kurdish rebels , saying it violates Iraqi sovereignty .
Mr. Maliki made his request during a visit to Baghdad by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who came to Iraq to sign agreements to boost economic ties in energy and other sectors , Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said .

Republican Dede Scozzafava has suspended her bid in next Tuesday ’s NY 23 special election , a huge development that dramatically shakes up the race .
She did not endorse either of her two opponents -- Conservative party candidate Doug Hoffman or Democrat Bill Owens .
The decision to suspend her campaign is a boost for Hoffman , who already had the support of 50 percent of GOP voters , according to a newly - released Siena poll , and is now well - positioned to win over the 25 percent of Republicans who had been sticking with Scozzafava .
Scozzafava has “ probably made her last campaign appearance between now and Election Day , ” spokesman Matt Burns told POLITICO .
“ She ’s releasing her support to the two other candidates . "
" I had a discussion with her last night , and we made the decision after I spoke with her .
We talked about it , what this came down to was spending .
It came down to the ability to defend herself from the get - go .
And that ’s the reality .
She was unable to define herself where the people did n’t know her . "
POLITICO has the full story on Scozzafava 's surprise decision here .
Scozzafava 's statement :
Dear Friends and Supporters :
Throughout the course of my campaign for Congress , I have made the people of the 23rd District and the issues that affect them the focal point of my campaign .
As a life long resident of this District , I care deeply and passionately about its people and our way of life .
Whether as a candidate for Congress , a State Assemblywoman or a small town Mayor , I have always sought to act with the best interest of our District and its residents in mind — and today I again seek to act for the good of our community .
The opportunity to run as the Republican and Independence Party candidate to represent the 23rd District has been and remains one of the greatest honors of my life .
During the past several months , as I ’ve traveled the district , meeting and talking with voters about the issues that matter most to them , I ’ve been overwhelmed by the amount of support I ’ve received as I sought to serve as their voice in Washington .
However , as Winston Churchill once said , Democracy can be a fickle employer , and the road to public office is not always a smooth one .
In recent days , polls have indicated that my chances of winning this election are not as strong as we would like them to be .
The reality that I ’ve come to accept is that in today ’s political arena , you must be able to back up your message with money — and as I ’ve been outspent on both sides , I ’ve been unable to effectively address many of the charges that have been made about my record .
But as I ’ve said from the start of this campaign , this election is not about me , it ’s about the people of this District .
And , as always , today I will do what I believe serves their interests best .
It is increasingly clear that pressure is mounting on many of my supporters to shift their support .
Consequently , I hereby release those individuals who have endorsed and supported my campaign to transfer their support as they see fit to do so .
I am and have always been a proud Republican .
It is my hope that with my actions today , my Party will emerge stronger and our District and our nation can take an important step towards restoring the enduring strength and economic prosperity that has defined us for generations .
On Election Day my name will appear on the ballot , but victory is unlikely .
To those who support me – and to those who choose not to – I offer my sincerest thanks .
Dede

" You lot take it up the arse , " were Diego Maradona 's words to the press immediately after his team secured a place at next year 's World Cup finals .
It was almost adding injury to the insult when he scanned the room and added , " if the ladies will pardon the expression " .
Looking increasingly Botox - ridden , the angry yet victorious Argentina coach was somehow able to raise a nervous chuckle from those on the receiving end of the abuse .
He wanted to dedicate the triumph to the fans back home and especially those who bothered to cross into Uruguay , to his girls Dalma and Giannina , and to his squad , who worked like never before for the 1–0 result .
" But certain people who have not supported me , and you know who you are , can keep sucking , " he added .
Grotesque and undignified , Maradona then grabbed his genitals with both hands , signalling some sort of manly insult to the TV cameras in the tunnel outside the dressing room .
In stark contrast , Uruguay 's manager , Oscar Tabárez , praised his own team and their opponents .
He had also impressed with the gentle manner in which he had helped Carlos Tevez back to his feet after a Uruguayan tackle had rolled the Argentina forward off the pitch during the game , and with the kind but firm way in which he expressed the view that his side could still make it to South Africa via next month 's two - leg play - off with Costa Rica .
The Uruguay - born commentator Víctor Hugo Morales described the match as mediocre – " it is so bad it 's not surprising the fans are celebrating a goal scored in a different match altogether , " he said when news of the already qualified Chile 's goal against Ecuador spread – and it was one which Argentina arguably won despite , rather than because of , Maradona 's influence .
Afterwards the players hugged each other and wept with joy as their manager wobbled towards the 70 - year - old general manager , Carlos Bilardo , and they clutched each other sobbing .
When those two joined forces for their first World Cup , in 1986 , they famously felt everyone was out to get them .
" We had to leg it out of the country , even the government were asking for my head , " Bilardo would later recount .
Their sense of triumph in adversity was a theme throughout that tournament , and when Fifa 's cameras captured the dressing - room celebration of a demented Diego waving his shirt in the air after the final and bellowing " we dedicate this to all of you , the fucking whore that gave birth to you " , the clip was slotted into an otherwise classy edit of the tournament and released as a successful film , Hero .
There has been a sense that something similar is in the air right now : almost as if the antagonism fuels Maradona , keeps him alive even .
As ever there is an element of truth in his opinions , and they shape his perceptions .
But just because he 's paranoid does not mean they 're not all out to get him .
After an initial treading - on - eggshells approach , the Argentinian press has been more and more candid about its reservations .
Criticisms are dealt out more readily and severely , and the personal gets mixed up with the professional .
And Maradona himself blurs the lines : his first game , against Scotland in Glasgow , saw a weepy manager discuss his daughter 's pregnancy in detail after she had been admitted to hospital .
The child 's father , the striker Sergio " El Kun " Agüero , left the training camp to be with her .
Maradona considered this the main issue of the day , praising his players for their ability to behave like caring human beings .
There was no mention of tactics , line - ups , or anything else related to the game .
Almost a year on baby Benjamin has been born and amid rumours that the young couple are going through a rough patch , Agüero did not even get a place on the bench last night .
Although these titbits of gossip are not published , they spread like wildfire .
Inside details from the camp are leaked in streams of text messages to selected journalists .
The afternoon before the Uruguay match , one AFA insider messaged several of them just before 3 pm , saying Maradona had just got up .
It 's hard not to be paranoid in that context .
But more worryingly still , Maradona 's outburst echoes the warring attitude of the long - standing AFA president , Julio Grondona , towards the main media in particular , and most of the press in general .
Yesterday he had a slight loss of cool when he spoke of how he is tired of " taking it " for 18 years .
Singling out obscure radio stations for very specific criticisms of him , Grondona said he reads and listens to everything , all night long .
His language of hatred and the way it was delivered left a sour taste .
And it is not just Maradona 's team who are finding it difficult .
The Under - 20s failed to qualify for their World Cup , something which has hardly been discussed in the press yet .
Wednesday may have been the night on which Argentina confirmed their reservation at South Africa 2010 , but if it goes on like this it ain't going to be pretty .
And even though some of us chuckled during Maradona 's press conference , deep down we also know that it 's not funny either .

ARMY WORKING WITH OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FOR US DEPLOYMENT
By NWV News writer Jim Kouri
Posted 1:00 AM
Eastern
October 26 , 2009
© 2009 NewsWithViews.com
[ NewswithViews.com participated in a " Bloggers Roundtable " with the Department of Defense .
The following report is based on that teleconference . ]
In a report released to the US Congress recently , analysts assessed what they termed " preparedness tests " between the US military and government agencies at the federal , state and local levels .
U.S. Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) exercises to test preparedness to perform its homeland defense and civil support missions .
The Government Accountability Office was asked to assess the extent to which NORTHCOM is consistent with Department of Defense guidelines for training and exercise requirement involving interagency partners and states in its exercises .
NORTHCOM ’s exercise program is generally consistent with the requirements of DOD ’s Joint Training System , but its exercise reporting is inconsistent .
Since the command was established in 2002 , NORTHCOM has conducted 13 large - scale exercises and generally completed exercise summary reports within the required time frame .
However , those reports did not consistently include certain information , such as areas needing improvement , because NORTHCOM lacks guidance that specifies exercise reports ’ content and format , potentially impacting its ability to meet internal standards for planning and execution of joint exercises , and to compare and share exercise results over time with interagency partners and states .
" While the rationale for using the US military domestically had been debated for years , President Barack Obama appears intent on using our military at least until he can create his promised ' Civilian Security Force ' which he said would be as big and powerful as the military , " said political strategist Mike Baker .
" The fact that the military -- in this instance NORTHCOM -- is being trained to operate with our borders should be setting off alarms throughout this nation .
But it 's being ignored even by those who profess to be conservatives , " he said .
Nineteen federal agencies and organizations and 17 states and the District of Columbia have participated in one or more of the seven large - scale exercises that NORTHCOM has conducted since September 2005 .
However , NORTHCOM faces challenges in involving states in the planning , conduct , and assessment of its exercises , such as adapting its exercise system and practices to involve other federal , state , local , and tribal agencies that do not have the same practices or level of planning resources .
Inconsistencies with how NORTHCOM involves states in exercises are occurring in part because NORTHCOM officials lack experience dealing with states and do not have a consistent process for including states in exercises .
Without such a process , NORTHCOM increases the risk that its exercises will not provide benefits for all participants , impact the seamless exercise of all levels of government , and potentially affect NORTHCOM ’s ability to provide civil support capabilities .
" It is up to the residents of individual states to tell their governors they do not want the federal government intruding on law enforcement and public safety issues , " said former NYPD detective and Marine intelligence officer Sid Frances .
" This is especially true if their governors share the same political philosophy as the President and his minions in Washington , " he added .

NORTHCOM has a systematic lessons learned and corrective action program to improve preparedness , but gaps remain with collecting and sharing lessons with agency and state partners and managing corrective actions .
Access to the system NORTHCOM uses for managing exercise observations is limited for non-DOD participants , and DOD believes that the Department of Homeland Security ’s system is not adequately protected from unauthorized users .
NORTHCOM ’s mitigation steps have not resolved the issues .
In addition , about 20 percent of the corrective actions tracked by NORTHCOM were being closed prematurely due to gaps in oversight .
Closing issues prematurely increases the risk that issues will reoccur and limits the knowledge gained and value of the exercise .
The Government Accountability Office is making recommendations to DOD to direct NORTHCOM to consistently involve the states in planning , executing , and assessing exercises and improve oversight of corrective actions .
The GAO is also recommending that DOD define when NORTHCOM should use planning and documentation requirements .
DOD agreed or partially agreed with the recommendations and cited ongoing and future efforts to satisfy the recommendations ’ intent .
DOD did not fully address a recommendation on training to NORTHCOM staff on specific state emergency management structures .
GAO believes such training would benefit NORTHCOM personnel in advance of a crisis and for exercise planning .
The first active - duty unit dedicated to supporting US civilian authorities in the event of a nuclear , biological or chemical attack is wrapping up three days of intensive training in tactics to be used within the continental United States , according to Armed Forces Press Service representative Donna Miles .
Ms. Miles reported to news reporters , bloggers and Internet journalists that troops from the 3rd Infantry Division 's 1st Brigade Combat Team are at the Naval facility located in Indian Head , Maryland getting hands - on training in skills they would depend on to provide support during a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive incident , known here as a CBRNE .
However , not everyone is happy about this latest military development coming so close to the transition from the Bush White House to the Obama Administration .
Some observers believe this plan is part of a deal between President Obama and the current Secretary of Defense who remained in his current position even after the Bush - Obama transition .
" While Obama and his team are making it sound as if they will use the military in a non-combative roll , part of the training being conducted is in urban warfare , " claims Mike Baker .
" Obama appears oblivious to Posse Comitatus and to the US Constitution when it comes to using the military against civilians within US borders , " he added .
While So- called military experts appear excited about this use of soldiers within the borders of the United States , many police commanders and officers are less enthusiastic .
" I cannot understand why the federal government is so intent on using such military force within our borders .
It reminds me of the Branch Davidian massacre in Waco , Texas when the feds used excessive deadly force against men , women and children .
And they used that deadly physical force based on false information , " warns former Det. Frances .

" While I 've served in the military and continue as a reservist , as a [ New Jersey ] cop I 'm troubled about the use of federal troops coming into our communities during any emergencies , " said Detective Lieutenant Stephan Rodgers

On Tuesday , Breckenridge , Colorado could become the latest American city to legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults .
The legalization measure , placed on the ballot after campaigners turned in a petition with almost three - times the number of signatures required , would also permit adults to posses bongs , pipes , bubblers and other so - called marijuana paraphernalia .

Allowing paraphernalia would be a first for U.S. voters , according to Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Bruce Mirken , who spoke with the Associated Press .
“ I do n’t think there ’s anywhere else in the country that has legalized paraphernalia , ” he said .
In Colorado , the current penalty for being caught with marijuana paraphernalia is $ 100 .
According to Colorado ’s Summit Daily News , the Breckenridge petition needed 500 signatures , but over 1,400 were collected .
If the measure passes , the town will remove all penalties for adults found in possession of up to one ounce .
“ It will not make it more available to minors , wo n’t make it legal to smoke it on the street , wo n’t get you out of trouble if you ’re stoned behind the wheel , ” the Daily News opined in an editorial supporting the measure .
“ What it says is that if you , as an adult , choose to possess small amounts of marijuana for personal use , you wo n’t be busted for it .
It ’s still a much more stringent law than those that apply to alcohol — a substance you can own as much as you want of and consume in public . ”
The paper added : “ Eventually , it seems these small possession busts will be a thing of the past state - wide , which makes us conclude some kind of ‘ nuisance pot smoke ’ ordinance needs to take their place — roughly analogous to public intoxication statutes . ”

“ ‘ We do n’t want to spend our tax dollars prosecuting this , so we ’re saying , let ’s just stop it , ’ said Sean McAllister , a Breckenridge attorney who proposed the ordinance , ” according to ABC 7 News in Denver .
The town ’s police chief has said he opposes the measure because it places Breckenridge at odds with state law .
Should the town legalize marijuana , municipal police officers who choose to make an arrest would be required to transport their prisoners to the Summit County Sheriff ’s Department , AP noted .
However , the measure would not truly pose much of an inconvenience for officers , as the county ’s sheriff is located mere moments away from the town ’s police department .

The odds that this measure will pass appear to be quite strong .
While an effort to legalize marijuana state - wide failed during the 2006 elections , Breckenridge voters supported it by a margin of nearly 3 - to - 1 , ABC noted .
Breckenridge , a famous winter get - away for skiing enthusiasts , has roughly 3,300 registered voters .
Mexico announced recently that it will decriminalize the possession of " small amounts of drugs " — marijuana , cocaine , LSD , methamphetamines , heroin and opium — " for personal use . "
Individuals who are caught by law enforcement with quantities below established thresholds will no longer face criminal prosecution .
A person apprehended three times with amounts below the minimum , though , will face mandatory treatment .
For the government of President Felipe Calderón , which has spent the ...
Mrs Clinton said the US was reviewing its approach to militancy US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said whoever wins Afghanistan 's recent election will be expected to do more to address the country 's problems .
Speaking to the BBC while in London , Mrs Clinton said the next leader needed to build better relationships with the US , the army and the Afghan people .
She said America 's goal in Afghanistan was still to defeat al - Qaeda .
But the current US review of the conflict was " leading to some welcome clarity " on the best tactics , she said .
Mrs Clinton , currently on a European tour , told the BBC's Today programme that the US was " anxiously awaiting " the outcome of the presidential elections which were held in Afghanistan in August .

The results have been delayed over accusations of fraud and malpractice .
Preliminary results indicate that the incumbent , Hamid Karzai , leads with about 55 % of the vote - considerably ahead of his nearest rival Abdullah Abdullah , who has 28 % .
' Welcome clarity ' BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mrs Clinton appeared unusually hesitant when asked whether the US would be proud to stand beside Mr Karzai if he emerged as the winner .
She said simply that the president had been " very helpful on many fronts " .
" We often overlook the progress made in Afghanistan because of the serious challenges that still exist , " she said .
" But we are very clear that , if this election results in him being re-elected , there must be a new relationship between him and the people of Afghanistan , between his government and governments which are supporting the efforts in Afghanistan to stabilise and secure the country . "
Mrs Clinton said the next president would also have to do more to train and deploy Afghan forces to take over from foreign troops .
" It is a more complex picture than sometimes emerges from snapshot views .
But clearly we expect more ; we 're going to be working towards more , " she said .
Late on Sunday , the New York Times quoted senior administration officials as saying the US president was impatient and " not satisfied " with progress on developing civil institutions , the judiciary and security forces in Afghanistan .
President Barack Obama 's civilian goals had been largely unmet , the officials said .
Mr Obama announced in March he would deploy hundreds of civilians to work in the country but officials told the paper that , because of deteriorating security , many aid workers could not travel outside the capital to advise farmers .
The US president is currently undertaking a review of the US military involvement in Afghanistan and the wider region , eight years after the operation began .
Pakistan ' to strike at militants '
Who are the Taliban ?
UN confirms Afghan poll fraud
The militant nexus
The commander of US forces in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McCrystal , has formally requested a significant increase in troop numbers .
Mr Obama is reported to have ruled out troop cuts or a major scaling back of the US effort in Afghanistan , but it remains unclear whether he will approve a significant escalation of an increasingly unpopular war .
Mrs Clinton described the review process as " a very thorough scrubbing " of US strategy which was " leading to some welcome clarity " .
She said America 's aim in the region was still " to achieve the goal of disrupting , dismantling and defeating al - Qaeda and its extremist allies " , but that it was now adopting " a much more careful analysis of who actually is allied with al - Qaeda " .
" We want to be smart about how we are proceeding .
The lives that our young men and women , both American and British , have put at risk - and lost - are very much in our minds .
We intend to get this as right as is humanly possible . "
Mrs Clinton said many people had been paid or coerced to fight with the extremists - and developing partnerships with such people would yield results , as had been the case in Iraq .
The secretary of state 's visit comes at a time of increasing volatility in the region .
At the weekend , some 19 people died when militants ambushed an army base in Rawalpindi in neighbouring Pakistan , an attack blamed by Pakistan on the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
Mrs Clinton said the attack on Rawalpindi , an army town to the south of the capital , Islamabad , showed militants in Pakistan were increasingly threatening the authority of the state .
But she said the US saw no evidence they were going to succeed , or that Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal was under threat .

Ice Hockey
bet365 has gone out of their way to create one of the most comprehensive betting markets offers I ’ve seen in the industry .

This offered unprecedented choice when I was making bets , unlike many other sportsbooks I ’ve reviewed in the past .

Most of the Canadian punters like myself love betting on ice hockey , and here you are in for a treat .
What I found at bet365 ice hockey betting markets was one of the most streamlined betting experiences coupled with the top - notch betting market offer and advanced betting tools .
Ice hockey is one of the most well - represented sports to bet on at bet365 with all major ice hockey leagues around the globe covered , as well as a number of minor leagues .
Among ice hockey leagues that are offered at bet365 , I found NHL and AHL , as well as major European hockey leagues such as KHL , Swedish Hockey League , Czech Extraliga , Danish Metal Ligaen , Finnish SM Liga , German Eishockey Liga , Russian VHL etc .
Bet types offered include Money Line , Line , Over / Under Goals , Goalscorer , Double Chance and Correct Score bets among many others .
Other Sports
If you are trying to find some action on European soccer leagues such as Premier League , Bundesliga , La Liga or UEFA Champion ’s League , the offer that bet365 has is unmatched in Canada , in my personal opinion .
All major professional sports in the USA are covered as well .
If the NFL , NBA or MLB are your primary choice for action , you will find plenty of it .
bet365 is offering a variety of betting markets for these leagues , including future bets such as division , conference and overall winners .
We found especially helpful the presence of player performance betting markets , where you can bet on the individual performance of the major players in each team competing .
Less popular sports are offered as well .
We did find the Winter Sports offer to be lacking , especially in offering a variety of bet types .
Outside of Outright , Futures and Match Ups , there are very little things you can bet on when these sports are in question .
What really makes bet365 stand out is their awesome Cash - Out feature .
At any point during my active bet , bet365 offered to cash me out on the spot .
The amount offered will vary depending on the current results of the active bet / bets you have on your betting slip .
It is a great way for punters to minimize risks and increase the value of their betting .
Using this bet365 bonus code review , you can hit the bet365 betting markets in no time while getting additional funds to bet with .
