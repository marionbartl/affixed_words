Becky : Hey Warren , you said you had thoughts on the Dodd legislation , that --
We spoke this morning with Ric Mishkin who teaches here , the former Fed governor .
And he 's very worried about the Fed ’s independence and not only the ( Connecticut Senator Chris )
Dodd legislation that ’s out there but the ( Texas U.S. Representative ) Ron Paul legislation .
Just things that would take power away from the Federal Reserve ...
Do you worry about that ?
Buffett :
Well , I think there is nothing more important in the economic future of the country than to have an independent Fed .
And I think that ’s been demonstrated over the years .
I think it was demonstrated even particularly last fall .
But we do not want to fool around with the independence of the Fed .
Becky :
Do you think the system is perfectly fine ?
I mean , there are people who say it is an antiquated system anyway .
Buffett :
Well , perhaps the regional banks and all that sort of thing , was better adapted to 1911 or something .
I ’m not sure you need somebody reporting in from Omaha to tell them what pigs are doing , you know , or hogs … ( Laughs )
But in terms of its fundamental mission as a central bank --
Becky : Yeah .
Buffett : I think it ’s done a good job over the years .
I think it ’s had good leadership most of the time .
I think it has terrific leadership now .
And I think that curbing the independence of the Fed could lead to a lot of mischief .

Duct Tape : Every Soldier 's Friend
Advertisement
Duct tape became a staple of American DIY projects and repairs after World War II .
During the war , duck tape — as it was initially known — was distributed to soldiers to use in sealing ammo cans .
Industrious soldiers quickly started using it for all manner of repairs thanks to its strong adhesive and sturdy construction .
When millions of soldiers returned home from the war , they brought their respect for duct tape with them , rapidly introducing the now ubiquitous tape into popular culture .

How popular has duct tape become ?
When Forbes magazine put together a list of the top 20 tools in all of history including such items as the knife and compass , they forgot to include duct tape .
They received enough reader questions on their exclusion of duct tape to prompt them to write an entirely separate article singing its praises .
Not a bad place to hold in public opinion after less than a century on the scene .

Practically Speaking

Love for the quirky things people make with duct tape aside , it was born as a practical tool and it remains a practical tool .
When assessing the usefulness of duct tape , the proper question is not " What can duct tape fix ? " but " What can duct tape not fix ? " .
Sure there are many a situation where duct tape is n't the perfect solution , but the very fact that it 's a plausible , if perhaps temporary , solution is a testament to the versatility of duct tape .
Case in point :
Ten years ago I was on a road trip .
My friend Dave and I had stopped to get the oil in his car changed — much to Dave 's grumbling because he preferred to change his oil himself , but we were short on time .
The guy who changed the oil at the service station neglected to put the cap back on the oil tank and somehow we managed to drive over a hundred miles before the oil light came on and alerted us to the situation .
In an empty gravel lot next to a McDonald 's we assessed the situation .
It was a Sunday , we were in the middle of relatively nowhere , and we needed to solve the problem .
Our solution ?
Dump a quart of oil from Dave 's trunk into the oil reservoir , take a nice round stone about the size of the oil cap into the McDonald 's bathroom and wash all the dirt and crud off , wrap the stone in several layers of duct tape , and duct tape that lucky stone right down to the engine block .
It worked so well we never ended up buying a replacement cap .

So if duct tape wallets are n't your thing , what can you do with duct tape ?
Plugging holes in engines aside , you can use it to clear out a clogged drain , cover an outlet to keep curious fingers and pets out , and even get rid of warts on the cheap .
If you 're a bit of a masochist you can even use it to improve your posture .
The important thing about duct tape is to always keep it handy because you 're more likely to be limited by a lack of duct tape than by what you can't use duct tape for .
To that end you 'll definitely want to check out these two DIY pocket duct tape dispensers here and here .

Harry Reid apologizes for " light skinned " remark about Obama
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) apologized today for referring to President Barack Obama as " light skinned " and " with no Negro dialect " in private conversations during the 2008 presidential campaign .
" I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words , " said Reid in a statement .
" I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans , especially African Americans for my improper comments . "
President Obama said in a statement that he and Reid had spoken about the matter on Saturday afternoon .
" I accepted Harry 's apology without question because I 've known him for years , I 've seen the passionate leadership he 's shown on issues of social justice and I know what 's in his heart , " said Obama .
" As far as I am concerned , the book is closed . "
The Senate Majority Leader was officially neutral in the primary fight between Obama and then Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( N.Y. ) .
Reid 's remarks about Obama were revealed in " Game Change " , a book detailing the 2008 race penned by Time 's Mark Halperin and New York magazine 's John Heilemann .
Reid has written extensively about his relationship in a memoir entitled " The Good Fight " that was released last year .
In that book , Reid recalled talking to Obama about running for president in 2007 and telling the then junior Senator from Illinois : " If you want to be president , you can be president now . "
That same memoir contained an anecdote in which Obama told Reid he had a " gift " after delivering a speech on the Senate floor regarding then President Bush 's approach to the war in Iraq .
That remark drew considerable controversy from the Obama 's Republican critics .
The details about Reid 's remarks were first reported by the Atlantic .
Reid 's apology was first reported by the Jon Ralston .
Reid 's apology comes on the same day that a new poll conducted by the Las Vegas Review Journal showed him facing an uphill fight for re-election in 2010 .
Reid trailed former state Republican party chairwoman Sue Lowden by a 50 percent to 40 percent margin and was behind businessman Danny Tarkanian ( R ) 49 percent to 41 percent .
Only one in three voters viewed Reid favorably while 52 percent saw him in an unfavorable light in the poll .
Tarkanian said that Reid " disgraces himself almost monthly with some disparaging remark about his constituents , political opponents , or now the president , " in a statement released Saturday afternoon .
The National Republican Senatorial Committee echoed that sentiment in a statement of its own release Saturday afternoon .
" For those who hope to one day live in a color - blind nation it appears Harry Reid is more than a few steps behind them , " said communications director Brian Walsh .
" Unfortunately , this is just the latest in a long history of embarrassing and controversial remarks by the senior Senator from Nevada . "
Despite Reid 's dismal poll numbers , he told the Review - Journal that he has no plans to follow his colleagues Byron Dorgan ( N.D. ) and Chris Dodd ( Conn . ) into retirement .
" I am absolutely running for re-election , " Reid told the paper .
" These are difficult times for Nevada and as the majority leader of the Senate I have been able to take action to address those challenges . "
It 's unclear whether the near - certain controversy his remarks about Obama will cause might force Reid to reassess his re-election plans .
Ever since the US arms sales to Taiwan , the American administration has been trying to undermine relations , the deputy head of Chinese Embassy in Israel said in a special interview with Ynet on the heels of the dispute that has unraveled between China and the United States .
While the US is trying to garner Chinese support to impose sanctions on Iran , the Chinese official said that the recent tensions could harm political cooperation .
Straining Relations Clinton : China risks isolation over Iran Associated Press US secretary of state warns Beijing it risks disruption to its energy supplies unless it helps keep Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons Clinton : China risks isolation over Iran
Zhang Xiao'an outlined to Ynet the Chinese perspective on the slump in ties between the US and China .
She mentioned that in several occasions , China 's ties with new American president usually do n't start off so well , but gradually improve with time .
She said that now , there is an opposite process – after Obama was elected last year , ties between China and the United States got off on the right foot , and ever since the recent developments have been deteriorating .
US President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November and met with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jinato .
The visit was meant to improve ties between the two countries , but a line of disputes between the two superpowers followed instead .
This includes a dispute over the US - Taiwan weapons deal , the Dalai Lama 's planned visit in Washington , matters pertaining to trade , exchange rates , human rights and the Google affair .
Zhang said that she hoped the US would stands behind Obama 's statements in China , who vowed that his country would respect China 's interests and that the sensitive problems and issues would be solved via dialogue and cooperation .
Obama declared on his first day in office that he plans to boost ties with China , and went so far as to say that by the end of 2009 , the situation would be " better than ever " .

Danger in sanctions
Zhang addressed the issue of China 's objection to imposing sanctions on Iran and noted that her country supports the international stance against the development of Iranian nuclear weapons .
She added that nevertheless , each country has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , which is applies for Iran as well .
According to Zhang , sanctions against Iran could achieve the opposite of the intended effect in pushing the Islamic Republic into a corner from which it will be hard to go back .
She noted that sanctions could also lead to a conflict and therefore China supports a different approach based on dialogue and consultation .
She pointed to the situation in Iraq as an example of the usefulness of such steps and noted that many countries in the UN have realized that sanctions wo n't work .
Zhang does not believe the recent tensions with Washington will reflect on relations with Israel , which she described as good .
She said that the tensions relate to outside factors and noted that China has good relations with Iran .
Zhang further added that Beijing strives for positive relations with all countries .
The Chinese are trying to avoid using the word crisis in describing their relations with the US .
Zhang said that there have been ups and downs to the relationship throughout the years but stressed that despite occasional differences in opinion there is also cooperation between the countries .

US - Taiwan ties
China claims to sovereignty over Taiwan which runs an independent regime supported by the West and US since 1949 .
Zhang stressed that the Taiwan issue has always been the most important and the most sensitive , and could create obstacles .
She noted that the US and China have agreed to respect each other 's interests and that the matter of Taiwan is one of sovereignty and territorial integrity which the US should respect .
The US has recently decided to sell arms to Taiwan , which prompted Chinese protest .
Zhang said that the US 's decision amounts to a harsh violation of the common principles between the two countries and noted that the Chinese people could not accept such conduct .
The Chinese envoy further added that the deal has undermined the relations and may effect political cooperation .
She said that China has decided to halt the exchange of military programs with the US , postpone security strategy consultation and impose sanctions on the American companies involved in the arms sale to Taiwan .
In respect to the crisis with Google , the Chinese diplomat rejected criticism on web censorship .
She noted that the Chinese internet was open and that the country is rated first in the world in terms of internet use with its 384 million net surfers .
She further added that China has 3.69 million websites and over 180 million bloggs .
Zhang believes the matter is a commercial issue turned political .
She stated that China 's policy was to develop the internet and pointed to data which illustrate the speed of development .
Nevertheless , she stressed that any company , local or foreign must obey the Chinese law and said the issue was also one of respect for local culture in addition the legal aspect .
VANCOUVER —
The coaches and players of the Canadian men's hockey team thought they played their finest game yet at the Vancouver Olympics , but their best was n't good enough on Sunday .
The United States upstaged its North American rival with an important 5 - 3 victory in a hostile environment at Canada Hockey Place on the final day of the preliminary round .
The pro-Canadian capacity crowd of 18,561 witnessed a dandy game , but U.S. goalie Ryan Miller was the best performer on the ice .
The brilliant Buffalo Sabres netminder made 42 saves to keep his team a perfect 3 - for - 3 .
The United States received a bye into the quarter - finals on Wednesday , while Canada was relegated to qualification Tuesday .
The Canadians will meet Germany , and a win would advance them to a quarter - final match against Alexander Ovechkin and Russia on Wednesday .
Canada now has to win four Game 7's in six days to win the gold .
" It 's the situation we find ourselves in , " Canada captain Scott Niedermayer said .
" We 'll try and make the best of it . "
Canada finds itself in this difficult situation because of a poor start against the U.S .
" We were standing around and watching the puck too much , " said Canadian defenceman Duncan Keith , whose team outshot the U.S. 45 - 23 .
The defence also had difficulty in its own end and could n't handle the speed of the U.S. forwards .
" In our defensive zone we had a few lapses , " Canada 's Chris Pronger said .
Goaltending a concern
Finally , Canadian goalie Martin Brodeur did not distinguish himself .
" It 's obviously an area we would have liked to be better , " Canadian coach Mike Babcock said .
Before the tournament began , goaltending was a question mark for Canada because neither Brodeur nor Roberto Luongo had played his best in the days leading up to the Olympics .
Babcock would not commit to whether Brodeur or Luongo would play against Germany .
Canada 's head coach wanted to allow the emotion from the game to subside and review the game tape before he decides on his starter for Tuesday 's game .
The first goal surrendered by Brodeur deflected off Sidney Crosby 's stick and the second marker was a screen shot .
Other than the solid start and a timely goal from defenceman Brian Rafalski , his second goal of the game that arrived 23 seconds after Eric Staal tied the affair midway through the first period , the Canadians did n't give much credit to the U.S .
Besides Miller 's strong play , the U.S. collapsed around their goaltender time - and - time again to limit second chances .
They also blocked plenty of Canadian shots .
An added bonus was the strong play of the U.S. shutdown defence pair of Brooks Orpik and Jack Johnson .
They saw plenty of ice time against Crosby 's line , which was on the ice for the first three U.S. goals .
' We did a lot of really good things '
But U.S. coach Ron Wilson conceded that the Canadians had twice as many quality scoring chances .
Babcock agreed .
" I thought we did a lot of really good things , " he said .
" We had the puck a lot . "
Canada did have its moments , dominating for a long stretch in the second period .
But the U.S. still escaped with a 3 - 2 lead after 40 minutes .
After Canada 's Dany Heatley tied the game early in the second period , Chris Drury put the U.S. back in front by a goal when Brodeur was caught out of position after he chased a loose puck .
Rafalski was the offensive hero for the U.S. against his Detroit Red Wings coach .
He fired a shot that Jamie Langenbrunner redirected for a power - play goal to put the U.S. ahead 4 - 2 in the third period .
Crosby scored a power - play goal later in the final frame to bring Canada closer .
But after the Canadians turned up the heat for a couple of shifts , Vancouver Canucks centre Ryan Kesler scored an empty - netter in the final minute .
" We were standing around a little bit at the start and maybe a little jumpy , " Canada 's Jarome Iginla said .
" But after that , we started to settle in a bit and we started to look like a lot quicker team . "
Maybe the U.S. simply felt less pressure .
The players certainly had fun at their team dinner in a downtown restaurant on Saturday .
The coaching staff surprised the players with the " This is your time " speech from little Herbie .
Five - year - old Nashville - area kid Josh Sacco has become a YouTube sensation with his Herb Brooks imitation from the movie Miracle , and he was invited to entertain the U.S. team .
The players cracked up over his performance .

LOS ANGELES -- Ice Energy has a novel solution for the electricity challenges of the 21st century : Make Popsicles .
Put another way , the company wants to freeze water at night in refrigerator - like boxes adjacent to commercial air conditioners and then thaw it during the day , when power demand is highest .
This would theoretically allow AC - hungry commercial buildings in warm climates to cut energy use during heat waves , by shutting air conditioners down while still providing cool air to buildings from melting ice .
After seven years of development and testing , the Windsor , Colo . - based company signed an agreement recently with the Southern California Public Power Authority here to deploy some 6,000 Popsicle - making units at 1,500 locations in the utility 's service territory around Los Angeles .
Ice Energy says the units , called Ice Bears , will lead to a 30 percent fuel reduction for the utility through avoided use of so - called peaker generation plants , which are only turned on when demand is highest .
In Southern California and other warm places , the benefits are numerous , the company says , because of a heavy reliance on air conditioners during hotter months .
Avoiding peak power also means importing less coal - fired electricity from out of state when the California grid is taxed during heat waves .
" Electricity suffers from the central tenet that it has to be used when it is generated , " Ice Energy CEO Frank Ramirez said in an interview .
" What we 're really leveraging is what nature gives us every single day through its rotation : cooler temperatures at night . "
Ramirez likes to call their technology " energy storage , " but in truth the Ice Bear is just a way to use energy when it is cheaper and more plentiful .
Doing so could save utilities money , reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more blue - collar jobs for HVAC technicians and manufacturers .
The cost ?
The Southern California Public Power Authority paid about $ 100 million for the 6,000 units , a price that comes with a maintenance guarantee by Ice Energy , which plans to subcontract to HVAC experts , and smart - grid coordination with the distribution network .
That may seem pricey on its surface , but Ramirez insists the investment will save the utility as much as 20 percent in reduced fuel costs over a 20 - year period .
And , as he likes to point out , that is an investment not backed by the federal or state government , unlike many rival new technologies that tend to vie for subsidies .
" We are the first stand - alone energy efficiency technology that does n't require government assistance or subsidy to employ , " Ramirez said .
Not your average icemaker
This is how the Ice Bear works :
It fluctuates between charging and cooling , freezing 450 gallons of water at night ( a process that might be said to " store " electricity ) to then reverse course during the day .
The cool air is fed into buildings with the same duct system already in place .
Some have likened the technology to hybrid cars , which rely on batteries to shut down internal combustion engines until their juice runs out , when the engine restarts .
Also comparable are geothermal heat pumps that are used widely in Scandinavia and other cold nations to heat homes during colder months .
Like the Ice Bear , such systems act like freezers , in a sense , with the back of the pump ( which gives off heat ) built into the inside of a home , with water freezing taking place outside .
Converting water to ice is a means of removing heat from H20 , physicist Jan Olaf Gunderson explained .
The heat is then expelled through the back of the freezing unit , warming homes .
" In Norway almost all new homes are heated by heat pumps built into the wall , with the ' back of the freezer ' on the inside of the home and the ' freezer ' on the outside of the home , " said Gunderson , a Norwegian national .
" A home freezer is a typical heat pump , and the cheapest way to heat your home is to fill the freezer with water , then when the water is in the form of ice , throw out the block of ice outside of your house , then fill the freezer with water again . "
Ice Energy seems intent on capitalizing on the same sort of simple system in the inverse , and Ramirez readily admits his technology applies best to warm climates .
Energy is lost in the conversion process from ice back to water ( as much as 15 percent ) , but Ramirez said a temperature gradient of 15 degrees Fahrenheit or more from day to night makes the product energy neutral .
" In most of California , the average gradient [ the difference between day and night temperatures ] is 22 degrees , " Ramirez said .
" We have a natural advantage provided by cooler temperatures to reject heat , instead of running the AC that has to overcome heat during the day . "
As for water supply , the Ice Bear is filled once and never filled again .
And Ramirez insists the concept is storage by any other name , just not the kind of storage people tend to anticipate .
" It 's a battery filled with water , " Ramirez said , taking up the hybrid - car analogy .
" I think you can draw the conclusion that nothing will ever be cheaper as a storage medium . "
Visit to Capitol Hill
Ramirez said California is an ideal venue for bring his Ice Bears to market for another reason :
The state has on the books a renewable portfolio standard of 20 percent by 2010 and to 33 percent by 2020 .
Citing a report on wind power by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , Ramirez said what nobody wants to admit in California that an intermittent source like wind tends to be weakest during peak power periods .
When it is hottest , in other words , the wind tends not to blow as hard .
This would make wind an unreliable source during hot , windless days when some sort of storage medium might counteract that reality .
" The greatest output of wind occurs 180 degrees out of phase with the peak , " Ramirez said .
" It 's variable in nature and typically blows when you do n't need it . "
So to this executive , the answer is pairing ice storage with renewables as complementary technologies .
He also said the distributed nature of his machines means less loss of electricity through transmission and distribution , in addition to more reliance on baseload power , which is more efficient than peaking power .
" Air conditioning demand is the root cause of the peaking power problem , " Ramirez said , noting that 14 peaking units have been stymied recently in Southern California by environmental justice activists who do not want the plants built in low - income neighborhoods .
At least one prominent lawmaker , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , has become a believer .
Pelosi recently invited Ramirez to address the House Democratic caucus , where he gave Democrats much the same pitch he presented to this reporter .
Up next ?
Ramirez said he is talking to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- the largest public utility in the United States -- about signing a deal that could potentially dwarf the Southern California Public Power Authority arrangement .
On the table in those discussions is building a manufacturing facility in Southern California , which is a high priority for a state facing 12 percent unemployment .
Such a deal could follow in the footsteps of Tesla Motors Inc. , the electric carmaker based in Silicon Valley that recently agreed to locate a manufacturing plant in Southern California in exchange for tax breaks to boost production ( Greenwire , Oct. 29 , 2009 ) .
" We are going to be speaking to [ Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ] and the L.A. Department of Water and Power about what it might take to build a plant in Southern California , " said Ramirez , adding that if Ice Energy gets a big enough project commitment from the utility , a California - based plant is possible .

Details surrounding the 27 December incident , in which the 10 civilians were killed in northeast Afghanistan , are still unclear , but according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) , there is strong evidence pointing to insurgents having been in the area at the time .
“ I appeal again to all of the armed actors to make every effort to minimise harm to civilians and want to underline the importance of taking all precautionary measures to distinguish between civilians and combatants , ” Kai Eide , the Secretary - General ’s Special Representative , said in a statement .
“ Greater efforts must be made to reverse current trends so that civilians are spared the worst effects of armed conflict in the coming year . ”
Mr. Eide , who also heads UNAMA , said that the world body remains concerned about night - time raids since they are often deadly and local authorities are frustrated when operations are not coordinated with them .
For safety and cultural reasons , evening raids are distressful to families directly affected by them , as well as to communities throughout Afghanistan , he added .
“ UNAMA is equally concerned about the risks posed to civilians by insurgents living or operating in residential areas , ” the envoy said .
“ They account for the majority and an increasing proportion of civilian deaths . ”
SAN FRANCISCO  Google has turned to the National Security Agency for technical assistance to learn more about the computer network attackers who breached the company ’s cybersecurity defenses last year , a person with direct knowledge of the agreement said Thursday .
The collaboration between Google , the world ’s largest search engine company , and the federal agency in charge of global electronic surveillance raises both civil liberties issues and new questions about how much Google knew about the electronic thefts it experienced when it stated last month that it might end its business operations in China , where it said the attacks originated .
The agreement was first reported on Wednesday evening by The Washington Post .
By turning to the N.S.A. , which has no statutory authority to investigate domestic criminal acts , instead of the Department of Homeland Security , which does have such authority , Google is clearly seeking to avoid having its search engine , e-mail and other Web services regulated as part of the nation ’s “ critical infrastructure . ”
The United States government has become increasingly concerned about the computer risks confronting energy and water distribution systems and financial and communications networks .
Systems designated as critical infrastructure are increasingly being held to tighter regulatory standards .

Somewhere among the stuffed animals and fire logs , the bellows , copper kettles , hatchets and adzes , the powder horn , horse skull , snowshoes , sleds , razor strop , ox - yoke chandelier and crank - operated washing machine are Rob Schleifer ’s 21st - century necessities .
“ I ask people to find the refrigerator , ” said Mr. Schleifer , who finally points it out : an all - but - invisible half - size unit .
It ’s camouflaged forest brown , like his televisions , VCR , radio , telephone , computers , printers and just about everything else in the fifth - floor Manhattan walk - up his family has had since 1947 .
New York ’s cliff - dwellers have long found inventive ways of customizing their living spaces , and untold secrets lie behind the city ’s apartment doors .
But Mr. Schleifer , a 61 - year - old bachelor body builder and philologist who compiles dictionaries and writes esoteric articles about lexicography , has carried an obsession with the frontier past to new lengths .
For reasons he finds difficult to explain , he has spent much of the last 30 years turning his one - bedroom rental on Avenue A near 14th Street into his version of a cluttered colonial cabin in the woods where young Abe Lincoln might feel at home .
His walls are painted to look like planks .
His toaster , Crock - Pot , corkscrews , pencil sharpener , egg - slicer , and hot plate — there is no stove , but he cooks mostly vegetables anyway — have all been painstakingly rusticated with walnut and mahogany stain .

Colorado Republican State Senator Dave Schultheis had the dubious honor of being named “ Worst Person in the World ” on Thursday by MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann for his unfortunate use of Twitter .
“ Do n’t for a second , think Obama wants what is best for U.S. , ” Schultheis tweeted .
“ He is flying the U.S. plane right into the ground at full speed .
Let ’s roll . ”

“ ‘ Let ’s roll , ” Olbermann repeated .
“ The rallying cry from Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville , PA on 9/11 . ”
Schultheis has denied that the 911 reference was intentional , telling the Denver Post , “ It ’s a comment people use all the time any more .
‘ Let ’s get going .
Let ’s move on .
Let ’s make major changes , ’ I can see it now .
But you ’re busy doing jillions of things during the day .
You sometimes do n’t analyze every single word . ”
Schultheis also suggested that his own reputation for controversial statements may have given people the wrong idea .
Last winter , he aroused outrage when he was the only member of the Colorado state senate to vote against a bill requiring HIV testing for pregnant women , objecting that it would “ remove the negative consequences that take place from poor behavior and unacceptable behavior . ”
Nobody in Colorado , however , seems to be accepting Schultheis ’s excuses .
The Democratic president of the state senate called his remark “ appalling ” and even the minority leader agreed that “ Dave should n’t have gone there . ”
The Denver Post mocked Schultheis by responding with some tweets of its own .

“ DenverPost_EdBoard @Sen_Schultheis :
Do n’t think we buy your claim you did n’t mean to equate the president with terrorists .
No one is buying it . ”

To believe that the American people elected a president intent on destroying the U.S. is hateful and absurd .
Such debate is debasing . ”
“ DenverPost_EdBoard @Colorado_GOP : Demand that Sen. Schultheis apologize .
Insist that your party keep its criticisms meaningful .
The president is n’t a Manchurian destructor . ”

“ Do something to make us forget that you just mocked the dead of 9/11 ! ”

One of the final tests of the now - cancelled Orion Program has ended in failure , when a parachute drop test of an Orion boilerplate resulted in the near - destruction of the vehicle .
It marks what is likely to be a sad end for the vehicle that was set to take US astronauts to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , the moon and eventually Mars – only to be killed by President Obama ’s proposed future for NASA .
Orion – one of the good elements of Constellation :
Orion has suffered from a troubled childhood , mainly through no fault of its own .
Design changes , demanded by its awkward launch vehicle – Ares I – disrupted any fluidity in Orion ’s DACs ( Design Analysis Cycle ) , to the extent its contractor , Lockheed Martin , made the unusual move to fight back at NASA criticism about the quality of their Orion 606C design via official documentation .
“ ( The ) community must understand that there has not been two consecutive deliveries with the same baseline design , because ( of ) multiple configuration changes – prior to PDR ( Preliminary Design Review ) on a non-consistent design . ”
The continual changes to the baseline mainly concentrated on stripping Orion of it capability and mass , as efforts were made to aid Ares ’ lack of performance .
While Ares managers made numerous claims of mass reserves , those reserves were almost always based on what had been stripped from Orion .
Despite being reduced to a four crew vehicle that was only capable of water landings , the ISS Orion was making good progress towards a readiness date of around 2013 .
Again , the problem was Ares I , which was struggling to keep to yet another refined IOC ( Initial Operating Capability ) schedule of 2015 .
The Augustine Committee went further , citing fears of a more realistic date of 2017 / 18 for Ares I ’s ready - date .
The main stress on the schedule related to previous and projected lack of funding for the program , with all the long - lead items associated with Ares I – such as the Upper Stage engine .
Orion – by proxy – was held to ransom by Ares I ’s development timeline .
NASA managers did back up Orion via its findings on the Augustine Commission ’s “ Flexible Path ” option , placing large support behind a Heavy Lift Vehicle ( HLV ) and Orion as the two main vehicles they should move forward with – whist omitting any key references to Ares I or Ares V .
“ We accept Orion as the basis for American mission - crew access to LEO , and with block upgrades for orbital lifetime and increased entry energy , for return to Earth from deep - space missions , ” NASA managers wrote in the 65 page presentation ( available on L2 ) .
“ We concur that an exploration - class , heavy - lift launch capability is essential for eventual human Mars missions . ”
See also NASASpaceflight.com ’s Flexible Path Review :
Part 1 : Battle of the Heavy Lift Launchers – Monster 200mt vehicle noted
Part 2 : Manned mission to construct huge GEO and deep space telescopes proposed
Part 3 : NASA Flexible Path Evaluation of 2025 human mission to visit an asteriod
Part 4 : Taking Aim on Phobos – NASA outline Flexible Path precursor to Man on Mars
Yet Orion was surprisingly placed on the chopping block along with the entire Constellation Program , as the NASA FY2011 budget proposal refused to hand NASA the additional monies required to bring Ares I back onto a viable schedule , instead throwing six billion at a yet - to - be - determined commercial LEO ( Low Earth Orbit ) replacement , despite serious reservations over crew safety from the advisory body ASAP – as much as they exposed flaws in their own findings .
The battle between spending billions on what would be a new crew transport versus Orion – which has matured over its years of design – may become one of the key battlegrounds when the FY2011 budget is discussed in Congress later this month .
For the interim , the Constellation team are still working on the vehicles .
Orion ’s Near Term Work :
Orion will continue to at least the DAC - 4 phase , which in turn will support the Constellation Program PDR ( Preliminary Design Review ) .
The PDR is currently expected to be the final role of the Program before it is shut down .
“ Some insights into the Orion work still progressing .
Orion Projects recognizes the value in completing these tasks at least in some manner , ” noted one of the Orion Project managers in an address tagged as “ continuing steps ” ( L2 ) to his team .
“ As we move forward it ’s important to make sure we are still focused on the critical work .
As a management team we are continuing to develop detailed plans , but I want to be clear that there are some general areas that we should work hard to complete .
I strongly believe that these areas contribute to our expertise and ability to launch humans into space . ”
The list of work to be completed included the launch of PA1 ( Launch Abort test ) , the design , construction and eventual testing of a full Orion test article as the DAC - 4 design and the PDRs .
“ This is not a complete list .
You should continue on your original plans unless you have coordinated with your supervisor and Orion management .
I do recognize that some of our original work ( even some of the detail of the items I mentioned above ) does not make sense in the current plan and we are ready to remove those requirements once we coordinate .
Thanks again for your dedication . ”
Orion Drop Test Failure :
Unfortunately , the Orion Project suffered a failure on one of its tests this week , when a boilerplate Orion crashed to Earth after its “ parachutes failed to deploy ” .
However , the problem is not believed to be Orion or the parachute system ’s fault , with the failure memo citing a problem with the rigging associated with the extraction system – although this is yet to be confirmed , as an investigation will be required .
“ A quick heads up that the Orion test drop failed .
Looks like the extraction system failed to release so the Orion chute system never deployed , ” noted the memo acquired on Tuesday ( the day of the failure ) by L2 .
“ Still saving the remains but expecting minimal hardware recovery . ”
The extraction method utilizes a sledge or pallet to deploy the test vehicle out of the back of the C - 17 .
The majority of these tests – which have included testing the giant parachutes for Ares I first stage recovery – have been successful , although a previous Orion PTV ( Parachute Test Vehicle ) suffered a failure back in 2008 ( see image left ) .
The only other failure was suffered in 2007 , when a Drop Test Vehicle ( DTV ) with an Ares I pilot parachute suffered a fault with the riser connecting the parachute to the DTV .
The vehicle – dropped from a C - 130 at 17000 feet – was destroyed , with parts of the DTV needing to be extracted from depths of up to 30 feet below the surface .
Orion Is n’t To Blame :
With a large part of the NASA and contractor workforce demoralized by the change of direction noted by President Obama ’s proposed plan for the space program , managers have been quick to address their respective teams .
The general theme of the majority of the addresses point toward the upcoming battle in Congress , while others point to finishing their work in style , in order to benefit future programs – as was seen via an address to the Orion team .
“ I feel compelled to offer some thoughts .
Please feel free to share them – with your colleagues as you think appropriate and useful , ” noted Dr. Michael G. Ryschkewitsch – Chief Engineer , Office of the Chief Engineer , NASA HQ – in an address acquired by L2 .
“ I have gotten a number of emails and queries about how we arrived where we are today .
The ones that bother me most are the ones that amount to “ we must have been stupid to have such a bad plan ” and / or “ we executed so badly that … ”
Neither one of these sentiments could be further from the truth .
Here is my take .
“ The Augustine panel was very clear in their report and in their public briefings that we had a solid plan ; we knew what it would cost and that we were executing well .
They were also clear that the plan we had was underfunded and could not simultaneously develop the ISS IOC capability and sufficient advance work toward the Moon .
They also correctly pointed out that we no longer had sufficient technology investments to give the program long - term legs .
“ So how did we get here ?
The plan we had was to do those things , appropriately phased , in parallel .
When it became clear that the budget could no longer support it all , a decision was made to cut the technological investments with the goal of restoring them later if and when the budget picture improved .
That of course never happened .
“ Due to a wide variety of continuing resolutions , non-appearance of anticipated increases ( perhaps “ hoped ” is a better word ) , etc , we had to repeatedly cut back on the long term activities in favor of the near term .
In a word , our stakeholders made the determination that the plan we had was not affordable .
“ This is no different than when we make changes in our personal lives to match what we want to do and how we do it with what we can afford .
This is in no way a reflection on the quality of the work or the quality of the people .
In asking the teams to continue to work on the progress Orion has already made , Mr Ryschkewitsch cited the cancellation of Space Station Freedom , and how the work on that project then benefited the design and construction of the ISS .
“ As much as I feel the loss personally , I know it is nothing compared to that of all the people who have been giving their blood , sweat and every ounce of their creative ability to this effort every day for so long .
That said , we can not just stop .
“ There are a great many activities that must be completed and documented so that we can get the benefits of our previous investments .
Some of you had experience on the various iterations of the space station and know that the current ISS draws heavily on earlier work completed for the cancelled versions , particularly Freedom .
“ Had we simply stopped , rather than finishing the work , documenting and archiving it , we would have lost a great deal . ”
While Mr Ryschkewitsch appeared to back the proposed changes to NASA ’s future – to the extent he believes their will be a large amount of exciting work in the future – the address ends with a note of pride for being associated with the Constellation Program .
“ As we finish this phase of our work , I am proud to be associated with the Constellation team and particularly with the Engineering workforce and leadership .
I cannot take credit but I hope you will allow me to use the word “ we . ”
We worked hard , we worked smart , and I believe that there is no organization or group of people that could have done better .
“ This has been an immensely difficult undertaking and we have executed it well , learning and improving every day .
Our challenge now is to channel our grief into resolution to close out the current work with the same dedication we have had , and then to turn ourselves to very bright future opportunities .
I have seen what we can do and I have been extremely impressed .
I know we are up to the challenges ahead and I am excited by the opportunities .
“ Thank you all for all you have done .
I look forward to being able to share this future with you as we move upward and outward . ”
The next Constellation article will be based on documentation and memos on Ares ’ final work , based on the proposed plan .

Homemade Baileys Irish Cream Recipe – You ’ll Never Buy it Again
Disclosure : I may earn a commission from purchases you make through affiliate links in this post at no additional cost to you .
This homemade Baileys Irish Cream recipe is cheap , so easy , and so tasty to make right in your own kitchen that you ’ll never want to buy it again !
Serving this led to a ton of questions and comments from my friends when I first served it at a party :
What ’s in Baileys Irish Cream ?
Where can I get the recipe for Baileys ?
OMG !
This homemade Baileys is sooo good !
Will you be posting the recipe ?
Below , you ’ll find some answers to questions about the cheapest and easiest way to never buy Baileys Irish Cream again .
What is Baileys Irish Cream ?
Baileys Irish Cream is a cream liqueur made from cocoa , cream , and Irish whiskey along with a secret blend of flavorings .
My copycat version uses coffee in addition to the cocoa flavoring found in the original .
People use Baileys to make mudslides or to give their coffee a kick , and in scores of other cocktails .
Which Whiskey and How Much Should I Use ?
Well , the original Baileys Irish Cream recipe is made with … wait for it …
Irish whiskey .
So if you want to make something that is as close as possible to that familiar flavor , you should start there .
But , I ’m not convinced that the brand of Irish whiskey you buy has much of an effect on the overall flavor of the drink .
People pay more for fancier whiskeys because they have a lot of delicate , subtle flavors .
But after you ’ve dumped in as much sugar , chocolate , and cream as this recipe requires , you are n’t going to taste those expensive flavors anyway .
As for how much , you should use your nose and your tongue .
I have heard from some of my loyal readers that the 1 2/3 cup of whiskey ( 400 ml ) called for in my recipe is too much .
If that ’s you , then just use less of it .
There is no shame in liking the lighter version of something .
I have noticed that after a bottle of homemade Baileys mellows in my refrigerator for a week or so , some of the more pungent liquor -y flavors go away .
If you feel like your mixture is too strong , let it sit for a while and see if it ’s better .
Do I Need to Use Real Cream ?
What If I ’m Lactose Intolerant or a Vegan ?
A classic Irish cream is made with real cream , but who needs to be classic ?
If your body ca n’t process the lactose in real cream , or if you are a vegan or for whatever other reason need your drinks to be dairy - free , then make it with something else .
I have heard from many people who use coconut milk , almond milk , or even non-dairy creamer to give their homemade Baileys a nice , creamy texture .
Can I Add Other Flavors ?
The ingredients in my recipe are meant to recreate the taste of the original liqueur .
But , recipes are made to be broken .
First of all , a lot of my readers wrote in to tell me that they used liquors other than Irish whiskey and liked it even more .
Some used a light , blended scotch like Chivas or Cutty Sark and said that it wound up tasting the same as when they used Jameson’s .
But , many used a sweeter liquor like brandy and liked the mellow edge it gave the final product .
Like everything else in your kitchen , you should use ingredients that taste best to you .
While you ’re thinking about different liquors , why not go for a totally different flavor profile altogether ?
With all the flavors of chocolate , caramel , and cream already present , adding some mint ( either peppermint extract or steeped mint leaves ) will give the drink a powerful wake - up call .
If you want less sharpness and more umami , try a pinch of malted milk .
And if you are a fan of cajeta or horchata , throw in a bit of cinnamon for a warm , spicy addition .
How Long Does Homemade Baileys Last ?
Well , this stuff is so yummy that in my house it does n’t last long at all ( rimshot ) .
But seriously , I would recommend keeping your bottle in the refrigerator and using it within a couple of months .
I think that freezing it is unnecessary and might lead to the ingredients separating from each other and clogging the bottle .
How to Make Baileys Irish Cream–Live !
What You ’ll Need to Make This Recipe
This recipe ’s easy enough to make that you should have time to whip up a batch to take to your New Year ’s Eve parties !
I found the recipe on a discussion forum on Chowhound .
The entire discussion is worth a read .
It contains lots of information about the drink .
I am reprinting it below with my changes , notes , and product suggestions .
Sure , any blender will do for homemade Baileys Irish Cream .
But if you are buying a new one and can swing the cost , a Vitamix blender is magical .
It can blend anything without even having to catch its breath .

You ’ll need chocolate syrup for this recipe .
Hershey ’s is the easiest to find , but the number one ingredient in it is high fructose corn syrup ( the second is corn syrup ) .
I recommend an organic chocolate syrup as a better alternative .

The homemade Baileys Irish Cream recipe calls for instant coffee .
To kick up the coffee flavor , choose an instant espresso .

The federal Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it would take steps to more stringently regulate three of the most potent forms of medical radiation , including increasingly popular CT scans , some of which deliver the radiation equivalent of 400 chest X - rays .
With the announcement , the F.D.A. puts its regulatory muscle behind a growing movement to make life - saving medical radiation  both diagnostic and therapeutic  safer .
Last week , the leading radiation oncology association called for enhanced safety measures .
And a Congressional committee was set to hear testimony Wednesday on the weak oversight of medical radiation , but the hearing was canceled because of bad weather .
The F.D.A. has for weeks been investigating why more than 300 patients in four hospitals were overradiated by powerful CT scans used to detect strokes .
The overdoses were first discovered last year at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , where patients received up to eight times as much radiation as intended .
I have placed several sources of information / contacts that may be utilized to review the FTC guidelines on truth in advertising and a method to complain about SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club at the end of this document .
The following is a summary of my observations of the dishonest and fraudulent business practices of the SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club :
Complaint One : SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club do not have general public contact telephone numbers or email addresses with which to contact them directly .
SMC Corporation 's physical address is a P.O. Box .
Complaint Two : SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club provides no method of internet website tracking ( The number of people that have visited your website , etc. ) .
You have absolutely no idea
How many people have visited your website today , in the past week , month or year .
Complaint Three :
Do not pay money to the SMC Corporation or eMerchant Club that you do not honestly owe , or it WILL be gone without a trace .
Their process is designed to KEEP YOUR MONEY .
Complaint Four : SMC will not allow the use of Pay Pal Pro. Pay Pal Pro is for all intents and purposes a gateway ( With very reasonable charges ) .
eMerchant Club charges $ 395.00 to set up your gateway .
You may set up your own gateway absolutely FREE ( By simply contacting a Gateway company on the internet or by phone ) .
Complaint Five : eMerchant Club charges hundreds of dollars for search engine optimization .
This simply requires submitting your website to the various search engines .
You may submit your website address to all of the search engines absolutely FREE .
This will of course be a total waste of time because the SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club website ( Provided to you by them ) is a replicated website .
Search engines despise replicated sites .
Complaint Six : A typical gateway will cost around $ 40.00 to $ 50.00 per month ( If you sell absolutely nothing , this will be there minimum charge ) .
The price quickly goes up if actual products are sold .
Complaint Seven :
If you decide to sell SMC items at swap meets or flee markets , you will find 3 or 4 ( or more ) other people selling the exact same merchandise from SMC ( at a greatly reduced price ) .
Complaint Eight :
It will be very difficult ( or impossible ) to sell SMC merchandise to businesses at wholesale .
Think about it , SMC has flooded the market with their products through their ongoing " mass marketing " campaign of infomercials , emails and ads of every form .
If a business wishes to sell SMC products to their customers ( For some reason ) , would they not have the ability to go directly to SMC themselves and pay member cost ?
Complaint Nine : Most , if not all of the SMC products are made in China ; I especially love the Harley Davidson coffee mug with " Made in China " stamped on the bottom ( that would get you killed at any Harley Davidson Rally ! ) .
Complaint Ten :
When conducting business with the SMC Corporation or eMerchant Club , and you are conveying something of importance , ensure that you have a witness listening on another line ( Wife , Friend , Mother , etc ) , and after the initial call , verify the information by a follow - up phone call .
Complaint Eleven : SMC tapes all telephone conversations and you will find that tapes that support their position are found with ease , however , tapes that support your position " do not exist " .
Complaint Twelve : Ensure that the battery for your telephone is completely charged prior to a call to SMC support .
You will find that a 45 - minute to a one - hour telephone wait will be common during the Christmas season ( This is of course the time that you will require the most support and you will listen to SMC promotions the entire time you are waiting ... NOT music ) .
Complaint Thirteen :
The shipping costs from SMC are very high and each order will be charged a $ 3.00 service fee ( Hugh cut in any potential profit ) .
Complaint Fourteen :
You will not have a person to complain to at the SMC Corporation or eMerchant Club if you have a complaint ( about anything ) .
You will be relegated to an interface provided by these companies for ALL communications with these companies .
Complaint Fifteen : The SMC Corporation will assign each person a " Business Coach " .
This person 's primary function is to " sell " you as much SMC materials as possible ( Catalogs , gift cards , SMC products or the new " flavor of the week " ) .
This " coaching " is purely based on the amount of money that you are prepared to spend with SMC .
You will find and be subject to " every dirty trick in the book " when dealing with an SMC " Business Coach " .
Complaint Sixteen :
You will find that whenever an SMC Representative has lied to you , it will always be your fault , because you misunderstood or you miss - communicated the situation .
Complaint Seventeen : The SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club do not have " opt-in " , they only have " opt- out " ( if you find out in time ) .
You will " automatically " be " opted - in " to pay for upgrades to your website and other hidden charges .
Complaint Eighteen :
If the SMC Corporation or eMerchant Club takes money from you for any reason that you do not understand , IMMEDIATELY contact your Bank or Charge Card Provider to contest the charges .
Attempting to retrieve your money by " going through the system " at SMC or eMerchant Club is a total waste of time !
Their entire system is based on KEEPING YOUR MONEY .
Let your Bank handle it and this wills FORCE the SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club to be more ethical and responsible in the future .
Complaint Nineteen :
If you decide to try SMC as a business , please do yourself and everyone else concerned a favor and report both of these companies to the FTC , States Attorney General and the BBB afterwards .
Something may be done about this if enough complaints are registered with these organizations .
Complaint Twenty :
The eMerchant Club website that you will be given by SMC is a replicated site .
Search engines despise replicated websites and pay little or no attention to them .
The websites are all identical and are set up so that updating may easily be performed by eMerchant Club .
This places you at a Hugh disadvantage from the start .
Complaint Twenty - One : You MUST be VERY proficient with computer hardware and software as well as the Internet in order to succeed at the " internet marketing " portion .
Complaint Twenty - Two :
You will have to pay for an SMTP server provider to send your email advertising out through , or hire an email distribution company to send them out for you .
The SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club will not allow members to use their SMTP severs to send out advertising .
Complaint Twenty - Three : The SMC Corporation 's portrayal of " it 's so simple " is of course a total lie ( Extreme fraud ) .
SMC should be honest and tell the general public that YOU MAY make SOME money at hosting house parties or selling to friends ( Until your friendships end ) .
Complaint Twenty - Four :
The high tech approach is out of the question unless you wish to hire professional companies to perform this work for every aspect of your " At Home " business ( Unless you can do this yourself ) .
This would end up costing in the ten's of thousands of dollars range .
The companies that perform many of these services may also be on the fraud alert list themselves , check all companies out completely before using them !
Complaint Twenty - Five : The SMC / eMerchant Club website that you will be given will have the look of a website from the early 1990's .
Complaint Twenty - Six : The Site Manager ( The utility that you will modify your website with ) is a text - based interface that is Reminiscent of the late 1980's .
Complaint Twenty - Seven :
The eMerchant Club Rep will have no idea what you are talking about if your question involves something more complicated than " How do I log on ?
Where do I find my orders ?
Etc.
You will be on your own .
Complaint Twenty - Eight : BEWARE of drop - shipping companies that offer " free " websites in general , they are setup to make money for THEMSELVES , not you ( This rule does not only apply to SMC / eMerchant Club ) .
Complaint Twenty - Nine : SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club had a little over 41,000 websites under their control some 6 to 8 months ago ( On DNS.
GIFTWORLDNET.COM in May or June of 2008 ) .
Complaint
Thirty :
The total number of domains ( websites ) on the eMerchant Club server DNS .
GIFTWORLDNET .COM has dropped to 28,389 as of January 10th 2009 .
UPDATE : On 01-29-2009 DNS.GIFTWORLDNET.COM
( eMerchant Clubs DNS server for the SMC Corporation ) has 28,215 Domains ( websites ) .
Complaint Thirty - One : SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club has roughly 13,000 less websites now on DNS .
GIFTWORLDNET .COM server than 6 to 8 months ago .
Complaint
Thirty - Two :
This will give you an idea of the tremendous ATTRITION RATE for the SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club member websites .
This may also explain the reason that the SMC Infomercials have suddenly reappeared ( January of 2009 ) .
Complaint Thirty - Three : Read the SMC Corporation / eMerchant Club TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY from the bottom to the top of the document ( they place the important points at the bottom assuming that you will have burned out by then ) .
Complaint Thirty - Four : SMC Corporation actually ended up on it's own fraud alert list ( They took themselves off immediately after an SMC employee discovered this ) !
In conclusion , I have listed several resources that you may wish to utilize if you feel that the SMC Corporation or eMerchant Club has misrepresented any or all of the information that they provided to you in order to entice you to buy their product ( s ) or service (s ) .

I would have placed the public telephone contact numbers and the email contact addresses for SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club here , however , public telephone numbers and email addresses do not exist for these companies .
Even " Members " of these companies may only communicate with SMC Corporation and eMerchant Club through their company provided interfaces .
Public forms of communication with these companies are not provided .
If you are filing a complaint on the Internet ( About a company ) , be sure to compose the complaint in a word processing program like Microsoft Word .
SAVE your document and you will have it to copy / paste in as many complaint sites as you require .
After posting a complaint , be sure to check back to determine that it was in fact " posted " .
If not , you have most likely ran across a " trap site " ( I have identified one trap site for SMC so far ) .
This is a site set - up by a company to " filter - out " as many complaints about their company as possible .
Please do not go through all of the hard work and effort to compose a complaint about a company , only to lose it through " trickery " .
Retaining your document for additional complaint sites ( If needed ) will save you a lot of time and effort ( And frustration ) .
You may recognize a trap site by the fact that they must REVIEW your complaint prior to posting it ( They will tell you this AFTER you have submitted your complaint ) .
Additionally , a legitimate Complaint website will require that you provide your personal information to allow a company to contest your remarks if slander or defamation are involved .
Think about it , legitimate complaint websites are not responsible for anything that YOU may place on their website ( Read their Terms of Service ) .
Why then , would there be a reason to REVIEW your complaint ?
If you are reading this on a specific website , you may rest assured that this complaint website is legitimate .
God bless the " REAL " complaint websites .
They perform a VERY useful function for us all !

Rage Against
The Machine have sensationally outsold X Factor winner Joe McElderry to take the Christmas number one !
Thanks to a Facebook led campaign , the Los Angeles band 's 1992 anthem ' Killing In The Name ' has secured the Yuletide top spot after shifting 502,000 downloads , according to the Official Charts Company .
McElderry has had to settle for second place with ' The Climb ' selling 450,000 copies .
This marks the first time in five years an X Factor winner has n't claimed the Christmas number one .
Better still , not only is Rage Against The Machine 's ' Killing In The Name ' number one , it has also achieved two new chart records .
Firstly it has notched up the biggest one - week download sales total in British chart history and it has also become the first ever download only Christmas number one in the UK .
Official charts company director Official Charts Company managing director Martin Talbot said : " Congratulations to Rage Against The Machine on their number one - as we have seen in recent years , overhauling any X Factor winner in the race for the Christmas number one is no mean achievement .
“ The popular support we have seen for the record this week has been truly amazing - and handed them two all - time records . ” ' Killing In The Name ' sold over 200,000 copies on Friday and Saturday alone , while McElderry 's physical sales are thought to have trailed off thanks to the bad weather .
Martin Talbot added : " Congratulations should also go to Joe McElderry .
In taking the number two spot , he has still achieved one of the highest weekly sales of any single this year - in almost any other year , 450,000 copies would have given him the Christmas number one .
" Through this week , these two tracks have accounted for more than 950,000 single sales , a fact which is truly remarkable .
"
The number ones of the decade are as follows : 2000 : Bob The Builder - ' Can We Fix It ? ' 2001 : Robbie Williams & Nicole Kidman - ' Somethin ’ Stupid '2002 : Girls Aloud - ' Sound Of The Underground '2003 : Michael Andrews feat Gary Jules - ' Mad World '2004 : Band Aid 20 - ' Do They Know It ’s Christmas ?
'2005 : Shayne Ward - ' That ’s My Goal ' 2006 : Leona Lewis - ' A Moment Like This '2007 : Leon Jackson - ' When You Believe '2008 : Alexandra Burke – ' Hallelujah '2009 : Rage Against The Machine – ' Killing In The Name '

' If you have a better idea , show it to me . "
That was President Barack Obama 's challenge two weeks ago to House Republicans regarding health - care reform .
He has since called for a bipartisan forum , not to start over on health reform but to " move forward " on the " best ideas that are out there . "
The best ideas out there are not those that were passed by the House and Senate last year , which consist of more spending , more regulations and more bureaucracy .
If the president is serious about building a system that delivers more ...
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has burnished his Christian credentials , courted Jewish support and preached outreach toward Muslims .
Today , his administration will host a group that fits none of the above : America ’s nonbelievers .
The president is n’t expected to make an appearance at the meeting with the Secular Coalition for America or to unveil any new policy as a result of it .
Instead , several administration officials will sit down quietly for a morning meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus with about 60 workhorses from the coalition ’s 10 member groups , including the American Atheists and the Council for Secular Humanism .
Tina Tchen , the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement , and representatives from the Justice and Health and Human Services departments will join in .
Coalition leaders are billing their visit as an important meeting between the administration and the “ nontheist ” community .
On the agenda are three policy areas : child medical neglect , military proselytizing and faith - based initiatives .
Meeting downplayed
“ We ’re raising important issues that affect real people ’s lives , ” said Sean Faircloth , 49 , a former Maine state legislator who is the coalition ’s executive director .
White House spokesman Shin Inouye downplayed the meeting , saying only that Tchen ’s office “ regularly meets with a wide range of organizations and individuals on a diverse set of issues . ”
The coalition ’s board includes such controversy magnets as authors Salman Rushdie ( “ The Satanic Verses ” ) and Christopher Hitchens ( “ God Is Not Great ” ) , as well as Michael Newdow , the Sacramento , Calif. , doctor who argued against allowing the words “ under God ” in the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court , but did n’t prevail .
South Carolina activist Herb Silverman founded the coalition in 2002 .
Washington presence
The coalition has had a Washington office and a lobbyist since 2005 .
“ Despite what we hear from Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin , we ’re in a stage in history where millions upon millions of Americans share a secular perspective on American public policy , ” Faircloth said .
“ We think the real ‘ silent majority , ’ if you will , is the Americans who say , ‘ Enough of this religious and even theocratic nature to American policy . ’ “
The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found in a 2008 survey that a majority of Americans , 52 percent to 45 percent , think that churches should stay out of politics .
That sentiment had changed from three election cycles back , 1996 , when 54 percent favored churches expressing political views .
Nearly 75 percent of Americans told Pew in December that they attend religious services each year .

List
That scary Control .
Comonad import from category - extras is going to be the subject of today 's post .
We 're going to look at one possible implementation of comonads for non-empty lists that model causal time - invariant systems , systems whose outputs depend only on inputs that are in the past .
We will see that computation in these systems follows a comonadic structure and that one instance of this structure strongly enforces causality and weakly enforces time - invariance .
Our causal lists are simply a newtype of list with the added restriction that they are non-empty ; causal is a " smart constructor " that enforces this restriction .
We use GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving to get the Functor instance for free .
> newtype Causal a = Causal [ a ] > deriving ( Functor , Show ) > > causal :: a -> [ a ] ->
Causal a > causal x xs = Causal ( x:xs ) > > unCausal :: Causal a -> [ a ] > unCausal ( Causal xs ) = xs > > type Voltage = Float
Background .
( If you 're already familiar with signal processing , feel free to skip this section . )
One such system models point - to - point communication of voltage samples across an imperfect wire channel .
In an ideal world , we would very much like to be able to pretend that any voltage I put into this channel would instantly perfectly transmit this voltage to the other end of the channel .
In practice , we 'll see any number of imperfections , including time to rise and fall , a delay , ringing and noise .
Noise is a party pooper , so we 're going to ignore it for the purposes of this post .
To a first approximation , we can impose the following important conditions on our system :
Causality .
Our wire can't peek into the future and transmit some voltage before it has even gotten it .
Time - invariance .
Any signal will get the same response whether or not it gets sent now or later .
Linearity .
A simple and useful approximation for wires , which states this mathematical property : if an input x1 results in an output y1 , and an input x2 results in an output y2 , then the input Ax1 + Bx2 results in the output Ay1 + By2 .
This also means we get superposition , which is an important technique that we 'll use soon .
When you see a linear time - invariant system , it means that we get to use a favorite mathematical tool , the convolution .
Discrete convolutions .
The overall structure of the discretized computation that a channel performs is [ Voltage ] -> [ Voltage ] ; that is , we put in a sequence of input voltage samples , and get out another sequence of output voltage samples .
On the other hand , the discrete convolution is the function calculated by ( with variables suggestively named ) :
( u ∗ f ) [ n ] = sum from m = -∞ to ∞ of f[m ] u [ n - m ]
It 's not quite obvious why the convolution is the mathematical abstraction we 're looking for here , so we 'll sketch a brief derivation .
One special case of our computation is when the input corresponds to [ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ... ] , called the unit sample .
In fact , due to linearity and time - invariance , the output that our system gives when posed with the unit sample , the unit sample response , precisely specifies the behavior of a system for all inputs : any possible input sequence could be composed of any number of delayed and scaled unit samples , and linearity says we can sum all of the results together to get a result .
A list is actually a function ℕ → a , and we can extend the domain to be over integers if we propose the convention f[ n ] = 0 for n < 0 .
Suppose that f[n ] represents our input samples varying over time , δ [ n ] represents a unit sample ( δ [ 0 ] = 1 , δ [ n ] = 0 for all other n ; you 'll commonly see δ [ n - t ] , which is a unit sample at time t ) , and u[ n ] represents our unit sample response .
Then , we decompose f[n ] into a series of unit samples :
f[n ] = f [ 0 ] δ[ n ] + f [ 1 ] δ[ n - 1 ] + ...
and the use linearity to retrieve our response g[n ] :
g [n ] = f [ 0 ] u[ n ] + f [ 1 ] u [ n - 1 ] + ... = sum from m = 0 to ∞ of f[m ] u [ n - m ]
which looks just like the discrete convolution , just without the -∞ bound .
Remember that we defined f[m ] = 0 for m < 0 , so the two are actually equivalent .
I 'd like to linger on that final mathematical definition for a moment , before writing out the equivalent Haskell .
We originally stated that the input - response computation had the type [ Voltage ] -> [ Voltage ] ; however , in our math , we 've actually defined a relation [ Voltage ] ->
Voltage , a channel specific function that takes all of the inputs up to time n , i.e. f [ 0 ] .. f[ n ] , and returns a single output g[n ] .
I 've written the following definition in a suggestive curried form to reflect this :
> ltiChannel :: [ Voltage ] -> Causal Voltage -> Voltage > ltiChannel u = \( Causal f ) -> sum $ zipWith ( *) ( reverse f ) u
The unit sample response may be a finite or infinite list , for reasons of efficiency a finite list is recommended :
> usr :: [ Voltage ] > usr = [ 1,2,5,2,1 ]
Comonads .
By now , it should be clear where we 've been working towards : we have ltiChannel usr :: Causal Voltage ->
Voltage and we want : Causal Voltage -> Causal Voltage .
This is precisely the form of computation that the comonad induces !
For your convenience , here is the definition of the Copointed and Comonad type classes :
class Functor f =>
Copointed f where extract :: f a -> a class Copointed w =>
Comonad w where duplicate :: w a -> w ( w a ) extend :: ( w a -> b ) -> w a -> w b
The Copointed instance is straight - forward , but demonstrates why the Causal must contain a non-empty list :
> instance Copointed Causal where > extract ( Causal xs ) = head xs
The Comonad instance can be defined using either duplicate or extend ; both have default implementations defined in terms of each other .
Deriving these default implementations is left as an exercise to the reader ; we 'll define both here :
> instance Comonad Causal where > extend f = Causal . map ( f . Causal ) .
tail .
inits .
unCausal > duplicate = Causal . map Causal . tail .
inits .
unCausal
The intent of the code is somewhat obscured by the unwrapping and wrapping of Causal ; for a pure list the instance would look like this :
instance Comonad [ ] where extend f = map f . tail .
inits duplicate = tail .
inits
The function duplicate really gets to the heart of what this comonad instance does : we take our input list and transform it into a list of histories , each one one step further than the last .
The tail tags along to drop the first value of inits which is an empty list .
duplicate builds up w ( w a ) , and then the user - supplied function tears it back down to w b ( if you think of monads , the lifted user function builds up m ( m b ) , and then join tears it back down to m b . )
One quick test to make sure it works :
> unitStep :: Causal Voltage > unitStep = Causal ( repeat 1 ) > > result :: Causal Voltage > result = unitStep =>> ltiChannel usr
and sure enough , the result is :
Causal [ 1.0 , 3.0 , 8.0 , 10.0 , 11.0 , 11.0 , ...]
= >> is a flipped extend , and the comonadic equivalent of the monadic >>= .
Enforced invariants .
Structuring our computation in this form ( as opposed to writing the darn convolution out explicitly ) gives us some interesting enforced invariants in our code .
Our channels need not be linear ; I could have squared all of the inputs before convolving them with the unit sample response , and that certainly would not be linear .
However , any channel we write must be causal and and will usually be time - invariant : it must be causal because we never pass any values from the future to the user function , and it is weakly time invariant because we do n't explicitly let the user know how far along the are the input stream they are .
In practice with our implementation , they could divine this information using length ; we could get stronger guarantees employing a combinator that reverses the list and then appends repeat 0 :
> tiChannel :: ( [ Voltage ] -> Voltage ) -> Causal Voltage -> Voltage > tiChannel f ( Causal xs ) = f ( reverse xs ++ repeat 0 ) > > ltiChannel ' :: [ Voltage ] -> Causal Voltage -> Voltage > ltiChannel ' u = tiChannel ( \xs -> sum $ zipWith ( *) u xs )
u in this case must be finite , and if it is infinite can be truncated at some point to specify how precise our computation should be .
Tonight marks the 10th anniversary of Y2 K , so I ’m using it as an excuse to look back at lessons learned and not learned from that experience .
The greatest lessons had to do with psychology , not technology .
Y2 K was no surprise to me .
I wrote a chapter on it in my book Accidental Empires back in 1991 — fully nine years before the actual deadline .
To my knowledge that was the first in - depth explanation of Y2 K in the mass media .
I explained how the problem came to be , how it could be solved , and predicted that doing so would cost a lot of money and force a transition on the way corporations and governments used technology .
In early 1999 someone at PBS came up with the bright idea that I do a TV special about Y2 K to run that October , setting audience expectations about what was to come .
Going into that project I remember the producers expected it to be about all the stuff that was likely to go wrong .
After all , I had written eight years before that we were in peril .
But when I jumped into the research in 1999 I found that Y2 K remediation , as it was called , seemed to be going well .
I also found that systems were n’t as inter-connected or dependent as many of us had thought — that the world simply was n’t as much at risk as we feared .
I had to fight for this position , but ultimately that was the more conservative story we told two months before the actual event .
And we were right .
PBS , to its credit , was the only U. S. television network with the guts to do such a show in primetime or anytime .
We took a position — a controversial one it turned out — and justified it with research .
Other networks preferred to play the doom card over and over again .
Y2 K remediation cost $ 50 - 100 billion for the U. S. alone .
Probably half of that money would have been spent on IT improvements anyway , but an extra 25 - 50 billion 1999 dollars is still a lot of dough .
Much of it was spent on Y2 K - related issues but a lot of it was spent on this - and - that .
Y2 K was such an arcane problem and so far above the heads of typical CEOs that it was viewed by IT departments as a chance to buy all the cool stuff they never could before .
A lot of cool stuff was bought on top of all the other cool stuff being bought because this was also the time of the dot - com Internet Bubble .
I have wondered how much of the economic downturn in 2000 and 2001 – the collapse of the Internet Bubble — was actually due to the passage of Y2 K with its excessive IT purchasing and labor costs .
While making that TV special I spent weeks interviewing experts and self - proclaimed experts including survivalists .
What I learned then was a story that I do n’t think ever really came out .
It consists of three parts :
1 ) Desire : the people warning the loudest about Y2 K , those hoarding lentils and suggesting the end of the world was coming , really wanted to be right .
They not only thought Y2 K was going to be a disaster , they wanted it to be a disaster .
2 ) Paranoia : the people who were so upset about Y2 K — the survivalists and others who headed to the mountains and other sparsely - populated areas — did n’t go to the country because they thought the cities would collapse .
They thought the rule of law would collapse and there would be Mad Maxian mass civil unrest .
And all that unrest would be aimed squarely at them — the arrogant and narcissistic survivalist leaders .
They just assumed that all the other folks who stupidly had n’t been hoarding lentils would want their lentils and would be coming for them , possibly armed .
They expected that Y2 K would not only delay Social Security checks , it would lead to armed insurrection aimed at they and their lentils .
I am not making this up .
3 ) Disappointment :
When the worst did n’t happen and these same folks found themselves in the middle nowhere with half a ton of lentils , they were disappointed the world had n’t fallen apart after all .
Some of those people still have n’t recovered .
When Y2K : The Winter of Our Disconnect ?
aired that October ( pre -Y2K ) , it produced the greatest e-mail response of any show I ever made — almost 3,000 messages in the first week .
Most of those messages were negative , some extremely so .
Many viewers saw me as irresponsible .
They claimed that my irresponsible actions would lead to the deaths of hundreds — perhaps thousands — of PBS viewers , lulled into inaction by my false reassurances .
Some viewers said I deserved to die for making the show .
A few suggested they would kill me themselves .
It reminded me to a certain extent of the minor firestorm a couple weeks ago over my Christmas card , though at least that one produced no death threats .
So I was Public Enemy Number One in October , 1999 for suggesting that Y2 K would turn out to be no big deal .
And what happened in January , when it became clear that my show was 100 percent correct ?
Nothing .
Not a single e-mail came to me from any of those people .
Audiences : you ca n’t live with them , you ca n’t live without them .
Happy New Year .
U.S. border security officials learned of intelligence about the alleged extremist links of the suspect in the Christmas Day airline bombing attempt as he was en route to Detroit and had decided to question him when he landed , officials said in new disclosures today .
The new information shows that border enforcement officials came across important clues about the suspect despite previous intelligence failures that were criticized by President Obama this week .
If the intelligence had been discovered sooner , it could have resulted in the interrogation and search of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before he boarded the Amsterdam - to - Detroit flight , senior law enforcement officials said .
“ The people in Detroit were prepared to look at him in secondary inspection , ” said a senior law enforcement official who requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
“ The decision had been made .
The . . . database had picked up the State Department concern about this guy , that this guy may have been involved with extremist elements in Yemen .
. . .
They could have made a decision on whether to stop him from getting on the plane . ”
Nonetheless , the revelations underscore the complexity of the intelligence and passenger screening systems that are the subject of comprehensive reviews to be revealed by the administration Thursday .
Even if U.S. border enforcement officials had learned of the Nigerian ’s alleged extremist links in time , it is not clear the intelligence was strong enough to cause Dutch officials to search him or block him from flying , officials said .
The threshold for requiring a foreign visitor to undergo special scrutiny upon arrival in the United States is considerably lower than criteria for preventing him from getting on the plane overseas , according to current and former law enforcement officials .
That is why border enforcement officials rely heavily on terrorism watch lists , officials said .
“ The public is n’t aware how many people are allowed to travel through the U.S. who are linked , who intersect with bad guys or alleged bad guys , ” a national security official said .
“ It makes sense from an intelligence perspective .
If they are not considered dangerous , it provides intelligence on where they go , who they meet with . ”
Moreover , the window for identifying a passenger as a potential threat before boarding is limited , according to a senior homeland security official .
Although U.S. border enforcement officials have access to passenger data based on reservation lists and use them for preliminary assessments , the in - depth vetting by Customs and Border Protection only begins once the flight manifest has been generated , just a few hours before takeoff , and focuses on potential actions to take at the U.S. border , the official said .
As a result , the intelligence about Abdulmutallab was discovered in a database by Customs and Border Protection inspectors based at the National Targeting Center in Washington once the plane was airborne , the other law enforcement officials said .
The administration ’s review of screening now underway includes an effort to make more information accessible to U.S.inspectors further in advance of flights , the senior law enforcement official said .
Customs and Border Protection spokesmen declined to comment because the investigation is still open .
In Detroit today , federal prosecutors filed a six - count indictment charging Abdulmutallab , 23 , for his alleged role in the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 .
The Nigerian already had been charged in a criminal complaint , and the indictment accuses him of placing a destructive device on an aircraft , attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and other charges that carry a penalty of up to life in prison .
“ This investigation is fast - paced , global and ongoing , and it has already yielded valuable intelligence that we will follow wherever it leads , ” Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said today .
“ Anyone we find responsible for this alleged attack will be brought to justice using every tool -- military or judicial -- available to our government . ”
Abdulmutallab has provided valuable information to the FBI and federal prosecutors about his dealings with extremists in Yemen , where he was allegedly trained and outfitted with the explosive device that he concealed in his underwear during the trip that began in Ghana , according to U.S. law enforcement officials .
Abdulmutallab has told interrogators that the plot involved meetings in Yemen with Anwar al Awlaki , an American - born Yemeni cleric suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda .
In addition , communications intercepts detected discussions about Awlaki ’s role in a suspected plot involving a Nigerian , U.S. officials have said .
The investigation has also uncovered communications between Abdulmutallab and Awlaki , a U.S. anti-terrorism official said today .
“ He was definitely in communication with Awlaki , ” said the official .
“ That ’s been documented . ”
Justice Department officials declined to comment on whether Abdulmutallab ’s cooperation could result in a reduced sentence .
But officials familiar with the case have said a plea deal could short - circuit the debate over his being charged in a civilian court .
Some Republican lawmakers and independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , have criticized the Obama administration for that decision , saying he should be interrogated and charged as an enemy combatant , without the right to counsel .

By comparison , the drug - resistant Gram - negative germs for the most part threaten only hospitalized patients whose immune systems are weak .
The germs can survive for a long time on surfaces in the hospital and enter the body through wounds , catheters and ventilators .
What is most worrisome about the Gram - negatives is not their frequency but their drug resistance .
“ For Gram - positives we need better drugs ; for Gram - negatives we need any drugs , ” said Dr. Brad Spellberg , an infectious - disease specialist at Harbor - U.C.L.A.
Medical Center in Torrance , Calif. , and the author of “ Rising Plague , ” a book about drug - resistant pathogens .
Dr. Spellberg is a consultant to some antibiotics companies and has co-founded two companies working on other anti-infective approaches .
Dr. Rice of Cleveland has also been a consultant to some pharmaceutical companies .
Doctors treating resistant strains of Gram - negative bacteria are often forced to rely on two similar antibiotics developed in the 1940s  colistin and polymyxin B .
These drugs were largely abandoned decades ago because they can cause kidney and nerve damage , but because they have not been used much , bacteria have not had much chance to evolve resistance to them yet .
“ You do n’t really have much choice , ” said Dr. Azza Elemam , an infectious - disease specialist in Louisville , Ky .
“ If a person has a life - threatening infection , you have to take a risk of causing damage to the kidney . ”
Such a tradeoff confronted Kimberly Dozier , a CBS News correspondent who developed an Acinetobacter infection after being injured by a car bomb in 2006 while on assignment in Iraq .
After two weeks on colistin , Ms. Dozier ’s kidneys began to fail , she recounted in her book , “ Breathing the Fire . ”
Rejecting one doctor ’s advice to go on dialysis and seek a kidney transplant , Ms. Dozier stopped taking the antibiotic to save her kidneys .
She eventually recovered from the infection .

Even that dire tradeoff might not be available to some patients .
Last year doctors at St. Vincent ’s Hospital in Manhattan published a paper describing two cases of “ pan-resistant ” Klebsiella , untreatable by even the kidney - damaging older antibiotics .
One of the patients died and the other eventually recovered on her own , after the antibiotics were stopped .
Fences can help to define and enhance our outdoor spaces , and provide us with security , privacy , and peace of mind .
Here ’s a handy - dandy primer to point out the pros and cons of each fence type , and some things to think about when selecting the right fence for you .
You can build fences out of a wide variety of materials , but the following options are among the most commonly used .
Wooden Fences
Among the best choices for privacy , wooden fences can come in a wide range of styles , and at a much lower price than brick or stone .
Perhaps the most configurable type of fence material , wooden fences can run the gamut from simple rail fences for borders , to classic white picket fences , to imposing stockade walls .
Remember that wood used in exterior applications should always be treated against rot , especially wooden posts that go into the earth .
Chain Link Fences
Inexpensive , easy to install , long lasting , and adaptable to uneven terrain , chain link fences are a great choice , particularly when security is a primary concern .
They are strong , provide great flow of air and light , and are far less expensive than wrought iron .
Also , vinyl - coated versions of chain link fences are virtually maintenance - free .
If a chain link fence makes you feel too exposed , you can purchase plastic strips to thread through the links to add privacy .
Be sure to use galvanized steel posts to prevent rust and decay .
Vinyl Fences
Vinyl fences are low maintenance , as they require no repainting , and are not susceptible to rot .
And , they have an attractive appearance reminiscent of classic wood fences — from a distance .
If you squint .
In a fog .
They do have a downside , however , as they are more expensive initially , burn intensely if they catch fire , and can become brittle in cold weather .
They make up for these deficiencies with their convenience , and lower costs over time compared to wood fences that need more long - term care and upkeep .
Brick and Mortar Fences
These are the most expensive , but are by far the longest lasting option .
They are also the most efficient at reducing noise , and provide exceptional privacy .
Wrought Iron and Aluminum
These two have many of the applications and attributes of chain link fencing , with a decidedly more upscale feel .
Wrought iron particularly can convey a sense of history and permanence , offer a clear view of a property , and discourage unwanted visitors all at the same time .
All of this comes at a high price however , and it remains one of the pricier options available .
Before you Build
Once you ’ve settled on the fence of your dreams , there are a few legal and logistical things to consider .
Contact your residential association or city government office to find out if there are any restrictions on fence construction in your area .
Your community may be particular about the height , type of fence material used , or the distance that your fence is set back from the street .
Also , before you start , be absolutely sure of the location of your property line .
In fact , it ’s a good idea to have a professional surveyor confirm the location of your lot line before you start digging .
If you encroach just an inch onto your neighbor ’s property , you might be required to pull your fence down and rebuild it properly .
Contact your utility company and ask them to mark the location of buried power cables with spray paint .
Most utility companies do it for free , and you wo n’t ruin your fence building experience by splitting a buried power cable with a shovel and lighting up like a Christmas tree .
Additionally , take into account any buried water lines to swimming pools , low - voltage lines for decorative lighting , sprinkler systems , and tree roots — you do n’t want any injury stemming from building your fence .
Lastly , talk to your neighbors about your fence .
Informing them of your plans is just common courtesy , as you are about to plop a construction zone on their border .
Hire a Pro , or Go Solo ?
Many types of fences can be constructed by the average weekend warrior , and many do n’t require any special permits .
However , if you do n’t have the time , or do n’t feel confident in doing the work yourself , you should hire a contractor to build for you .
Once you ’ve settled on what you want , consult with several contractors to get a range of estimates .
Make absolutely certain that all candidates up for the job are licensed , bonded , and insured .
Ask for references and follow up on them .
They should be able to show you examples of their work as well .
A Fence is a Design Element
There , I said it .
Certain fences look more appropriate with certain types of homes .
For example , if you have a cute little starter home on a small lot , erecting a massive wall made of fieldstone might look ridiculous .
Similarly , if you are the proud owner of a 3 - story vintage brownstone , installing a homey , little , 30 - inch tall white picket fence could attract the attention of concerned mental health professionals .
Choose a fence style that wo n’t disrupt the aesthetic unity of your home and yard .
Good Reasons to Build a Fence
Here are some smart reasons to build a fence , and recommendations for specific types of fencing :
Block off an Unwanted View
If you have an unfortunate view that ruins your otherwise idyllic environment , erecting a fence to block out that view is a dandy idea .
You should go with a solid fence , or if you are concerned about light and airflow — or plain old aesthetics — consider a combination of a solid wall topped with latticework , to add visual interest .
Increase Privacy
For privacy you want a solid fence , such as a brick or wooden fence , at least 6 ft. high to shield your yard from prying eyes , and to cut down on intrusive noise .
Keep Pets and Kids In
Dogs have been known to dig under fences , and children love to climb just about anything .
Whatever type of fence you choose , make sure that you have a barrier that extends at least 6 inches into the ground .
If you have intrepid toddlers , make sure there are no handholds , such as horizontal rails .
Security
When it comes to security , fences are a double - edged sword .
On the one hand , they present a conspicuous barrier to thieves .
But on the other , fences can also shield a thief from view , and offer them a chance to work with less fear of discovery .
Your best fence bet for security is a chain link fence , at least 6 ft. tall , to effectively keep out intruders .
A brick wall or wooden fence provides added privacy , but the open design of a chain link fence allows better air flow , provides better light for plants , offers no hiding places for intruders , and their somewhat harsh appearance can be softened with trailing vines and other plants .
Add Visual Appeal
A well - designed fence , thoughtfully placed , can add definition to your landscape , and unify your home and yard like nothing else .
You might want to keep in mind that the general etiquette for building fences is to keep the best face toward the public .
The only recommendation to make here is to let your home ’s design and natural setting function as the guiding influence in determining which fence is best .
Fences Built With Good Intentions
Sometimes putting in a fence is not the best idea .
Say , for example , somehow you and your neighbor got ticked off at each other and now you ’re toying with building a high fence just to block the sun , killing his hydrangea bushes .
Unfortunately , if you are building a fence for malicious reasons to annoy people on adjoining property , it ’s considered a private nuisance .
That ’s against the law , and you could be compelled to pull it down .
And possibly be the recipient of glares .
But , if your intentions are true — and surely they are — putting in a new fence might be the perfect accessory to your home and garden .
A WILD pheasant is wreaking havoc in a peaceful town forcing residents to take cover indoors , it was reported today .
Local paper
The Northern Echosaid the aggressive male bird has a long list of victims in North Yorkshire , England .
He has reportedly attacked men , women , children , baby - strollers , bikes , dogs and even cars in Newsham , North Yorkshire .
The ferocious bird is known to hide silently in bushes , waiting for innocent passersby , before leaping out for an attack .
The pheasant has been rumoured to wait for the area school bus , chasing screaming children into the safety of their home .
Sonia Hall , 65 , who was attacked by the pheasant while out for a walk with her two - year - old grandson , Jacob , told the Northern Echo , " When we came out of the post office and set off back to the house , the pheasant darted across the road towards us .
It started flying low towards my legs and pecking at me . "
Hall now leaves the house ready and armed to fight the pesky bird .
" Another day it came at me and I whacked it with my handbag .
I carry an umbrella around with me now for protection , " she added .
Lindsay Waddell , chairman of the National Gamekeepers Organisation , told the UK's Daily Mail that the bird was just protecting what it considered to be its home territory .
Waddell said the best way to deal with the bird would be to humanely capture it and relocate it away from the village .
Cadbury will accept defeat in its battle to stay independent today by recommending a £ 12bn takeover from US rival Kraft that threatens to reignite a fierce debate about the vulnerability of British industry .
The 186 - year - old chocolate maker decided to throw in the towel late last night after a large foreign shareholder joined hedge funds in indicating it would accept an improved offer from Kraft , and the prospect of a rival bid from Hershey faded .
Cadbury 's board , led by chairman Roger Carr , will announce its decision to recommend the revised 850 p - a - share bid to all shareholders through a ­statement to the stock exchange this morning , according to sources close to the company .
Although a board recommendation is not binding , it is highly unusual for a ­company to resist a hostile takeover once its management has capitulated .
The confectionery giant joins a list of British industrial names to have fallen to foreign takeovers in similar circumstances in recent years .
More than 50 ­leading companies have gone , including BAA , Boots , Cazenove , Corus , ICI , Jaguar Land Rover , P&O , Pilkington and Scottish Power .
Until now Cadbury had fought a public campaign to preserve its independence , attracting support from Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , who warned Kraft to expect " huge opposition " from the ­government if it wanted to make a " fast buck " by buying Cadbury .
His intervention is ­understood to have rattled Kraft 's chief executive , Irene Rosenfeld , who recently met shareholders in London , but the US company chose to negotiate a raised offer after calculating that the political risk was manageable .
Cadbury unions have warned that up to 30,000 jobs would be put at risk by the deal as Kraft would be weighed down by some £ 22bn in debt .
Kraft has a record of aggressive cost- cutting , and the union Unite said that between 2004 and 2008 it shed 19,000 jobs and closed 35 sites to help reduce its debt .
Today 's bid of 850 p - a- share ( including a 10 p dividend ) is an increase on Kraft 's previous offer of around 770 p in cash and shares , which Carr had previously described as " derisory " .
Nonetheless it is at the low end of many independent experts ' predictions for an agreed price and comes after Cadbury 's chief executive , Todd Spitzer , appeared to suggest he thought its shares were worth £ 10 each .
A source close to Cadbury said the decision had been taken with " a heavy heart " but followed advice from its investment bankers that any increase in Kraft 's bid beyond 830 p would succeed .
More than a quarter of Cadbury shares are now in the hands of hedge funds which bought them in the hope of a deal .
The final straw came when Franklin Templeton , a large US mutual fund with a 7 % stake , indicated it would accept 830p .
The circumstances of the defeat are likely to reopen a debate about the role of hedge funds and other investors during takeovers .
Lord Myners , the City minister , has been vocal in his criticism of short - termism among institutional fund managers .
Cadbury was the first big test of a supposed new mood after the financial crash and raised strong emotions because of its history as a progressive employer , supporter of fair trade and proponent of good corporate governance .
Nevertheless , its management 's actions appear to have followed a well - worn path in such situations .
Carr cut his teeth as chief executive of Williams , an industrial conglomerate also sold overseas , and worked with Sir Nigel Rudd , who recommended the sale of Boots two years ago .
Under Takeover Panel rules , Kraft had until midnight tonight to raise its offer .
There is still a chance that Hershey may intervene , but sources close to Cadbury last night said that was unlikely .

LESS than a year before the euro became the currency of 11 European countries in January 1999 , a declaration signed by 155 German - speaking economists called for an “ orderly ” — ie , long — delay .
The prospective euro members , they said , had not yet reduced their debt and deficits to suit a workable monetary union ; some were using “ creative accounting ” to get there , and a casual attitude towards deficits would undermine confidence in the euro 's stability .
Now the prediction is coming true , says Wim Kösters , of the Ruhr University in Bochum and one of the original signatories .
Greece , which joined the euro two years after its inception , has concealed the dodgy state of its finances .
Now it is under attack from speculators .
A default could spread panic to other deficit - plagued economies , including those of Spain and Portugal , with scary consequences for Europe 's already shaky banking system .
But if Greece 's partners bail it out , defying the euro 's founding treaty , the currency will suffer .
Either way , the euro is in trouble .
This dilemma is felt especially keenly in Germany .
It was a wrench to surrender the Deutschmark , symbol of post - war recovery and economic success .
On the eve of monetary union 55 % of Germans were against it , making their nation the euro zone 's most reluctant founders .
When a “ rescue ” is mentioned , all eyes fix on Germany , Europe 's biggest economy and most creditworthy borrower .
Germans fear that a rescue of Greece would , in effect , extend their welfare state to the Mediterranean .
Greece 's travails put Angela Merkel , the chancellor , in an uncomfortable position .
German taxpayers are in no mood to save what they see as profligate Greeks , having already pledged € 500 billion ( $ 682 billion ) to shore up their own banks and billions more for companies .
The liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , the junior partner in her coalition government , is against a rescue , as are many politicians from her own Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) .
The Young Entrepreneurs ' Association declared that it would be “ fatal ” for Germany to foot the bill for Greece 's “ budget chaos ” .
A domestic row over welfare makes charity for foreigners a still more awkward subject .
This month the constitutional court ruled that the government had erred in setting benefits for the main welfare programme , called Hartz IV .
It has until the end of the year to come up with a new formula , which may cost more money .
Guido Westerwelle , the FDP leader , lamented the “ late Roman decadence ” of a society that treats welfare beneficiaries more generously than workers .
His outburst , in turn , annoyed Ms Merkel .
“ I ca n't explain to someone on Hartz IV that we can't give him a single cent more but that a Greek gets to retire at 63 ” , said Michael Fuchs , a CDU leader in the Bundestag .
On February 11th Mrs Merkel joined other European leaders in offering Greece vague support , while demanding concrete plans to slash its budget deficit .
Since the summit , the demands have become more concrete and talk of aid even more vague .
On February 15th finance ministers from the 16 euro - zone countries told Greece to take additional steps to cut its budget deficit by four percentage points of GDP to 8.7 % this year .
A harsh austerity plan , they hope , will be enough to deter speculators — and to reassure their voters at home that Greece is not getting off lightly .
The model is Ireland , whose brutal spending cuts restored market confidence without aid from its European neighbours .
A bail - out , Mrs Merkel fears , would break the bargain Germany struck in accepting the euro : that the single currency 's members would never jeopardise its stability nor ask Germans to pay for anyone else 's mismanagement .
That said , the currency union was hardly an act of martyrdom by Germany .
In the past decade its firms have modernised and their workers have accepted miserly pay rises , boosting their competitiveness .
In a euro - less Europe , its trading partners could have erased some of that advantage by devaluing their currencies .
Instead , many of Europe 's weaker economies failed to reform and Germany accumulated gratifyingly large current - account surpluses .
Nor has the crisis been entirely bad news .
The euro has weakened by about 10 % against the dollar since the beginning of 2010 .
Under the circumstances , that was not a harbinger of inflation but a welcome tonic for European exports — especially German ones .
The path out of the crisis is unclear .
Greek bonds remain under pressure ( see chart ) .
Arguments rage over which chain reaction would be more damaging : serial bail - outs or serial defaults .
A legal opinion by Bundestag experts argues that help for Greece might be allowed by European treaties if the crisis can be blamed on outside forces , like speculators or the global recession .
Some economists ( mainly non-German ones ) say Germany can contribute to a longer - term solution by stimulating domestic consumption , which would help the Mediterranean miscreants grow out of their problems .
There is talk of more co-ordinated “ economic government ” within the euro - zone ( see Charlemagne ) .
Mr Kösters is sceptical .
“ No one knows what economic government is , ” he says .
Europe 's single market and currency set countries in competition with each other on the basis of their economies and institutions .
Germany largely rose to the challenge .
Now , says Mr Kösters , it is up to Greece and the others to do the same .
The budget is far more than Obama had hoped to spend when elected , only modestly less than during Bush 's last years .
War spending surges in 2011 budget
President Barack Obama ’s new budget , to be released Monday , forecasts two consecutive years of near $ 160 billion in war funding , far more than he hoped when elected and only modestly less than the last years of the Bush Administration .
In 2011 alone , the revised numbers are triple what the president included in his spending plan a year ago .
And the strain shows itself in new deficit projections , already hobbled by lagging revenues due to the weak economy .

The administration appears to be projecting a deficit of near $ 1.6 trillion for the current year and $ 1.3 trillion in 2011 .
That is even more pessimistic than Congressional Budget Office estimates last week , and it ’s only in 2012 that the projections drop to the range of $ 800 billion to $ 700 billion .
By the end of the decade , the gap again widens , and as a percentage of GDP , the average appears above the 3 % target viewed as sustainable .
Obama has responded with a three - year domestic spending freeze impacting about $ 447 billion in annual appropriations .
This leaves him less money to sustain the very rapid growth seen last year in clean water programs or the Great Lakes restoration initiative .
The Environmental Protection Agency budget would be cut modestly , and to stretch his dollars , Obama wants to dramatically ramp up the Energy Department ’s credit budget , a low - cost way to extend tens of billions in loan guarantees to the nuclear power industry .
But on balance , the president ’s plan seems less restrictive in many areas than lawmakers had anticipated .
With the Senate having just passed a $ 1.9 trillion debt ceiling increase last week , fiscal moderates in his own party may insist on even tighter limits .
Obama ’s 2010 starting point for the freeze has a built - in cushion since billions in Census spending wo n’t have to be repeated in 2011 .
He appears to count expanded Pell Grant funding for low - income college students as a mandatory cost outside the Education Department ’s discretionary budget .
And both Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security , two of the fastest areas of recent spending , are exempted from the freeze .
The VA is slated to get significant new money to speed the processing of claims , and billions more will be requested this year to resolve old disputes related to soldiers and airmen exposed to Agent Orange in the Vietnam War .
In the case of education , a top priority for the president , the department ’s appropriations would grow by about $ 3.5 billion to $ 49.7 billion , a 7.5 % increase .
But when Pell Grants are counted , the total increase is closer to $ 11.4 billion or 16 % above current spending .
Other departments , like Health and Human Services and Labor , receive smaller increases , more in the range of inflation or less .
But within these totals , the National Institutes of Health would grow by about $ 1 billion or 3 % .
Community health centers and Head Start are also promised increases , and a teen pregnancy program would be expanded from $ 100 million to almost $ 180 million .
Mindful of the strain on state and local law enforcement budgets , substantial increased funding is provided for the hiring of police officers under the COP ’s program within the Justice Department .
The budget ’s increased war funding is not entirely surprising given Obama ’s decision to add more U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
And his early estimates for 2011 in last year ’s budget were always suspect and more of a “ plug ” than real .
Nonetheless , seeing everything in a single budget brings the war costs more into focus .
Democrats are increasingly agitated by the pace of withdrawal from Iraq , and the combined costs of the two wars is striking –especially when measured against the much more hopeful rhetoric of Obama ’s campaign .
The president ’s 2010 defense budget a year ago requested $ 130 billion for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and just $ 50 billion in 2011 .
The new budget ramps up 2010 spending to $ 163 billion and for 2011 requests $ 159 billion in overseas contingency funds for the military .
This reverses the drop in war - related spending seen in fiscal 2009 , which ended last Sept 30th and was a transition year of sorts between the two administrations .
When compared to the peak war spending of the Bush years , Obama is only about 10 % below Bush ’s annual average of $ 176 billion in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 — the time of the Iraq war surge .
Core defense spending is also feeling the strain and the president ’s $ 549 billion request reflects less than 2 % real growth over inflation .
At a time when the administration is emphasizing jobs creation , this sets up what could be bitter election - year fights with fellow Democrats over plans to halt airplane and truck production important to employment California and the Midwest .
For example , Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to redouble his campaign against the C - 17 transport plane this year , much as he successfully went after F - 22 production last year .
And while the Pentagon is making a huge commitment to the F - 35 joint strike fighter , production will slip a year to allow more testing and Gates wants to rollback efforts in Congress to develop an alternate engine for the fighter .
The 2011 budget debate wo n’t hit full stride until this spring , but Democrats may move earlier than usual on a supplemental spending bill for the current fiscal year .
The Defense Department is seeking $ 33 billion in additional war - related funding on top of which the State Department will also be receiving additional funds for its beefed up operations in Afghanistan .
Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , chairman of the House defense appropriations panel , wants to include any requests related to Haiti in the same package , and the VA appears to be pursuing its own 2010 supplemental request in the new budget related to Agent Orange claims .
It may have given the world the Kama Sutra and the Bollywood wet sari scene , but it appears that India is not yet ready to be exposed to the delicate subject of sex on the internet .
A Guardian investigation has discovered that several internet companies have quietly introduced filters to prevent Indian users from accessing sexual content .
The Yahoo search engine and Flickr photo - sharing site ( owned by Yahoo ) altered their sites earlier this month to prevent users in India from switching off the safe - search facility .
The block also applies to users in Singapore , Hong Kong and Korea .
Microsoft has also barred Indian users of its Bing search engine from searching for sexual content .
Users who do try to search for sexual material receive a notice informing them that " your country or region requires a strict Bing SafeSearch setting , which filters out results that might return adult content " .
The clampdown is understood to be in response to recent changes to India 's Information Technology Act of 2000 , which bans the publication of pornographic material .
That law , which is based on a 150 - year - old statute ( section 292 of the Indian penal code ) , defines obscenity as " any content that is lascivious and that will appeal to prurient interest or the effect of which is to tend to deprave or corrupt the minds of those who are likely to see , read or hear the same " .
In October , the scope of the 2000 act was dramatically widened to enable action to be taken against a wide range of providers , from internet search engines and internet service providers to cyber -cafes .
Under the new law , they are obliged to exercise due diligence and disable access to any content which contravenes the act .
Failure to do so carries a three - year jail sentence and a fine of up to 500,000 rupees ( £ 6,690 ) .
Search engine reports suggest that users in India are responsible for more searches for " sex " than those in any other country .
Its popular daily newspapers are packed with pictures of young women in states of undress and Bollywood oozes sexuality from every pore .
But at the same time it remains a deeply religious country in which traditionalists regularly take violent offence at anything deemed to be too suggestive .
The latest attempts to constrain internet users come at a time when the vexed subject of sexual behaviour is once again dominating the domestic headlines .
Last week an Indian news channel broadcast video footage of a man said to be the 86 - year - old governor of Andhra Pradesh , Narayan Datt Tiwari , in bed with three young women .
He quit on Sunday , citing health reasons and still denying that the man in the video was him .
Today there was also mixed news for the tens of thousands of fans of India 's most popular – and only – cartoon porn star , Savita Bhabhi .
The sexual antics of the energetic housewife won her website a daily audience of nearly 200,000 visitors , until it was closed down by the Indian government in June .
Now the site is back at a new web address but already it has fallen foul of the Internet Service Providers Association of India , whose president , Rajesh Chharia , warned that it faced closure again because its content was " not acceptable to our culture " .
No one from Yahoo was available for comment today but a posting on the Flickr website explained that " Flickr is a global community made up of many different kinds of people .
" What 's OK in your backyard may not be OK in theirs .
Each one of us bears the responsibility of categorising our own content within this landscape .
So , we 've introduced some filters to help everyone try to get along .
" If your Yahoo !
ID is based in Singapore , Hong Kong , India or Korea you will only be able to view safe content based on your local terms of service ( this means you wo n't be able to turn SafeSearch off ) . "
US government officials may have conspired to conceal evidence that three Guantánamo Bay inmates could have been murdered during interrogations , according to a six - month investigation by American journalists .
All three may have been suffocated during questioning on the same evening and their deaths passed off as suicides by hanging , the joint investigation for Harper 's Magazine and NBC News has concluded .
The magazine also suggests the cover - up may explain why the US government is reluctant to allow the release of Shaker Aamer , the last former British resident held at Guantánamo , as he is said to have alleged that he was part - suffocated while being tortured on the same evening .
" The cover - up is amazing in its audacity , and it is continuing into the Obama administration , " said Scott Horton , the contributing editor for Harper 's who conducted the investigation .
When the three men – Salah Ahmed al - Salami , 37 , a Yemeni , and two Saudis , Talal al - Zahrani , 22 , and Mani Shaman al - Utaybi , 30 – died in June 2006 , the camp 's commander declared that they had committed suicide and that this had been " an act of asymmetrical warfare " , rather than one of desperation .
According to an official inquiry by the US navy , whose report was heavily censored before release , each man was found in his cell , hanging from bedsheets , with their hands bound and rags stuffed down their throats .
However , Horton spoke to four camp guards who alleged that when the bodies were taken to the camp 's medical clinic they had definitely not come from their cell block , which they were guarding , and appeared to have been transfered from a " black site " , known as Camp No , within Guantánamo , operated by either the CIA or a Pentagon intelligence agency .
The men said that the following day , a senior officer assembled the guards and told them that the three men had committed suicide by stuffing rags down their throats , that the media would report that they had hanged themselves , and ordered that they must not seek to contradict those reports .
Harper 's says that when the bodies of the three men were repatriated , pathologists who conducted postmortem examinations found that each man 's larynx , hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage – which could have helped determine cause of death – had been removed and retained by US authorities .
The men's bodes did show signs of mistreatment , however , including bruising and needle marks .
Al - Salami's jaw was broken and several teeth missing , injuries that an earlier US pathologist 's report attributed to an attempted resuscitation .
Aamer 's account of his mistreatment on the same evening as the three deaths appears in papers lodged with a district federal court in Washington .
His lawyer , Zachary Katznelson , wrote in an affidavit that Aamer had been beaten for two and a half hours by seven naval military police after he refused to provide a retina scan and fingerprints .
" He reported to me that he was strapped to a chair , fully restrained at the head , arms and legs .
The MPs inflicted so much pain , Mr Aamer said he thought he was going to die . "
The MPs are also alleged to have pressed on pressure points and held Aamer 's eyes open while shining a torch into them .
" When he screamed , they cut off his airway , then put a mask on him so he could not cry out , " Katznelson wrote .
Aamer , 41 , whose British wife and four children live in London , has been held at Guantánamo for almost eight years .
Next Friday marks the first anniversary of President Obama 's order that the camp be closed within a year , but around 214 other men are also still detained there .
In the days that followed the deaths of the three men , US navy investigators seized every piece of paperwork possessed by other inmates .
Harper 's reports that when the US justice department subsequently went to court to defend the seizure of correspondence between inmates and their lawyers , the judge commented on one aspect of the department 's case : that its " citations supporting the fact of the suicides " were all drawn from media accounts .
Harper 's also reports that two of the three men had been due for release when they died , and that family members doubt they would have taken their own lives .
One of Horton 's sources , a former staff sergeant in his mid-40s called Joseph Hickman , approached the department of justice via his lawyer in February last year to report his concerns , but Harper 's says a subsequent investigation appears to have been shelved , raising concerns that the department had been compromised by its own role in the use of torture in the " war on terror " .
" Under George W Bush , the CIA created an archipelago of secret detention centres that spanned the globe , and authorities at these sites deployed an array of justice department –sanctioned torture techniques – including waterboarding , which often entails inserting cloth into the subject 's mouth – on prisoners they deemed to be involved in terrorism , " Horton says .
" The experience of Sergeant Hickman and other Guantánamo guards compels us to ask whether the three prisoners who died on 9 June were being interrogated by the CIA , and whether their deaths resulted from the gruelling techniques the justice department had approved for the agency 's use – or from other tortures lacking that sanction . "
Since then , Halpern has nearly finished writing the book of stories -- some go in - depth behind popular tweets and others tell of childhood experiences with his father .
The book will be in stores before Father 's Day .
In September , The Times ' Technology Blog wrote about the chance events that took Halpern 's paternal - biographical messages from a few friends watching on Twitter to a book deal .
But that 's a small obstacle in a long , fortuitous process for the 29 - year - old comedy writer since moving back home with Samuel , his 74 - year - old father , in San Diego .
Now , his vision finally looks to be coming to a realization .
It 's unclear how CBS will adapt the potty - mouth show title .
Halpern , who 's co-penning the show about his cranky dad with long - time writing partner Patrick Schumacker , says he hopes the network lands on a name like " S#& % My Dad Says " -- bleeping the first word during spoken - word promotions .
CBS has green - lighted a pilot based on the tweets of an angry old man .
William Shatner is set to play the well - intentioned curmudgeon in the production based on Justin Halpern 's Twitter account called " Stuff My Dad Says . "
( We 're replacing the swear word in the title , and be warned -- the site is full of words that network television wo n't broadcast ) .
The Twitter account has passed 1 million followers .
By some accounts , it was the first profile on Twitter to reach such a milestone without the help of Twitter 's prized suggested users list -- though Halpern 's page has made it onto the newest list .
On Twitter , he 's turned down numerous public business propositions -- movies , cartoons , merchandising .
One company offered him $ 25,000 to send out a single , sub - 140 - character message promoting its product .
Halpern rejected the deal because he thought it was " the exact opposite of my dad , " he said over coffee recently .
" Even though he already was like , [ censored ] do it ! "
Halpern said .
" He just does n't want to have to support me when I 'm older . "
The likelihood of Halpern moving out of his parents ' house is looking pretty good .
Even now , he spends much of his time living in Echo Park with a friend .
" Will and Grace 's " Max Mutchnik and David Kohan are producing the show , providing experience that Halpern calls invaluable .
They 've had to struggle with producing a show that , at first glance , sounds a lot like " All in the Family " -- " one of my all - time favorite shows , " Halpern said .
" Archie Bunker is like so blue collar , " Halpern said .
" My dad went to medical school .
He lectured at Harvard .
He 's [ censored ] way smarter than I could ever hope to be . "
The show focuses intently on unemployment among Justin 's generation .
CBS is betting on a concept that pokes fun at U.S. economic turmoil .
" Most of my friends live at home in San Diego .
They 're guys that went to college and stuff , " Halpern said .
" It 's interesting that there 's this generation of people that are educated and sort of went through the route that our parents went through .
But then when they got out , with the way that the economy is , they 're just kind of [ out of luck . ] "
When Halpern called his father Thursday night to ecstatically tell him about CBS picking up his show , his dad reacted in his unbeknown comedic style .
" Great to hear .
Here 's your mom , " Halpern recalled his dad saying .
" I was like , ' That 's it ? '
And he goes , ' You 're on a cellphone .
I do n't like talking on those .
It 's muffled .
Here 's mom . ' "
Halpern endorsed Shatner for the role , saying , " He was our first choice . "
Shatner won an Emmy for his work on " Boston Legal . "
However , the " Star Trek " legend was n't Halpern 's dad 's pick .
" He wanted James Earl Jones to play him , " Halpern said .
" I was like , ' But you 're white . '
He was like , ' Well , we do n't have to be !
Who gives a [ censored ] ?
You asked me who I thought , and that 's who I think . ' "
Samuel will soon be immortalized on screen with or without Darth Vader 's contribution .

Linux in Canada
Linux , the world 's most well - known open source software , has been popular in Canada for quite some time .
Linux costs considerably less than Microsoft , so people are likely to switch over .
Not just people , but government institutions , like the city of Calgary , have adopted Linux software .
After all , Canada ’s largest supercomputer , the IBM iDataPlex at the University of Toronto , runs on Linux .
Linux ’s popularity has soared in Canada to such an extent that now people worry that favourite distros like Red Hat could become the target of viruses .
Though some worry that Linux adoption in Canada in general has been slow , it has been notably high in certain areas .
Nowadays , there are a number of Linux organisations , user groups , forums , and dedicated professionals who teach the software and tweak it for Canadian personal users .
Read ahead for more information about best known entities helping ease Linux adaptation in Canada .
Organisations
Linux Professional Institute Inc. ( LPI )
LPI is a non-profit organisation in Canada that offers training and professional certification in Linux - based systems for Canadian programmers , system administrators , and other interested parties .
The organisation issues LPIC certificates that are widely accepted by businesses to test employees ’ and job applicants ’
Linux competency .
Though LPI is headquartered in Canada , it has many branches throughout the provinces .
The exams the institution provides are available around the word and are administered by Linux training partners of LPI .
HPE is an organisation that offers computer educational services in Linux for residents in the US and Canada .
The organisation offers a number of courses in Linux for users of all levels .
There are two “ paths ” students can take , one in system administration and the other in project management .
HPE also focuses training on multiple Linux distros , including Red Hat Enterprise , SUSE Server , and Ubuntu .
NobleProg
NobleProg is a Polish IT consultancy and training organisation that offers Linux certification courses in Montreal .
The company offers Linux courses varying from the very basic to professional levels for Canadians .
Course fees range from $ 1880 to $ 6440 .
Courses also cover a number of Linux distros .
User Groups
Ottawa Canada Linux Users Group
This user group has been active for close to two decades promoting Linux use in the Ottawa area .
The group maintains several mailing lists and occasionally conducts events for members to meet .
The group is run by a diverse array of Linux enthusiasts .
Some have only basic levels of knowledge , while others are pros .
Meetings are held at notable locations around the city , especially the local public library .
GTALUG ( formerly TLUG )
This group brings together Linux fans in the Toronto area .
Anyone is welcome to join .
The group provides users a place to discuss how to use and learn more about Linux .
The group holds in - person meetings at “ F2 F ” locations .
Before real - life meetings are conducted , users hold discussions via email .
Informal get - together events are held often , usually at local restaurants .
Calgary Linux Users Group Guild ( CLUG )
CLUG is dedicated to bringing Linux users and interested parties together in the Calgary area .
The group holds a monthly meeting on the first Wednesday of each month , usually at a room in the downtown campus of University of Calgary .
Because the group is rather large , there are sub groups with specialised interests that meet separately .
The group holds many training workshops , special get - together events and “ installfests ” where the public is invited to get help installing Linux software onto personal computers .
Forums
Most Canadian users discuss Linux on official Linux.com and official distro forums .
In addition , they may use the following :
PegaSoft.ca –
An online forum dedicated to discussing open source software including Linux .
alt.linux –
This is a public Google Group for users to discuss Linux , among other topics .
Linux Professionals
According to a report published by the Linux Foundation , the demand for professionals specialising in Linux is rapidly rising .
Currently , the demand seems to exceed the supply .
Companies are described as being “ desperate ” for employees who know the open source software inside out .
Companies in search of Linux professionals and hiring Linux professionals are soaring in Canada .
IT professionals , therefore , should focus on getting Linux skills on their resumes .

Introduction : Why GDI Output For 2D Graphics Remains Relevant
First things first : if you have n't yet read 2D , Acceleration , And Windows : Are n't All Graphics Cards Equal ? , please feel free to check that one out first , since it's the Part 1 to this Part 2 exploration into the history of 2D in Windows and current issues seen on high - end discrete graphics cards .
In this second part , we focus on the relevance of GDI , explain 2D graphics output more completely , and present to you our 2D benchmark ( for the folks who have n't already discovered it on Tom's Hardware DE ) .
In order to fully understand the results from that benchmark , we must first dig into some related theoretical fundamentals .
Direct2D or GDI ?
Or perhaps both ?
Why Do We Still Test GDI in the Era of Windows 7 and Direct2D ?
In the first part of this series , a number of readers speculated that , with the introduction of DirectX 10 - capable graphics cards and Windows Vista , older GDI methods for 2D graphics output were rendered obsolete .
The WPF ( Windows Presentation Foundation ) , along with Direct2D , have been available to Microsoft developers for some time now .
Nevertheless , there are plenty of good reasons why GDI ( the Graphics Device Interface ) remains unarguably meaningful and relevant , which means we must examine its behavior and performance , even for the brave new world of Windows 7 .
These reasons include :
The GDI continues to support older graphics cards , while Direct2D requires cards that can support DirectX 10 or better .
GDI is supported in every known version of Windows , whereas Direct2D is available only in Windows Vista and Windows 7 .
Every graphics application that runs under Windows XP ( and older Windows versions ) uses GDI
Lots of software developers resist converting their software from older to newer APIs .
Even today , many developers continue to turn to the same well - understood programming libraries , even if newer technologies are available .
Converting from one library to another also means rewriting and retesting all affected code modules .
Because performance improvements that result from converting from an older library to a newer one may be barely perceptible , software developers also balk at making such changes on purely economic grounds ( too much time and effort for too small of a result ) .
If you take the implementation of Direct2D in various components of Mozilla Firefox as an illustrative example , you get a sense of the industry ’s leisurely pace in carrying out this conversion process .
In addition , it would be a form of business suicide for many of these firms to lock the entire community of XP users out of their latest releases .
All of this adds up to a single compelling observation : the GDI is likely to stick around until Windows XP no longer represents any significant component of the end - user community .
Then there are technical reasons to explain the persistence of GDI .
Key GDI code modules ( those that are included and invoked most often in Windows applications ) are n't completely portable .
Direct2D also consumes significant processing power and system resources , but can do nothing that Direct3D cannot also deliver .
And those who elect to skip using Direct3D have usually considered this decision quite carefully .
In addition , the GDI works independently of the output devices , such as monitors or printers , that may be in use .
Thus , the same routine in a program can render graphics on a monitor , and output to a printer , thereby reducing the code ( and its subsequent maintenance and error risk ) by as much as one - half .
Many of the most affordable printers are GDI devices nowadays , and this situation is unlikely to change any time soon , even in Windows 7 , where plenty of drivers for GDI - only printers remain widely available .
Direct2D as a part of Direct3D - Output ( D3D )
The Whole Is More Than the Sum of All Parts
We ourselves view the conversion to WPF and Direct2D as a move that ’s being pushed forcibly by Microsoft , and as an irreversible technical step forward .
But those who get all hot and bothered by new technology should think back to previous introductions , which we 'll recap in this piece .
Windows XP included , there is more than enough legacy technology hanging around that you can really only face the future if you ’re willing to ignore the past .
But alas , this disregards the realities in which most users operate , such as the well - known phobia for Windows XP shown by 780G and 785G on - board graphics chips .
We want to revisit our benchmarks from Part 1 here , but this time we ’ll use our own custom - built software ( readers can also download this tool from our site , and run it on their own PCs ) .
We 'll observe that even the most expensive graphics cards fall flat on some of these tests , if they ’re affected by drivers that have n't been optimized for what many folks consider an older technology .
Following a pitched court battle , the British Foreign Office has been forced to release seven previously “ redacted ” paragraphs regarding allegations of mistreatment by former Gitmo detainee Binyam Mohamed .
The paragraphs were part of a CIA document shared with the British government about Mohamed ’s status .
The rest of the document had previously been released .
Binyam Mohamed
The paragraphs confirm in great measure allegations of Mohamed ’s torture in custody , concluding that the treatment “ if it had been administered on behalf of the United Kingdom , would clearly have been in breach of the undertakings given by the United Kingdom in 1972 . ”
The comments were likely a reference to the “ Parker Report ” in 1972 , which determined that the British government could not legally inflict techniques spelled out as torture by the European Court of Human Rights under domestic law .
It detailed Mohamed ’s mistreatment and deteriorating condition , to the point that he had to be kept under “ self - harm observation . ”
Though it explicitly declined to “ categorise the treatment reported , ” it finally concludeed that “ it could readily be contended to be at the very least cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities . ”
Mohamed was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and accused of playing a role in the illusory “ dirty bomb plot ” of Jose Padilla .
He spent seven years in US custody , including five years at Guantanamo Bay .
In February 2009 the US dropped all charges against him and released him .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband
Since his release , the British national has detailed his systematic mistreatment , sparking a battle with the British government to come clean on its complicity in years of torture .
Today ’s release seems to have finally vindicated Mohamed once and for all , providing clear confessions that the “ evidence ” obtained against him for the charges that were eventually dropped came from torture .
The British Foreign Office , for its part , incredibly insisted that the evidence in the seven paragraphs was no big deal , with Foreign Secretary David Miliband insisting the case was about defending a fundamental principle of keeping shared intelligence secret .
Mary Daly , the feminist theologian and philosopher , has died .
She was an audaciously creative spirit ; an awkwardly witty , deadly serious writer .
She arguably did more to stretch what is possible to think in contemporary feminist theology than any other .
Here 's a taste of what she was prepared to say .
In books like Gyn / Ecology and Beyond God the Father , she envisaged the Trinity – Father , Son and Holy Spirit : the all - male three in one – as an eternal homosexual orgy .
She argued that to call God " father " is to make fathers gods , excusing all kinds of horrors from religious totalitarianism to domestic violence .
" The character of Vito Corleone in The Godfather is a vivid illustration of the marriage of tenderness and violence so intricately blended in the patriarchal ideal , " she wrote in Beyond God the Father .
She sought to cause offence , no doubt , though not for it 's own sake or to stir a sensation .
Rather , her radical reinterpretation dares you to think differently .
I was advised to read her by a professor at Boston College , the Catholic university with which she was uneasily associated for more than 30 years .
That 's a story in itself , which she wrote about in Amazon Grace : Re-Calling the Courage to Sin Big .
My advisor was a Jesuit priest , a man who'd never heard her speak as she banned men from attending her lectures , arguing the act was a just reflection of the long silencing of women .
Her performance was as striking as her words .
( It 's worth adding that the Boston Jesuits were pretty fearless towards Rome too .
Whilst I was staying with them , a missive was issued from the Holy See that had the effect of censoring Catholic institutions .
The Jesuits reading of it in their breakfast newspapers protested with the theological equivalent of two fingers .
" Rome 's a long way from Massachusetts , " I recall one saying . )
Theologians have contested Daly 's claims , not least feminist theologians who have remained within the Christian tradition .
They point out that alongside the male images of God as Father and Son are the more ambiguous ones of God as Spirit .
In the Hebrew Bible , the Spirit of God is envisaged as a wise woman , Sophia .
Sophia has even been aligned with the person of Christ : at the time of Jesus , she was well established as a symbol of God 's relatedness .
Paul links the figure of Wisdom with the person of Jesus in 1 Corinthians , arguing that this wisdom , from God , makes the wisdom of the world look foolish .
Moreover , it 's striking that Paul juxtaposes the true ( female ) wisdom with the faux - wisdom of ( male ) scholars , philosophers and wise men – arguably a proto - feminist move .
And yet , Jesus was a man .
The female word Sophia lost out to the male word Logos when it came to interpreting the metaphysics of the Son .
Daly moved on from Christianity too .
However , there is feminist juice in the Christian stories still , which she implicitly encouraged others to extract .
At the heart of the Christian story is the image of a dead man on a cross .
He is the victim of male violence – violence in which the God -Father was at least passively complicit .
" My God , My God , why have you forsaken me ? " the broken figure cries .
He is abandoned to the violence of men .
So , the story can be read as transgressive .
It 's both terrible and hopeful .
For a feminist believer , Jesus might be seen as queerly identified with suffering women , thereby offering the hope of redemption by disrupting the cycle of male violence .
It 's as if the perverse patriarchal ideal of " tender violence " , as Daly put it , collapses under the weight of its own hideous contradictions .
Daly might retort that this notion is even more objectionable : the story perpetuates women 's reliance on men , even for the alleviation of their suffering .
She was not one to let Christian patriarchy off the hook .
But at least this reading places responsibility for the violence squarely on the shoulders of men .
Daly has inspired a generation to pursue the possibility that Christianity has the capacity to root out its own patriarchy .
Many , many more people have shaped what video games are over the last 30 years , but far too many current generation gamers greet their names with vague recollection at best and more often a total sense of bamboozlement .
Time to put that right .
This is in no way an exhaustive list , but every person on it has had a major impact on the way you play games today .
I posted an article yesterday about Jean - Francois Jacques and his effect on Shawn Horcoff and Patrick O'Sullivan .
The final conclusion was that Jacques ' game is not suited to NHL play at this point .
He 's getting overwhelmed and he 's dragging his teammates down with him .
There were n't many comments on the article , but I did get a handful of emails , all in defense of Jacques ' play .
Most of them were of the " stats do n't tell the whole story " mindset , Only one particular reader that e-mailed me made a thought - out argument against the numbers .
He asked if Jacques was really playing that poorly because he really likes what Jacques brings to the team with his physical play .
" No other Oilers make the other team look over their shoulder and you can't quantify that , " he wrote .
His viewpoint is that the big hits create fear in the opponent and the effects of those hits change the entire game .
That may be true , but the rest of Jacques ' game is so thoroughly lacking , that it 's JFJ that should be looking over his shoulder -- to see if his pink slip is coming .
If opponents were afraid of Jacques , or perhaps changing their game because of Jacques , then their on - ice performance should slip and it would show in the numbers .
That 's not the case .
In fact , it 's the opposite in an extreme manner .
I used Vic Ferrari 's timeonice tool ( an excellent resource to explore the impact of shot data on the game ) to find Jacques ' effect on every single player on the roster this year .
The table below shows each player and their even strength shots ratio without Jacques compared to their even strength ratio with Jacques .
At the right is their even strength GF - GA on without and with Jacques .
The data leaves little to the imagination concerning Jacques ' on - ice effectiveness or lack thereof -- he 's not getting it done , and he 's bringing his linemates down a level or two .
Note : I 've left Cogliano , Potulny , Moreau , Penner , Stone and Comrie off of the list as Jacques has spent little to no time on the ice with that group .
Every single player on the team gets outshot while on the ice with Jacques .
Players that normally outshoot their opponents ( Horcoff , Hemsky , Gagner , Souray , Visnovsky ) see their ratios fall off , sometimes to a drastic measure , while on the ice with Jacques .
Players that are already being outshot ( Stortini , Staios , Grebeshkov , Chorney ) see their numbers plummet to downright misery when on the ice with Jacques .
Jacques is 24 year old now and healthy for the first time in years .
Perhaps his development has been stunted so badly that he 's going to need a year or two more to " get it " .
But the guy has 8 points in 94 games and by the above chart and other advanced stats is the worst player on the team , both traditional stats and advanced stats agree .
He should be in Springfield right now learning the game again .
I 'm sure that the Oilers do n't want to waive him because they feel that someone will scoop him up and give him another chance .
They 're probably right .
He 's a big guy with great feet -- he 'll keep getting chances until he 's 30 .
However , given the numbers that Jacques is leaving behind , the Oilers should be looking for a replacement - level player to replace Jacques this summer .
We can clearly " see what we have " and it 's time to get rid of it .

Atkinson says his family is more at risk from angry video gamers than outlaw motorcycle gangs .
The South Australian Attorney - General revealed in an interview aired last night that a " threatening note from a gamer " was placed under his door early one morning .
" I feel that my family and I are more at risk from gamers than we are from the outlaw motorcycle gangs who also hate me and are running a candidate against me , " he said on ABC TV's Good Game .
" The outlaw motorcycle gangs have n't been hanging around my doorstop at 2 am .
A gamer has . "
Mr Atkinson was involved in introducing tough new laws to outlaw bikie gangs in South Australia several years ago .
At the time he said politicians and public officials had to put themselves " on the line " to take the gangs on .
The comment on Good Game is the latest volley in a war of words between Mr Atkinson and people who support the introduction of an R18 + rating for video games .
Australia is the only Western country without an adult rating for games .
Mr Atkinson has been the most vocal opponent of introducing one and has the power to veto changes to the classification system .
Industry groups say an adult rating would help parents make better decisions about which games are appropriate for children , but Mr Atkinson disagrees .
He has previously referred to the campaign as akin to saying : " Give us more cruel sex and extreme violence ! "
However the attorney - general 's famously colourful rhetoric has n’t always hit the mark .
In 2004 Mr Atkinson told South Australian Parliament that bikies had used a park barbeque in his electorate to " cook a cat for human consumption " .
He was later forced to apologise .
The animal was not a cat , the incident happened at another location and bikies were n't involved .
On the record
Some of Mr Atkinson 's more memorable quotes on video games :
" Like other parents in Australia , I want to keep the threshold very high to try to protect ( children ) from being able to access computer generated pornography and violence . "
- Statement to The Advertiser newspaper , February 2008
" It was banned because in the course of the game , the player may use illegal performance - enhancing drugs for the members of his or her team . "
- Explaining why Blitz : The League was banned in a speech to South Australian Parliament in March 2008
" This game was banned because it promotes breaking the law by vandalising public buildings with graffiti . "
- Explaining why Getting Up : Contents Under Pressure was banned during the same speech
" I think you will find this issue has little traction with my constituents who are more concerned with real - life issues than home entertainment in imaginary worlds . "
- Letter to a member of the public who wrote to Mr Atkinson in support of an R18 + rating in November 2009
" I understand the Wii console has been phenomenally successful for Nintendo and that system provides many games to challenge and develop skill , physically and intellectually , without depraved sex , gore and cruelty . "

Congressional Republicans and Democrats have converged on the White House for a day long summit on healthcare reform with President .
If you thought that the Republicans would learn from the beating that Obama gave the House GOP when he spoke to them at their retreat a few weeks ago , you were wrong .
Republicans are still sticking to their talking while letting the president make the case for healthcare reform .
Obama opened the day with the hope that this event designed to be political theater would not become political theater .

So far , so good , let ’s see what the GOP ’s new strategy is courtesy of Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) :
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Alexander said , “ Now , you have presented ideas .
There ’s an 11 - page memo — I think it ’s important for the people to understand that there ’s not a presidential bill ; there are good suggestions and ideas on the web .
It ’s a lot like the Senate bill .
It has more taxes , more subsidies , more spending .
So what that means is , when it ’s written , it will be 2,700 pages , more or less .
It will probably have a lot of surprises in it .
It means it will cut Medicare by about half a trillion dollars and spend most of that on new programs , not on Medicare and making it stronger , even though it ’s going broke in 2015 .
It means there will be about a half trillion dollars of new taxes in it .
It means that for millions of Americans , premiums will go up , because when people pay those new taxes , premiums will go up , and they will also go up because of the government mandates .
It means that from a governor ’s point of view , it ’s going to be what our Democratic governor calls the ‘ mother of all unfunded mandates . ' ”
For good measure , Alexander threw in a let ’s start over again talking point , “ Our view , with all respect , is that this is a car that ca n’t be recalled and fixed , and that we ought to start over .
But we ’d like to start over . ”
The problem with repeating the same talking points is that the other side knows what ’s coming as evidenced by Harry Reid ’s opening remarks .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Reid said , “ It ’s obvious , we heard it .
Our Republican friends oppose our legislation , and that is your right , but also it becomes your responsibility to propose ideas for making it better , so if you have a better plan for making health insurance more affordable , let ’s hear it .
If you have a better plan for making health insurance companies more accountable , let ’s work on it …. ”
The healthcare summit has been a trap for Republicans , but it is a trap of their own creation .
As soon as they decided to stick to their talking points , they played right into President Obama ’s hands , because the issue being debated today is healthcare , but the larger political subtext is the obstructionism of the Republican Party .
Obama and the Democrats are laying the groundwork for an electoral strategy to the frame the Republicans as the Party of no ideas .
We have all heard this before .
The difference is that Obama and the Democrats have set out to expose the Republicans on day long national television .
If the Republicans were smart they would have at least shown up today willing to pay lip service to the notion cooperation , and maybe put a few new ideas on the table , but if Republicans were smart , they would be Democrats , so I was probably expecting too much from them .

The survey found there was some reluctance to report being raped A majority of women believe some rape victims should take responsibility for what happened , a survey suggests .
Almost three quarters of the women who believed this said if a victim got into bed with the assailant before an attack they should accept some responsibility .
One - third blamed victims who had dressed provocatively or gone back to the attacker 's house for a drink .
The survey of more than 1,000 people in London marked the 10th anniversary of the Haven service for rape victims .
More than half of those of both sexes questioned said there were some circumstances when a rape victim should accept responsibility for an attack .
Less forgiving
The study found that women were less forgiving of the victim than men .
Of the women who believed some victims should take responsibility , 71 % thought a person should accept responsibility when getting into bed with someone , compared with 57 % of men .
Elizabeth Harrison from Haven said there was never an excuse for forcing a woman to do something she did not want to .
" Clearly , women are in a position where they need to take responsibility for themselves - but whatever you wear and whatever you do does not give somebody else the right to rape you .

Rape victims ' views on blame " It 's important people take the time to actually look at what they are doing and make sure the person they are with is actually wanting to go ahead with what they are proposing . "
The survey also found more than one in 10 people were unsure whether they would report being raped to the police , and 2 % said they would definitely not do so .
The main reasons were being too embarrassed or ashamed ( 55 % ) , wanting to forget it had happened ( 41 % ) and not wanting to go to court ( 38 % ) .
Meanwhile , the survey suggested that many people are relaxed about their safety .
Almost half of people have walked home via side streets on their own .
One in five has been so drunk they have lost their memory , while one in five has got into a taxi without checking whether it is licensed .
Hardening attitudes
When asked about their own experiences , more than a third of those polled said they had been in a situation where they could have been made to have sex against their will .
Women are more likely to have been in this situation - 40 % compared to 20 % .
And one in five adults had been in a situation where they were made to have sex when they did not want to .
This had happened to more women ( 23 % ) than men ( 20 % ) .
It is depressing that people are still quick to blame the victim of rape rather than placing the responsibility where it actually belongs - squarely on the shoulders of the perpetrator
Kate Allen
Amnesty International
The online survey , titled Wake Up To Rape , polled 1,061 people aged 18 to 50 , comprising 712 women and 349 men .
An Amnesty International report five years ago found that a significant minority of British people laid the blame for rape at victims themselves .
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says this latest study suggests attitudes may have hardened .
And the findings may help explain why juries are reluctant to convict in some rape trials .
Amnesty International 's UK director Kate Allen said the new findings were " alarming but sadly not surprising " .
" It is depressing that , nearly half a decade later , people are still quick to blame the victim of rape rather than placing the responsibility where it actually belongs - squarely on the shoulders of the perpetrator , " she said .
" The government has announced that it will develop an ' integrated strategy ' to tackle violence against women and these findings are another reminder of how urgent this is and how proper training , support and resourcing will be vital in making it a reality . "
The Home Office said it had introduced a number of measures to the service provided to rape victims , including new police and prosecutors ' guidance , monitoring of services and funding for support for rape victims .
A spokeswoman said : " The government is determined to ensure that every victim has immediate access to the services and support they need so that more victims have the confidence to come forward and report these crimes and we can bring the perpetrators to justice . "

The media world is aflutter with recent revelations that Goldman may have facilitated Greece in creating an SPV that " rebalanced " budget payments via an interest rate swap arrangement , which the NYT describes as " a currency trade rather than a loan , [ which ] helped Athens meet Europe ’s deficit rules while continuing to spend beyond its means . "
For those curious to get a much more detailed perspective on the mechanics of not just this , but a comparable Goldman - facilitated transaction , we suggest the following article in Risk Magazine , which focuses on a similar prior deal completed over six years ago .
Yet we are fairly confident that all this barrage of information is merely a Houdini distraction act : the prospectus of the February 2009 securitization deal clearly delineates the mechanics of the deal ; it was full public knowledge .
Of course , a Europe gripped by sudden chaos due to their aggressive and quick " bail out " response with no regard for public backlash , is now taking full advantage of this recent " discovery " to make it seem that Greece and Goldman were hiding even more information : Bloomberg reports that " Greece was ordered by European Union regulators to disclose details of currency swaps it may have used to deal with the debts that threaten to swamp its economy . "
Germany 's CDU has gone one step further and claims that the " Goldman deal broke the spirit of Euro rules . "
Alas , this is nothing but more scapegoating while Europe tries to find its bearings and , if possible , back out of the bail out while finding more pretexts to throw Greece out of the euro zone entirely .
If it takes a Goldman smear campaign , so be it .
However , where the rub truly lies , and where things for Greece may get very hairy fairly quick , is in the interplay between the rating agencies and the rating of the Goldman underwritten swap agreement securitization SPV known better as Titlos PLC .
As one recalls , it was precisely the rating agencies that were the proximal catalyst that started the collateral call cascade that ultimately resulted in AIG 's failure and subsequent bailout ( ignoring for a moment the pent up toxicity on AIG 's books : both AIG then , and Greece now , are in deplorable shape : the question is what will bring it all to the surface ) .
So here are some recent facts :
On December 23 , 2009 , Moody 's downgraded Titlos , following the prior day 's downgrade of Greece itself from A1 to A2 with a negative outlook .
Fact : last week Moody 's said it could further downgrade Greece to Baa1 .
Fact : the Titlos PLC rating mirrors that of Greece itself .
Fact : according to Moody 's " Framework for De-Linking Hedge Counterparty Risks from Global Structured Finance Cashflow Transactions Moody 's Methodology " a counterparty can enter into a hedge transaction with an SPV and continue to participate in that transaction without collateralizing its obligations so long as it maintains a long - term senior unsecured rating of at least A2 .
When ( not if ) Titlos is downgraded again , and its rating drops below the A2 collateralization threshold , look for AIG 's margin call driven liquidity crisis escalation from the fall of 2008 to spread to Greece .
And that 's not all .
The Titlos SPV itself may be null and void should the rating of the National Bank of Greece , as the Hedge Provider , drop below a " relevant rating " as defined in the hedge agreement .
Should Greece then be forced , at Titlos ' option , to unwind the swap agreement , and be forced to cash out to the tune of € 5.4 billion ( net of the 107.54 issuance price ) , look for all hell to break loose .
Some background
On February 26 , 2009 , with Goldman Sachs as arranger , Titlos PLC , a Special Purpose Vehicle , issued € 5.1 billion of notes at 107.54 ( rated A1 by Moody's , no S&P rating ) to finance its purchase of swap rights from the National Bank of Greece ( NBG ) as part of a securitization transaction , whereby Titlos paid the NBG over € 5 billion in " novation consideration " , while at the same time effectuating a fixed / floating rate payment arrangement with the Hellenic Republic .
It is this last bit that has the panties of a collective Europe in a bunch , as the actual payments are not indicative of the " true " budgetary situation in Greece .
Keep in mind that the actual interest rate swap was closed , very much publicly , on December 31 , 2008 ( from the prospectus : On 31 December 2008 , the Hellenic Republic and NBG entered into an interest rate swap transaction governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association , Inc. ( " ISDA " ) ( Multicurrency – Cross Border ) 1992 Master Agreement dated as of 25 July 2005 . )
There is nothing hidden here .
The danger is elsewhere .
A graphic representation of the securitization arrangement from the prospectus is provided below .
It is oddly curious that the Titlos transaction prospectus , which until recently could be hyperlinked from the Greek National Bank 's website at the following location , has been mysteriously pulled .
Note that not only the prospectuses but also the investor reports for the other ( much more minor ) GNB securitization deals Eterika PLC and Revolver 2008 - 1 PLC are fully accessible and available on the GNB site ( and certainly worth the read ) .
Zero Hedge has retained a copy of the Goldman Sachs arranged Titlos deal prospectus , which is presented in full below ( we can provide pdf's upon request ) :
Those of you on a tight time schedule are in luck , for here is the summary version of the transaction courtesy of the only rating agency to have rated the deal ( A1 at issuance ) : Moody's .
In December 2008 , National Bank of Greece S.A. ( “ NBG ” ) ( Aa3 , Prime - 1 ) entered into an interest rate swap transaction with the Hellenic Republic ( the “ Hellenic Swap ” ) .
On the closing date , NBG novated the Hellenic Swap to the Issuer ( subject to certain amendments to its terms ) pursuant to a Novation Agreement .
The initial purchase price paid by the issuer under the Novation Agreement was equal to the issuance proceeds of the Notes .
At the same time , the Issuer entered into a Hedge Agreement with NBG comprising two swap transactions ( Swap 1 and Swap 2 ) , to exchange its cashflows from the Hellenic Swap for cashflows matching the interest and principal payments under the Notes plus a margin to cover the Issuer ’s on - going expenses .
And some additional summary deal details from Moody's :
Issuer established in the UK
The Issuer is established as a bankruptcy remote vehicle incorporated in the UK .
Novation Agreement
The rights and obligations of NBG under the Hellenic Swap were transferred by NBG to the Issuer by way of novation pursuant to a Novation Agreement between NBG , the Hellenic Republic and the Issuer .
The Issuer used the proceeds of the Notes to pay NBG the initial consideration for the novation .
The Issuer will also pay deferred consideration to NBG to the extent of excess funds on each interest payment date after all items ranking senior in the relevant priority of payments are paid in full .
Greek legal counsel has opined that the Novation Agreement is valid and enforceable and that , on the basis that NBG was solvent as at the time of the novation , the Issuer ’s rights under the Hellenic Swap could not be “ claw - backed ” following the insolvency of NBG .
Further , they have opined that the novation will not be re-characterised as a secured loan , despite the fact that NBG retains a right of re-novation ( see below ) .
Under the Novation Agreement , the Hellenic Republic has waived any right to set - off existing claims owing to it by NBG against its payments to the Issuer under the Hellenic Swap .
Further , the events of default and termination events in the Hellenic Swap with respect to the Issuer have been modified in accordance with Moody ’s Hedge Framework .
Here is the actual detail of the underlying swap : dear CDU and Angela Merkel - we are fairly confident that you can afford Moody 's as of circa February 2009 , to not sound quite so indignant :
Hellenic Swap
The Hellenic Swap between the Issuer and the Hellenic Republic has a fixed notional amount of Euro 5.5bn and is scheduled to terminate on 20 September 2037 .
The Issuer pays 4.50 % annually and the Hellenic Republic pays 6 Month Euribor + 6.6025 % semi annually .
The Hellenic Republic ( but not the Issuer ) is required to gross - up for any tax in relation to its swap payments .
In order to make scheduled payments to Noteholders , the Issuer relies on , among other things , the receipt of amounts payable to it under the Hellenic Swap .
Payments under the Hellenic Swap are due to be paid on the same date as the corresponding payments under the Notes , giving rise to a potential operational risk .
Hedge Agreement for Swap 1 and Swap 2
The Issuer has entered into a Hedge Agreement comprising two swap transactions with NBG as Hedge Provider .
Swap 1 has a fixed notional amount of Euro 5.5bn and is scheduled to terminate on 20 September 2037 .
Under Swap 1 , the Issuer exchanges a flow of floating rate receipts into a stream of fixed rate payments .
By virtue of payments under the Hellenic Swap and Swap 1 , the Issuer retains a net fixed amount semi-annually .
The Issuer uses such net amount to ( i ) make fixed payments under Swap 2 , ( ii ) make scheduled principal payments under the Notes and ( iii ) replenish the expenses reserve fund .
Swap 2 has a notional amount that tracks the amortising principal amount of the Notes and is scheduled to terminate on 20 September 2037 .
Under Swap 2 , the issuer makes fixed payments in exchange for floating amounts that equal the interest due under the Notes .
The Hedge Agreement complies with Moody ’s hedge de-linkage criteria for cash flow transactions1 .
Therefore Moody ’s has not modelled the impact of NBG ’s credit risk ( as Hedge Provider ) on the expected loss posed to investors .

Digging Deeper
So much for the smoke and mirrors .
Everything that Europe is now complaining about has been public for about one year .
Granted , it is extremely disingenuous of the entire European financial cavalry to bring attention to it now that they are looking for a scapegoat in backing out of the Greek rescue .
But that 's the headlines for popular consumption .
Reading between the lines reveals something quite nastier .
On Christmas Eve eve , with very little fanfare , Moody 's quietly downgraded not just Greece From A1 to A2 , but Titlos from A1 to A2 as well .
Paris , December 23 , 2009 -- Moody 's Investors Service has today downgraded to A2 from A1 the rating of the notes issued by Titlos plc .
This rating action follows Moody 's downgrade of the foreign and local currency ratings of the government of Greece to A2 from A1 on 22 December 2009 .
Moody 's rating for the Titlos plc transaction is linked to the rating of the the Greek government on a one - to - one basis .
Issuer : Titlos plc Downgraded to A2 from A1 ; previously Placed Under Review for Possible Downgrade on Nov 9 , 2009 .
This transaction , which closed in February 2009 , represents the securitisation of a swap agreement ( the Hellenic Swap ) originally entered into between the National Bank of Greece , S.A. ( NBG ) and the Greek government .
The issuer relies on payments by the Greek government under the Hellenic Swap in order to pay amounts falling due under the notes .
The issuer is also a party to two swaps ( the NBG Swaps ) entered into with NBG for the purpose or matching payments under the Hellenic Swap to payments of interest and amortising principal required under the notes .
On 22 December 2009 , NBG 's deposit and debt ratings were downgraded to A1 from Aa3 .
However , the NBG Swaps fully comply with Moody 's criteria for de-linking hedge counterparty risks from structured finance transactions and , therefore , the rating action in respect of NBG has not influenced the rating action on the notes .
The principal methodology used in rating and monitoring the transaction is " Framework for De-Linking Hedge Counterparty Risks from Global Structured Finance Cashflow Transactions " May 10 , 2007 , which is available on www.moodys.com in the Rating Methodologies sub - directory under the Research & Ratings tab .
Other methodologies and factors that may have been considered in the process of rating this issuer can also be found in the Rating Methodologies sub-directory on Moody 's website .
Further information on Moody 's analysis of this transaction is available on www.moodys.com.
So we decided to dig into Moody's " sub- directories " to pull this fabled " Framework for De- Linking Hedge Counterparty Risks from Global Structured Finance Cashflow Transactions " which is the golden grail on how Moody 's evaluates all structured finance transaction .
The full 46 page report can be found here for those who have gobs of time to sift through the definitions and trigger clauses .
Luckily , law firm Orrick ( anchor tenant of 666 Fifth Avenue which will soon be making some pretty serious waves in CMBS land when the property defaults , but that is a story for another day ) has provided a cliff notes version of the Moody 's report .
What immediately drew our attention is the definition that Moody 's gives for threshold eligibility for counterparty rating " without the need to collateralize the underlying obligations " :
The Moody ’s Criteria permits a hedge counterparty to enter into a hedge transaction with an SPV and continue to participate in that transaction without collateralizing its obligations so long as it maintains a long - term senior unsecured rating of at least A2 and a short - term rating of P - 1 ( or , if such hedge counterparty has only a long - term rating , at least A1 ) ( the “ Moody ’s First Trigger Required Ratings ” ) .
Unfortunately for Greece , one more downgrade of either Greece itself , or , much more relevantly , of Titlos , and here comes the collaterialization brigade , demanding excess collateralization margin sweeps .
For a country caught in a liquidity crunch , this is not a welcome development .
Images of a defunct AIG promptly come to mind .
Digging even deeper
In addition to the nightmare scenario of having to start posting collateral on Titlos , the even nightmarier scenario is that Titlos itself may well have the right to unwind the transaction if certain trigger thresholds are met .
Continuing from Orrick :
Within 30 business days of a downgrade of a Moody ’s rating to the Moody ’s First Trigger , the hedge counterparty is required to either ( i ) post the “ Moody ’s First Trigger Collateral Amount ” ( described below ) , ( ii ) obtain a guaranty from a guarantor rated not lower than the Moody ’s First Trigger Required Ratings , or ( iii ) transfer the hedge transaction at issue to a replacement hedge counterparty rated not lower than the Moody ’s First Trigger Required Ratings ( or to a replacement hedge counterparty that does not satisfy the Moody ’s First Trigger Required Ratings but is rated at least P - 2 and A3 ( or at least A3 if it has no long - term rating ) , provided that any such replacement hedge counterparty immediately posts collateral in an amount equal to the Moody ’s First Trigger Collateral Amount ) .
Within 30 business days of a downgrade of a Moody ’s rating to the Moody ’s Second Trigger , the hedge counterparty is required to post the “ Moody ’s Second Trigger Collateral Amount ” ( described below ) .
31 Also , within 30 business days of a downgrade to the Moody ’s Second Trigger , the hedge counterparty is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to either ( i ) obtain a guaranty from a guarantor rated above the Moody ’s Second Trigger , or ( ii ) transfer the hedge transaction at issue to a replacement hedge counterparty rated above the Moody ’s Second Trigger .
If the hedge counterparty fails to obtain such a guaranty or effect such a transfer within the thirty business day period , the Moody ’s Criteria requires that it continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to either obtain an eligible guaranty or identify an eligible replacement hedge counterparty for so long as it remains rated below the Moody ’s Second Trigger .
And the piece de resistance :
The Moody ’s Criteria requires that the SPV have the right to terminate the hedge transaction under either of the following circumstances : ( i ) the hedge counterparty is downgraded to the Moody ’s First Trigger and fails to take appropriate remedial action within the applicable grace period , or ( ii ) the hedge counterparty is downgraded to the Moody ’s Second Trigger and either ( A ) the hedge counterparty does not within the applicable grace period post the Moody ’s Second Trigger Collateral Amount and / or does not use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an eligible guaranty or to locate an eligible replacement hedge counterparty , or ( B ) the applicable grace period has expired , the downgraded hedge counterparty has not obtained an eligible guaranty or transferred the hedge transaction to an eligible institution and at least one eligible institution has submitted a “ live bid ” to replace the downgraded hedge counterparty .
If , in the last of these situations , the SPV cannot terminate the hedge transaction because no live bid from an eligible institution is available , it will become entitled to declare an early termination and replace the downgraded hedge counterparty at such time ( if any ) as a live bid is provided and the downgraded hedge counterparty will remain obligated until that time to post the Moody ’s Second Trigger Collateral Amount .
Our read of this data , and granted we are as far from conflicted Greek legal counsel or Moody 's as possible , is that should the barrage of downgrades persist in the adverse scenario where European leaders continue posturing and making it seem that all the bailout talk from last week was merely semantics , that Titlos will have the option to unilaterally unwind the swap following a green light from Moody's .
Ironically , it is precisely Moody 's which is doing all it can to prevent an additional notching of either Greece and , by implication , Titlos , and certainly of the Greek National Bank , as it is well aware of the margin scramble that would result , culminating with a feedback loop that could kill the actual securitization agreement , and force massive , formerly Greece - beneficial cash payments to be repaid .
And while there could be some " soft " interpretation of the rating threshold of the SPV , where there is complete lack of doubt is the rating threshold of Hedge Provider itself : the National bank of Greece ( at least initially ) .
To wit from the prospectus :
Hedge Provider NBG will be the initial Hedge Provider under the terms of the Hedge Agreement .
Specific early termination " Put " clauses :
Hedge Transactions under the Hedge Agreement may be subject to early termination by the Issuer in certain circumstances , including but not limited to : ( i ) the Hedge Provider being in default by reason of failure by such Hedge Provider to make payments ; ( ii ) the Hedge Provider being otherwise in breach of the relevant Hedge Agreement or having made certain misrepresentations ; ( iii ) the rating of a Hedge Provider being downgraded below the relevant rating (s ) specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement and the requisite remedial steps not being taken by the Hedge Provider as described in more detail in — Rating Downgrade or Withdrawal of the Hedge Provider " below ; ( iv ) certain insolvency - related or corporate reorganisation events affecting the Hedge Provider ; ( v ) any action being taken by a taxing authority or there being a change of relevant law or a merger of the Hedge Provider which results or will result in the Issuer receiving a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of tax ; or ( vi ) a change in law resulting in the illegality of the obligations to be performed by it under the Hedge Transaction .
And more troubling :
Rating Downgrade or Withdrawal of the Hedge Provider [ i.e. , Greek National Bank ]
In the event that the rating of the Hedge Provider is downgraded below the relevant rating (s ) specified in the relevant Hedge Agreement , then the Issuer has the right , subject to certain conditions , to terminate the Hedge Agreement unless the Hedge Provider , within the time period specified in the Hedge Agreement and at its own cost , takes certain remedial steps which may include : ( i ) providing collateral for its obligations in accordance with the terms of the Hedge Agreement ; or ( ii ) obtaining a guarantee of , or a co-obligor for its obligations under the Hedge Transactions from a third party whose ratings are equal to or higher than the ratings specified in the Hedge Agreement , where the terms of the Hedge Agreement so provide ; or ( iii ) novating all of its rights and obligations under the Hedge Transactions to a third party provided that such third party 's ratings are equal to or higher than the ratings specified in the Hedge Agreement ; or ( iv ) obtaining a confirmation from Moody 's that the then current rating applicable to the Notes will not be downgraded , suspended or withdrawn as a result of the downgrading of the Hedge Provider 's debt obligations .
Lastly , from the prospectus ' Risk Factors section :
Credit Risk on the Hellenic Republic
The ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of interest , principal and any other amounts due under the Notes depends ultimately upon the due performance by the Hellenic Republic of its obligations under the Hellenic Receivable .
Any failure on the part of the Hellenic Republic to pay amounts under the Hellenic Receivable as and when such payments become due could result in a default by the Issuer in payment of interest , principal or other amounts under the Notes .
In the event that the rating of the Hellenic Republic is downgraded by any rating agency , there is no requirement for the Hellenic Republic to post collateral or obtain a guarantee or co-obligor in respect of its obligations in respect of the Hellenic Receivable or to novate its rights and obligations under the Hellenic Receivable to a third party .
As a result , any downgrading of the Hellenic Republic may also result in a downgrading of the rating of the Notes notwithstanding that there may not have been any default by the Hellenic Republic under the terms of the Hellenic Receivable .
As well as this :
The Rating Agency may downgrade , suspend or withdraw its rating with respect to the Hedge Provider .
The Issuer expects under the terms of the Hedge Agreement that in such circumstances the Hedge Provider will be obliged to use reasonable efforts to novate the Hedge Transactions to a replacement Hedge Provider or post collateral to the Issuer or enter into other suitable arrangements .
However , there can be no assurance that the Hedge Provider will be able to find a replacement counterparty to enable it to novate the Hedge Transactions or that the Hedge Provider will be able to post collateral to the Issuer and / or enter into other suitable arrangements in this event or that the ratings of the Notes will not be downgraded , suspended or withdrawn in this event .
If any rating assigned to the Notes is downgraded , suspended or withdrawn , then the market value of the Notes may be reduced .
Indeed , all the inherent risks are there , laid out by Goldman 's legal crack team , black on white .
Where does the National Bank of Greece stand in the downgrade cascade ?
On December 23 , Moody 's downgraded the NBG from Aaa3 to A1 .
As pointed out previously , the threshold eligibility criteria is A2 .
Should Moody 's downgrade Greece to the first Trigger Rating of A3 or lower , let alone its threat to cut Greece to a whopping Baa1 , and all Special Purpose Vehicle bets are off .
Financial analysts are all too aware of the liquidity bottleneck which Greece faces in April and May when roughly € 8 billion in near - term bond maturities are due .
As it stands , absent a European " bail out " , in the form of guarantees or German banks directly purchasing Greek bonds , this maturity would be unfundable , precipitating the Greek default .
Should Titlos add another forced " put " option of over € 5.4 billion , and it is surely game over for Greec , starting the on , and , as this story has shown , much more importantly off , balance sheet contagion .
In conclusion , the real story from this weekend is not that Goldman arranged the Greek swap : this information has been public for almost a year , and making waves out of it merely demonstrates European hypocrisy in doing ( or at least saying ) one thing last week , and now promptly seeking to undo it ( and as to whether or not the Greek National Bank pulled the prospectus on purpose or this was merely a clerical error is not up to us to decide ) .
What is the real story , however , is that far from mere observable , on - balance sheet funding needs , Greek has suddenly found itself at the mercy of a Moody 's , whose just one additional notch down , would increase the funding needs by almost 40 % in addition to near term maturity requirements .
Score yet one more for the off - balance sheet securitization puzzle , so prevalent in our day and age , courtesy of Wall Street 's " innovation " masters - Goldman Sachs .
Later today : Just Who is Titlos Anyhow ?
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Monash University biochemists have found a critical piece in the evolutionary puzzle that explains how life on Earth evolved millions of centuries ago .
The team , from the School of Biomedical Sciences , has described the process by which bacteria developed into more complex cells and found this crucial step happened much earlier in the evolutionary timeline than previously thought .
Team leader and ARC Federation Fellow Trevor Lithgow said the research explained how mitochondria - the power house of human and other cells , which provide complex eukaryotic cells with energy and ability to produce , divide and move - were thought to have evolved about 2000 million years ago from primitive bacteria .
" We have now come to understand the processes that drove cell evolution .
For some time now the crux of this problem has been to understand how eukaryotes first came to be .
The critical step was to transform small bacteria , passengers that rode within the earliest ancestors of these cells , into mitochondria , thereby beginning the evolution of more complex life - forms , " Professor Lithgow said .
The team found that the cellular machinery needed to create mitochondria was constructed from parts pre-existing in the bacterium .
These parts did other jobs for the bacterium , and were cobbled together by evolution to do something new and more exciting .
" Our research has crystallised with work from other researchers around the world to show how this transformation happened very early on - that the eukaryotes were spawned by integrating the bacterium as a part of themselves .
This process jump - started the evolution of complex life much more rapidly than was previously thought . "
The research consisted of two components , the first used computers to read , compare
and understand DNA sequences .
From this , experiments were designed to do actual laboratory testing using a bacterium that is the closest living relative to the original ancestor of the mitochondria .
The research was published in the prestigious journal Science today .
Professor Lithgow said the latest findings were only made possible due to a gradual gathering of evidence within the scientific community and recent developments in genome sequencing .
" We can now " read " with great care and insight genome sequences - the complete DNA sequence of any organism .
From these sequences we find tell - tale clues to the past .
Our findings are relevant to all species , including the evolution of humans , " Professor Lithgow said .
" It continues to amaze that this theory , proposed in the century before the advent of molecular investigations , is so accurate on a molecular scale .
This improved understanding is directly relevant to the big picture timeline for the evolution of life . "
Professor Lithgow said the findings will be regarded by some scientists as controversial as many have long - held views on the process of evolution as a tinkerer .
" This will surprise and may even spark debate .
However our research compliments the basic rules of life .
Even at the molecular level , the rules of the game are the same .
Evolution drives biology to more and more complex forms , " Professor Lithgow said .

How I Think About Keynesian Economics By Arnold Kling
By the way , my panel appearance on jobs is now up on C - span ( I start about 45 minutes in .
Also , I saved some of my thoughts for the Q&A , which starts about 64 minutes in . )
In this post , I want to try to explain Keynesian economics to people who are inclined not to believe it .
That is , to people who think “ If the government spends money , it has to come from somewhere else , so Keynesian economics is just an example of fallacious reason that comes from observing the seen and ignoring the unseen . ”
It helps to think of economic activity as outsourcing .
That is , if you iron your own shirt , that is not economic activity .
If you outsource ironing by paying someone else to do it , that is economic activity .
If you eliminate ironing by buying permanent press shirts , that is also economic activity ( Nick and I call the cost - saving innovation Economics 2.0 ) .
A recession is a decline in economic activity .
People are not outsourcing as much as they did when the economy was booming .
Economists have noticed during this recession that global trade figures have plummeted .
Indeed .
That illustrates a decline in outsourcing , a decline in economic activity .
In Adam Smith ’s terms , the extent of the market has declined .
Not because of explicit trade barriers , but because …. well , I would say it is because the market needs to recalculate , but that is not a very Keynesian notion .
Keynes would have said it is because consumers are attempting to hoard , and businesses do not have the “ animal spirits ” needed to convert this hoarding into investment .
The thinking behind Keynesian economics is that when you are in a recession , if the government runs a bigger deficit , recipients of the money will want to increase their economic activity .
This will draw people out of non-market activity ( unemployment ) and into the market .
The newly - employed will want to outsource more of the satisfaction of their needs , and this will create a virtuous cycle ( the multiplier ) .
Imagine that all of us were chefs , each with a different specialty .
In good times , I patronize others ’ restaurants and other people patronize mine .
That is economic activity .
In a recession , for some reason we stop going out to eat .
I do n’t enjoy eating my own cooking every meal , but I do n’t think I can afford to go out .
Since I am not patronizing your restaurant , you think you have to cut back on eating out , also .
Economic activity declines .
Thinking about the economy in these terms , the idea of using government deficits to boost economic activity makes perfect sense to me .
The reason that I am doubtful about Keynesian policies today is that I think that recalculation is important .
Nobody , least of all the government , knows the best way to align the work force to satisfy needs .
The recalculation problem has to be solved gradually , by trial and error .
It is as if we had a bubble in Mexican restaurants , and now it is not clear whether they need to be replaced by more Indian food , more French - Asian fusion cooking , or whatever .
I do not think that central planners in Washington know the answer any better than the market .
So I am not confident that a Keynesian approach is going to get us very far this time .
Irish novelist and award - winning short story writer Julian Gough has launched a scathing attack on his country 's authors , describing them as " a pompous , provincial literary community " which has " become a priestly caste , scribbling by candlelight , cut off from the electric current of the culture " .
" We 've abolished the Catholic clergy , and replaced them with novelists .
They wear black , they preach , they are concerned for our souls .
Feck off , " said Gough , whose short story The Orphan and the Mob won the National Short Story prize in 2007 .
The author of novels including Juno and Juliet , about identical twin sisters , Gough grew up in Ireland but now lives in Berlin .
He said that he hardly ever read Irish writers any more , because he has been disappointed so often .
New , young writers mostly produce " grittily realistic , slightly depressing descriptions of events that are n't very interesting " , he wrote in what he described as an " intemperate rant " , posted on his website .
" Though , to be fair , sometimes it 's sub-Joycean , slightly depressing descriptions of events that are n't very interesting , " he added .
And it was n't only the new generation of Irish authors which came under attack from Gough .
" The older , more sophisticated Irish writers that want to be Nabokov give me the yellow squirts and a scaldy hole , " he said .
" If there is a movement in Ireland , it is backwards .
Novel after novel set in the nineteen seventies , sixties , fifties .
Reading award - winning Irish literary fiction , you would n't know television had been invented .
Indeed , they seem apologetic about acknowledging electricity ...
The only area where Irish writing is thriving in Ireland itself is on the internet , because it 's a direct connection , writer - to - reader .
Blogs captured , and capture , Ireland in a way literature no longer does . "
Sebastian Barry , the Irish author who won the 2009 Costa book of the year award for his novel The Secret Scripture , said that Gough was both " completely right and completely wrong " about Irish writing – but added that he himself would have said the same thing " word for word " 30 years ago .
" There is a feeling you want to clear out everything , and that 's what I 'm getting from it , " he said of Gough 's opinion , describing the author as " a very wonderful writer " .
" The piece is more about his state of mind – he wants to start building afresh , which is what he 's doing , " said Barry .
" If he 's in any way referring to me with his darker words , then so be it – next time I 'm in Berlin , he and I will have to sit down and have an Irish whiskey and an arm wrestle . "
The Booker prize - winning Irish novelist John Banville also agreed that Gough " has a point , or more than one point " , but added that " his notion that shouting the word ' feck ' – Father Ted has a lot to answer for – and being grossly scatological will make him seem echt Irish only harms his argument " .
" We who were born and continue to live in Ireland are always distressed by the stage - Irish antics so often to be encountered among the sons and daughters of the diaspora , " said Banville .
" But it is true , as the critic Declan Kiberd remarks , that no contemporary Irish writer has yet attempted the Great Irish Novel on social and political themes .
Where is our Middlemarch , our Doctor Zhivago , our Rabbit trilogy ?
The fact is Irish fiction tends to be poetic rather than prosaic , which is something that non-Irish reviewers find hard to grasp .
John McGahern used to say that there is verse and there is prose , and then there is poetry , and poetry can occur in either form , and that in Ireland it occurs more often in prose than in verse .
There may be a grittily realistic novelist even now writing a masterpiece such as Mr Gough says he longs for , and , if so , I applaud her / him . "
Although prize - winning Irish novelist Emma Donoghue said that " Roddy Doyle and Joe O'Connor have proved that there 's nothing ' backwards ' in writing about the past " , Paul Murray , another Irish writer whose second novel Skippy Dies has just been published , agreed with Gough that Irish writing was failing to tackle the modern world .
" It is disappointing when you read a young novelist who seems to make no effort at all to engage with modernity .
And it does happen , " said Murray .
" On the one hand I do believe authors should write what they want , on the other it is slightly disingenuous to ignore modernity , and it seems there is a danger that the Irish novel could become this nostalgic form where readers go to get images of priests and donkeys and so on . "
Gough said today that he was " fighting with one hand behind my back , because I have great respect " for writers such as Banville and Barry , but admitted that he does " want to arm wrestle " .
The " funeral - in - the - rain Irish novel " , he said , " does tend to win the Booker or the Costa " , but where , he asked , are the books dealing with the Irish experience over the last decade and a half ?
" Individual writers have n't necessarily lost their nerve , but they 're writing about eras which they 're more confident in – you see it in England too , with Amis going back to the 1970s , finding it hard to pin down the modern moment .
Some of the younger generation are still writing McGahern - esque stories , and for me that is missing the point of being an Irish writer , " he told the Guardian .
" The role of the Irish writer is not really to win prizes in Ireland ; their role historically has been to get kicked out of the country for telling the truth .
And there 's not quite enough of that going on .
Just when we need a furious army of novelists , we are getting fairly polite stuff published by Faber & Faber that fits into the grand tradition , " he continued .
" At the moment Ireland has one , massively developed , lyrical realism arm which is all biceps , and the other arm , the odd , freaky , tattooed arm , needs to be built up .
In a way I 'm trying to rally a few young writers around a flag which has n't been waved in a while .
You can't save the world with a novel , but it can put a tiny featherweight on the scales . "
A study in the March edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry senior - authored by Jerome C. Wakefield , a professor at the Silver School of Social Work at New York University with Mark Schmitz of Temple University and Judith Baer of Rutgers University , empirically challenges the effectiveness of psychiatrists ' official diagnostic manual in preventing mistaken , false - positive diagnoses of depression .
The findings concerning the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ' ( DSM ) criteria for diagnosing depression rebuts recent criticism of earlier research by Wakefield .
That earlier research suggested that misdiagnoses of depression are widespread , and touched off considerable controversy .
According to the DSM , the diagnosis of major depression requires the presence -- for two weeks -- of at least five possible symptoms out of a list of nine , which include , for example , sadness , loss of interest in usual activities , lowered appetite , fatigue , and insomnia .
However , these symptoms can also occur in normal responses to loss and stress .
False positive diagnoses occur when someone reacting with intense normal sadness to life 's stresses is misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder .
Recent studies suggest that a very large percentage of people have such symptoms for two weeks or longer at some point in their lives ; therefore , how many of these individuals really are afflicted by a mental disorder or are responding within normal limits to loss or stress has been a matter of debate .
The journal article examines the primary method by which the official diagnostic criteria for depression - the Clinical Significance Criterion ( CSC ) -- are supposed to distinguish normal from disordered cases and thereby prevent false positive diagnoses .
The CSC was added to the symptom and duration criteria in the DSM 's fourth edition in 1994 ( DSM - IV ) in the wake of criticism that too many of the listed symptoms -- loss of appetite , say , or sadness , insomnia , or fatigue -- were being identified as evidence of major depressive disorder even when they were mild and possibly normal responses to distress arising from such events as the loss of a job , the dissolution of a marriage , or other triggers for sadness , and that such errors might be contributing to the very high reported rates of untreated depression in the American population drawn from epidemiological surveys .
Under the 1994 DSM revision , in addition to the two weeks of sadness and other depressive symptoms , a specified minimal " clinically significant " threshold in the form of harm due to distress or role impairment ( in occupational , family , or interpersonal contexts ) must have resulted from the symptoms in evidence before they could be considered signs of depression .
Researchers have subsequently assumed -- without definitive evidence -- that the CSC eliminates substantial numbers of false positives .
In a 1999 article in American Journal of Psychiatry , Wakefield and co-author Robert Spitzer , the originator of the modern DSM symptom - based approach to diagnosis , argued that the CSC would not eliminate false - positive diagnoses of major depression because anyone having the specified symptoms -- even an individual experiencing a normal intense reaction to loss -- would be likely to experience distress or role impairment .
Thus , they asserted , the CSC was redundant with the symptom criteria and could not distinguish normal from disordered symptoms -- a claim that has come to be known as the " redundancy hypothesis . "
The researchers ' argument was purely conceptual , and largely ignored .
The issue of whether the redundancy hypothesis is correct became suddenly more important after Wakefield senior - authored a much - discussed 2007 article in Archives of General Psychiatry .
The article argued that there were indeed large numbers of false - positive diagnoses of major depression in community surveys of mental disorder -- possibly as high as 25 % to 33 % .
However , that study used data from a national survey that was conducted before the DSM - IV 's addition of the CSC to the major depression diagnostic criteria .
Thus , there was no CSC in the criteria that Wakefield and his team used to identify cases of major depression at the time .
Critics of that study argued that the lack of a CSC was fatal to the argument because if the CSC had been used , then the supposed false - positive diagnoses that Wakefield and his group identified would likely have been eliminated as cases too mild for diagnosis .
For example , one noted psychiatrist argued that Wakefield 's results were due to a " glitch " in the diagnostic criteria Wakefield used , and that the diagnosed individuals identified by Wakefield as having normal reactions would have been eliminated from the depression category if current diagnostic criteria including the CSC were used .
A paper later submitted by Wakefield that built on the 2007 article was rejected for publication partly based on a reviewer 's assertion that if the CSC had been included in the earlier study , the supposed false positives likely would have been eliminated .
So , the issue of whether the CSC is in fact redundant or actually eliminated many false - positive major depression diagnoses became key to the debate , which is still ongoing , about the prevalence of depressive disorder .
The latest study , coming in the American Journal of Psychiatry , offers an empirical demonstration , based on nationally representative data , that the Critical Significance Criterion fails to distinguish normal from disordered conditions .
In this analysis , Wakefield undertook to evaluate independently the impact of the CSC on epidemiological survey estimates of major depressive disorder by using data from a later survey that included a carefully worked out CSC criterion for depression whose inclusion , according to the claims of its authors , was an effective way of eliminating former false positives .
Wakefield then compared estimates of depressive disorder with and without the use of the CSC .
Confirming the redundancy hypothesis put forward a decade earlier , he found that the CSC eliminated virtually no one from diagnosis -- in fact , even among those who experienced prolonged sadness without meeting other diagnostic criteria for depression , about 94 % of them satisfied the CSC just on the basis of the " distress " component alone .
Thus the Clinical Significance Criterion , according to Wakefield and his co-authors , is not doing what it is supposed to do -- reducing the over - diagnosis of normal mood fluctuations as depression -- and the issue of preventing false positives needs to be revisited .
And contrary to critics ' speculations , the earlier findings suggesting many false positives in community surveys cannot be dismissed on the basis of the CSC .
The results take on further importance , Wakefield says , in light of proposals for changes to the DSM in a revision currently taking place that will lead to DSM - V.
Concern about increasing false positives is at the heart of criticisms of the proposals that have been put forward by leading psychiatrists , including Allen Frances , the Editor of DSM - IV .
Moreover , some of the proposals seem to rely heavily on the CSC to justify diagnosis of disorder even when symptoms are minimal -- when in fact the current research underscores that normal distress can easily satisfy the CSC .
Do n’t Forget These Home Office Tax Deductions
In the last 10 years , the use of home offices has exploded .
From telecommuting to running a home business , millions of people are making use of a home office .
The good news is that you can actually take tax deductions for the use of a home office .
It used to be that the IRS would red flag people for taking these deductions , sometimes resulting in the increased chance of an audit , but with so many people working from home now , thanks to technology , just taking these deductions will no longer mark you out .
But you still need to be careful , since the IRS wants to make sure that your home office is being used for business purposes .
Qualifying for home office deductions
In order to qualify for home office deductions , you have to use the space in your home , or the deducted supplies and items , for regular and exclusive business purposes .
There are some exceptions for storing inventory that you sell , or running an in - home daycare , but , for the most part , you have to use the area you are deducting , and the items you are deducting , for business purposes only .
Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that if you telecommute , working for someone else , you cannot take deductions for items or space that you are being reimbursed for .
If your employer is covering some of the costs related to the home office , you cannot deduct those costs on your taxes .
Possible home office tax deductions
Here are some of the items that you might be eligible to deduct on your taxes :
Percentage of your mortgage interest ( do n’t double deduct this , though , on Schedule A if you itemize ) .
Percentage of your home property taxes .
Percentage of your rental payments if you do n’t own .
Percentage of utilities you pay .
Percentage of Internet costs , based on how much of the usage is for your business .
Percentage of repairs , maintenance and painting for your home .
Percentage of renter ’s or homeowner ’s insurance .
Costs related to a dedicated business phone line in your home office .
Buying a computer .
Depreciation on home office equipment .
Office supplies ( such as pens , paperclips , furniture , etc. , as long as they are used only for your home business ) .
Mileage traveled on behalf of the business or work ( as long as it is n’t reimbursed ) .
Some qualifying travel and meal expenses .
Cost of subscription to trade publications that enhance your ability to perform your work , or run your business .
Cost of cell phone use for work , as long as your employer does n’t reimburse you .
Some job training to help you remain competitive and of use to your employer ( as long as it is n’t paid for by the employer ) .
As you can see , there are a number of possibilities for tax deductions when you have a home office .
You should double check to ensure that you are taking your deductions properly , and a tax professional using corporate tax software can help with this if you are unsure .
Remember that online tax software , and even tax professionals , can make mistakes , so double check .
If you have a question , do n’t hesitate to ask a professional , or even contact the IRS , whose customer service department can give you straight from the source .

Lost Update Season IV 05/22/2008
As promised , the Grassy Knoll Institute is ready to explain the mysterious Jacob , the old man that lives in the cabin .
The same man that Ben takes orders from .
The same old man that seems to have powers beyond our comprehension .
The answer to this mysterious entity can only be found in the Twilight Zone .
For those not familiar with the Twilight Zone , it was a science fiction television program created by Rod Serling that aired in the late 1950 ’s and early 1960 ’s with each episode exploring outlandish events and ending with a twist .
Tonight ’s Lost update will explore the 1963 Twilight Zone episode titled , The Old Man In The Cave .
You will quickly see the relevance and similarities between Lost and the Zone .
As usual , we will start with the Prologue .
( How each Twilight Zone episode began )
Prologue :
You unlock this door with the key of imagination .
Beyond it is another dimension – a dimension of sound , a dimension of sight , a dimension of mind .
You ’re moving into a land of both shadow and substance , of things and ideas .
You ’ve just crossed over into the Twilight Zone .
Next came the opening Monologue by Serling himself .
Opening Monologue :
What you ’re looking at is a legacy that man left to himself .
A decade previous he pushed his buttons and , a nightmarish moment later , woke up to find that he had set the clock back a thousand years .
His engines , his medicines , his science were buried in a mass tomb , covered over by the biggest gravedigger of them all : a bomb .
And this is the Earth ten years later , a fragment of what was once a whole , a remnant of what was once a race .
The year is 1974 , and this is the Twilight Zone .
Story Synopsis :
In a thinly populated town set in 1974 , ten years after a nuclear war , survivors of the town discover some canned food and other supplies .
As hungry and desolate as they are , they do n’t eat the food .
Instead they wait for the old man in the cave to tell them if the food is fit to eat or contaminated with radiation .
One time they did n’t listen to the old man and the townsfolk planted crops where he said not to .
( Contaminated soil )
The harvest turned out to be a bitter one leaving them with little food to survive on .
They learned the hard way to wait for an answer from the old man , and from Goldsmith .
( The towns leader ) Goldsmith was the only man who went to the cave to talk to the old man and waited on his word whether or not to plant or eat .
As usual , Goldsmith took a can of food with him to the cave and returned a short time later .
Goldsmith said the old man declared the food unfit to eat and for it to be destroyed immediately .
Just as the people were ready to destroy the food , a group of renegade soldiers pulled into town .
They started asking questions on who was in charge , did they have any food , water , supplies , gas .
When the towns people said they had no food it angered the soldiers for they saw the crates of food that were deemed unfit to eat by the old man in the cave .
The soldiers asked who the old man was , and did anyone ever see him , how they knew he was alive , and tried to make the towns people believe he did n’t exist .
That he was made up by Goldsmith so he would always be in control of the town .
To prove their point , the soldiers went to the cave and called the old man out .
Goldsmith told them that he is the only one that sees and talks to the old man .
The soldiers stormed the cave and instead of finding the old man , they find a computer .
Goldsmith was using the computer to analyze the food and soil to see if it was contaminated or not .
The towns people got angry , and as a mob , destroyed the computer and decided to eat the food .
All the people for the first time in a long time got their fill of food including the soldiers .
They all shunned Goldsmith as he was the only one who did n’t partake in the food .
The next morning , all the towns people and soldiers are dead laying in the street and yards , killed by contaminated food they ate the previous night .
Goldsmith was the only one left alive .
Epilogue :
Mr. Goldsmith , survivor , an eye witness to man ’s imperfection , an observer of the very human trait of greed and a chronicler of the last chapter — the one reading ‘ suicide ’ .
Not a prediction of what is to be , just a projection of what could be .
This has been the Twilight Zone .
Go ahead , take a breather .
I ’ll let it all sink in .
Let me know when you are ready to continue .
( tick , tock , tick tock , all the time I need )
Before we begin comparing the Old Man in the cave and the Old Man in the cabin , lets look at what this Twilight Zone episode was about .
The story is set in a post nuclear war future , the human race almost completely destroying itself .
As fate would have it , the survivors finish the job that nuclear war started by a lack of faith , greed , and a dependence on technology that may lead them to ruin one day .
Onward to the comparisons of this Twilight Zone and Lost .
This Twilight Zone episode depicts isolated survivors from a horrific event .
Lost begins with a horrific plane crash leaving a small group of survivors stranded on an unknown island .
This Twilight Zone episode has the people relying on Goldsmith , the town leader , for survival , guidance and direction .
The Lost castaways also rely on Jack for the same .
But when Ben is introduced , he becomes the focal point , the man in charge , with their very lives hanging in the balance .
In the Twilight Zone episode , people found food and wondered if it was good to eat .
The Lost castaways also found food in the jungle with Dharma decals all over it and wondered the same , if the food was good to eat .
In the Twilight Zone episode , the townspeople were arguing about what to do , how to proceed .
There was a distinct split of opinion between them .
So can be said about the Lost castaways .
In fact , they split into two groups as some decide to stay on the beach and the rest moved further inland .
In the Twilight Zone episode , only Goldsmith sees and talks to the old man in the cave .
On Lost , only Ben sees and talks to Jacob , the old man .
in the Twilight Zone episode , the old man lives in a cave .
Is mysterious , intelligent .
On Lost , the old man lives in a cabin .
Is mysterious , intelligent .
In the Twilight Zone episode , what Goldsmith tells the people is the law , handed down by the old man .
No one questions that authority .
On Lost , Ben commands the people , handed down by Jacob , the old man in the cabin .
In the Twilight Zone episode , renegade soldiers enter the town with an agenda all their own .
On Lost , renegade soldiers land on the island from the freighter with an agenda all their own .
In the Twilight Zone episode , the towns people force Goldsmith to reveal who the old man in the cave is .
On Lost , the castaways force Ben to reveal who Jacob , the old man in the cabin , is .
In the Twilight Zone episode , the townspeople revolt against Goldsmith and the old man in the cave .
On Lost , the castaways revolt against Ben and Jacob .
In the Twilight Zone episode , all the townspeople died failing to heed the warning by the old man leaving only Goldsmith alive .
On Lost , Ben was the only survivor as all the “ Others ” were killed .
Seems to be going in the same direction once again with the new castaways .
For the Twilight Zone episode , the twist of the episode was that the old man was not a man , but a computer used by Goldsmith to analyze soil and food for contamination .
The computer , or old man , kept the townspeople alive .
On Lost , it has yet to be revealed who Jacob , the old man in the cabin , really is .
And , it appears that Jacob is being used by Ben to keep the castaways alive , using Jacob ’s knowledge to hide the island , control the smoke monster , and defeat the renegade soldiers .
Twilight Zone episode , a look into the near future and the horrors of man being left to his own vices , and devices .
Annihilation of the planet and human race .
Goldsmith was attempting to keep humanity alive and rekindle it ’s spirit .
He failed .
On Lost , perhaps Ben is attempting the same .
Wide speculation has it that the Hanso corporation and Dharma Initiative are involved in time travel , genetics , and several other medicines strange to a private group and island .
I think this is the part where Rod Serling appears on screen saying , “ Submitted for your approval ” and explains the evenings offering .
After watching the pilot episode of Lost way back in 2004 , I formulated two theories , Virtual reality experimentation which is the main theme of this section or a remake of the Twilight Zone .
For tonight only , staying in theme with the Twilight Zone , Lost is a modern day remake of the Twilight Zone .
Each and every week , Lost mirrors a unique Twilight Zone episode sans the Rod Serling narration .
Each week , the Lost characters confront their inner most demons , horrific events , twists of fate , and supernatural entities just as the original Twilight Zone episodes did .
One final tidbit .
The Twilight Zone was written allowing the audience to be privy to supernatural events unfolding on the screen but at the end , twisted the story offering a logical natural explanation leaving it up to the viewer to decide .
Until next weeks season IV finale , Get Lost !

LURKING ON THE GRASSY KNOLL
It all began on the road to Milwaukee for an Inventory reading / signing .
Keith warned Scott and me that we should make mix -CDs for the trip , or we would be forced to listen to the only CD he had in his car : volume three of NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
Scott and I failed to heed Keith ’s call , however , so on the ride home , we were transported back to the bygone era of 1999 .

We had unwittingly hopped onboard a musical time machine ; seemingly the sum of pop music in the late ’90s was represented on one magical disc , from the Latin explosion ( Enrique Iglesias ’ “ Bailamos ” ) that briefly alerted the public to the existence of something called “ Latinos ” to obnoxious nü-metal rap-rock ( Limp Bizkit ’s “ Nookie ” ) to the song that appeared in every movie trailer that year ( Smash Mouth ’s “ All Star ” ) .
For the first time in forever , we were forced to contemplate what I contend is the single worst song ever written , Blessid Union Of Souls ’ “ Hey Leonardo ( She Likes Me For Me ) . ” ( Runner - up : 4 Non Blondes ’ “ What ’s Up ? ” )
“ Hey Leonardo ( She Likes Me For Me ) ” is three and a half minutes of pure cheese that functions as the Date Movie of late - ’90s novelty songs , a never - ending string of groan - inducing pop-culture references ( Tyson Beckford , The Cable Guy , Fargo , Dirty Harry , Steve Buscemi ) masquerading as entertainment .
All you really need to know about the song is that it features these immortal lines :
She likes me for me
Not because I sing like Pavarotti
Or because I ’m such the hottie
I like her for her
Not because she ’s phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
The 18 songs on volume three of NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
function as one possible history of the past 13 years in pop .
And like most histories , it ’s written by the winners .
The dominant word in the series title is “ now ” :
These compilations exist forever in the present tense .
So it felt almost heretical to listen to it 10 years after the fact .

So I thought it would be interesting , edifying , and , yes , even a little arousing to listen to the entire NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
series in chronological order to see what the albums say , individually and collectively , about the way music has evolved and devolved , and to explore some of the weirder and more obscure nooks and crannies of pop culture .
With that in mind , I ’m introducing a new feature called THEN That ’s What They Called Music ! a.k.a.
“ NOW That ’s What I Call Music Revisited . ”
Each entry will tackle a disc in the series .
We ’re about to embark on a journey that will take us from Cherry Poppin ’ Daddies to Drake , from Imajin to Lady Gaga .
But enough preamble .
Let ’s get to the music !
’ Cause is n’t that what the bestselling NOW compilations are all about ?
It ’s even in the title , along with an exclamation point that lets you know that the people behind this disc mean business , that they ’re dead fucking serious about sharing the music of Marcy Playground and Aqua with the world .

I come both to bury pop music and to praise it .
Listening to the first few CDs in the NOW series , I was continually impressed by the craftsmanship found in even the most disposable pop songs .
Though the sentiments expressed in the lyrics are often comically banal , the tracks themselves are shiny little masterpieces of pop production , filled with neat little details and flourishes .
Take the song that kicks off the NOW series ’ first disc , drawn from the years 1997 and 1998 : Janet Jackson ’s “ Together Again . ”
It ’s possibly the peppiest song ever written about a friend dying of AIDS .
It ’s musical Prozac that bops merrily along , driven by one of those ubiquitous four - on - the - floor disco beats and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ’ silky smooth production .
( Dig those celestial harps ! )
The cotton - candy R&B found in the NOW collections frequently comes off as generic , but Jackson invests plenty of herself in the song .
The same ca n’t be said about the next track , Backstreet Boys ’
“ As Long As You Love Me , ” a robo - ballad so achingly bland that I had to come up with an elaborate backstory for it just to avoid falling asleep .
So I decided it was really about a young paranoid schizophrenic promising his object of desire that he loves her , even though she ’s currently in a mental hospital for the criminally insane , after stabbing a hobo with a crude shiv .
The theme of mental illness and isolation from the outside world is established in the very first line , “ loneliness has always been a friend of mine . ”
In case that was n’t explicit enough , just a few lines later , the fellows confess , “ People say I ’m crazy and that I am blind . ”
Backstreet Boys repeatedly assure their lover that they do n’t care about “ what is written in your history ” ( i.e. her file at the mental hospital ) , that they do n’t care who she is ( a hobo - killing convict ) , where she is ( in a mental hospital for the criminally insane ) or what she did ( murder that hobo for no good reason ) , as long as she reciprocates their lunatic affection .

The smorgasbord of genres , artists , and tones found on NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
volume one has a curious leveling effect .
Within the series ’ nothing - but - hits , all - killer - no - filler , short - attention - span world , it does n’t matter if a song comes from Harvey Danger — a smartass pop-punk outfit with a lead singer whose vocal style can best be described as “ Nyah , nyah , nyah ! ” — or from an evil boy - band genius like Lou Pearlman .
If you ’re on NOW That ’s What I Call Music ! , you ’re a hitmaker .
You performed a song that resonated with the public ; that ’s all that matters .
Advertisement
A strange spirit of musical democracy pervades the CD .
It ’s a curious world where one - hit wonders like Marcy Playground breathe the same rarified air as Janet Jackson and Radiohead .
For a brief period , they were peers , at least where Billboard and NOW That ’s What I Call Music ! is concerned .
Part of the train - wreck fascination of NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
involves seeing familiar songs in bizarre new contexts .
To cite volume one ’s most extreme example , Radiohead ’s “ Karma Police ” is sandwiched between Aqua ’s “ Barbie Girl ” and Everclear ’s “ I Will Buy You A New Life . ”
Advertisement
Aqua and Radiohead do n’t seem to inhabit the same universe , but here they improbably share the same bestselling disc .
Actually , the series does n’t re-contextualize songs so much as it de-contextualizes them .
NOW throws the sum of pop music in a blender , then serves it up straight .
Somewhere , somehow , the man , woman , or computer who programmed the compilation ascertained that of course Radiohead should follow a bizarre novelty song positing Barbie as a vacuous Euro party girl !
It just makes sense !
( To be fair , the demo version of “ Karma Police ” does prominently feature the line “ Come on , Barbie , let ’s go party ! ” so maybe that ’s where they saw the connection . )
Remember the swing revival of the late ’90s ?
No ?
Me neither .
I had blotted it out of my memory until NOW 1 cruelly resurrected traumatic memories of the swing class I took as a college senior , which involved Cherry Poppin ’ Daddies ’ “ Zoot Suit Riot , ” a song so doggedly generic , its melody was probably found on a Casio under the setting “ Upbeat Swing Song . ”
There ’s a good reason history has forgotten so many of these songs : NOW is a Whitman ’s Sampler of crap .
Cringe at the overwrought bleating of Tonic ’s “ If You Could Only See . ”
( That song embodies a vocal style my old editor Stephen Thompson used to call “ Hunger Dunger Dang , ” because it always sounded like they were moaning those sounds in a depressed haze . )
Recoil in horror at the lazy aggregation of purloined riffs and rock - dinosaur attitude that is Lenny Kravitz ’ “ Fly Away , ” which begins with the lines “ I wish that I could fly into the sky / So very high just like a dragonfly . ”
And just try to listen to Aqua ’s “ Barbie Girl ” without losing a few brain cells .
In college , I worked at a Goodwill store where the radio was always tuned to the adult contemporary station .
During that time , I became disproportionately grateful for George Michael ’s “ Fastlove . ”
It is n’t the kind of thing I ’d seek out on my own , but in the midst of endless maudlin ballads , its clean , infectious pop songcraft was like manna from heaven .
Advertisement
I felt the same way about NOW tracks like Hanson ’s “ MMMBop ” and Spice Girls ’ “ Say You ’ll Be There , ” the latter a “ Wannabe ” knock - off , but a good one .
For those too young to remember , Hanson was an Iowa teen group featuring a pretty girl singer , a bassist who looked like a yeti , and a drummer who was actually a sentient fetus .
But they wrote some fucking catchy songs , and their producers , the Dust Brothers , shined them to a fine gloss .
I listened to the first installment of NOW That ’s What I Call Music ! with nostalgia and dread .
I was revisiting parts of my past ( and pop culture ’s past ) that I had long forgotten .
It seemed to capture a pop realm fragmenting into a thousand little niches , but I do n’t know whether that says more about the era the compilation documents , or the nature of compilations like NOW That ’s What I Call Music !
that are all breadth and zero depth in their approach to archiving pop history as it happens .

Living inside NOW
That ’s What I Call Music ! for a good week was an immersive exercise in cheap nostalgia , but my journey has just begun .
The American NOW That ’s What I Call Music series runs to 33 volumes ( not counting all the special sidebar discs and the longer - running UK series ) , so we ’ve got 32 more entries in this series to go .
Next up in THEN That ’s What They Called Music : NOW Vol. 2 , the disc that finally brings together the jailbait pop wizardry of Britney Spears , The New Radicals , the existential wisdom of someone who is not Baz Luhrmann , and Fatboy Slim .

A new study in the journal Auk finds evidence that mercury contamination can modify the singing behavior of birds .
Kelly Hallinger and fellow researchers from William and Mary 's Cristol Lab recorded and analyzed bird songs from four species at sites along the mercury - contaminated South River in Virginia .
They also studied birds of the same species at nearby uncontaminated sites .
The researchers found that for three of the species - the Carolina wren , house wren , and song sparrow - songs at the contaminated sites contained a lower diversity of note types and were sung at lower tonal frequencies .
Furthermore , both species of wren tended to sing shorter songs at the polluted sites .
These behavior changes could have negative consequences for avian populations .
The study authors write :
" Because song plays a critical role in both mate attraction and territory defense , contaminant - induced changes … could severely depress male reproductive success .
Song is therefore a potent mechanism through which contaminants such as mercury could affect fitness . "
The study offers several possible explanations for the differences in birdsongs at mercury - contaminated sites :
1 ) Mercury contaminated birds may suffer impairment in hearing high frequencies which in turn could cause them to preferentially sing lower notes - similar auditory impairment has been found in monkeys exposed to mercury .
2 ) Mercury could cause stress during song learning .
This would make sense given that the fourth species examined in the study , the eastern phoebe , did not exhibit differences in singing at the contaminated and reference sites .
Unlike the other three birds , scientists believe that the phoebe does not learn songs but rather is predisposed to sing certain patterns .
3 ) Contaminated birds might be in poorer condition and therefore sing in a way that is easier for them to perform .
4 ) Other factors incidentally associated with the contaminated site could be causing the differences .
However , the authors do not believe that this is the case .
They collected data on surrounding land cover and found no difference between contaminated and reference sites .
This study adds to the growing body of work showing that environmental contaminants can have sub-lethal negative impacts for species .
On the positive side , the findings indicate that if we listen closely enough , bird songs may give us a heads - up , warning about contamination issues in a particular area .
The researchers write ,
" Song may be a more sensitive indicator of environmental stress than tissue samples , which are traditionally used to evaluate contaminant effects , because song is the result of a combination of complex behavioral and physiological pathways . " ﻿

When is the NHL going to stop being stubborn and realize the three point game is bad for hockey ?
It does n't make sense that in the same night they can award two points in some games and three in others and yet it happens .
The 2010 Winter Olympic hockey tournament is using a different system to run their tournament .
They are awarding three points for a regulation win , two points for an overtime or shootout win , one point for an overtime or shootout loss and zero points for a regulation loss .
A couple of games went to overtime and the point system altered the standings considerably .
If the tournament was using the NHL point system , Canada would have been a number four seed and would have had a first round bye .
This is a three game tournament and just a couple of points make a world of difference .
Over the course of an 82 game schedule the standings may not be altered too much .
I was surprised to find out that the standings would be altered quite considerably .
Many teams would be in the very same position but others swapped spots .
It affected the lower playoff seeds more than it did the top seeds .

The 1 - 6 seeds in the Eastern Conference remained the same while big changes happened the rest of the way down the standings .
It will be interesting to see how the standings finish at the end of the season but I have a feeling that some teams will make the playoffs that should n't actually be there .

The Western Conference does n't have the same shakeup in the standings as the Eastern Conference had .
Still the experiment shows me that the NHL should change to this point system .
It will not alter the standings too much but it will eliminate the " three - point game " .
This system would allow three points in all games instead of only some games .
MIAMI , Fla . —
In her 88 years , Florence Siegel has learned how to relax : A glass of red wine .
A crisp copy of The New York Times , if she can wrest it from her husband .
Some classical music , preferably Bach .
And every night like clockwork , she lifts a pipe to her lips and smokes some marijuana .
Long a fixture among young people , use of the country ’s most popular illicit drug is now growing among the AARP set , as the massive generation of baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s and ’70s grows older .
The number of people aged 50 and older reporting marijuana use in the prior year went up from 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent from 2002 to 2008 , according to surveys from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .
The rise was most dramatic among 55 - to 59 - year - olds , whose reported marijuana use more than tripled from 1.6 percent in 2002 to 5.1 percent .
Observers expect further increases as 78 million boomers born between 1945 and 1964 age .
For many boomers , the drug never held the stigma it did for other generations , and they tried it decades ago .
Some have used it ever since , while others are revisiting the habit in retirement , either for recreation or as a way to cope with the pains of aging .
Siegel walks with a cane and has arthritis in her back and legs .
She finds marijuana helps her sleep better than pills ever did .
Advocates for legalizing marijuana say the number of older users could represent a shift in their push to change the laws .
The drug is credited with relieving many problems of aging : aches and pains , glaucoma , macular degeneration and so on .
Patients in 14 states make use of medical marijuana laws , but those elsewhere are breaking state law when they use the drug to ease their conditions .
Among them is Perry Parks , 67 , of Rockingham , N.C. , a retired Army pilot who suffered crippling pain from degenerative disc disease and arthritis .
He had tried all sorts of drugs but found little success .
About two years ago he turned to marijuana .
" I realized I could get by without the narcotics , ” Parks said , referring to prescription painkillers .
Age increases risks
There ’s also the risk that health problems already faced by older people can be exacerbated by regular marijuana use .
Older users could be at risk for falls if they become dizzy , smoking it increases the risk of heart disease and it can cause cognitive impairment , said Dr. William Dale , chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the University of Chicago Medical Center .
He said he ’d caution against using it even if a patient cites benefits .
" There are other , better ways to achieve the same effects , ” he said .
Pete Delany , with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , said boomers ’ drug use defies stereotypes .
" As a nation , it ’s important to us to say , ‘ It ’s not just young people using drugs , it ’s older people using drugs . ’ ”
In conversations , older marijuana users often say they smoke in less social settings than when they were younger , frequently preferring to use the drug privately .
I have often recommended file - scanning services like VirusTotal and Jotti , which allow visitors to upload a suspicious file and scan it against dozens of commercial anti-virus tools .
If a scan generates any virus alerts or red flags , the report produced by the scan is shared with all of the participating anti-virus makers so that those vendors can incorporate detection for the newly discovered malware into their products .
That pooling of intelligence on new threats also serves to make the free scanning services less attractive to virus authors , who would almost certainly like nothing more than to freely and simultaneously test the stealth of their new creations across a wide range of security software .
Still , there is nothing to stop an enterprising hacker from purchasing a license for each of the anti-virus tools on the market and selling access to a separate scanning service that appeals to the virus - writing community .
Enter upstart file - scanning services like av-check.com and virtest.com , which bank on the guarantee that they wo n't share your malware with the anti-virus community .
For $ 1 per file scanned ( or a $ 40 monthly membership ) av-check.com will see if your file is detected by any of 22 anti-virus products , including AVAST , AVG , Avira , BitDefender , NOD32 , F - Secure , Kaspersky , McAfee , Panda , Sophos , Symantec and Trend Micro .
" Each of them is setten [ sic ] up on max heuristic check level , " av-check promises .
" We guarantee that we do n’t save your uploaded files and they are deleted immediately after the check .
Also , we do n’t resend your uploaded files to the 3rd person .
Files are being checked only locally ( without checking / using on other servers . "
In other words :
There is no danger that the results of these scans will somehow leak out to the anti-virus vendors .
The service claims that it will soon be rolling out advanced features , such as testing malware against anti-spyware and firewall programs , as well as a test to see whether the malware functions in a virtual machine , such as VMWare or VirtualBox .
For safety and efficiency 's sake , security researchers often poke and prod new malware samples in a virtual environment .
As a result many new families of malware are designed to shut down or destroy themselves if they detect they are being run inside of a virtual machine .
Virtest checks suspicious files against a similar albeit slightly different set of anti-virus programs , also promising not to let submitted files get back to the anti-virus vendors : " Your soft is n't ever sent anywhere and the files being checked will never appear in the fresh AV signature bases after scanning , " the site pledges .
" On purpose in all AV - products are turned off all possible methods and initiatives of exchange of files ’ info with the AV - divisions . "
The proprietors of this service do n't even try to hide the fact that they have built it for malware writers .
Among the chief distinguishing features of virtest.com is the ability for malware authors to test " exploit packs , " pre-packaged kits that – when stitched into a malicious or hacked website – serve the visitor ’s browser with a kitchen sink full of code designed to install software via one of several known security holes .
Many anti-virus programs now also scan web pages for malicious content , and this service ’s " exploits pack check " will tell malware authors whether their exploit sites are triggering virus alerts across a range of widely used anti-virus software .
But do n't count on paying for these services via American Express :
Both sites only accept payment via virtual currencies such as Webmoney and Fethard , services that appear to be popular with the online shadow economy .

Problem –
You have told your kid that he should not play on the computer till late at night .
He should shut it down at 11 and then study since exams are near .
He assures you that he will do that and next morning tells you that he did that .
How do you find out if he actually did that ?
If you want to know what was the exact last shutdown time of your computer , then you can find that out using a simple trick .
You ’d need to go to the Event Viewer in Windows to get that information .
Here are the steps .
Step1 .
If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7 , click the start icon and type Event Viewer in the search box .
Event viewer program will appear .
Click on it .
If you are a Windows XP user , Go to Start > Run .
Type eventvwr.msc and click OK button .
Step 2 . Event Viewer window will open .
Now on the left side of that window click on “ Windows Logs ” .
Now on the right side , click on System .
Step 3 .
All the system files will open on the right side .
Now on the source column you have to find out Eventlog source having Event ID 6006 ( 6006 is an event ID for shutdown ) .
You will find many Eventlog sources having event ID 6006 .
But you need to figure out source with the most recent date and time .
Note :
All the events are placed in descending order ( latest time first ) so the top event log with event ID 6006 will show the correct time and date of last PC shutdown ( In this case the time is 1/10/2010 1:06:48 AM ) .
So the last shut down time of my PC is 1/10/2010 1:06:48 AM .
That ’s how you can easily find out when exactly was your computer last shut down .

Naked body scanning will now be compulsory at two of Britain ’s biggest airports after the government announced people who refuse to let security thugs ogle their genitalia will be treated like terrorists and barred from flying .
“ It is now compulsory for people selected for a scan to take part , or they will not be allowed to fly , ” reports the BBC .
That ’s right – no optional pat down as we were told , if you think that having strangers leer over your naked body is an invasion of privacy and refuse , you ’ll be treated the same way as a suspected terrorist .
Manchester Airport ’s head of customer experience , Sarah Barrett , told the BBC that the scanners do not allow security staff to see passengers naked .
This of course is a complete lie .
The images produced by the scanners provide high resolution crisp images of your genitalia .
This was confirmed by London Guardian writer Helen Carter who investigated trials of the scanners at Manchester Airport and said genitals were “ eerily visible ” in the images .
Indeed , as we have previously highlighted , when the scanners were first introduced at Australian airports in 2008 it was admitted that the X - ray backscatter devices do n’t work properly unless the genitals of people going through them are visible .
“ It will show the private parts of people , but what we ’ve decided is that we ’re not going to blur those out , because it severely limits the detection capabilities , ” said Melbourne Airport ’s Office of Transport Security manager Cheryl Johnson .
Despite objections on the grounds that the images produced violate child porn laws , the UK government has simply gone ahead anyway and overturned a previous ban on under 18 ’s being forced to use the scanners .
This will now give free reign to the kind of control freak thugs who like to sexually harass 13 - year - old girls to ogle your naked daughter ’s breasts while sitting alone in a back room enjoying themselves .
[ efoods ]
“ A rule which meant under 18s were not allowed to participate in the body scanner trial has been overturned by the government , ” according to the BBC report .
This now sets the precedent for every other UK and US airport to follow the same guidelines , meaning that if you want to escape from Airstrip One or the United States of Amerika , you must submit to a virtual strip search .
There seems little doubt that the naked scanners will eventually be rolled out at other transport hubs and after another staged terror attack , on the streets , in shopping malls , at sporting events and any other places of public congregation , as has already been proposed .
Three years ago , leaked documents out of the Home Office revealed that authorities in the UK were working on proposals to fit lamp posts with CCTV cameras that would X - ray scan passers - by and “ undress them ” in order to “ trap terror suspects ” .
Dutch authorities have also announced their intention to use mobile body scanners in “ high risk areas ” and “ mass scans on crowds at events such as football matches . ”
Experts agree that naked body scanners would not even have stopped accused underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from boarding Delta Flight 253 .
Maybe the fact that he was on a terror watch list , had no passport , and was accompanied by a suspicious well - dressed man should have provided some kind of warning .
The blatantly staged Christmas Day incident has been ravenously exploited to the full by the same mouthpieces for the military - industrial complex that own a stake in the body scanners , and now we the browbeaten public are being forced to suffer yet another disgusting indignity as we move one step further to a society that outstrips George Orwell ’s worst nightmare .

Read Tributes
Carl E. Taylor , MD , DrPH , founder of the academic discipline of international health and a man of spiritual conviction who dedicated his life to the well - being of the world 's marginalized people , passed away February 4 from prostate cancer .
He was 93 .
The reach of his life was extraordinary , personally working in over 70 countries and having students from more than 100 countries .
He was sharing this near century - long perspective with his students up until a week before his death .
Taylor was born in the Indian Himalaya to medical missionaries .
His career began at age 7 as a pharmacist assistant in his parents ’ oxcart - based clinic in the Indian jungles .
His childhood was spent in those jungles , before going on to earn his medical degree from Harvard .
( His medical school application opened with , “ My study of anatomy began dissecting a tiger to see where the food went . ” )
Following medical school , he worked in Panama where he married his wife of 58 years , the late Mary Daniels Taylor , who died in 2001 and was professor emeritus of Education at Towson University .
Taylor returned to India in 1947 as director of Fategarh Presbyterian Hospital where he led a medical team through the deadly riots of 1947 during the separation of India and Pakistan .
In 1949 , he conducted the first health survey of Nepal , then the most closed country in Asia .
Back at Harvard , he completed his MPH and DrPH degrees .
His doctoral dissertation provided the seminal research that defined the synergism between nutrition and infection , today a principle at the foundation of public health .
In 1952 , he founded the department of preventive medicine at the Christian Medical College Ludhiana , the first such department in the developing world .
Taylor was the founding chair of the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins .
He was instrumental in designing the global agenda for primary health care in the 1960s and 1970s .
Before it was widely embraced , he was part of research and movements that connected women ’s empowerment and holistic community - based change .
Throughout his life , Taylor had a particular interest in health care reform , especially the integration of services .
His research achievements were wide - ranging .
The Narangwal Rural Health Research Project in northern India , which he led from 1960 to 1975 , provided breakthrough understandings in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood pneumonia , neonatal tetanus , getting medical care to the villages , synergism of malnutrition and child mortality , understanding childhood diarrheal treatment and community empowerment for just and lasting health solutions .
In addition to his 48 years at Johns Hopkins , Taylor was China Representative for UNICEF from 1984 to 1987 .
From 1992 until his death , he was senior advisor to Future Generations and more recently Future Generations Graduate School where a professorship is endowed in his name .
From 2004 to 2006 , he was Afghanistan Country Director for Future Generations , where he led field - based action groups using over 400 mosques as educational sites for Afghan women .
He returned to Afghanistan in 2008 ( at 92 ) to test hypotheses about how “ women can in action groups solve the majority of their family health problems . ”
Taylor was the primary World Health Organization consultant in preparing documents in 1978 for the Alma Ata World Conference on Primary Health Care .
From 1957 through 1983 , he advised WHO on a wide range of international health matters .
In 1972 , Taylor became the founding chair of the National Council for International Health , now known as the Global Health Council .
He was also the founding chair of the International Health Section of the American Public Health Association .
Taylor published more than 190 peer - reviewed journal articles , books , chapters and policy monographs .
In addition to his earned degrees , Taylor received honorary degrees from Muskingum College , Towson State University , China ’s Tongji University , Peking Union Medical College and Johns Hopkins University .
In 1993 , President Bill Clinton recognized him for " Sustained work to protect children around the world in especially difficult circumstances and a life - time commitment to community based primary care . ”
Taylor is survived by his two brothers , John and Gordon , two sisters , Gladys and Margaret , three children , Daniel , Betsy , Henry , and nine grandchildren .
With an eight - decade long career in international health , he is beloved by thousands students and colleagues around the world .
His stories of adventure and service enabled them to believe that they too could create just and lasting change .
In the last year of his life , he was sitting with women in a bamboo hut in northeast India asking them how they would shape their futures , when they responded , “ it is harra , the empowerment of ourselves . ”

Brian McLaren ’s latest book , A New Kind of Christianity : Ten Questions That Are Transforming the Faith , is two steps forward in terms of clarity and ten steps backward in terms of orthodoxy .
A New Kind of Christianity , more than any previous McLaren project , provides a forceful account of what the emergent leader believes and why .
Before I get further into this review–and it will be on the long side , so buckle up –I need to say a word about charity .
Without a doubt the biggest critique Ted and I received for Why We ’re Not Emergent was that Ted and I were not charitable .
We were , some said , unfair , mean , and un-generous .
I do n’t doubt that the same will be said of this review .
So let me attempt a preemptive explanation .
I want to be fair with McLaren .
I want to understand his ideas and evaluate them based on their merits .
If I misunderstand a point or misconstrue what McLaren teaches I want to be corrected .
Further , I have no desire to engage in ad hominem attacks .
I want to discuss McLaren ’s theology without vitriol or sophomoric putdowns .
I will not assume the worst about Brian McLaren .
I will try not to say anything in the cozy confines of the blogosphere that I would not say sitting across from McLaren over a beverage of his choice .
It ’s not wrong to ask a reviewer to be charitable , so long as the love does not have to be devoid of the truth .
So what I will not do is pretend that the issues McLaren raises are non-essential issues or that his mistakes are little mistakes .
I will not refrain from serious critique because this is only a “ quest ” or merely an attempt to raise questions .
Moreover , I will not attempt to find a middle ground with teaching that I believe to be heterodox .
I will not look for a third way when I see Christianity going down one path and McLarenism going down another .
I will state my disagreements with this book strongly and warn other Christians strenuously .
I am not ashamed for having convictions , and I am not afraid to write as if I understand ( truly though not exhaustively ) what the Bible teaches and understand that what it teaches is incompatible with A New Kind of Christianity .
No one deserves to be reviled .
But some books deserve to be pilloried .
The Quest and the Questions
Brian McLaren is on a quest — “ a quest for new ways to believe and new ways to live and serve faithfully in the way of Jesus , a quest for a new kind of Christian faith ” ( 18 ) .
On this quest , McLaren raises and responds to ten questions .
1 . The narrative question : What is the overarching story line of the Bible ?
For McLaren , the familiar story line of creation , fall , redemption , consummation ( with heaven and hell as a result ) is a grotesque Greco - Roman distortion of the biblical narrative .
God the creator , liberator , reconciler is the real story line .
2 . The authority question : How should the Bible be understood ?
Not as a constitution , argues McLaren , with laws and rules and arguments about who ’s right and wrong .
Rather , we go to the Bible as a community library , where internal consistency is not presumed and we learn by conversation .
3 . The God question : Is God violent ?
Believers used to think so , but we ought to grow in maturity from fearing a violent tribal God to partnering with a Christlike God .
4 . The Jesus question : Who is Jesus and why is he important ?
Jesus is never violent and does not condemn .
He did not come to save people from hell .
Jesus , says McLaren , is peace - loving and identifies with the weak and oppressed .
5 . The gospel question : What is the gospel ?
It is not a message about how to get saved .
The gospel is the announcement of a “ new kingdom , a new way of life , and a new way of peace that carried good news to all people of every religion ” ( 139 ) .
6 . The church question : What do we do about the church ?
Churches — in whatever form and whatever we call them — exist to form people of Christlike love .
This is the church ’s primary calling , to form people who live in the way of love , the way of peacemaking .
7 . The sex question : Can we find a way to address human sexuality without fighting about it ?
We need to stop hating gay people and welcome them fully into the life of the church .
The “ sexually other ” may be defective in traditional religion , but they are loved and included in a new kind of Christianity .
8 . The future question : Can we find a better way of viewing the future ?
No more “ soul - sort ” universe where our team goes to heaven and the bad guys go to hell .
The future is open , inviting our participation .
In the end , God ’s mercy will triumph and all shall be well .
9 . The pluralism question : How should followers of Jesus relate to people of other religions ?
“ Christianity has a nauseating , infuriating , depressing record when it comes to encountering people of other religions ” ( 208 ) .
There is not us / them , insider / outsider .
Jesus accepted everyone and so should we .
10 .
The what - do - we - do - now question : How can we translate our quest into action ?
The human quest for God has known many stages .
Those in the more mature stages of the quest should gently invite others to grow into fuller maturity , but without being divisive .
Some may be thinking , “ What ’s wrong with this new kind of Christianity ? ”
Well , as it turns out , pretty much everything .
( Today you got the ten questions from the book .
Tomorrow ’s post will be much longer : you ’ll get the ten problems with the book .
On Friday I ’ll put the whole thing together as a downloadable PDF . )
We humans love robots .
We fear them .
We fantasize about them .
At least I do .
Some 70 artists around Boston set out to reveal their " inner robots " for a new show opening Friday in the South End .
Recently I went to check out their illustrations , paintings and sculptures , the beautiful and bizarre .
That 's where I met Skunk .
Skunk deals in junk .
He shows me his trio of adorable , scrap - metal creations — three - foot machines called " Astrobots . "
They 're made of used bicycle parts and all kinds of rusty old gears and sprockets .
" Benno " by Skunk
" I try to look at myself as a modern - day prospector living off the land , " Skunk says .
" You know , in my urban environment , there ’s ton of steel being chucked and oscillating fan parts and just all kinds of really charismatic and sexy , oily bits . "
Boot me up , baby .
" There ’s happy ones , there ’s sad ones , there ’s funky ones , there ’s childlike ones .
There ’s dirty ones , " Bennitt says .
" They ’re people - esque .
But , not . "
Ami Bennitt is the curator of this show , called " I ... You ... We ... ROBOT . "
After calling on artists at large for submissions , she received hundreds .
Artist Derrek
Coss does n’t build robots , he paints them — in people - esque settings , with people - esque needs .
" I try to look at some concerns that we as humans are already concerned with .
Health care and insurance , workers unions and things of that sort , " Coss says .
( I wonder if robots are more likely than Congress to pass health care reform . )
Coss tells me the same thing I hear from a lot of the artists here :
It ’s fun to play God .
Listen : ' Everybody Needs A Robot '
His images reveal powers and abilities we might wish we had .
Like the ability to scale a skyscraper with suction - cup feet .
See , that ’s the perennial trap for us dumb humans .
The robots we create wind up surpassing us .
To be honest , most of the creations in this show are way cooler than their creators .
That ’s why I wish I could be a robot .
" I... You ... We ... ROBOT " opens Friday , Jan. 29 , at Space 242 .

Angela Gordon and Junaid Abuhamza starved Khyra Ishaq at their home A mother who starved her seven - year - old daughter to death has been cleared of murder , but has admitted manslaughter .
Prosecutors accepted Angela Gordon 's defence of diminished responsibility over the death of Khyra Ishaq and agreed to the lesser charge .
Gordon 's partner , Junaid Abuhamza , had a manslaughter plea accepted following an earlier report on his mental health .
Khyra weighed 2st 9lb ( 16.5 kg ) when she was found severely emaciated at a house in Handsworth , Birmingham , in 2008 .
Paramedics took her to Birmingham Children 's Hospital where she was pronounced dead .
' Squalid conditions '
Following the end of the trial , it was revealed a judge in the High Court had concluded that " in all probability " Khyra would be alive if there had been " an adequate initial assessment by educational welfare services " .
In a ruling which could only be reported at the end of the criminal trial , Mrs Justice King said : " It is beyond belief that , in 2008 , in a bustling , energetic and modern city like Birmingham , a child of seven was withdrawn from school and thereafter kept in squalid conditions for a period of five months before finally dying of starvation . "
Who is the man who killed Khyra ?
Could Khyra have been saved ?
But the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board , which is carrying out a " serious case review " , said current legislation had hampered intervention by people who may have been able to help Khyra .
Local Labour MP
Khalid Mahmood has called for a public inquiry into social services handling of the case .
The city council said it had already carried out major improvements in the protection of vulnerable children and had improved the way it worked with other agencies .
Det Insp Sean Russell of West Midlands Police , who led the investigation , said he believed Khyra had been kept a virtual prisoner in an upstairs room .
" The defendants had created a situation in which the children , who were being educated at home , had been kept away from their extended family , friends and the outside world , " he said .
Dangerous malnutrition Birmingham Crown Court heard medical staff tending to Khyra had not seen such a severe case of malnutrition .
During the retrial - ordered after the first trial collapsed - jurors heard that Khyra was killed by an infection caused by months of deliberate starvation .
The house was well - stocked with food , but this was kept locked away out of the reach of Khyra and five other children in the care of the defendants .

The other children were also starved , two of them suffering from dangerous malnutrition by the time they were rescued .
Gordon , 35 , and Abuhamza , 31 , have also admitted five charges of child cruelty relating to the other children .
The decision by the Crown to accept Gordon 's plea on the lesser charge of manslaughter came after she admitted the cruelty charges and psychiatrists agreed that she had been suffering from severe depression when Khyra died .
Before she pleaded guilty to child cruelty and was cleared of murder , her counsel , Michael Burrows QC , said psychiatrists had agreed that her condition impaired her ability to function effectively as a mother .
Abuhamza 's plea of guilty to manslaughter but not guilty to murder was accepted earlier this month .
Martin Lindop of the Crown Prosecution Service said the manslaughter pleas were accepted as a result of psychiatric reports .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" As a result of the content of a number of psychiatric reports , which we received at a very late stage in the case , we concluded the charge of murder in relation to Khyra Ishaq could no longer be sustained , " he said .
Abuhamza had told the court he was brutally abused as a child and witnessed his father beating his younger sister to death when he was five years old .
After the case , Khyra 's natural father Ishaq Abuzaire said : " I think manslaughter was the right decision and the right outcome . "
Gordon and Abuhamza will be sentenced on Friday next week .

Mr. Gross , a former associate general counsel for the Federal Election Commission , said he generally supported disclosure requirements , though he said some of them might be hard to enforce .
He also questioned whether some of the legislation ’s other provisions would hold up in court .
Image Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York proposes requiring nonprofit groups to identify donors for political advertising .
Credit ... Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
The McCain - Feingold campaign finance law , passed in 2002 , sought to limit the use of attack advertising late in election campaigns .
It imposed restrictions on the types of broadcast , cable and satellite advertisements that could appear within 30 days of a federal primary or within 60 days of a federal general election .
“ Electioneering communications , ” as the McCain - Feingold act calls the advertising , are required to focus on issues rather than candidates .
They can name candidates in regard to a political issue , like a particular bill , but they cannot call for a candidate ’s election or defeat .
McCain - Feingold barred corporations and unions from financing electioneering communications .
In 2006 , however , the Supreme Court , in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life , held that it is unconstitutional to bar corporations from spending their money on electioneering communications .
Election commission rules require that organizations and individuals placing advocacy advertising or electioneering communications report their expenditures and identify donors who gave them money for those purposes .
Many nonprofit groups , however , have taken the position that their donors and dues - paying members did not give them money specifically for political uses .
Therefore , the groups have maintained , they are not obligated to name contributors .
It is impossible to know whether corporations or unions are taking advantage of the new freedom to funnel pro- or anti-candidate money through nonprofit organizations .
Election commission data on electioneering spending may offer a glimpse of the future , though .
After the 2006 Wisconsin Right to Life decision , there was no sudden surge in direct corporate spending on issue advertising .
Electioneering communications spending by nonprofit groups that did not identify their donors , however , increased sharply .
Of the $ 98.7 million in electioneering communications reported in the 2004 cycle , virtually all was accompanied by identification of at least some donors .
In the 2008 cycle , over one - third of the $ 116.5 million reported was not accompanied by donor identification .
Yesterday I noted that efforts to offer “ Trust Women / Respect Choice ” license plates in Virginia had been been subverted with state legislators in the House passed a bill directing any money raised from their sale to the Virginia Pregnant Women Support Fund instead of Planned Parenthood .
Well , the state Senate has now passed its own version of the bill which explicitly rejected that attempt :
The Virginia Senate , controlled by Democrats , has passed a measure that would create a specialty state license plate with the message “ Trust Women / Respect Choice . ”
Some of the application fee money paid by drivers who select the plate would go to the Virginia League of Planned Parenthood .
Drivers in Virginia , which loves its vanity plates , already are allowed to select one with the logo “ Choose Life . ”
Today ’s action put the Senate ’s bill on the issue in conflict with one passed by the Republican - controlled House of Delegates on Monday .
Delegates chose to strip out Planned Parenthood funding and send the application fees for the plate to a state fund to help pregnant women instead .
Democrats in the Senate fended off an amendment to the bill from state Sen. Mark Obenshain ( R - Harrisonberg ) that would have followed the House ’s lead , allowing the creation of the plates but without sending money to Planned Parenthood .
Gov. Bob McDonnell has already made clear that he supports stripping Planned Parenthood of any state funding it receives while Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said he would defend the state if lawmakers refuse to create the plate , so it ’ll be interesting to see how this plays out .
The Linux Foundation — the non-profit organization dedicated to all things Linux — is involved in a number of conferences throughout the year .
Among those , the newest is LinuxCon , which will be celebrating it 's second year in 2010 .
The location of industry conferences can be somewhat volatile — even those that have convened in the same city for the better part of a decade can suddenly turn up in another area .
LinuxCon , at least for now , looks to be one that will jump from city to city each year , creating both an opportunity for individuals in geographically diverse locations to attend , and a nice guessing game over where that will be .
This week , the Linux Foundation announced where the conference 's next hop will land , and when that will be .
The second annual LinuxCon will assemble in Boston , Massachusetts from August 10 - 12 , 2010 , and will as always include a variety of speakers , networking opportunities , panel presentations , and other conference staples .
Though the lineup has yet to be announced , past presenters have included Ubuntu 's Self - Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life , Mark Shuttleworth , Hewlett - Packard 's Bdale Garbee , IBM Vice President Bob Sutor , and — of course — Developer - in - Chief Linus Torvalds .
Attendees will have the added benefit of being able to attend several other events that will also be underway .
Though they were co-located last year , the Linux Plumber 's Conference will not be on - site in Boston — it is scheduled for November 3 - 5 , 2010 in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Several other events will run concurrently , however , including FOSS DevCamp and LDAPCon , will also take place at the same time .
The Linux Foundation Training Program offered sessions during last year 's conference , though its 2010 schedule has not currently been published .
It should be noted that entry to , and the cost of , these concurrent events is not included in the LinuxCon registration .
Those interested in submitting a proposal to present at the conference may wish to keep an eye on the Call For Participation page on the Foundation 's LinuxCon site .
At this early stage of the game , details on when the call will be issued , like most information , have yet to be announced .
Registration dates for the conference have been announced , however , and will open in February .
Full details will be provided on the registration page at that time .
Conference fees do not appear to have been announced as of yet , but will likely be similar to last year 's fees .
The registration fees for LinuxCon 2009 were : $ 299 for Early Birds who registered a minimum of three months in advance , $ 399 for post - EB registrations no later than one month prior , and $ 499 for late registrations , which were available until three days before the event .
Students , as is frequently the case , received the lowest rate , at $ 199 .
Discounts were available to a number of groups : Linux Foundation members received 30 % off , as did those attending the LPC , while companies with three registrants and up saved 15 % .
A slew of relief efforts poured into Haiti after the devastating 7.0 - magnidtude earthquake all but destroyed the capital city of Port - au - Prince , but nothing popped up faster than the Doctors Without Borders pop up hospital .
OK , maybe it does n’t really “ pop ” but the inflatable supports had a hospital on a soccer field in a matter of hours and provides the sterile environment necessary for medical work .
Of all the interesting shelters and pre fabricated housing and portable structures , this is the only one I ’ve seen being used to actually help people .
Sorry Blob House , you ’re pretty but you just sit around .
In science fiction , there ’s dystopia and there ’s utopia .
There are the dark wizards of apocalypse , terrifying us with visions of humanity ’s grim comeuppance .
And the starry - eyed fantasists , insisting how much better the future will be than the messy , middling present .
And then there ’s Kim Stanley Robinson : family man , High Sierras pilgrim , ex - Orange County homeboy and prolific author of several of the most influential science fiction works of the last 25 years .
Robinson , 57 , does n’t put much stock in the extremes of Bad New World vs. Bright New Tomorrow .
His work restlessly seeks out the third ( or fourth , or fifth ) possibility , an alternative evolutionary path .
With total worldwide sales of around 2.5 million copies , in numerous languages , his perspective plainly has a following .
Like Dante , Robinson specializes in triptychs .
His Mars trilogy of the 1990s describes 200 years of human colonization and ecological transformation on the Red Planet .
His “ Three Californias ” series of a decade earlier imagines the southern edge of the Golden State overrun by ruthless development and flattened by nuclear disaster , yet resilient , like a hardy mutant plant .
His latest novel , " Galileo ’s Dream ” ( Spectra : 544 pp. , $ 26 ) , deftly lashes together three narratives : a homage to Galileo , a trek to Jupiter ’s moons in the year 3020 and a philosophical inquiry into the perpetual tussle between comforting falsehoods and inconvenient truths .
“ Elegant , charming , funny and profound , ” summarized a reviewer for the Guardian of London , marking Robinson as the rare sci- fi writer whose polished prose and intellectual heft equals his inventive plotting .
It ’s up to the reader , his speculative fiction implies , to determine which future will prevail .
“ You can never properly predict the future as it really turns out , ” Robinson told a high school class here recently .
“ So you are doing something a little different when you write science fiction .
You are trying to take a different perspective on now . ”
This endeavor raises several questions central to Robinson ’s outlook .
What if the world is n’t fated to end with a bang or whimper , but simply to go on and on ?
What if utopia and dystopia are n’t static but dynamic terms , “ roads of history ” leading us through crisscrossing , switch - backed destinies ?
What if history can be read backward and forward , like a reverse nuclear chain reaction , in which altering a single atom could sway the course of religions , cultures , empires ?
Most crucially , perhaps :
How might the world be different if our literature , to say nothing of our politics , behaved more like a rational , intrepid adult than a hand - wringing adolescent ?
“ Apocalyptic thinking happens on the left as well as on the right , and in environmentalism , that ’s a terrible approach to take , ” Robinson says over lunch at one of his favorite downtown haunts .
“ Because it is n’t true .
We can not kill off life on Earth even if we wanted to .
Life is insanely robust , though we can make species go extinct , and this is the bad thing .
So I always make the point that you ca n’t say , ‘ Is it too late ? ’
That is the terrible question , because either answer promotes inaction .
If it ’s too late , you do n’t need to act ; if it ’s not too late , you do n’t need to act . ”
His sci - fi origins
Robinson earned his liberal - humanist bona fides the way many California boomers did .
He was raised in a conservative Orange County home where he agreed to disagree about politics with his Republican parents .
In those days Orange County was a citrus - scented Eden , at least for middle - class suburbanites .
But as he grew up , Robinson watched bulldozers plow up the orange and eucalyptus groves .
It was n’t until he started reading Isaac Asimov , and later Ursula K. Le Guin , Samuel R. Delany and Gene Wolfe , that he discovered a genre to express what he ’d witnessed .
“ When I started reading science fiction , I thought , ‘ This is me .
This is about going from a human world to a machine world and becoming a cyborg , ’ ” he has said .
“ I think of science fiction as the realism of California . ”
When Robinson drove from Orange County to UC San Diego ( where he received his B.A. in English ) , he recalls that “ in 90 minutes , I went from 1950 to 1970 . ”
At UCSD , he became radicalized by Vietnam and his exposure to certain faculty thinkers , chief among them his friend Fredric Jameson , the literary critic and Marxist theorist .
Their influence remains .
But over the years , Robinson has tilted away from the absolutism of the 1960s and tried to “ reimagine what revolution ” can be .
In his novels , he posits a scientific , gradualist , nonviolent view of how progress can occur .
“ He believes that problems can be solved , and he sees the first step as imagining ways they might be solved , ” says his close friend and fellow novelist Karen Joy Fowler .
“ He is not interested in councils of despair . ”
Instead of “ revolution , ” Robinson prefers terms like “ better scenario ” and “ phase change ” to express what he sees as humanity ’s best hopes for reforming itself .
When discussing a hot - button subject such as climate change , his Zen calm ignites with passion .
“ The problem is that dealing with climate change is a Big Government issue , and ever since Reagan - Thatcher there ’s been this strong move to demonize government , ” he says .
Climate - change rejecters and free - market ideologues “ have done just what the Catholic Church did with Galileo .
They ’ve made the wrong choice and are going to have to crawl away from it , but the damage will have been done . ”
For a man whose mind plumbs the depths of time and space , Robinson savors life as a Mr. Mom homebody .
Since the early 1990s , he and his wife , Lisa Nowell , an environmental chemist , have lived in Village Homes , a planned community with similarities to the utopian colony he depicted in his California trilogy .
The couple ’s elder son is in college , and the younger is a ninth - grader .
In this well - tended 70 - acre enclave , with its community center , school and nearby wetlands where Canada geese and snowy egrets flock , Robinson often writes at a little metal table in his front yard while listening to classical music .
He also raises broccoli , artichokes , strawberries and spinach in his small patch of the communal gardening plots , which function as a personal Walden Pond .
Robinson reckons that he knows about 200 of his roughly 1,000 neighbors , and has even served on the community ’s board of directors .
He ’s fond of citing a quote attributed to Oscar Wilde : “ Socialism will never succeed .
It takes too many evenings . ”
“ It ’s one of the contradictions he balances , ” says Terry Bisson , a longtime friend and fellow sci - fi writer .
“ He ’s sort of a high - modernist bohemian .
But he ’s pretty middle - class about it too . ”
The challenge for the affluent developed world , from Robinson ’s viewpoint , is to make places like this green - friendly Brook Farm of the Central Valley reproducible .
“ It ’s what I said in ‘ Pacific Edge , ’ we live in a pocket utopia , and we need the rest of the world to be utopia , or else we seem like criminals or idiots . ”
Much left to write
Although Robinson has a contract to complete three new novels , he also hopes to write a nonfiction book about his experience of the Sierras .
He hikes there often , inspired by both John Muir and the poet Gary Snyder , another friend .
For Robinson , such a book would be part spiritual meditation and part how - to book about “ how to have fun up there as a Californian , without being a climber , without being in danger and without suffering . ”
But he plans to heed Le Guin ’s advice : “ Do n’t do the lone , enraptured male . ”
There ’s one more book Robinson envisions that ca n’t be fully finished .
As he sees it , humankind is authoring a great science fiction novel , as individuals and collectively .
Every day , he believes , we are writing the future into being through our actions and dreams .
Is it harder or easier as a sci - fi writer not to know how those future chapters will turn out ?
He reflects in his tranquil living room as the fog spreads its fingers against the sliding glass doors .
Oh , definitely not harder , he says .
“ It ’s a kind of reconciliation , since so much of our life is an imaginative act anyway .
Since I ca n’t go there biologically , at least I ’ve imagined it . ”

Glossolalia , or speaking in tongues , has fascinated thinkers ever since the “ tongues of angels ” descended upon early believers as a gift from the Holy Ghost in the New Testament of the Bible .
This unusual mental state , characterized by utterances that sometimes sound like an untranslated psalm from Mars , typically occurs during instances of religious excitation , and is primarily associated with Pentecostal religious practices .
It has commonly been considered a form of ecstatic trance accompanied by verbal utterances not found in any language .
Tongue speakers typically claim that the outbursts are non-voluntary , but others can sometimes produce instances of glossolalia on demand .
Glossolalia has typically been considered a psychopathology , although little has been known about what occurs in the brain during this behavior .
Plato asserted that these occurrences were caused by divine inspiration .
He suggested that God took possession of the mind while man was sleeping or possessed , and during such a state , God inspired man with utterances that he can neither understand nor interpret .
Research performed in the 1980s at Denison University by the late anthropologist Felicitas Goodman led to a theory that glossolalia was a trance state caused by rhythmic discharges from the reticular formation , an area of the brain stem that plays a role in sleep and dreams .
Goodman believed that this represented an alternative neural pathway for language , but more recent research has cast light on activity in other areas of the brain .
In 2006 , Andrew Newberg and associates conducted the first functional neuroimaging study of cerebral changes during the act of glossolalia .
In the study , published in Psychiatry Research : Neuroimaging , Newberg and other researchers at the University of Pennsylvania managed to run single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) scans to measure regional cerebral blood flow in the brains of five people during episodes of active glossolalia .
( As controls , the investigators took scans of people singing gospel songs . )
Despite the prevailing notion in the biomedical community of glossolalia as psychopathology , the researchers discovered that “ the limited number of reported studies have suggested that people who speak in tongues show no differences in personality traits from other population groups . ”
Indeed , an earlier study in Britain of glossolalia among the clergy found that those who sometimes spoke in tongues showed more emotional stability and less depression than a control group .
In an earlier neuroimaging study of meditation states , Newberg and coworkers had observed increased activity in the frontal lobes , a finding consistent with scans of other attention - focusing activities .
But in the case of glossolalia , Newberg , the director for the Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , discovered that activity the frontal lobes decreased , including activity in the brain ’s primary language processing centers :
“ Our finding of decreased activity in the frontal lobes during the practice of speaking in tongues is fascinating because these subjects truly believe that the spirit of God is moving through them and controlling them to speak .
Our brain imaging research shows us that these subjects are not in control of the usual language centers during this activity , which is consistent with their description of a lack of intentional control while speaking in tongues . ”
Another area of activity during glossolalia is the left superior parietal lobe ( SPL ) , a region behind the frontal lobes that plays an important role in processing sensory input .
In the meditation scans , during which subjects describe a loss of the sense of self , there was a significant decreases in SPL activity .
However , glossolalia patients showed no such decreases , a finding consistent with their assertion that they experience no loss of individual boundaries , or submerging of the sense of self , while speaking in tongues .
The study also found increased activity in the limbic system , the seat of emotional responses , but the researchers declined to speculate on “ altered emotional activity during glossolalia . ”
One of the curious aspects of the study , as pointed out on the Neurocritic Blog , is that the subjects were capable of entering the state of glossolalia more or less on cue .
This finding seems to call into question the “ spontaneous utterance ” aspect of glossolalia .
Spiritual or religious aspects notwithstanding , the study strongly points to the act of speaking in tongues as a verifiable language phenomenon that invites further study .

No cases have yet gone to court Music industry representative the BPI has criticised the approach used by a UK law firm in chasing file - sharers .
Law firm ACS : Law has sent thousands of letters to people it claims have downloaded illegal content .
The BPI said it did not condone the approach of mass - mailing alleged internet pirates .
A law firm that represents some of those sent letters has called on the Information Commissioner to investigate the matter .
The BPI said it would not be adopting the same approach as ACS : Law if UK legislation on the issue of illegal file - sharing comes into force .
" We do n't favour the approach taken by ACS : Law to tackle illegal file - sharing , " said spokesman Adam Liversage .
" Our view is that legal action is best reserved for the most persistent or serious offenders - rather than widely used as a first response , " he added .
Wi - fi hacking
The government Digital Economy Bill is in the process of going through parliament .
In it the government lays out its approach to the issue of illegal file - sharing which would start with sending letters to those addresses linked to computers found to have been downloading illegal material .
Some of the accused could have had their network hacked into If a letter campaign does not work , more drastic action , such as removing them from the network , will be taken .
Consumer publication
Which has been approached by 150 people who have received letters from ACS : Law and say they are completely innocent .
It highlights one of the problems with the software used to track file - sharers , namely that finding an IP address of a computer does not necessarily find the person who has committed the crime .
It could be that someone else has used an unsecured wireless network , effectively piggybacking on a householder 's network to download illegal content without being traced .
Or , in other cases , it could be that another member of the household is responsible .
ACS : Law said that it is happy that the methods used to trace file - sharers is completely accurate .
But lawyer Michael Coyle from Lawdit , who represents around 100 people who have received letters , is concerned that none of the cases has gone to court .
" About 10 % of them have paid but the rest have just disappeared , " he said .
To me it seems like a license to print money , all you have to do is hold your nerve , beat the stick and most people do pay
Michael Coyle
He is not convinced that the evidence would stand up if they did go to court .
" It seems to me that the only way that a claim can be upheld is if you admit the claim or they inspect your hard drive , " he said .
Andrew Crossley from ACS : Law told BBC
News that cases are pending .
" It has been said that we have no intention of going to court but we have no fear of it , " he said .
He represents a range of clients , including German firm DigiProtect .
DigiProtect is not a content company itself but agrees with rights holders to pursue file - sharers on their behalf .
Mr Coyle said that there are other firms " jumping on the bandwagon " .
' So bizarre '
One of his clients was contacted on behalf of an English firm called MediaCat whose members include two London - based pornography companies .
Mr Coyle said that his client was accused of downloading 22 adult films and ACS was " demanding £ 11,000 " .
It is the equivalent of someone stood outside HMV with a pile of the latest albums , handing them out to people who were intending to go in the shop and buy it
Andrew Crossley
" The whole thing is now so bizarre that I do n't actually think it 's got anything to do with copyright any more , " he added .
Mr Crossley said that MediaCat seeks " £ 540 per infringement " .
" It is an appropriate settlement and if it went to court the claim would be for £ 3,000 per infringement , " he said .
He said his client did not pursue people " who have just downloaded something " .
" The system is designed to monitor uploads not downloads . "
" It is the equivalent of someone stood outside HMV with a pile of the latest albums , handing them out to people who were intending to go in the shop and buy it , " But Mr Coyle questions the motives of firms such as MediaCat .
" We have been approached by similar companies in Belgium and Germany asking us to do the same sort of thing .
To me it seems like a license to print money , all you have to do is hold your nerve , beat the stick and most people do pay , " he added .
He thinks the practice needs to be stopped .
" I suspect that many hundreds of people have been innocently accused of copyright infringement and the accusations continue without any organisation being prepared to intervene , " he said .
" Ideally the Information Commissioner ought to intervene and seek to prevent the courts releasing the personal data of thousands of individuals , " he added .

Artificial Flight and Other Myths
a reasoned examination of A.F. by top birds
Over the past sixty years , our most impressive developments have undoubtedly been within the industry of automation , and many of our fellow birds believe the next inevitable step will involve significant advancements in the field of Artificial Flight .
While residing currently in the realm of science fiction , true powered , artificial flying mechanisms may be a reality within fifty years .
Or so the futurists would have us believe .
Despite the current media buzz surrounding the prospect of A.F. , a critical examination of even the most basic facts can dismiss the notion of true artificial flight as not much more than fantasy .
We can start with a loose definition of flight .
While no two bird scientists or philosophers can agree on the specifics , there is still a common , intuitive understanding of what true flight is : powered , feathered locomotion through the air through the use of flapping wings .
While other flight - like phenomena exist in nature ( via bats and insects ) , no bird with even a reasonable education would consider these creatures true fliers , as they lack one or more key elements .
And , while some birds are unfortunately born handicapped ( penguins , ostriches , etc. ) , they still possess the ( albeit undeveloped ) gene for flight , and it is indeed flight that defines the modern bird .
This is flight in the natural world , the product of millions of years of evolution , and not a phenomenon easily replicated .
Current A.F. is limited to unpowered gliding ; a technical marvel , but nowhere near the sophistication of a bird .
Gliding simplifies our lives , and no bird ( including myself ) would discourage advancing this field , but it is a far cry from synthesizing the millions of cells within the wing alone to achieve Strong A.F. Strong A.F. , as it is defined by researchers , is any artificial flier that is capable of passing the Tern Test ( developed by A.F. pioneer Alan Tern ) , which involves convincing an average bird that the artificial flier is in fact a flying bird .
Now we know the goal , but what about the technical hurdles ?
Our visions of the bird wing are becoming more accurate , it ’s true , and soon we may have a full model of every muscle , bone and sinew , but even this is merely information .
There ’s never been a realistic timetable of how long it would take to replicate even a portion of the wing , whether through biology , engineering or otherwise .
And even the most optimistic birds have yet to explain how we plan to accurately rebuild the delicate array of feathers that are essential to flight .
Do not misinterpret this pessimism as cynicism , mind you , as I do believe these studies are worthwhile , as we will learn more about ourselves and what it means to be a bird .
Replicating birddom , though , is almost definitely out of our reach .
Even if we were capable of completely achieving the above , how would we ever know if it was a true bird ?
Where does flight really reside ?
We may build a functioning , flapping wing , but what if the essence of flight is deeper , hidden within the cells or elsewhere ?
We would only succeed in making a hollow doll that only gives the appearance of flight .
If this is the end result , is it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources ?
There are religious birds who believe God made Bird in His own image , and while I do not share in most of these beliefs , I do think there ’s something to be said about the motivation behind creating Strong A.F. Perhaps , as we are the only creatures on Earth capable of flight , we want to push forward past our current capabilities , perhaps even augmenting our own flying capacities if independent A.F. is an impossibility .
This could be interpreted as noble , but I would argue that there ’s very little utility in replicating what nature has essentially perfected .
Why spend millions on an artificial flier when there are so many birds out of work ?
Many weaker fliers have already lost their jobs to gliders ; is it wise to rush to make ourselves obsolete ?
A.F. research may unlock some hidden mystery about ourselves , and it may make the lives of some more comfortable , but at best , true Strong A.F. is a pipe dream and at worst a challenge to what it means to be a bird .

Why do so few British footballers succeed on foreign fields ?
About a decade ago , Johan Cruyff said that he thought it was one of the biggest questions in European football .
" Why are there , over the last 40 years , only about five English players who have done well abroad .
There 's something going on here , something strange , " mused the Dutch genius .
Johan was perhaps being unkind .
I can think of a few more than five .
He also came out with his statement before Beckham - mania took over Real Madrid for a few years , to bump up the number by one .
Nevertheless , he had a point , and his later admission that he meant British players rather just English made his analysis even grimmer .
British players still , to this day , seem to wilt abroad , for whatever reason .
An interesting insight into what British players face when they go abroad has been provided by Darius Vassell , the former Aston Villa , Manchester City and England striker who is now at the very modest Turkish side Ankaragucu .
Vassell has started writing a blog , partly to relieve the boredom one suspects , partly to exorcise the frustrations of his new existence , which include getting thrown out of his hotel when the club failed to pay the bills .
It 's not the usual PR prose written by a wealthy player 's acolyte .
The 29 - year - old is writing himself and it's heartfelt .
Nevertheless , despite his honesty and endeavour at trying to resolve the issues he faces , you suspect he will soon be back in England , no longer a candidate for Cruyff 's approval .
Vassell will have lasted longer than Stan Collymore , though .
As Oviedo fans will need no reminding , the former Liverpool and England forward lasted just three games before deciding he could not adapt to a new way of life and a new way of playing , even though he had an English - speaking manager in Radomir Antic to help him along .
Stan Collymore in action - albeit very briefly - for Oviedo
Gary Lineker has been one of the few Brits to shine abroad .
But for every Lineker there has been at least one Mark Hughes , who so obviously failed to settle at Barcelona , even when the then coach Terry Venables was playing with English - style tactics , that he was loaned to Bayern Munich after just one season .
Lineker has often expounded on the reasons for his success at Barcelona and the failure of other Brits at European clubs - and a lot of the reasons hinge on language .
" I looked at British players who went abroad and were successful , " he reflected a few years ago .
" They were the ones who learnt the language and adapted to the culture .
Look at Tony Woodcock and Ray Wilkins .
The ones that did n't tended to be home pretty quick . "
However , another critical factor is the ability to adapt to the prevalent playing style .
One man who made the grade , at least in the eyes of Real Madrid fans , was Steve McManaman .
" As soon as I and Victoria ( his then girlfriend , now wife ) hung our clothes up and had a bed , I started to feel at home , " he said .
" I made an effort to learn Spanish .
Sometimes I thought I was making progress and a group of fans would approach me , start talking , my mind went a complete blank .
On the field , though , I understood what was going on . "
This seems to be something that has passed by Jermaine Pennant at Zaragoza , the latest British import at a Spanish football club .
I had high hopes at the start of the season that he might prosper , but almost every time he takes to the field he ends up pleading with his team - mates to adapt the tactics to his skills .
As anybody going to a new school will remember , you have to fit in .
It 's a long time before you can start to dictate events .
Of course , sometimes you can still do your best and things still do n't go your way , as Vassell will no doubt agree .
Jonathan Woodgate was fluent in Spanish by the time he left Real Madrid in 2006 but injuries restricted him to just nine La Liga games .
" I 've had plenty of time to learn the language , " the former Leeds centre - half quipped to me on one occasion .
In another interview , Woodgate described his daily routine , one that might have some familiarity to Vassell .
" What I did at the hotel was develop a set routine , " he said .
" I 'd have lunch at a certain time .
Go to bed for a couple of hours .
Go to the gym downstairs .
Go on the internet .
Train again .
Swim a bit , keep myself ticking over .
I 'd watch TV , got English TV .
And I 'd go off in my car and get lost in Madrid .
I 'd get lost and then I 'd find my way back .
Then on Sundays I 'd go to the airport and buy every paper , every magazine in English , and come home and chill out , reading all day . "
Cruyff treats it as a great mystery , yet the answer to why so few British players are successful on the continent appears crystal clear .
In my humble opinion , these are the five biggest British success stories on the European mainland in the last 50 years .
1. Kevin Keegan : at Hamburg he won two successive European Footballer of the Year awards in 1978 and 1979 .
The only British player to win the award while at a foreign club .
2. Gary Lineker : still a hero at Barcelona and finished second in the 1986 European Footballer of the Year poll while at the Catalan club .
3. John Charles : forget Hughes or Ian Rush , who infamously said that " playing in Italy was like being in a foreign country " , Charles is Wales ' greatest ever football export .
During their centenary in 1997 , Juventus voted him their best - ever foreign player .
4. Steve McManaman : articulate and genuinely enjoyed being in Madrid .
Won two Champions League titles while at the Spanish giants .
5. David Beckham : he may have gone against all the ' rules ' and ended up leaving Real Madrid knowing barely any more Spanish than when he arrived , but you can't really argue with what he did on the field in his four years there .
Two years ago , The Sun produced its own Top Ten , which might offer some food for thought .
I 'm going to give a copy to Johan Cruyff the next time I see him .

I do n't need your full address but please put the town / city and country where you come from .
In the past week , the postbag has been deluged with questions .
Many thanks , and also apologies , to the majority of people who write .
I do read all the emails so please keep them coming but only have enough space to answer a couple of questions each week .
I was curious about the defending Bundesliga champions Wolfburg .
What happened to them this year ?
They are currently in the mid-table .
Alvaro Erickson , USA
After their coach Felix Magath left for Schalke in the summer , the team fell seemed to fall apart .
In my opinion , Magath 's influence and ability can be seen in how well Schalke are doing this season .
To quote from a recent British football magazine , " He undeniably holds the patent for assembling teams which live and breathe over - achievement . "
Zvjezdan Misimovic has been a shadow of his former self this season , perhaps distracted by his off - the - field disagreements with Bosnian coach Ciro Blazevic and the birth of a son .
Grafite has likewise been out - of - sorts for much of the season .
Edin Dzeko has been doing his best and still is getting goals , but the supporting cast in last season 's success story have not been pulling their weight this time around .
Who do you think the favourites to win the Champions League ?
Samuel Parker , Liverpool
I 'm sure that I 'll be writing on a Champions League topic at length next week and most bookies still put Barcelona as the favourites , just ahead of Chelsea and Manchester United .
Nevertheless , I 'm going to stick my neck out and say that neither of those three teams will win the Champions league this year .
Real Madrid have looked formidable since the start of 2010 and Florentino Perez is finally getting some return for all the money he spent last summer .
Kaka had arguably his best game since joining them in the 3 - 0 defeat of Espanyol on Saturday .
All that remains to be seen is if Cristiano Ronaldo can avoid losing the plot too often or that Iker Casillas does n't get suspended for a critical game ( he 's on two yellow cards ) .
I 've also been impressed with Inter Milan in their last couple of games .
They seen to have got over their mid-season ' wobble ' .
If the draw does n't bring them together earlier , I could see a Real v Inter final , which will evoke plenty of memories as it will be a repeat of the epic 1964 final which the Italian side won 3 - 1 .

The Project on Defense Alternatives sent me this email a few minutes ago :
We ’ve just opened the web page Trillions to Burn ?
A Quick Guide to the Pentagon Budget Surge — please have a look .
It ’s a quick read with 9 charts that explain why the DoD budget has risen to over 700 billion and what it implies for other federal spending and the national debt .
Hey , you had me at “ charts ” !
So here ’s your chart of the day : a look at Pentagon spending since World War II , adjusted for inflation .
Right now we ’re spending more than we did during the Korean War , the Vietnam War , or the Reagan military buildup .
And there ’s no end in sight .

Hair is a language ; it announces our gender , class and even our politics .
George Washington rejected wigs as too aristocratic for the new Republic .
He tied his long powdered hair in a “ queue , ” while his successors embraced unpowdered styles inspired by ancient Rome .
Federalists like John Adams wore long hair , while Jefferson ’s Democrats countered with shortened cuts .
By the mid-19th century , beards returned after a long absence .
Virile - looking and practical on the battlefield , beards were suited to the Civil War ; Grant kept his when he entered the White House .
The safety razor ’s invention around 1900 marked the beginning of the end for presidential facial hair .
For the last 100 years , there have been very few stylistic developments of note ; the most significant change of late comes with our current commander in chief , whose hair has brought welcome diversity to the presidential scalp .

This is about 30 times the energy ever delivered by any other group of lasers in the world .
The peak power of the laser light , which was delivered within a few billionths of a second , was about 500 times that used by the United States at any given time .
" Breaking the megajoule barrier brings us one step closer to fusion ignition at the National Ignition Facility , and shows the universe of opportunities made possible by one of the largest scientific and engineering challenges of our time , " said NNSA Administrator Thomas D'Agostino .
" NIF is a critical component in our stockpile stewardship program to maintain a safe , secure and effective nuclear deterrent without underground nuclear testing .
This milestone is an example of how our nation 's investment in nuclear security is producing benefits in other areas , from advances in energy technology to a better understanding of the universe . "
In order to demonstrate fusion , the energy that powers the sun and the stars , NIF focuses the energy of 192 powerful laser beams into a pencil - eraser - sized cylinder containing a tiny spherical target filled with deuterium and tritium , two isotopes of hydrogen .
Inside the cylinder , the laser energy is converted to X - rays , which compress the fuel until it reaches temperatures of more than 200 million degrees Fahrenheit and pressures billions of times greater than Earth 's atmospheric pressure .
The rapid compression of the fuel capsule forces the hydrogen nuclei to fuse and release many times more energy than the laser energy that was required to initiate the reaction .
This experimental program to achieve fusion ignition is known as the National Ignition Campaign sponsored by NNSA and is a partnership among LLNL , Los Alamos National Laboratory , the Laboratory for Laser Energetics , General Atomics , Sandia National Laboratories , as well as numerous other national laboratories and universities .
The NIF laser system , the only megajoule laser system in the world , began firing all 192 - laser beams onto targets in June 2009 .
In order to characterize the X - ray drive achieved inside the target cylinders as the laser energy is ramped up , these first experiments were conducted at lower laser energies and on smaller targets than will be used for the ignition experiments .
These targets used gas - filled capsules that act as substitutes for the fusion fuel capsules that will be used in the 2010 ignition campaign .
The 1 MJ shot represents the culmination of these experiments using an ignition - scale target for the first time .
These early tests have demonstrated that NIF 's laser beams can be effectively delivered to the target and are capable of creating sufficient X - ray energy in the target cylinder to drive fuel implosion .
The implosions achieved with the surrogate capsules have also been shown to have good symmetry that is adjustable through a variety of techniques .
The next step is to move to ignition - like fuel capsules that require the fuel to be in a frozen hydrogen layer ( at 425 degrees Fahrenheit below zero ) inside the fuel capsule .
NIF is currently being made ready to begin experiments with ignition - like fuel capsules in the summer of 2010 .
" This accomplishment is a major milestone that demonstrates both the power and the reliability of NIF 's integrated laser system , the precision targets and the integration of the scientific diagnostics needed to begin ignition experiments , " said NIF Director Ed Moses .
" NIF has shown that it can consistently deliver the energy required to conduct ignition experiments later this year . "
NIF , the world 's largest laser facility , is the first facility expected to achieve fusion ignition and energy gain in a laboratory setting .
This image of the small asteroid 2010 AL30 was taken in Jan. 11 , 2010 , when the space rock was discovered , by astronomers at the Skylive - Grove Creek Observatory in Australia .
It was released by the Remanzacco Observatory .
This story was updated at 7:33 p.m. ET .
A weird object that left some observers wondering if it was a piece of space junk is most likely just a small asteroid , and will zoom close by Earth Wednesday , NASA scientists say .
It may be visible to seasoned amateur astronomers as it passes harmlessly by the planet .
The space rock wo n't hit the Earth , but it will make its closest approach at 7:45 a.m. EST ( 1245 GMT ) when it comes within 80,000 miles ( 130,000 km ) of our planet .
That 's nearly one - third the distance between the Earth the moon .
Astronomers announced the discovery of the asteroid , which they named 2010 AL30 , on Monday .
It is relatively small , about 36 feet ( 11 meters ) wide , NASA researchers said .
There was some early speculation that the object was a part of a derelict spacecraft , but NASA scientists have concluded that it is most likely a simple space rock flying near Earth .
" I looked at this object closely yesterday morning and concluded that this object is probably not artificial , " said Paul Chodas , a scientist at NASA 's Near - Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
What makes 2010 AL30 weird is its orbit , which is almost exactly one Earth year long , leading to some discussion that it might be a man-made spacecraft launched in the recent past .
But Chodas said the asteroid 's trajectory is not the kind used to transfer spacecraft out of Earth 's orbit , nor is the space rock followed by other objects that escaped from Earth or lunar space .
The asteroid was also far from Earth during the Apollo lunar missions of the late 1960s and 1970s , when many spacecraft were launched into the space near the moon , Chodas said .
Professional astronomers have already snapped photos of the object and seasoned skywatchers may be able to do the same if they know where to look .
According to Spaceweather.com , 2010 AL30 will appear as bright as a 14th magnitude star and pass through the constellations Orion , Taurus and Pisces as it passes the Earth .
Magnitude is a standard used by astronomers to measure the brightness of objects in the sky .
The lower the number , the brighter the object , with the brightest stars in the sky categorized as either a zero or first magnitude .
2010 AL30 is not the only space rock passing relatively close by Earth this week .
Another recently discovered object , known as 2010 AG30 , will zip by the planet on Thursday .
But that asteroid is about 43 feet ( 13 meters ) wide , and will pass by at a comfortable distance of about 650,000 miles ( 1 million km ) from Earth , NASA scientists said .
While searching my blog archives for something I wrote on UFOs , I stumbled on an old article :
Woo shots , about the antivax movement .
It was one of the first times I wrote about the antivaxxers on the blog , and the first time I took them on directly :
If these people prevail , we are all at risk .
If you ’re under the age of , say , 40 do you personally remember anyone getting smallpox , or polio ?
No ?
Guess why .
That ’ll all end if the antivax people have their way .
They must be stopped , and being vocal about critical thinking is the only way to do it .... and when it comes to the important stuff , the really important stuff , I ’ll take all the help I can get to make sure the word gets out .
That article was written almost exactly two years ago , and little did I know then that not only would the movement grow stronger , but in the intervening 700 or so days many people -- including babies -- would die due to the words of those who deny vaccinations to their own children .
That 's despite the 60 or so posts I 've written about this , and the efforts of others like Steve Novella , Orac , Joe Albietz , Rachael Dunlop , and so many others .
But it 's on more than individual blogs now : Daily Kos has a lengthy article up today about antivaxxers , and many other weighty websites and even the mainstream media have taken up the issue .
I 'm very glad to see it .
When I write about these topics , I get a handful of complaints from readers who think I should stick to astronomy .
Well , that 's not going to happen .
After these past two years I remain as adamant and as impassioned to spread the word that antivaxxers are dangerous , and their ideas kill .
I will continue to write about this health danger , and keep you up to date as much as I can on the latest news on this .
People are dying , and it 's because of bad thinking .
We must stop this , and the first step is to be aware of the problem .
I can hope that two years from now I wo n't have to write about this any more ... but I 'm a realist , and I know that this will be a problem for a long , long time to come .
It 's up to us to minimize that time .
Bad thinking takes lives , but good thinking can save them .
Think well .
Women have often protested about their treatment
Saudi Arabia is planning to bring in a new law to allow women lawyers to argue cases in court for the first time .
Justice Minister Mohammed al - Eissa said the law was part of King Abdullah 's plan to develop the legal system .
The law - to be issued " in the coming days " - would allow women to appear in court on family - related cases , including divorce and child custody .
At the moment , they can only work behind the scenes in government and court offices .
The new legislation will also allow Saudi women to complete certain procedures without the presence of a witness .
" In accordance with the new law , women will be able to complete their preliminary procedures with notaries by just presenting their IDs , " said Ministry of Justice official Osama al - Mirdas , according to Arab News .
Under a system of male guardianship , Saudi Arabian women are required to be kept separate from men they are not related to .
All are veiled to a greater or lesser degree in public , they are not allowed to drive , and women under 45 must receive permission from a male when they travel .
Opportunities for education and employment are also dependent on male guardianship .
But a number of steps have been taken to ease restrictions - for instance women are now allowed to stay in hotels unaccompanied .
Last year , a senior cleric was removed after criticising a new mixed - sex science and technology university .
The cleric , Sheikh Saad al - Shethry , had described the mixing of sexes in any university as evil and a great sin .
An estimated 57 million Americans have contracted pandemic H1N1 influenza since the outbreak began last April , about 257,000 have been hospitalized with complications from it , and nearly 12,000 have died , according to estimates released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The total number of infected represents an increase of about 7 million cases since the last estimate was released in December , a modest gain that correlates with other data suggesting the swine flu pandemic has been waning .
Most cases in all categories have involved children and adults younger than 65 , a sharp change from normal flu seasons , in which the elderly suffer disproportionately .
Although the death total is much lower than the estimated 35,000 U.S. deaths in a normal flu season , the numbers among people younger than 65 are much higher than normal .
Virtually all cases of influenza that were tested have been caused by the H1N1 virus rather than by seasonal flu viruses , a finding that leads some experts to predict -- rather hopefully -- that the country will not see a regular flu season this year .
Nonetheless , the CDC report says , “ flu activity , caused by either 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu viruses , may rise and fall , but it is expected to continue for several more months . ”

It was not Susan Sarandon ‘s night at The Box , where throngs of partygoers stayed from late Thursday into the early morning to help the Lower East Side burlesque club ring in its third anniversary .
Sarandon , who recently separated from Tim Robbins , got an unpleasant party favor when transsexual performer Rose Wood vomited on stage directly onto the Oscar winner .
A witness reports , “ She actually handled it very well .
She was laughing while a bunch of guys came over to towel her off . ”
Standing just a few feet away were “ A View From the Bridge ” co-stars Scarlett Johansson and Liev Schreiber , while Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose and his frequent collaborator , former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach , hung out toward the back .
Bach and Rose kept the rocker spirit going and were later spotted swilling wine at an after - party in NoHo until 8 a.m .

Via Greg Hengler , a clip that ’s not as surprising as it may at first seem .
The One ’s agenda has vaulted fiscal conservatism to the top of the list of right - wing priorities ; with even Darth Cheney sanguine about gay marriage , social issues simply do n’t have the same bite that they used to .
In fact , I ’m curious to know if Ed ’s gotten the same vibe at the convention that Time magazine ’s getting — namely , thanks to the GOP ’s tilt towards libertarianism , that the big tent is a little bigger this year than it used to be .
While I was flipping through the autobiography , a woman approached the booth .
Catherine Sumner , it turned out , was part of GOProud , a group of openly gay Republicans and conservatives that for the first time is taking part in CPAC .
“ Is this your flyer ? ” Sumner demanded , waving the white and green pamphlet .
Thus launched a debate about gays in the military that pretty much ended when the booth attendee told her that homosexuality is a sin and she ’s going to hell .
“ It ’s insulting , ” Sumner , 31 , who edits a military magazine , said turning away .
“ Across the board the reaction to GOProud ’s presence here has been positive , but then you have guys like this .
Even Dick Cheney came out and says he supports us .
Conservatives have to be more inclusive , they have to be . ”
In fact , just one group , Liberty University , boycotted CPAC over the inclusion of GOProud , though the Catholic crowd were n’t the only ones unnerved by their presence : one booth down from GOProud ’s set up in the fourth row , those manning the National Organization for Marriage , which works to ban gay marriage , kept casting nervous – and slightly envious – glances at the somewhat larger crowd surrounding GOProud ’s booth .
The tensions did n’t end there .
Along the back wall 2004 World Poker Champion Greg Raymer stood waiting for a talk radio interview .
“ Focus on the Family considers poker immoral , ” Raymer said , gesturing towards the Focus on the Family booth down an aisle .
“ They have no right to tell me what to do . ”
Raymer is at CPAC representing the Poker Players Alliance , which is lobbying to have a 2005 ban on Internet poker lifted – literally one of the last bills passed by the GOP before they lost control of Congress .
“ In the privacy of our own homes , consenting adults should be able to do whatever they want , ” Raymer said .
“ Gambling is legal in America .
They should n’t be mandating how we live .
If they consider it a sin , they should n’t do it .
But do n’t tell me I ca n’t do it . ”
Josh Koscheck was impressive in victory over Anthony Johnson © Getty Images Enlarge
Josh Koscheck has confirmed he will fight Britain 's Paul Daley at UFC 113 : Machida vs Shogun 2 , and he immediately made a point of targeting his next opponent : Tito Ortiz .
Koscheck is currently walking around with plenty of pent - up frustration , having seen Dan Hardy leapfrog him in the queue for a UFC welterweight title shot at Georges St - Pierre .
Koscheck had previously slipped down the rankings after a shock knockout loss to Paulo Thiago , who has since gone on to push himself into the title reckoning .
With at least six fighters attempting to prove themselves worthy of a crack at the welterweight crown , Koscheck knows he must stop the rise to prominence of Hardy 's " Rough House " stable mate Paul Daley , who has created waves since his UFC debut by knocking out Martin Kampmann and Dustin Hazelett .
Koscheck has already taken out one man with dynamite fists in Anthony Johnson , and now he is promising to do likewise to Nottingham - born Delay .
" OK here we go , let the s**t - talking start .
I am fighting Daley , May 1 co-main event UFC 113 .
This kid is going to get what he 's asking for , " Koscheck wrote on his Twitter page .
Daley has finished 18 of his 23 career victories by TKO or knockout , but it is his wrestling capabilities that Koscheck , a former Division I national champion and four - time All - American , will look to test .
And if the American succeeds , he already has his eye on stepping up a couple of weight divisions to take on light - heavyweight veteran and former champion Tito Ortiz .
Ortiz recently badmouthed Mark Coleman after " The Hammer " looked sluggish in defeat to Randy Couture , and Koscheck did not take kindly to seeing one of his icons disrespected .
Putting his money where his mouth is , the American Kickboxing Academy fighter said he would bet £ 100,000 he could beat Ortiz .
" Too little ?
Look at the old days of the UFC .
I would bet 100 k of my own money on it ... I want to kick big mouth 's ass , " wrote Koscheck .
Ortiz is currently preparing for The Ultimate Fighter 11 Finale , where he takes on Chuck Liddell .

GOOD evening , Madame Speaker .
I 'm always saying " Glad to 've met you " to somebody I 'm not at all glad I met .
But I 'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything .
I 'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me last year .
It started with the economy .
Bailout .
There 's a word I really hate .
It 's a phony .
I could puke every time I hear it .
We all hated each other 's guts after that .
You could see there was n't any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation .
I was sorry as hell I 'd started .
But if you 're supposed to sock somebody in the jaw , and you sort of feel like doing it , you should do it .
I 'm just no good at it though .
I 'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw .
I hate fist fights .
I do n't mind getting hit so much — although I 'm not crazy about it , naturally — but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy 's face .
I can't stand looking at the other guy 's face , is my trouble .
It would n't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something .
By now it should be fairly obvious that I did n't take on health care because it was good politics .
I had to sit there and listen to that crap .
I was surrounded by jerks .
I 'm not kidding .
It certainly was a dirty trick .
While I was in the cab coming over here , I took out my wallet and sort of counted our money .
I do n't remember exactly what we have left , but it 's no fortune or anything .
They 'd spent a king 's ransom in about eight lousy years .
They really had .
And I 'm a goddam spendthrift at heart .
What I do n't spend , I lose .
Half the time I sort of even forget to pick up my change , at restaurants and night clubs and all .
It drives Michelle crazy .
You can't blame her , though .
So we 're not going to spend any more .
One other thing I just thought of .
Washington 's terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night .
You can hear it for miles .
It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed .
That 's why I can't stand lobbyists .
They 're lawyers .
Those boys really haul it in .
One reason I know they 're quite well off , they 're always investing money in shows on Broadway .
But make no mistake .
Life is a gift horse , in my opinion .
There are nice things in the world — and I mean nice things .
We 're all such morons to get so sidetracked .
Let 's just try to have a marvelous time this year .
I mean not try to analyze everything to death for once , if possible .
Especially me .

Fatigue is n’t the only reason for black or dark circles under or around your eyes .
Under eye bags can actually be caused by a number of different factors .
The following are the most common causes of those unattractive dark circles .
8 common causes of dark circles under the eyes
1. Heredity :
Like varicose veins , dark circles under the eyes are usually an inherited trait .
If you have dark circles , there ’s a good chance that others in your family also have them .
The skin under the eye is very thin .
When blood passes through the large veins close to the surface of the skin it can produce a bluish tint .
The more transparent your skin , also an inherited trait , the darker the circles appear .
2. Exposure to the sun :
Even in darker skinned people , exposure to sunlight , especially during the summer months , can cause a higher - than - normal level of skin pigmentation ( melanin ) under the eyes .
People get suntans because exposure to the sun increases the natural pigmentation of the skin and draws that pigmentation to the surface .
The same principle applies to the skin under the eyes .
3. Allergies , asthma and eczema :
Any condition that you have that causes your eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles under the eyes because rubbing or scratching can darken the skin .
Hay fever sufferers particularly will notice under - eye “ smudges ” during the height of the allergy season .
Some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker .
4. Medications :
Any medications that you ’re taking that causes blood vessels to dilate , can cause circles under the eyes to darken .
Because the skin under the eyes is very delicate , any increase blood flow shows through the skin .
5. Nutrition :
A lack of nutrients in your diet , or the lack of a balanced diet , can contribute to the discoloration of the area under your eyes .
6 . Fatigue , lack of sleep :
A lack of sleep or excessive tiredness can cause paleness of the skin , which again allows the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear more blue or darker .
7. Pregnancy and menstruation :
The skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation , which again allows the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible .
8. Age :
If you tend to have dark circles show up under you eyes , as you grow older , they ’re likely to become more noticeable and permanent .
Excess folds of skin under the eyes will also make dark circles more pronounced causing eye bags .
Natural remedies to reduce dark circles
But the good news is that you can reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eyes , and in some cases make the disappear altogether .
1. Tea bags :
Try applying a cold compress of rosemary tea to increase circulation , which helps reduce swelling around the eyes .
Make tea by bringing a half - cup of fresh rosemary and a quart of water to a boil .
Steep for 20 minutes , then strain and chill .
Soak a washcloth in the tea , ring out extra liquid anal place over eyes for 15 to 20 minutes , once a day , as needed .
2. Acupressure :
Another circulation - boosting treatment is acupressure .
This is an easy exercise that you can also do every day .
Close your eyes and gently press your ring finger underneath one eye , moving from the inside corner to the outside corner .
Do this 10 to 15 times .
Then repeat on the other eye .
3 . Cold compress :
Close your eyes and cover them with a cold washcloth for about five minutes , says Dr. Monica .
Repeat several times throughout the day .
That will help constrict your blood vessels , minimizing darkness , and it may help minimize tissue swelling and eliminate some of the darkness .
4. Moisturize :
To minimize the appearance of bags , plump up skin with moisturizer , one that contains vitamin C , an antioxidant that protects skin cells from damage and supports collagen production ; licorice ( or fennel ) extract , an anti-inflammatory ; and stabilized oxygen , a form of hydrogen peroxide that promotes circulation .
5. Parsley cubes :
Freeze some parsley in ice cubes .
Use the parsley cubes instead of eye creams to diminish dark circles and puffiness .
Parsley is packed with chlorophyll which helps fade darkness , while the ice cubes reduce the swelling .
6 . Diet hack :
Eating a whole - foods , plant - based diet , drinking plenty of water ( eight 8 - ounce glasses daily ) , and avoiding alcohol , coffee , tea and caffeinated soft drinks also go a long way in preventing bags , circles and wrinkles .
7. Spread on the sunscreen :
Use a sunscreen especially made for the face with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of at least 15 , but preferably 20 , “ all day every day , ” to keep the sun ’s rays from darkening the skin under your eyes .
8 . Get more sleep :
Eight hours of sleep is a must for all of us , especially for people having dark circles under their eyes .
9 . Vegetable compress :
Close your eyes and cover eyelids with slices of raw potato or cucumber for 15 - 20 minutes .
Wash with warm water and apply a cream .
10 . Homemade pastes , creams , & compresses :
Grate a cucumber , squeeze to take out its juice and refrigerate .
Make a mixture of lemon juice , lanolin cream and cucumber juice and apply around the eye for 10 - 15 minutes .
Dip some cotton in a 1:1 mixture of potato and cucumber juices .
Put the cotton on your eyelids and keep for 20 minutes .
Wash your eyes with cold water .
Apply a mixture of lemon and tomato juice ( equal parts ) on the black circles 2 times a day .
Apply a paste of turmeric powder with pineapple juice for dark circles under the eyes .
Apply crushed mint around the eye .
Massage with almond oil under and around eyes at bed time daily for 2 weeks and see the improvement .
Almond helps to remove dark circles , and is an excellent “ skin food ” .
Remove the cream applied around the eye after 10 min .
No cream should be left on the skin around the eyes for long periods .
Rub the area with a powdered Vitamin E capsule and wipe off with a mixture of honey and egg white .
Put hot and cold clothes alternatively under eyes for 10 minutes .
Then apply some almond oil on the dark surface before going to bed .
11 . Simple eye mask :
Tomato , Turmeric and Lemon Juice Eye Mask
Make a paste out of the following ingredients .
Ingredients :
• 1 tsp. tomato juice
• ½ tsp. lemon juice
• a pinch of turmeric powder
• 1 tsp. of flour Directions :
• Apply paste carefully around eyes ( avoid getting into eyes ) .
• Leave on for 10 minutes before rinsing .
12 . Potato & cucumber compress :
Extract potato juice and cucumber juice in equal amounts .
Soak cotton wool in this and apply around the eyes .
It eliminates dark circles and refreshes the eyes .
13 . Egg white firming eye mask :
Astringent egg white tightens your pores and reduces puffiness .
Additionally , the high concentration of the B vitamins promotes circulation and reduces inflammation .
Check with the farm that produces your local organic eggs to make sure they ’ ve been tested for Salmonella , a bacteria that can cause serious infections , cautions Annie Berthold - Bond , the Rhinebeck , N.Y. - based author of Better Basics for the Home ( Three Rivers Press , 1999 ) .
Use your fingers to dab 1 / 2 teaspoon of one raw egg white onto the clean , dry skin around your eyes , avoiding your eyes .
Leave it on until it dries , about 15 minutes .
Then rinse the area well with warm water and wash your hands with soap and water .
14 . VisionTone or Purple Gold Cream :
According to traditional Chinese medicine , dark circles under the eyes are often caused by what ’s referred to as “ kidney deficiency . ”
This refers to the flow of the energy through the kidney “ meridian . ”
So called “ kidney deficiency ” can be caused by lack of sleep , chronic stress , poor diet , lack of exercise , excessive drinking , smoking or drugs .
Both VisionTone and Purple Gold Cream can help .

Scientists in Cambridge have made a significant step towards developing a so - called " artificial pancreas " system for managing type 1 diabetes in children .
The team has developed and successfully tested a new algorithm , providing a stepping stone to home testing for the artificial pancreas .
The new study -- funded by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ( JDRF ) and published in The Lancet -- shows that using an artificial pancreas system overnight can significantly reduce the risk of hypoglycemia , when blood glucose levels drop dangerously low , while sleeping .
These so - called " hypos " are a major concern for children and adults with type 1 diabetes .
An artificial pancreas system combines a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump , both already on the market , and uses a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the appropriate amount of insulin to deliver based on the real - time glucose readings .
As well as obviating the need for multiple daily finger prick tests and insulin injections , the artificial pancreas should offer better control of blood glucose levels overnight .
In the new study , 17 children and teenagers aged between 5 and 18 with type 1 diabetes were studied during 54 nights in hospital .
The team measured how well the artificial pancreas system controlled glucose levels compared with the children 's regular continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) pump , which delivers insulin at preselected rates .
The study included nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal or having done early evening exercise .
Both are challenging to manage , a large evening meal because it can lead to so - called " insulin stacking " and , as a result , a potentially dangerous drop in blood glucose levels later in the night , and late afternoon or early evening exercise because it increases the body 's need for glucose in the early morning and can therefore increase the risk of night time hypoglycaemia .
The pooled results showed the artificial pancreas kept blood glucose levels in the normal range for 60 % of the time , compared with 40 % for the CSII .
The artificial pancreas halved the time that blood glucose levels fell below 3.9 mmol / l -- the level considered as mild hypoglycaemia .
It also prevented blood glucose falling below 3.0 mmol / l , which is defined as significant hypoglycaemia , compared with nine hypoglycaemia events in the control studies .
According to lead author Dr Roman Hovorka of the Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge : " Our results show that commercially - available devices , when coupled with the algorithm we developed , can improve glucose control in children and significantly reduce the risk of hypos overnight . "
" This is the first randomised study showing the potential benefit of the artificial pancreas system overnight using commercially - available sensors and pumps .
Our study provides a stepping stone for testing the system at home . "
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic , life threatening condition which is on the increase in the UK , particularly in the under fives .
Children and adults require multiple daily insulin injections or pump infusions and many finger prick blood tests each day .
However , treatment with insulin brings with it the risk of hypoglycaemia , one of the most feared short - term complications of type 1 diabetes for children and their parents .
Recent technological developments in blood glucose monitors and devices for continuous administration of insulin -- such as those used in this study -- can improve blood glucose control , but more needs to be done .
Commenting on the results Karen Addington , Chief Executive of JDRF said : " This study is proof of principle that type 1 diabetes in children can be safely managed overnight with an artificial pancreas system .
We need to redouble our efforts to move the artificial pancreas from a concept in the clinic to a reality in the home of children and adults with type 1 diabetes . "

Researchers from the University of Minnesota 's Institute of Technology have found that the hydrodynamic environment of fish can shape their physical form and swimming style .
The research , available on the Journal of Experimental Biology Web site , was sponsored by the National Science Foundation 's National Center for Earth - surface Dynamics .
Catch a glimpse of a fish 's body shape , and you can often guess how speedy it is .
Tuna and mackerel look as if they should outpace frilly reef fish and eels .
But how have all of these diverse body shapes evolved ?
Have fish bodies been shaped by the hydrodynamics of their environment or did they evolve for other reasons ?
Turning to computational fish for answers , professor of Civil Engineering Fotis Sotiropoulos , along with postdoctoral researcher Iman Borazjani , from the university 's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory decided to race hybrid and realistic fish in a massive parallel computer cluster to find out what influence the aquatic environment has had on fish shapes and swimming techniques .
But building the computational fish was far from straightforward .
" We started this work over five years ago , " says Sotiropoulos .
" It was a challenge because we had never simulated anything living before . "
Borazjani explains that the hydrodynamic forces exerted on swimmers vary enormously depending on their size and speed .
Knowing that mackerel and eels swimming in water generate and thus experience different hydrodynamic environments , the duo simulated these different environments by varying tail beat frequencies and fluid viscosity ( syrupiness ) .
Building two computational mackerels ( one that beat its tail like a mackerel and a second that wriggled like an eel ) and two eels ( one that wriggled and another that beat its tail like a mackerel ) , the engineers set the fish racing from standing starts and noted how they performed .
The results showed clearly that all fish swam more efficiently if they had the body form or swimming style appropriate to the speeds at which they swam .
For example , a lamprey that needed to swim faster could gain efficiency -- which for a real fish would mean tiring less quickly -- if it changed its shape or swimming style to mimic a mackerel .
And a mackerel that had to move slowly would be more efficient if it could change shape or swimming style to mimic a lamprey .
This is evidence that a fish 's optimal range of swimming speeds generates hydrodynamic forces that influence the shape and swimming style it will evolve .
" From these experiments , we can deduce that real mackerel and eel 's swimming styles are perfectly adapted to the hydrodynamic environments that they inhabit , " says Sotiropoulos .
The method could be adapted to study how a fluid environment molds the evolution of other organisms and to design robots that would swim at different speeds or in water of different viscosities , the researchers say .
' Crabzilla ' :
The biggest crab ever seen in Britain ... and it's still growing
With its enormous legs and lethal claws , this monster of the deep is already the biggest crab ever seen in Britain .
But astonishingly , the arthropod - which measures a staggering 10ft from claw to claw - is still growing , and could live until it is 100 .
Nicknamed ' Crabzilla ' after the fictional giant monster , the Japanese Spider Crab has a body the size of a basketball and its legs can straddle a car .
They will eventually measure a massive 15ft .
Crabzilla : Derek Scales from the National Sealife Centre in Birmingham with the biggest crab in Britain
The crab , called Macrocheira kaempferi in Latin , was caught by fishermen in the Pacific Ocean and has now been imported to Britain where it has gone on display at the National Sea Life Centre in Birmingham .
Out of the water , the crab looks limp and languid because it cannot support its heavy limbs .
But in its own habitat - up to 2,500 ft down in the cold seas of the ocean - it is a lethal predator .
However , it also has predators of its own - humans - as it is considered a delicacy in Japan .
Graham Burrows , curator of the National Sea Life Centre in Birmingham , said : ' It is rumoured these crabs can grow to four metres across .
' Our open - topped ray tank has the icy cold waters Crabzilla needs , and will be his home until the end of March .
' He absolutely dwarfs the other crabs in there , but he 's not aggressive and they should have nothing to worry about . '
' He has already spent time in quarantine and ultimately will be moved to the Sea Life centre in Blankenberge in Belgium . '
He added : ' The Japanese Spider Crab is the largest known member of the arthropod family , which includes all invertebrates with jointed limbs .
' Crabzilla 's front limbs are his feeding arms , each over five feet long and ending in sizeable claws .
' They are a Japanese delicacy and are usually salted and steamed , but eating them in the spring is banned because that is when they lay their eggs . '
Here are quick wrapup on what has been said during the packaging session in the language summit that is happening today at Pycon .
The four major points are :
The implementation of the accepted PEPs that have been done lately will not happen in Distutils but in a new package in the Distribute project ( so logically in a “ distribute ” package ) .
This resolves backward compatibility issues : new features will be under the “ distribute ” namespace .
Distribute will stay a third - party package and will be integrated in the standard library once it has enough support and feedback from the community .
So this could happen in 3.3 ( or 2.8 😉 ) .
Some part that are useful for the existing distutils package might be added in the stdlib today .
But the idea is to stop adding features in distutils and focus on distribute .
The Hitchhicker ’s guide to packaging is going to be moved into the Python repository , so it becomes part of docs .
python.org .
It ’s not finished yet but it ’ll grow there .
Ian threw the idea to have virtualenv as a core feature , but he ’s not sure how yet .
Some brainstroming on this should happen during Pycon .
Manama : Algerian bloggers have welcomed a statement by their interior minister to apply the reciprocity principle on special terrorism - related air travel watch lists .
The US last month directed airlines to give US - bound travellers from 14 countries , including Algeria , full - body pat - downs .
following a botched effort by a Nigerian to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas ,
However , on Tuesday , Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said that it was " unacceptable " for Algeria to be on such list and that " if need be , we shall apply the rule of reciprocity . "
“ We will wait and see how the US is going to apply the precautionary measures it had talked about towards Algerian nationals .
Should the US move forward towards imposing specific monitoring measures , Algeria will announce its official stance on the matter , ” Zerhouni said at the end of a parliament session .
“ Should our nationals be subjected to exceptional control measures at US airports , we will not hesitate to apply the same principles in Algeria with the Americans , ” he said .
Algeria 's government last month summoned US ambassador David D. Pearce to protest the " unfortunate , unjustified and discriminatory " decision .
Algerians have accepted the move , claiming it was a matter of honour of the country .
However , several bloggers urged Zehrouni to include France in the reciprocity threats , arguing that Algeria was also among seven countries on a French list .
“ Do not forget France in your claims and do not confine the threats to the US , ” a reader identifying himself as “ the son of Algerian martyr Al Arbi Wahran ” wrote .
“ France has first to apologise for colonizing us for 135 years and must also pay compensations for all these year . ”

6 Things to Know About the 2010 Roth IRA Conversion
As you know , this year is a magical year for the Roth IRA retirement account .
It is possible to convert your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA , no matter your income .
For this one year , 2010 , anyone can convert a “ regular ” IRA into a Roth account , allowing your money to grow tax free .
This means that you wo n’t have to pay income taxes on it when you withdraw from the account .
( You should note , though , that there are still income restrictions on contributions to a Roth IRA .
Those have n’t been lifted for this year .
You can only do a rollover . )
However , before you jump on the Roth IRA conversion wagon , there are a few things you should consider .
Here are 6 things to know about the 2010 Roth IRA conversion :
You will probably end up with extra taxes :
When you put money in a traditional IRA , you putting the money in before taxes , lowering your taxable income .
That traditional IRA money has n’t been taxed , and the conversion treats the money your rollover to a Roth IRA as a distribution .
Which means that you will have to pay income taxes on it .
But once it ’s in the Roth account , it does grow tax free .
You can defer your conversion tax hit :
Even though you will likely be taxed on your conversion , you can defer it .
It is possible to report half of the income on your 2011 return , if you like , and the other half on your 2012 return .
This gives you time to work things out .
However , if you expect to be in a higher income tax bracket come 2011 and 2012 , it might be worth your while to report the entire conversion amount this year .
If you file an extension , you can procrastinate a little bit longer in making this decision .
You can make a partial conversion :
It ’s not an all or nothing proposition .
It is possible for you to make a partial conversion , only taking out a portion of what is in your traditional IRA and rolling it over into a Roth IRA .
Run the numbers , maybe with a financial professional , and then figure out how much sense it makes to convert all or part of your traditional IRA accounts to Roth IRA accounts .
You can act independently of your spouse :
You do what you want to do with traditional IRAs in your name , and your spouse does the same with those in his or her name .
What each of you does has no bearing on what the other does .
This can be helpful , since you might look to see what conversions would do to your money goals and your taxes .
Discuss this point especially if you are married filing jointly .
It is possible to set up multiple accounts :
If you are interested in trying some new things with a Roth account , you can hedge your investments with multiple Roth IRA accounts .
If you have a big traditional IRA , it does n’t mean that you have to get one big Roth IRA .
Instead , consider using several smaller Roth IRA accounts as hedges .
Or , make sure that you invest your money in a properly diversified manner in order to limit your risk .
Reversal of your Roth IRA conversion is possible :
If , after you complete a rollover , you decide that it was n’t such a good idea after all , you can reverse your conversion .
You have until October 17 , 2011 to change your mind .
You can even reclaim your tax hit if you decide to re-characterize your Roth IRA back to a traditional IRA .
Bottom line :
There are pros and cons to making a Roth IRA conversion .
If you think that you are going to be in a relatively high tax bracket during retirement , this might be a good time to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to avoid having your distributions count as income down the road .
But you will have to do a cost benefit analysis to ensure that the tax hit you take now is outweighed by tax savings down the road .
On January 19 Israel ’s international secret police , the Mossad , sent an eighteen member death squad to Dubai using European passports , supposedly ‘ stolen ’ from Israeli dual citizens and altered with fake photos and signatures , in order to assassinate the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud al Mabhouh .
The evidence is overwhelming : The Dubai police presentation of detailed security videos of the assassins was corroborated by the testimony of Israeli security experts and applauded by Israel ’s leading newspapers and columnists .
The Mossad openly stated that Mabhouh was a high priority target who had survived three previous assassination attempts .
Israel did not even bother to deny the murder .
Furthermore , the sophisticated communication system used by the killers , the logistics and planning surrounding their entry and exit from Dubai and the scope and scale of the operation have all the characteristics of a high - level state operation .
Furthermore , only Mossad would have access to the European passports of its dual citizens !
Only Mossad would have the capacity , motivation , stated intent and willingness to provoke a diplomatic row with its European allies , knowing full well that Western European governments ’ anger would blow over because of their deep links to Israel .
After meticulous investigation and the interrogation of 2 captured Palestinian Mossad collaborators , the Dubai police chief has stated he is sure the Mossad was behind the killing .
The Larger Political Issues
Israel ’s policy of overseas assassination raises profound issues that threaten the basis of the modern state : sovereignty , rule of law and national and personal security .
Israel has a publicly - stated policy of violating the sovereignty of any and all countries in order to kill or abduct its opponents .
In both proclamation and actual practice , Israeli law , decrees and actions abroad supersede the laws and law enforcement agencies of any other nation .
If Israel ’s policy becomes the common practice world - wide , we would enter a savage Hobbesian jungle in which individuals would be subject to the murderous intent of foreign assassination squads unrestrained by any law or accountable national authority .
Each and every state could impose its own laws and cross national borders in order to murder other nation ’s citizens or residents with impunity .
Israel ’s extra-territorial assassinations make a mockery of the very notion of national sovereignty .
Extra - territorial secret police elimination of opponents was a common practice of the Nazi Gestapo , Stalin ’s GPU and Pinochet ’s DINA and has now become the sanctioned practice of the US “ Special Forces ” and the CIA clandestine division .
Such policies are the hallmark of totalitarian , dictatorial and imperialist states , which systematically trample on the sovereign rights of peoples .
Israel ’s practice of extra-judicial , extra- territorial assassinations , exemplified by the recent murder of Mahmoud al Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room , violates all the fundamental precepts of the rule of law .
Extra -judicial killings ordered by a state , mean its own secret police are judge , jury , prosecutor and executioner , unrestrained by sovereignty , law and the duty of nations to protect their citizens and visitors .
Evidence , legal procedures , defense and cross examinations are obliterated in the process .
State - sponsored , extra- judicial murder completely undermines due process .
Liquidation of opponents abroad is the logical next step after Israel ’s domestic show trials , based on the application of its racial laws and administrative detention decrees , which have dispossessed the Palestinian people and violated international laws .
Mossad death squads operate directly under the Israeli Prime Minister ( who personally approved the recent murder ) .
The vast majority of Israelis proudly support these assassinations , especially
when the killers escape detection and capture .
The unfettered operation of foreign state - sponsored death squads , carrying out extra-judicial assassinations with impunity , is a serious threat to every critic , writer , political leader and civic activist who dares to criticize Israel .
Mossad Murders : Zionist Fire
The precedent of Israel killing its adversaries abroad , establishes the outer boundaries of repression by its overseas supporters in the leading Zionist organizations , most of whom have now and in the past supported Israel ’s violation of national sovereignty via extra-judicial killings .
If Israel physically eliminates its opponents and critics , the 51 major American Jewish organizations economically repress Israel ’s critics in the US .
They actively pressure employers , university presidents and public officials to fire employees , academics and professionals who dare to speak or write against Israeli torture , killing and systematic dispossession of Palestinians .
So far , most critical comments , in Israel and elsewhere , of Mossad ’s recent murder in Dubai focus on the agents ’ “ incompetence ” , including allowing their faces to be captured on numerous security videos as they clumsily changed their wigs and costumes under the camera gaze .
Other critics complain that the bungling Mossad is “ tarnishing Israel ’s image ” as a democratic state and providing ammunition for the anti-Semites .
None of these superficial criticisms have been repeated by the US Congress , White House or the Presidents of the Major Jewish American organizations , where the mafia rule of Omerga , or silence , reigns supreme and criminal complicity is the rule
Conclusion
While the critics bemoan the clumsy Mossad job , making it harder for Western powers to provide Israel with diplomatic cover for its operations abroad , the fundamental issue is never addressed :
The Mossad ’s acquisition and alteration of official British , French , German and Irish passports of dual Israeli citizen ’s underscores the cynical and sinister nature of Israel ’s exploitation of its dual citizens in the pursuit of its own bloody foreign policy goals .
Mossad ’s use of genuine passports issued by four sovereign European nations to its citizens in order to murder a Palestinian in a Dubai hotel room raises the question of to whom ‘ dual ’ Israeli citizens really owe their allegiance and just how far they are willing to go in defending or promoting Israel ’s overseas assassinations .
Thanks to Israel ’s use of British passports to enter Dubai and murder an adversary , every British businessperson or tourist traveling in the Middle East will be suspected of links to Israeli death squads .
With elections this year and the Labor and Conservative parties counting heavenly on Zionist millionaires for campaign funding , it remains to be seen whether Prime Minister Gordon Brown will do more than whimper and cringe !
Very , very sad news :

Australian researchers have measured the amount of entropy that exists now in the Universe .
They found that the Universe has much less energy available than had been previously measured .
Are they right ?
Is the Universe aging faster ?
The authors of the research are Charles “ Charley ” H. Lineweaver , a professor from the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Australian National University ( ANU ) , and Chas A. Egan , Ph.D. student at ANU .
Their articlewill be published in a future issue of the Astrophysical Journal Their analysis of the entropy within the Universe found that it is about 30 times higher than other projections had previously measured .
In other words , according to these researchers , the Universe has a thirty times higher entropy number than what was earlier calculated .
Entropy is a measure of energy expenditure of any system , such as the Universe .
The Universe began with a low entropy number ( low disorder ) .
However , as the Universe gets older its entropy number gets higher ( higher disorder ) as it expends more energy .
Thus , the higher entropy number ( the more entropy ) , the more energy has been expended .
Entropy is calculated to find out how efficient a system is , such as an engine or a Universe , and how quickly the system will run down .
Energy is continually expended in the Universe , and the more energy that has been expended in the past , the less energy that is available in the future .
In fact , Egan stated , “ The universe started out in a low entropy state and , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics , the entropy has been increasing ever since .
This is important because the amount of energy available to life in the universe , including terrestrial life , depends on the entropy of the universe .
” Page two continues .
Egan adds , [ScienceAlert.com.au : “ Black holes need high upkeep ” ]
The measurements by Lineweaver and Egan are based largely on the number of the black holes in the Universe , along with their masses .
Black holes are considered to contribute the most to entropy .
However , other matter of the observable Universe was also taken into consideration with respect to calculating entropy in our 13.7 billion - year - old Universe .
Considering everything , black holes are vastly more important to figuring out entropy in the Universe .
Egan states , He adds , [ ScienceAlert.com.au ]
Dr. Lineweaver compared their results to a car ’s gas tank .
He states , [ News.com.au : “ Universe heading towards ' heat death ' ” ] Page three continues .
However , their estimate is only a tentative measure at the moment .
Lineweaver stated , Currently , Lineweaver and Egan are looking into a measurement on how much longer the Universe will be able to support life .
However , they admit that this figure will be difficult to come up with because astronomers are unsure about how much energy was available at the beginning of the Big Bang , the start of our Universe .
The abstract to their paper ( “ A Larger Estimate of the Entropy of the Universe ” ) is found on the ArXiv.org website .
The researchers used mass - function measurements from supermassive black holes ( SMBHs ) .
They stated , They conclude in the abstract , However longer the Universe has left to support life , its end will come about like this analogy by Dr. Lineweaver .
He states , [ News.com.au ]
Earlier this month , the Real World Economics
Blog took votes on which economist should be blamed for blowing up the global economy .
The winner of the aptly - named Dynamite Prize in Economics was Alan Greenspan with 5,061 votes .
As Chairman of the Federal Reserve System from 1987 to 2006 , Alan Greenspan both led the over expansion of money and credit that created the bubble that burst and aggressively promoted the view that financial markets are naturally efficient and in no need of regulation .
Milton Friedman claimed second place with 3,349 votes .
He was credited with propagating the notion that the economy can be accurately modeled using counterfactual propositions .
Larry Summers came in third with 3,023 votes and was credited with the repeal of Glass - Steagall .
For the full results and to nominate economists for the next prize -- the Revere Award in Economics for foreseeing the crisis -- head to Real World Economics .

NASA ’s New Telescope Spots Near - Earth Asteroids
NASA ’s Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or WISE , is hard at work on its task of mapping the entire sky with infrared light .
Why ?
Planet - killing asteroids , that ’s why !
They ’re out there , and I ’m terrified !
And guess what ?
WISE ’s already brought home the bacon :
That red dot is WISE ’s first find – a . 6 - mile asteroid NASA ’s designated 2010 AB78 .
Will it collide with the planet , killing billions ?
Thankfully , no – due to its tilted orbit , it wo n’t come near earth for centuries – but thanks to the WISE we can now keep an eye on it .
How does WISE work ?
Well , I could tell you about it ’s onboard telescope with a 16 - inch aperture , a telescope designed to continuously sweep the sky at four infrared wavelengths as it spins about the earth .
I could tell you about its four detector arrays , capible of scanning ONE MILLION PIXELS each .
I could tell you all that , but I ’d just be regurgitating nonsense words , as I have no idea what any of that means .
Let me put this in words even I can understand : big telescope help save planet !
Earthlings grateful !
Asteroids bad !

Toyota 's recall of its Prius model this week was n't down to a mechanical fault but a software glitch .
Increasingly , computers are in control of our cars , says Paul Horrell , and that is changing our relationship with the open road .
In this week 's recall of the Toyota Prius , there is no faulty mechanical component .
All that 's necessary is a quick software update to recalibrate the electrically generated pedal " feel " in its braking system .
Which just goes to show how deeply computer control is embedded in today 's cars .
The Prius is such a famously economical car partly because of its regenerative braking system .
When the driver touches the brake pedal , there is no mechanical link to the normal brake discs .
In gentle braking , all that happens is the electric generator in the powertrain takes up the load , slowing the car by collecting its kinetic energy and re-charging its battery .
COMPUTERS IN A MODERN CAR Climate control unit - allows driver to control temperature with thermostat .
Also detects pollutants and shuts off air intake accordingly Alarm and immobiliser - controls security .
Engine starts when two codes sent wirelessly via aerial in steering wheel Engine management - controls fuel injection , engine temperature , ignition Wiper control - turns on wipers when it rains ; adjusts headlights to counteract heavy loads Automatic transmission - monitors weather , load , incline and position of accelerator to select best gear ABS - controls brakes in emergency and can brake any of four wheels to correct a potential skid Airbag - triggers front and side airbags in event of crash or impact Parking aid - operates warning signal to let driver know how close they are to object behind them
Q&A : Toyota recalls Connected cars ' promise safer roads '
Only when the driver brakes moderately hard , or when the battery is charged , do the electronics hand over the braking effort to the wheel discs .
For this to occur smoothly , instantly and predictably is an extraordinarily complex piece of control technology .
But then , while they do n't have this type of " brake by wire " , all modern cars do have some electronics in the brakes .
The anti-lock braking system ( ABS ) detects if a wheel has locked up , which causes a skid .
ABS corrects this by over - riding the mechanical command from the pedal , easing the braking pressure on the affected wheel .
Back in the 1980s , ABS , along with electronically regulated fuel injection , was one of the first pieces of electronics in cars .
They used to be a selling point - now they 're standard by law .
You can't have modern exhaust emission control without fuel injection , and electronic control is nowadays cheaper and more effective than mechanical .
As cars have become more economical over the years , the degree of electronic optimisation of the engine and transmission has grown .
And on hybrid cars such as the Prius and Honda Insight , it 's orders of magnitude more complex again .
All the driver does is press the throttle , but the powertrain electronics module independently controls both the petrol engine and the electric motor , and the transmission that blends them , to give the most economical drive at any given moment .
Many of today 's computerised systems take the load off the driver , for the sake of safety or convenience .
High - end cars have radar - based cruise control to vary their speed , keeping them a safe distance from the car in front .
" Crash mitigation " uses the radar to sense that the car in front has stopped or there 's an obstacle , and can apply the brakes if the driver fails to .
Trickle down effect Camera - based " lane - keeping assist " reads the road markings and nudges the steering to keep the car in its motorway lane .
And infra-red - based night - vision systems can recognise pedestrians and warn the driver if they 're stepping into the car 's path .
David ' Knight Rider ' Hasselhoff , prophet of the computer - car synthesis
These systems are beginning ( as with the new Audi A8 ) to link up with the satellite navigation , the better to predict the road ahead and work more smoothly .
And history has shown that these gadgets trickle down .
In five years or so they 'll be available , at least as options , on mid-market hatchbacks .
With this level of electronic driver support , wo n't cars soon be able to drive themselves ?
In fact car makers have built prototypes that can do just that .
But for years into the future they will stop short of selling them .
It 's too onerous to take legal responsibility away from the driver .
Even so , cars will continue to harvest more and more information about the world around them .
Rival manufacturers are co-operating to lay down an automotive wifi standard .
The aim is that in a few years from now vehicles will be able to set up ad - hoc car - to - car networks .
Cars would send and receive their position , direction and speed to neighbouring vehicles .
Your car would warn you if a vehicle was around a corner , coming towards you but hidden .
If you do n't apply the brakes , it could .
Soulless automation
This type of networking opens more possibilities .
Imagine a localised traffic jam in a city - a truck breaks down , say .
Cars that get stuck will report their position to neighbouring cars , which will pass it on to a wider pool of vehicles .
The navigation systems in vehicles a few streets away will be able to use this info to re-route and avoid the jam .
The golden days - some drivers dislike the feel of modern cars
So there 's no doubt computerisation is making every car more effective as a transport appliance .
But that 's a pretty dreary fate for the most expensive piece of technology we ever buy .
People do n't always want that level of soulless automation .
They want an individual relationship with their cars .
Electronics come to our aid here too .
And it goes beyond just having personal preferences for the entertainment and navigation interfaces .
Any system that 's governed or modulated by electronics can be re-programmed .
For most cars today that means the engine response , steering weight , suspension firmness , climate control , even engine sound .
It 's becoming common for cars to have a ' sport ' button on the dashboard .
This lets them feel more relaxed in town , but when the driver presses the button , their responses get more urgent on a faster country road .
The engineers for different car brands can go further with this , taking the same basic components ( because commonality reduces cost ) but baking in a particular character of driving feel by calibrating the firmware to suit their brand .
In an age where brands are a means of self - expression , that 's become a critical part of car marketing .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Electronic controls can produce wonderful efficiencies and extend capabilities for most automobile drivers .
The cautionary notes are these :
- failure mode of these computers or the functions which they control must be such that there are no critical repercussions ;
- ultimately control must be available to the driver when extenuating circumstances exist that are not handled by the system as programmed .
Rick Contestabile , Brookings , Oregon , US
The real problem is the interconnectivity of the systems in cars .
The functions that make up a car used to be separate components , so a fault in the braking system could not possibly affect the engine management .
Now it is common for the systems in the car to be made up of a network of components that communicate over data buses in a similar way to office computer systems .
As a result a single failure could result in multiple failures if a great deal of care is not taken with the design .
Andy Cole , Ulverston
All credit to the folk who manage to design , write and test this complex software which needs to be faultless to ensure the safety of the vehicle which is controlled .
Theme for detective drama : programmer modifies braking software on victims car to cause fatal crash at critical point in journey , causing murder with no murder weapon ?
Peter Fisk , Doddinghurst , Essex , England
By all means refine things like the engine and braking , but when we start having rain - sensing wipers , dark - sensing lights , the car nudging us back into our lane , braking for us ... that 's too far .
There are enough bad drivers without these additional aids to encourage complacency .
Look at the number of motorcycle riders who are sceptical at ABS now that more and more bikes are offering it as a feature !
Stephen W , Caerphilly
Any more loss of control and you might as well take the train !
However , my basic concern is lack of feel ; power steering in particular , which is totally unnecessary on all but the largest cars .
Most people nowadays drive " digitally " - constantly on and off the accelerator , and steering as if playing a computer game rather than controlling a 3D object with momentum .
Such a loss of driving skill and mechanical appreciation , detracts from all the engineering improvements in safety and efficiency .
The basic ignorance of how to deal with a sticking pedal is a case in point !

JERUSALEM — Archaeologists said Wednesday that they have unearthed a section of a stone street in Jerusalem that provides important new evidence about the city 's commercial life 1,500 years ago .
The 19 - foot ( 5.8 - meter ) section of street passes from the west into the center of Jerusalem 's Old City , coming to a stop at a large cistern that supplied water to the city 's residents .
Pottery , coins and bronze weights used to measure precious metals from Byzantine times were also found at the site .
The discovery conforms to the layout of the city depicted in a mosaic map discovered earlier in a Jordanian church , said excavation director Ofer Sion of the Israel Antiquities Authority .
The map has long been used as a guide to understanding the shape of the city during the 4th through 6th centuries and the discovery of the street proves the map is correct .
" This street was the center during the most ( commercially ) successful period in the history of ( ancient ) Jerusalem , " he said .
" It is wonderful that ( today 's street ) actually preserved the route of the noisy street from 1,500 years ago . "
Working from the historic map , archaeologists three months ago uncovered covered the section of street 14 feet ( 4.3 meters ) below the current street level .
The map , taken from a Byzantine - era church in Madaba , Jordan , shows the locations of major streets and the Christian sites in the city , including the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , the site where the faithful believe Jesus was buried .
Once restoration work is completed , within the next few weeks , the segment of street will be covered because of heavy pedestrian traffic in the area , Sion said .
It seems iPad lack of Flash support is the debate of the moment .
On one camp : “ You ca n’t use the web without Flash ” , on the other camp : “ We do n’t need no stinking Flash ” .
Although I do realize how a technology like Flash is sometimes needed , I ’m more on the second camp .
The less flash , the better .
I think iPad ’s lack of Flash cause two things to happen :
Slow down the adoption of the iPad : surely someone will say “ No Flash , No iPad “ .
Speed up the adoption of HTML5 : surely someone will consider using HTML5 to support the tablet .
Giving that the iPad is a closed device , probably the closedest non-phone computer consumers ever had access to and that HTML5 is good progress for the web , I consider both results of the iPad not having Flash positive .
If I have to say anything about it , it ’d be : please , stop trying to wake Steve Jobs up regarding this , you ’ll ruin it .
Pull up a chair , here 's a tumbler of scotch , and help yourself to the sybian , good times that we 'll all remember .

An over - emphasis on tackling new and emerging security threats may be causing companies to overlook older but far more frequently exploited vulnerabilities , says a recent report .
The report , from TrustWave , is based on an analysis of data gathered from over 1,900 penetration tests and over 200 data breach investigations conducted on behalf of clients such as American Express , MasterCard , Discover , Visa , and several large retailers .
[ Also in InfoWorld : " Companies patch OS holes , but biggest priority should be apps . " | Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes ' Security Adviser blog and Security Central newsletter , both from InfoWorld . ]
The analysis showed is that major global companies are employing " vulnerability chasers " and searching out the latest vulnerabilities and zero - day threats while overlooking the most common ones , the report said .
As a result , companies continue to be felled by old and supposedly well - understood vulnerabilities rather than by newfangled attack tools and methods .
For instance , the top three ways hackers gained initial access to corporate networks in 2009 were via remote access applications , trusted internal network connections and SQL injection attacks , TrustWave found .
All three attacks points have been well researched and known about for several years .
SQL injection vulnerabilities , for instance , have been known about for at least 10 years , but still continue to be widely prevalent in Web - based , database - driven applications , TrustWave said .
The most common vulnerability that TrustWave discovered during its external network penetration tests had to do with the management interfaces for Web application engines such as Websphere , and Cold Fusion .
In many cases , the management interfaces were accessible directly from the Internet and had little or no password protection , potentially allowing attackers to deploy their own malicious applications on the Web server .
Similarly unprotected network infrastructure components such as routers , switches and VPN concentrators represented the second most common vulnerability unearthed by TrustWave .
The tendency by many companies to host internal applications on the same server that also hosts external content was another common vulnerability , as were misconfigured firewall rules , default or easy - to - guess passwords and DNS cache poisoning .
Meanwhile TrustWave 's wireless penetration tests unearthed common weaknesses such as the continued use of WEP encryption , legacy 802.11 networks with minimal to no security controls and wireless clients using public " guest " networks instead of secured private networks .
In almost all of the cases , the most common vulnerabilities unearthed by TrustWave were common well - understood issues that should have been addressed a long time ago said Nicholas Percoco , senior vice president at TrustWave 's SpiderLabs research unit .
" There are basically two themes , " Percoco said .
" Through our study in 2009 we found some very old vulnerabilities present within enterprises , some as old as 20 to 30 years . "
The second theme is that attackers are targeting these old flaws to break into enterprises , then using increasingly sophisticated tools to harvest data from companies , he said .
In addition to older keystroke logging and packet sniffing tools , malicious attackers are increasingly employing tools such as memory parsers and credentialed malware to steal data , Percoco said .
Memory parsers are used to monitor the random access memory associated with a certain process and to extract specific data from it .
Credentialed malware programs are a new class of multi-user programs that have typically been used to steal money and payment card numbers from ATMs .
There are several measures companies can take to mitigate the risks posed by older and often overlooked vulnerabilities , TrustWave said .
One step is to maintain a complete asset inventory .
Many companies are often unaware of all the IT assets they own or of the risks they pose to data , so maintaining an up to date list of assets is vital to protecting them , TrustWave said .
Decommissioning older legacy systems as much as possible can also help mitigate the risk .
Also , in 80 % of the cases that TrustWave looked at , third - parties were responsible for introducing vulnerabilities .
So monitoring third - party relationships is key according to the company .
Other recommended measures included internal network segmentation , data encryption and stronger Wi -Fi security policies .

‘ Avatar ’ Now Second Highest Grossing Movie of All Time
The 3 - D film Avatar has finally taken the second spot for highest grossing film of all time–ending the six year stay in the silver spot of The Lord of the Rings : Return of the King .
The film stands at $ 1.175 billion , which is 700 million dollars below of gold medalist Titanic , the last movie that Avatar director James Cameron directed .
Avatar is only on its fourth week of release .
It entered the billion dollar club last week whose other members include Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man ’s Chest and The Dark Knight .
The alien flick entered the top ten highest grossing movies in the United States .
It is threatening to get the highest grossing film of 2009 from Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
The giant robots have 402 million dollars domestic sales , while the Nav ’i people currently have 393 million dollars .
Avatar is currently at the top of the charts for its fourth weekend at 13 million dollars , defeating Sherlock Holmes , Daybreakers , Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel and Leap Year .
Second place Holmes is only at 5.9 million dollars .
Labour is dreaming up 33 new crimes a month ... including barring you from swimming into the Titanic
Labour has created 4,300 new crimes since taking power - including a ban on swimming in the wreck of the Titanic and on the sale of game birds shot on a Sunday .
Gordon Brown has been the worst offender in this unprecedented ' legislative splurge ' , with his Government creating new offences at the rate of 33 a month .
Under Tony Blair , Labour invented 27 new ways of criminalising the public every month .
One of Labour 's laws makes it illegal to swim over the hull of the Titanic
The ' crimes ' range from swimming in the hull of the Titanic without the permission of a Cabinet Minister to ' disturbing a pack of eggs ' when instructed not to by an authorised officer .
In total , between 1997 and 2009 , 4,289 new criminal offences were created - approximately one for every day ministers have been in office .
It is twice the rate at which new crimes were created under the last Tory administration .
They include offences - such as carrying out a nuclear explosion - which could easily be covered by existing laws .
Others are simply bewildering , such as the ban on the sale of game birds shot on a Sunday - or Christmas Day .
This stems from the fact it is illegal , for ancient religious reasons , to shoot the birds on a Sunday - so the Government felt the need to also make it illegal to sell birds shot on a Sunday , to reinforce the point .
Liberal Democrat home office spokesman Chris Huhne , who uncovered the figures , will attack the Government 's law - making frenzy in a speech tonight .
He will say : ' Over the past 12 years , this Labour Government has been suffering from the most acute and prolonged bout of legislative diarrhoea .
' We have had 69 Home Affairs Bills in 12 years , an average of almost six per year .
This is a staggering - volume to have added to the statute books in such a short time , and this is just the two departments of the Home Office and the Justice Department .
' The " bill teams " in departments are possibly among the most productive parts of the public sector .
Unfortunately , the product is in too many cases virtually worthless . '
Many of the new laws are backed by powers to enter people 's home without a warrant to check they are not being breached .
Mr Huhne wrote to Justice Secretary Jack Straw urging him to repeal some of the laws .
But , in reference to the crime of ' disturbing a pack of eggs ' , Mr Straw said : ' Egg marketing inspectors must be able to ensure that eggs suspected of being marketed in contravention of EU regulations are not tampered with . '
He added : ' I am sorry that you regard these offences as unnecessary .
In their different ways they are important pieces of legislation . '
Have you joined my incredibly non-annoying , once - in - a - while email newsletter ?
First off –
This is n’t some Tim Ferris garbage about how you can live on an island and only work between 5:48 pm and 5:49 pm .
If you do n’t love what you do , this is n’t going to help you , stop reading now , as geographic location is the least of your worries .
I LIKE work .
Hell – I LOVE what I do .
I ’m fortunate enough to have a good paying career in an industry that I love .
I supplement my main career with a speaking career that ’s quickly becoming a second full - time career – Finally , I consult to companies all around the world on marketing , social media , and customer service .
So believe me – I ’m busy .
But the difference here , is that I ’m busy from anywhere I WANT to be .
That ’s the ADHD version of this blog post – and what I hope you ’ll take away from it :
You too can work just as hard , or just as little – as you always have – But you can do it from wherever you want .
Yes , you .
YOU .
Specifically .
Yes .
You .
Because to be honest , I ca n’t imagine anything scarier than waking up on my deathbed , wondering where my life went outside of the office .
I started my trip a few weeks ago in Omaha , Nebraska , keynoting a conference .
From there , I flew to Miami to run the Miami ING Half Marathon , then , after a day of meetings in Miami , headed to Nashville , TN , where I spoke at another conference .
From Nashville , I flew to New York City for one evening , and then boarded a flight from Newark to Los Angeles , where I connected on a Qantas flight to Sydney , Australia .
I ’ve just spent the past seven days down under , both for meetings and pleasure , and I ’m now writing this on a flight from Brisbane , Australia , back to Los Angeles , where I ’ll connect to New Orleans to cover Mardi Gras for 72 hours , then fly to Newark , onto Frankfurt , wake up on the plane in the morning to connect to another eight - hour flight to Bangalore , India , where I ’ll be speaking at a conference .
I ’ll be home on or around the 23rd of February for about two days , after which , I ’ll fly to Sacramento , CA , to speak at an SPSA event , then fly to LA for meetings with several film and TV agents .
I ’ll be home again Saturday , the 27th , to enjoy my first weekend in my apartment in approximately a month , prepared to defend myself against a 24 - hour assault of “ where were you ?
We ’re hungry .
Pay attention to us ” from two overweight cats , looked after by both my wonderful assistant Meagan , and from time to time , my mother .
Over the entire month of this massive trip , I never once went into an “ office ” to work .
Yet , I launched the new HARO , sold over $ 50 k of advertising on the new site , accepted seven new keynote speech requests , two consulting jobs , and sent presents to three people , two for birthdays , and one as a thank you .
Additionally , I paid all my bills , from my rent and mobile bills , to my incredibly overpriced attorney .
I signed my lease renewal forms ( after negotiating a substantial rate decrease over the phone ) and was able to have a prescription faxed to a pharmacy a block away from a hotel in which I was staying .
I did n’t miss an episode of 24 , Burn Notice , or Dollhouse thanks to iTunes subscriptions , and I followed the Superbowl from 12,000 miles away on my Blackberry , getting as frequent updates as I would if I was in my office during the game .
Ladies and Gentlemen , Geography has officially died and been reborn .
Let us mourn it briefly , and move the hell on .
Good riddance to the old , I say .
Work geography is dead .
Long live Life Geography .
What follow are the new rules of Geography – How to live , work , and play , while being as mobile as you want – from one day a month out of the office , to deciding to take four weeks and work from Whitsunday , QLD , as I ’m contemplating doing sometime later this year .
Rule One :
In 2010 , no one gives a damn where you are , and rightfully so .
I had a phone call with a HUGE potential HARO partner while I was in Sydney .
I held the conference call at three in the morning , from my desk in my hotel room , via Skype .
My COO was in Scottsdale , Arizona .
The only reason anyone on the call knew where I calling from was because they followed my blog .
One of them said he was amazed I was on the call , to which I replied , “ I ’m surprised you ’re in your office – I hear it ’s snowing something fierce in Chicago . ”
The rise of the mobile revolution has given us tremendous power .
You think the Blackberry is an electronic leash , and the mobile phone a tool to keep an eye on you ?
You ’re thinking about it totally , totally wrong .
These are the tools of freedom , like a pick - axe or overturned verdict is to a convict .
The fact is , the majority of bosses do not care from where you work , as long as the work gets done , on time , and exceeding the quality expected .
One of my editors , Laura Spaventa , was producing the HARO out of her parents ’ place in Philly .
She ’s since moved to New York City , living on her own for the first time .
The only reason I even know this ?
Meagan reminded me to buy her a housewarming gift .
She ’s never slacked off on her work , her work quality continues to get better , and for all I know , she could be producing the HARO with Ariel , under the sea .
It does n’t matter to me , as long as she gets it done , which she does , perfectly .
She has a Mac , a wireless card , and power .
That ’s all she needs .
Location is irrelevant .
If your boss does n’t agree with this , perhaps it ’s time to find a new boss .
Remember the wonderful quote : “ If you ca n’t change the people around you , change the people around you . ”
How to convince your boss …
If you work for someone else , the key is under - promising and over - delivering .
Your goal is to prove that you ’re so valuable , your work so awesome , that it does n’t matter from where you do it .
In fact , you want to prove that you ’re even MORE valuable when you ’re let go from your office chains –
You ’re more creative , more aware of deadlines , more able to get done that which needs doing when you ’re NOT bound to a desk in an office park .
Some easy ways to ease your boss into it without him or her knowing he or she is being eased :
a ) Start producing your work and emailing at different times of the day .
Project due at 5 pm on Thursday ?
Submit it via email at 3:45 am on Wednesday .
When you walk into the office in the morning , casually mention to your boss that the project is in his email , waiting for him .b )
Start setting up more video calls , less in - person meetings .
The more you can get people used to not physically sharing the same space with you , the less they ’ll care when you ’re not actually there , but rather , calling in from Pongo Pongo . c )
Start small :
Get an afternoon project out of the way in the morning , and spend your lunch hour in a spin class , or a run around the local park or gym .
Come back a little bit later – End result is , the afternoon project was already done light years ago , right ?
Take your berry , but chances are , you wo n’t need it .d )
Email , email , email .
Instead of popping down the hall to Bob ’s office , shoot a quick note , drop an IM , a BBM , again , anything that does n’t require your physical appearance .e)
This is key :
When you DO make an appearance , make sure you ’re noticed .
Remember –
You ’re working just as hard as everyone else – probably harder –yet there will ALWAYS be some dumbass in the office that notices that you ’re not there as much , and tries to give you hell for it .
Your goal is to counter by again , over - delivering .
Try “ Hey boss , while I was skiing this weekend , I had a few hours by the fire to look over those financial statements and noticed a few spots where we could tighten and save the company some cash .
I ’ll email them over to you later – I guess a fireplace just makes it easier for me to work . ”
You ’ll never convince everyone that working out of the office is for them .
Your job is to make it clear that it ’s for you .
Screw them .
Rule 2 : Even the Aborigines have mobile broadband .
Mobile Internet is everywhere .
I mean , everywhere .
Next month , Continental Airlines is rolling out GoGo inflight internet , becoming yet another of a growing number of major carriers to offer Internet in the air .
Laptop 3G and 4G cards are available on incredibly cheap plans , ( $ 50 a month , give or take ) and they work virtually everywhere , as well .
What ca n’t you do from a coffee shop in Berlin that you can do in the office ?
Seriously .
Tell me in the comments , and I ’ll tell you why you ’re wrong .
The only answer I ’ll accept is “ shake someone ’s hand ” – and I ’ll get to that later .
When I was in Asia last year , I discovered something awesome – AIM , Google Chat and the like , all work on your blackberry or iPhone .
Just keep yourself logged in .
Respond if you have to , just like you would at a desk .
Rule 3 : You ’re not as damn important as you think you are .
Rule 3 corollary :
If your Blackberry is shut off for seven hours , the world will continue to spin .
This Australia trip was one of the first times I actually went truly off the grid for periods of time greater than the time it takes me to ride the A train from Columbus Circle to West 4th Street .
It ’s kinda hard to thumb while rappelling down a waterfall or snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef , and so , for the first time , I did n’t .
( I know at least three people who are jumping up and down right now and shouting praise to the heavens after reading that . )
I got to the start of the reef tour at 7:15 am ( 5:15 pm New York time ) and shut off my berry around 8:30 am , when I lost signal .
I did n’t turn it on again until around 5 pm , ( 2 am EST ) – I had about 30 emails that came in during that time .
I replied to the ones that mattered , and no one felt like they were n’t being taken care of because I took a few hours to reply .
Truth be told , this is probably the hardest rule to swallow , especially for die hard connected thumbers like me .
If we ca n’t tweet it , it did n’t happen .
If we ca n’t Facebook it , it does n’t exist .
If the email comes in and we ca n’t answer it within four seconds , it wo n’t matter .
To an extent , I still believe that – But I ’m getting better .
Just because I ’m off the grid for seven hours or so , does n’t mean I ca n’t post the photos , tweet the funny story , or answer the email the second I come back into range .
I tried it on this trip .
Holy cow , was it freeing .
I mean , really , really freeing .
You know what it ’s like to not be afraid to get soaked by a wave from your boat because you do n’t have anything electronic on you ?
IT ’S FREAKING AWESOME !
Rule 4 : If you really need to shake someone ’s hand , then armed with nothing more than a credit card , you can truly be anywhere in the world , from anywhere in the world , in less than 29 hours , and usually , in much less time than that .
I left New York City on a 3:30 pm flight to LAX , arriving six hours later .
I had a three - hour layover ( where I could email and work ) and then a 15 - hour flight to Sydney .
24 hours total , 21 of which I was incommunicado .
Within a year , all airlines will have wi-fi , so those 21 hours wo n’t matter anyway .
You need to be somewhere else tomorrow to solve a major crisis that just popped up ?
Does n’t matter where in the world you are – if you need to be , you can be .
It ’s that simple .
Show up at the airport , ask the first gate agent you see to help you plot a course – or – even smarter , have a credit card with a travel concierge , who will do it for you , for no additional charge , even before you leave wherever you happen to be .
These people route other people for a living –
They ’ve gotten me connections that I did n’t even know EXISTED .
They ’re like FedEx Human Transport –
They can get you where you need to go , when you absolutely , positively , have to get there overnight .
The crisis that really is n’t :
When you snorkel and watch fish , you have a lot of time to think .
I imagined a crisis brewing while I was out of contact .
Let ’s say it was 2 pm .
I ’d be back on land by 4:30 pm .
If something happened , I could catch the 6:50 pm from Whitsunday Airport , landing in Brisbane at 8 pm , then I could work all night , and if I really , really needed to , could grab the first Qantas into LA the next day .
And chances are , I could solve whatever crisis occurred from my hotel room , using Skype and email .
Think about it – Really think about it – When was the last time your physical presence was truly , TRULY required to solve a problem ?
You see all the movies where the boss or head of whatever jumps out of the helicopter that just landed on the roof , and is being briefed as he ’s walking down the stairs to the boardroom .
If you ’re really that important , chances are you have a full office on your private jet , and do n’t need to read my blog .
Rule 5 : A conference room looks the same , whether in Boston or Bali , Brisbane or Bangalore .
I know this for a fact .
Based on the rules above , if you ’re somewhere you ’ve never been , take a few extra hours , hell , a few extra days , to explore .
Why rush home ?
You ’re already in the new place !
Why waste it ?!
Full disclosure – I used to !
I ’d rush to the airport and head to the security of the President ’s Club lounge – I felt safe there , would n’t miss my flight , etc .
What ’s the point ?
Why not take a few hours and do something ?
Almost every city or town , at the very least , has a walking tour , a downtown tour , an anything tour – It ’s something to do , you can learn a bit more – and you leave a bit more fulfilled then when you got there .
At the very least , find a new jogging trail and go explore .
The only thing I ’ve ever learned at the President ’s Club is which people talk the loudest on their cell phones .
Rule 6 : Entrench yourself with the tools , and life becomes cream cheese .
These are my tools .
They allow me to work anywhere in the world , at any time , day or night .
You might use some , or all , or different ones .
( If you have ones I ’m missing , tell me in the comments . )
Most of them are technical in nature , but not always .
Some are basic things that you never associated with the way I ’m going to explain them – some are common sense .
For more specific tips on how I travel , see my post from last year : “ Tools of my Travel Trade . ”
And of course , these are in no particular order .
a) Worldwide mobile phone with data and voice ( AT&T seems to have the most decent coverage overseas for now . ) b )
Laptop that works everywhere , and is strong enough to put up with my daily abusec ) World - wide current converterd ) My Canon G10 , Flip HD , and Panasonic HDC - HS3003 ) A Timex Ironman watch with multiple city settings .
I always keep # 1 on NYC time .
# 2 is where I am .
It makes me feel like I ’m never far from what I know . f)
Ogio backpack and luggageg ) Scott - e- Vest for travel and getting stuff through securityh ) Skypei ) $ 100 in local currency .
This helps more than you could ever know – Will get you back to the airport quicker , too . j )
FourSquare and Twitter – I met someone in Manly Beach , Sydney , that I never met before .
We were in the same bar in the same hotel , and found it out via FourSquare and Twitter .
Bottom line ?
This can be done .
You can work from anywhere .
You can love what you do , and do it from a place you love .
I ’m living proof .
Do you do it ?
Have you done it ?
Tried to do it ?
Leave suggestions or stories in the comments – Top two win – One an Ogio bag , and one a Scott–e - vest .
Former NFL star Warren Sapp was arrested by Miami Beach police this afternoon and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery stemming from an allegedly violent confrontation with his girlfriend .
According to the Miami Beach Police Department , Sapp is accused of attacking his girlfriend of two years at around 5:00 AM Saturday at the Shore Club Hotel .
According to the arrest report , the alleged victim had " a swollen right knee and bruises on the back of her neck . "
She claims Sapp allowed her to sleep in his hotel room -- then came into the room early in the morning and pulled her out of bed .
The alleged victim says they began arguing about guys she was hanging out with earlier Friday night .
Sapp 's girlfriend told cops that during the argument Sapp " grabbed her and began to choke her . "
He eventually threw her out of the room , she claims .
When cops spoke to Sapp , he told them he had allowed the woman to stay in his room -- but later on decided he wanted her to leave because " he was expecting company . "
He told police he was trying to help her and she fell .
Sapp is in Miami for the Super Bowl and serves as an analyst for the NFL Network and on Showtime 's " Inside the NFL . "
The NFL Network released a statement saying they were aware of the incident and that Sapp will not appear on the NFL Network until they review the matter .
President Obama has followed up on his support for " a new generation of safe , clean nuclear power plants , " laid out Jan. 27 in his State of the Union speech , by proposing to triple public financing for nuclear power .
The Department of Energy recently proposed $ 36 billion in new federal loan guarantees on top of $ 18.5 billion already budgeted – for a total of $ 54.5 billion .
That 's enough to help fund six or seven new power plants .
It 's a full - speed nuclear - power gambit that many say is largely a bid to win votes from pro-nuclear senators for legislation to address climate change .
But his strategy is generating a firestorm of opposition , amid warnings that much more is at stake than a political calculus .
From environmentalists to fiscal hawks to nuclear security experts , the Obama plan is sparking near - open revolt .
The nuclear - power expansion is not accompanied by any plan to store commercial radioactive waste , they note , and includes a new push by the Department of Energy into spent - fuel reprocessing and small " pocket nuke " reactor research , which they see as a proliferation risk .
The Obama nuclear policy is at cross purposes to his nonproliferation goals , they add , and might even cement his energy legacy as the president who revived a moribund industry that had n't built a nuclear plant in decades because of the financial , environmental , and security risks involved .
" It 's ironic , but Obama could end up being the biggest pro-nuclear power president since Dwight Eisenhower , " says Henry Sokolski , executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center , a nuclear deterrence expert who served as deputy for nonproliferation policy in the Department of Defense from 1989 - 1993 under President George H.W. Bush .
One antidote to global warming ?
Among environmentalists , who saw Mr. Obama as a friend of renewable energy , the sense of betrayal is acute .
" Every new nuclear power plant built would be a step backwards when it comes to solving global warming , " Anna Aurilio , a spokeswoman for Environment America said a statement .
" Clean energy solutions like energy efficiency and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are far more effective . "
Obama 's stance won plaudits from the industry , however .
" The administration 's initiative will make a meaningful difference in bringing about development of the nuclear energy facilities that our nation needs , " Marvin Fertel , president of the Nuclear Energy Institute , said in a statement .
Budget hawks have a different set of concerns .
They oppose government " subsidies " to the industry ( in the form of federal loan guarantees ) , saying taxpayers assume a huge risk given the industry 's track record of cost overruns – and loan defaults – in the 1980s .
" We did n't have good experience recently with the mortgage industry , and we ought to keep that in mind with nuclear power , " says Doug Koplow , president of Earthtrack , an energy consulting firm .
" For each power plant , we 're talking about something like $ 8 billion in taxpayer exposure to a single asset owned by a private firm .
To me that seems unprecedented . "
Various studies and the US Government Accountability Office warn of potential loan default rates on the order of 50 percent .
The Department of Energy , though , says safeguards are in place to prevent that .
" Regulatory changes and contractual changes implemented in this round of nuclear construction lay the foundation for the US to deliver on time and on budget , " Jennifer Lee , a DOE spokeswoman says in an e-mail response to questions .
" Each loan is specifically structured to protect the taxpayer against cost over - run risk . "
Nuclear strategy not ' coherent '
The president 's new budget also proposes to eliminate funding for the controversial Yucca Mountain nuclear - waste repository .
He has appointed a blue - ribbon commission to look into other options , which many say would likely include fuel reprocessing .
" I 'm reluctant to say this , because I admire the Obama administration , but its nuclear strategy no longer appears to be coherent , " says Edwin Lyman , an expert on nuclear power with the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" It does n't have a plan for [ storing ] radioactive waste from a new generation of nuclear power plants .
That is irresponsible . "
Even nuclear power advocates are upset by the absence of a waste - storage plan .
" There is a significant regulatory and waste - management risk with building a nuclear power plant today , " says Jack Spencer , research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a nuclear power advocate .
" This tells me he 's just not as serious about nuclear power as he says he is , because appointing a blue - ribbon commission is just kicking the can down the road . "
Such criticism is unwarranted , says the Obama administration .
" The Administration is committed to addressing our used fuel and nuclear waste management needs , " writes the DOE's Ms. Lee .
" We have established a Blue Ribbon Commission on America 's Nuclear Future to bring together leading experts to provide recommendations for developing a safe , long - term solution to managing the Nation 's nuclear fuel and its waste . "
A risk of spreading nuclear know - how
Meanwhile , the White House has grudgingly agreed that the Department of Energy can push ahead with research into " pocket nukes " – small nuclear reactor designs – and spent - fuel reprocessing .
Both areas could lead to the spread of nuclear know - how to many small developing countries , say nuclear security experts .
When crafting the new White House budget plan , the Office of Management and Budget had actually slashed money for reprocessing and small reactor research .
But in a Dec. 22 letter , Energy Secretary Steven Chu argued for restoring funding for both .
The White House blinked .
Funding was restored .
The president 's latest moves are at odds with his earlier focus on leading " an international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years , " and on securing new arms - reduction deals with the Russians , say other nuclear security experts .
" None of this makes any sense from a security or economic standpoint , " says Mr. Sokolski .
" I served on a bipartisan committee that just recommended that the US put a moratorium on commercial reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel . "
The DOE 's research program for spent fuel reprocessing " is a long - term science - based research and development program , " says Lee , noting that " advancements in the area of non-proliferation are an integral part " of it .
Concerning pocket nukes , she notes : " Without a U.S. program on small - modular reactors , the world would default to small - modular reactor systems from other countries which may not integrate advanced non-proliferation technologies into their design . "

The decision to use an unusually small SIM card in the iPad means current iPhone customers can't just use their iPhone 's SIM in an iPad , as we reported last week .
It appears increasingly likely that this decision was driven not by space considerations ( after all , the iPad is much larger than the iPhone ) , but rather by AT&T 's business strategy .
This way , they can charge customers twice for 3G wireless data :
Once for the iPhone , and once for the iPad .
Gemalto , which probably makes the micro SIM card in Apple 's iPad , says OEMs might choose to use a micro SIM card because mobile operators set device requirements forcing them to do so .
Gemalto could n't confirm that it was an Apple supplier , but according to Lok8u , the manufacturer of the only other micro SIM card device currently sold in America , Gemalto is the likely maker of the iPad 's SIM .
" We cannot speak specifically about our relationship with OEMs , " said Gemalto North America vice president of business development Jean - Louis Carrara .
But he was able to speak about the company 's micro SIM card clients in general , shedding light on Apple 's strange decision to use a smaller card in the large iPad device and a larger card in the small iPhone .
The main reason a manufacturer would choose micro SIM , also called 3FF , is to facilitate smaller cellphone designs , as has happened already in Europe , said Carrara .
However , he acknowledged that purely business reasons could play a role in a company 's decision to go with a format that 's all - but - unknown in the United States .
" If you look at where the micro SIM is being used today , it 's in those devices that have real space constraints , but it 's hard to envision a tablet to have that much of a constraint , " said Carrara .
" Maybe it does .
But it could also be a decision by some OEMs that they would prefer to have a [ micro SIM ] because it just makes sense with the way they want to run their business , or the customer segment , or the way they want to distribute their devices .
We will see OEMs choosing [ micro SIM ] because they have a physical constraint , but it could also be because they want to have a card that is different than the plug - in SIM . "
No company that works with Apple can say much about it , and Apple and AT&T are themselves notoriously tight - lipped .
There is no evidence that the smaller SIM was chosen as a concession to AT&T .
But the circumstantial evidence suggests that it was not chosen because of the limited space in the iPad 's chassis .
Carrara agreed with our prediction that a certain segment of buyers will rebel against the purchase of a second wireless data plan by slicing their SIM cards so that they work both in their phones and the iPad .
" There is no difference between the functionality or design of a micro SIM card , when compared to a regular SIM card – the only difference is the size of the extra plastic surrounding the chip , " confirmed Carrara .
" Cutting the plastic around [ a SIM card ] and putting it in a new device is not endangering anything .
What it 's probably going to do is that people will probably not cut the plastic properly , and the contacts wo n't match on the device , and therefore it wo n't perform , but that 's not a problem .
You can lose your SIM today and go to the operator and get a new one . "

Israel currently claims sovereignty over Jerusalem Newspapers in the Middle East agree that Palestinians stand to benefit from a joint EU statement calling for Jerusalem to serve as the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state .
Commentators in Israel say the country " dodged a bullet " when the proposal from the EU that East Jerusalem be recognised as the future Palestinian capital was rejected .
One commentator urges Israel 's leaders to act quickly to quell any momentum that the statement may grant to the Palestinian cause .
The Palestinian press welcome the statement as positive yet flawed - viewing the softening of its language as a concession to Israel .
This sentiment is echoed by one Pan - Arab commentator who argues that Arab support for the Swedish proposal should have been more robust .
GIDEON SAMET IN ISRAEL'S MA'ARIV
The European community is fed up waiting for peace talks .
The draft proposal was softened at the last minute , but remains a clear signal of the change in the international attitude to settlements in the [ West ] Bank .
When the Palestinian initiative for unilateral independence is rolled out most of the countries of the world will recognise it .
The United States cannot prevent this becoming an international fact even if it vetoes such a resolution at the [ UN ] Security Council .
HERB KEINON IN ISRAEL'S JERUSALEM POST
The bottom line is that Israel very much dodged a bullet ...
Had the Swedish resolution been adopted the language would probably have seeped into debates at the UN Security Council , making Israel 's diplomatic situation more difficult than it already is ...
In the absence of Israeli initiatives or any real movement , other actors will put forward their own initiatives which may be deleterious to Israeli interests .
ADIL ABD -AL - RAHMAN IN PALESTINIAN AL - HAYAT AL - JADIDAH
Although a clearer and firmer position in deciding on the characteristics of a Palestinian state and its capital Jerusalem were hoped for , the European decision was nevertheless an advanced step forward .
The statement issued by the EU has specified the reference points for the settlement process and defined the borders of the Israeli pull - out .
EDITORIAL IN PALESTINIAN AL - QUDS Despite its flaws , the European decision [ on Jerusalem ] constitutes a positive step on the right track .
It also undermines Israeli greediness in Arab Jerusalem .
So will the Palestinians and Arabs exploit this decision and follow up on it ?
HANI HABIB IN PALESTINIAN AL - AYYAM Although Israeli President Shimon Peres expressed his disappointment with the final statement issued by the EU 's foreign ministers on the Palestinian - Israeli issue , we think Israel was somewhat successful in redrafting Sweden 's draft proposal ...
It is true that this decision is a Palestinian gain in one way or another , but it has not added anything new .
ABD - BARI ATWAN IN PAN - ARAB AL - QUDS AL - ARABI Israel , with the support of countries such as France , the Netherlands and Germany , has succeeded in foiling a plan submitted to European foreign ministers by Sweden , which called for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state ...
Israel 's success was due to the absence of active Arab action not only to support the Swedish proposal but for Europe to support decisive issues in confronting Israel 's actions for the Judaisation of the city .

Here on the SelectSpecs blog we write a lot of posts about celebrity glasses but so far we ’ve neglected their cartoon cousins .
There have been so many awesome cartoon characters that wear specs over the years – here is our selection of some of the best ones that we ’ll always remember with fond nostalgia …
1. Hans Moleman ( The Simpsons )
Without doubt one of the funniest Simpsons characters , Hans Moleman ’s awesome powers of feeble ineptitude undoubtedly stem from his super thick ( and frankly pretty useless ) goggle - eye glasses .
The poor guy always seems to be hit with the most terrible misfortune , he is always back on his walking stick and ready for the next disater .
Moleman , we salute you !
2. Peter Griffin ( Family Guy )
Did you just double take ?
Most people ( me included ! ) do n’t even realise that Peter from Family Guy even WEARS glasses .
But yup , there they are , glued to his face and cunningly exactly the same size as his oversized eyeballs ( hence the confusion ) .
Bet they came in handy when the giant chicken was trying to peck his eyes out ( see video ) .
For the record we at SelectSpecs do n’t recommend using your glasses as a suitable defence against giant chickens .
In fact we suggest you stay away from psychotic poultry altogether .
3. Penfold ( DangerMouse )
The show may have been named after DangerMouse but we all know Ernest Penfold , the cute , bumbling , giant - headed sidekick to the World ’s Greatest Secret Agent was the real star of the show .
Yes , he had a squeaky voice .
Yes , he was rather dim , terrified of everything and utterly useless at crime fighting .
Yes , he usually ended up getting captured by the enemy so DangerMouse had to rescue him .
But he was just so CUTE !
His top phrases are “ crumbs Dangermouse ” and “ Ooh-eck ! ”
Penfold and his iconic glasses have a far reaching legacy for glasses wearers across the UK , becoming the standard school playground taunt towards the kid with glasses .
School bullys , you thought you were being mean but actually it was a huge compliment .
Penfold Rocks .
Really .
4. Velma ( Scooby Doo )
Aaah Velma , the archetypal Geeky Glasses Girl , aka “ the clever one from Scooby Doo ” .
Velma is usually the one coming up with the elaborate plans despite being the youngest in the gang .
Without her glasses she cannot even see her own hands in front of her face .
When Scooby Doo was made Velma may have fit the stereotype of the harmless , nerdy smart girl with confidence issues and bad grooming , but we reckon there ’s more to her and today she ’d be more like Enid from Ghost World .
There ’s even a dedicated Velma Dinkley fan site “ In appreciation of the most under - appreciated member of Mysteries Inc ( a groundbreaking piece of web design by the way ) .
5. Spongebob Squarepants
Spongebob uses his glasses like most people use reading glasses , except he only uses them when he goes jelly fishing .
Most of the time they do n’t seem to help at all and he rarely manages to catch anything .
A lot of people seem to associate Spongebob with the the conveyor belt of brain - dumbening cartoons that have kids glued to their TV sets with blank faces and open , drooling mouths .
They ’re wrong .
If you watch Spongebob , its actually a brilliant introduction to surreal , offbeat humour – kind of like Ren & Stimpy meets The Three Stooges .
I ’d rather my kids watch that than High School Musical , that ’s for sure …
6. Eric Cartman ( South Park )
OK so Cartman does n’t exactly wear glasses but he gets in the list for the classic “ Respect My Authoritah ” Ray Ban Sunglasses look , and because he has to be one of the funniest cartoon characters ever created .
Nuff said .
7. Professor Frink ( The Simpsons )
Yes , the second Simpsons entry in our list but I just could not leave off the genius that is Professor John I.Q Nerdelbaum Frink Jr. – the uber geeky scientist modelled on the classic Nutty Professor played by Jerry Lewis .
We particularly love his tendency to get into a gibberish fit when he gets excited .
Frink is never to be seen without his glasses on , which is all part of his nerdish charm we reckon .
8. Professor Farnsworth ( Futurama )
The Simpsons creators basically took Professor Frink , added a few hundred years , senility , liver spots and a sadistic evil streak to create the lovable Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth .
Apparently the aged professor ( Fry ’s great great great x30 nephew ) has never been seen without his coke - bottle glasses on the show , although in one episode he did need his “ reading glasses ” which were twice the size of his normal ones !
( bonus points to anyone who can name the episode ) .
9. Cedric Sneer ( The Raccoons )
Watching the trailer for The Raccoons makes me go a bit warm and fuzzy inside with nostalgia .
The adventures of Bert Raccoon and his friends against the evil industrialist aardvark Cyril Sneer were a crucial part of any 80s childhood .
Cedric Sneer was Bert ’s best friend and also the son of his arch nemesis Cyril Sneer .
Quite frankly Cedric was a bit of a tool – pretty weak and useless and he ends up joining forces with his dad .
But he did have some seriously heavyweight dork glasses and some insane nasal plumbing .
10 . Bonus Entry : Mr Magoo
OK so the whole point of Mr Magoo was that he does n’t wear glasses – but the blind old codger is such a legend we had to have him in here .
So what – it ’s our blog , we can do what we want =)
Honorable Mentions
Here are a bunch of other glasses wearing cartoon characters that did n’t make it into our arbitrary list …
More from the Simpsons ( we could do a whole post of these ) : Millhouse , Grandpa Simpson and occasionally Homer ( his ‘ intellectual ’ glasses ) :
Mr Mackey ( “ Drugs are bad , mmmmkay ? ” ) and Mr Garrison from South Park :
( “ Drugs are bad , mmmmkay ? ” ) and from South Park : Hank Hill ( King of the Hill ) – everyone ’s favourite salesman of propane and propane accessories :
( King of the Hill ) – everyone ’s favourite salesman of propane and propane accessories : Daria Morgendorfer ( Daria ) – the deadpan , emo / goth with the monotone wit :
( Daria ) – the deadpan , emo / goth with the monotone wit : Chuckie ( Rugrats ) – the kid who made it acceptable for two year olds to wear ( and lose ) glasses :
( Rugrats ) – the kid who made it acceptable for two year olds to wear ( and lose ) glasses : Johnny Bravo – the vain , dim but ultimately cool Elvis - impersonating sunglasses - wearing animated hero .
Bonus points for almost getting it on with Velma Dinkley after helping her find her glasses !

GOMAD stands for a gallon of milk a day .
It ’s a simple weight gain diet for skinny guys who struggle to eat a lot .
Just drink a gallon of whole milk a day on top of eating three meals day and lifting heavy .
That extra milk adds about 2400 calories and 120g of protein .
GOMAD therefore makes it easier to reach a caloric surplus to gain weight .
It has helped the most stubborn hardgainers and ectomorphs gain up to 25 lb in only 25 days .
If you ’re skinny , under - weight and can’t gain weight no matter , you may want to try GOMAD .
Why Milk ?
Milk contains about 8g of protein per cup .
The milk protein is 80 % casein and 20 % whey .
That protein helps for muscle recovery and muscle building .
Milk is also a liquid , and liquid calories digest faster than solid meals .
So milk makes it easier to get more calories in so you reach a caloric surplus and gain weight .
Milk is 87 % water and contains about 90mg calcium and 107mg sodium per cup .
Milk therefore replenishes fluid and electrolytes lost from sweating during your workouts .
This also improves muscle recovery and prevents headaches from dehydration .
So you do n’t need to buy expensive sports drinks like gatorade .
Milk has natural electrolytes , which saves you money .
Milk has everything a weight lifter needs to get stronger .
The cow has always been the weight lifter ’s best friend .
It provides us with protein for building muscle ( steaks and milk ) and leather for lifting heavy ( weight lifting belts , shoes ) .
Why a Gallon of Milk ?
One gallon of whole milk contains about 2400kcal from 120g protein , 200g carbs and 120g fat .
Most guys need around 2500 to 2800 calories a day to maintain their body weight .
So you can get almost all your maintenance calories from drinking a gallon of whole milk a day .
Eat three small meals a day ( 500 calories each ) plus a gallon of whole milk , and you have almost 4000 calories .
That ’s a caloric surplus without eating 6 meals a day or 4 bigger meals that skinny guys do n’t have the appetite for yet .
Plus milk is easy : it ’s portable , and requires no cooking .
And a gallon of whole milk gives you about 120g of protein .
You need about 0.8g of protein per pound of body weight for optimal muscle building when lifting heavy weights .
So a gallon of whole milk covers your base protein requirements for the day .
You need do n’t need to drink extra protein shakes .
Bottom line , GOMAD is a simple and effective way to get a lots of calories and protein with minimal work .
Is GOMAD Right for You ?
GOMAD is for guys who have always been skinny .
Guys who ca n’t gain weight , no matter what , even though “ they eat a lot ” .
Guys who think they ’re skinny because of their genetics or metabolism .
The typical case is a 1m80 20y old guy who only weighs 55kg .
With GOMAD we can easily create a caloric surplus to gain weight .
That quick weight gain finally makes you realize you were under eating .
We achieve that without adding cooking chores , or forcing big meals you have no appetite for yet .
So GOMAD is NOT for people who have a normal body weight already .
It ’s NOT for people who are over - weight or obese .
It ’s only for under - weight guys who are new to lifting , and who want to finally achieve a normal body weight .
If you ’re a guy over 30 years old or a female , GOMAD is definitely NOT for you .
How Much to Eat on GOMAD ?
The average guy needs 2500 to 2800 calories a day to maintain his body weight .
Skinny guys usually eat less – they skip breakfast , eat a bagel at noon , then nothing until dinner .
They barely get 2000 calories a day .
That ’s why they can eat everything they want without gaining weight .
On GOMAD , a skinny guy can continue to eat his two meals a day .
GOMAD will add 2400kcal and increase his total daily calorie intake close to 4000 kcal .
This is guaranteed to make a skinny guy gain weight quickly .
For the first time in his life , you ’ll believe you ’re not doomed to be skinny .
You do n’t have to change much about you diet yet .
Just add a gallon of whole milk on top of whatever you ’re eating now .
One quarter at breakfast , one quarter at lunch , one quarter in the afternoon , one quarter post - workout / at dinner .
Get used to drinking a gallon of whole milk a day for a week or two .
Then get used to eating three meals a day – consistently .
500 kcal / meal is fine as that still gives you 4000 kcal / day with the whole milk .
That means a small breakfast , lunch and dinner .
Frequently Asked Questions
Wo n’t all the fat from GOMAD make me fat ?
Fat does n’t make you fat .
Excess calories do .
The proper question is therefore – wo n’t all those calories make me fat ?
It ’s a common mistake for skinny guys to want to build muscle without gaining fat .
The problem is that this is a hard thing to do .
To gain weight you need to eat more , to lose fat you need to eat less .
So most guys trying to gain without without getting fat end up eating too little to gain weight .
That causes frustration and will make you lose motivation .
Remember building muscle is harder than losing fat .
You can only gain 2 lb / muscle per month .
But you can easily lose 4lb of fat a week .
All that takes is eating 500 kcal / day less .
So focus on gaining weight and muscle now .
You can easily lose the fat later .
Do I have to drink a gallon of milk a day ?
No .
You can start with a quarter of a gallon of whole milk to add about 600 kcal to your daily intake .
But GOMAD is for skinny , under - weight guys who have never been able to gain weight .
The goal is to kick - start the weight gain to make you realize the issue is not your metabolism or genetics but your calorie intake that was insufficient .
You want to go full GOMAD to kick - start the weight gain .
Can I do GOMAD with soy milk ?
No .
Large amounts of soy milk can lower your testosterone levels and cause erectile dysfunction .
Moderate consumption of soy may be okay , but not a gallon a day .
If you insist on soy milk , stick to a liter a day max .
You ’ll need to eat more though to make up for the lack of calories .
So it ’s simpler to gain weight with cow milk .
Can I drink low fat or skimmed milk to avoid fat gains ?
Again , fat does n’t make you fat .
Excess calories do .
A gallon of skimmed / low - fat milk makes you lose 800 - 1000 kcal / a day .
That means you have to eat about 1500 calories a day more to get to the same 4000 kcal / day you get with whole milk .
But you still have to drink a gallon of fluid a day .
That ’s not smart .
If you want to reduce your caloric intake from drinking whole milk , then drink half a gallon .
That halves the caloric intake from 2400kcal to 1200 kcal .
And you ’ll only drink two liters of fluid a day .
But you ’ll have to eat more to mak eup for the calorie difference .
Simpler is to just drink whole milk .
It tastes better than skimmed / low - fat milk thanks to the fat content .
Do I have to drink GOMAD every day ?
Yes .
It ’s your average caloric intake for the week , month and year that matters for gaining weight .
Not how many calories you get in a day .
If you get 4000 calories today but only 1500 calories the rest of the week , you ’re not going to gain weight .
Your weekly average is only 1857 kcal / day .
That ’s below maintenance .
You need to consistently eat a caloric surplus to gain weight .
What about drinking GOMAD on workout days only ?
No .
As I just explained , it ’s your weekly average caloric intake that matters to gain weight .
If your caloric intake is above maintenance on some days but below maintenance on other days , you will not gain weight .
You need to have consistent caloric surplus .
Do I need to eat if I do GOMAD ?
Yes .
GOMAD is only 2400 kcal / day .
The skinny , hardgainer , ectomorph types for who GOMAD is for typically can’t gain on 2400 kcal / day .
They need to push it over 3000 kcal at the minimum to start seeing weight increases .
That means you ’re going to have to eat real food as well .
Do I have to lift weights ?
Yes .
The goal is for the excess calories to be used for muscle building .
Not to be stored as fat .
So lift heavy weights three times a week to stimulate your body to build muscle .
Heavy Squats and Deadlifts .
Check StrongLifts 5×5 .
Why not just drink mass gainer shakes ?
Because most of them are full of sugars and other crap .
You ’re better of mixing whey protein and oats if you do n’t want to drink milk .
Can I do GOMAD with chocolate milk ?
Chocolate Milk has more calories than regular milk .
But those extra calories come from the extra sugar content that makes it tastier .
Eating tons of artificial sugar is bad for you .
Milk chocolate is also more expensive , contains less protein , and tends to constipate .
You ’re better off making your own chocolate milk by adding a scoop of chocolate whey to your milk .
Can I do GOMAD with coconut milk ?
No .
A gallon of coconut milk a day would be almost 7000 calories .
That ’s too much .
Plus most of the calories in coconut milk come from saturated fats .
Coconut milk has 10 x more fat than dairy milk .
But it only has half the protein .
You could drink less coconut milk to get the same amount of caloric intake .
But you ’re still trading protein for 10 x more fat .
And your stomach will not enjoy drinking high quantities of coconut milk .
Stick with cow milk .
Is drinking so much milk good for the body ?
GOMAD IS definitely an aggressive approach .
But it ’s what skinny guys who have never been able to gain weight need .
We want you to stop blaming your genetics and metabolism .
We want you to start realizing it ’s just a matter of calories .
We can do that within a month if you drink a gallon of milk a day .
Do you think staying skinny , frail and weak is good for your body ?
We ’re not talking about drinking a gallon of vodka a day .
It ’s just milk .
Will all the weight gain from GOMAD be fat ?
No .
Most of your weight gain will be muscle – 60 % muscle , 40 % fat .
That is if you lift heavy weights three times a week .
You can easily lose the fat later since it ’s easier than building muscle .
Keep in mind that there ’s no weight gain method that allows you to gain muscle without getting fat .
Even if you follow a more conservative approach where you only eat 10 - 15 % extra calories per day ( as explained here )
You will always gain about a pound of fat for every pound of muscle you gain ( and increase your body - fat by about 1 % per month ) .
Most guys can’t gain pure muscle weight without gaining some fat .
And if you worry about fat gains , you ’re not the skinny guy GOMAD is far anyway .
Ectomorph and hardgainers have little fat in the first place .
They ’re all bones .
They ’ll look better even if they gain a little fat .
Will I lose the weight gained if I stop GOMAD ?
Not if you continue to eat more calories than your body burns .
GOMAD adds 2400 kcal / day which you will lose when you stop drinking the milk .
Most guys need about 2500 - 2800 kcal / day to maintain their body weight .
So you ’ll have to increase your meal size from 500 kcal to 1000 per meal at a minimum .
Then you ’ll probably need to add an extra 500 kcal snack to continue gaining weight .
Can I just do half or quarter GOMAD instead ?
That would halve / quarter your daily calorie and protein intake .
This may be okay for people who are not that skinny and concerned about fat gains .
But for the hardgainer ectomorph who has never been able to gain weight , it ’s better to go full GOMAD to get quick weight gain .
Should I drink pasteurized , UHT or raw milk ?
The processing method does n’t matter for gaining weight .
The point is to create a caloric surplus .
Whole milk makes that easier because it has more calories .
The processing method does n’t matter as long as you ’re drinking whole milk .
What if I ’m lactose intolerant ?
You could take lactaid pills so you do n’t get cramps , gas and diarrhea .
Lactose intolerant people lack the lactase enzyme to break down lactose in milk .
That ’s what causes bloating and nausea .
You could drink lactaid milk which is free of lactase .
But lactaid pills are cheaper .
Most people need about 16 pills per gallon of milk .
Will GOMAD cause acne ?
Could be from the increase in testosterone from lifting , and the increased dairy intake .
Not much you can do about it .
You ’re not going to do GOMAD your whole life
Just a few weeks to get that weight gain kicked off .
Suck it up in the meanwhile .
How long should I do GOMAD ?
One month is usually enough .
gu
Just to kick in the weight gain so you see that your metabolism and genetics are n’t the issue .
And to increase your appetite with is usually low with skinny guys .
What if I struggle to drink all that milk ?
You can take a progressive approach like with StrongLifts 5×5 .
Start with half a gallon of milk a day the first week .
Add a quarter a day in week two .
Then go full gallon in week three .
This gives your stomach time to adapt .
Make sure you spread your calorie intake as much as possible ( wake up earlier to maximize your eating window ) .
How do I keep the milk cold when I carry it everywhere ?
Buy a thermos .
Fill it with cold water for 5 mins .
Then drain it and fill it with milk .
If you drink one quarter in the morning , and one quarter when you get back from school / work , you only need to take one quarter with you .
The last quarter you drink in the evening .
Is GOMAD better than steroids ?
No .
Steroids of course work better than GOMAD .
It ’s a lot easier to build muscle without gaining fat if you use steroids .
But most guys do n’t want to take steroids as they have complicated side - effects .
Plus taking steroids early on does n’t teach skinny guys to eat , train , and think right .
GOMAD will teach you to think right .
It will who show you that your metabolism and genetics are n’t the reason you ’re skinny .
Your low , daily caloric intake is .
Do I need to get 5000 kcal / day ?
No .
That would cause unnecessary fat gains .
You can only gain about 2lb of muscle per month on average .
That is if you lift heavy , eat enough calories , and get your protein .
Eating more calories than necessary wo n’t make you build muscle faster .
Nothing will ( except taking steroids , which I advise you not to ) .
Getting 10 - 15 % calories above maintenance is usually enough for weight gain .
The average skinny guy who eats two meals a day will get almost 4000 kcal / day with GOMAD .
That ’s already enough calories to gain weight .
You do n’t need to stuff yourself with food .
Cisco Systems and Hewlett - Packard probably wo n't force their mutual customers to take sides after the end of their partnership , though the vendors are deadly serious about competing against one another , analysts said on Friday .
Cisco said Thursday it would not renew its system integrator contract with HP after it expires April 30 , which means HP will no longer be a Cisco Certified Channel Partner or Global Service Alliance partner .
The company said its relationship with HP had evolved from partnership to competition .
As a result , it is n't appropriate for Cisco to continue sharing road map information with HP , among other things , the head of Cisco 's channel program said on a webcast .
As a hint of the break to come , HP earlier on Thursday had said it would expand its own reseller contract with QLogic for storage switches , a category of product that HP has resold from Cisco .
In addition , there were reports earlier this week that Cisco had halted work on a future product called the Nexus 4001d blade switch , designed to fit into the Dell M1000e blade chassis .
( Cisco declined to comment on unannounced products and said Dell remains a reseller of several Cisco products . )
The coming change announced Thursday only formalized a break that had been forming over the past few years , analysts said .
In the past , HP has resold many of Cisco 's high - end enterprise networking products while Cisco has used HP computing platforms , some as the basis for network appliances .
Each focused on its own areas of expertise , and though HP did sell networking gear through its ProCurve division , that business was focused mostly on small and medium - sized businesses .
However , as data centers become larger and more complex , especially with virtualization , the largest IT vendors are trying to circle the wagons around complete sets of products for those facilities .
Cisco and HP are among the most active in this trend , along with IBM , Oracle and Dell , according to industry analysts .
Cisco shook up the industry nearly a year ago when it introduced the UCS ( Unified Computing System ) blade server platform , entering a business where it had never competed .
That may have set off the conflict .
" When Cisco started selling servers , it was pretty clear HP had started to de-emphasize Cisco 's networking equipment , " said analyst Steve Schuchart of Current Analysis .
" This is the tombstone on the corpse of the relationship . "
In fact , HP is shaping up to be not just a competitor , but Cisco 's biggest rival , Schuchart said .
With its acquisition of 3Com , expected to close by midyear , the company will have a fairly complete lineup of both routing and switching products , though not quite the same breadth as Cisco , he said .
While Cisco had more than two - thirds of the Ethernet switch market in the third quarter of last year , HP and 3Com were the second - and third - place vendors in that business , with a combined 10.3 percent of the market , according to figures from Dell ' Oro Group .
Both companies are likely to continue building their forces through acquisitions , UBS Warburg analyst Nikos Theodosopoulos wrote in a research note .
" We expect the competition between Cisco and HP to be intense over the next few years , " he wrote .
They are likely to use aggressive financing deals to win customers , he wrote .
As HP bulks up to take ground from Cisco , the latest development hurts it more , according to a research note by Ovum .
" It appears that HP needs Cisco more than Cisco needs HP , with the 3Com acquisition expected to still take some time to be completely integrated , " the analyst company said .
However , both Cisco and HP are smart enough not to let their rivalry hurt customers who bought into the two vendors in happier times , analysts said .
" Customers will not be forced to choose between one and the other , " Schuchart said .
However , " They might be asked , " he added .
Both companies are likely to " strongly encourage " their customers to standardize on their gear , said analyst Gordon Haff of Illuminata .
The good news is that encouragement will probably come in the form of financial incentives in many cases , he said .
For its part , Cisco said it will honor Cisco customer service contracts with HP customers and has contacted HP about crafting a new agreement that better reflects the companies ' new relationship .
" We will continue to work with HP wherever our customers expect it and where it makes sense for our business , " said Keith Goodwin , senior vice president of Cisco 's Worldwide Partner Organization , on the webcast .
Agreements under which Cisco resells HP products on an OEM basis will not be affected , a Cisco spokeswoman said .
The consolidation of enterprise IT companies that helped drive Cisco and HP apart is likely to affect customers of all major vendors but may not be all bad , the analysts said .
The " re-verticalization " of IT is the latest stage of the cycle that saw computing move from totally proprietary systems such as mainframes and minicomputers to the decentralized , open architectures of PCs and Ethernet LANs , Haff said .
IT departments have benefited from the high volume and falling prices of standard components over the past several years , but those parts are increasingly hard to piece together into working systems , he said .
As vendors including Cisco , HP , IBM , Oracle and Dell try to supply all parts of a data center , on their own or through tight partnerships , they will probably help to ease some of the pain of that complexity , Haff said .
This could be bad news for some third - party system integrators that have done some of the heavy lifting , he said .
And all is not lost from the era of " best - of - breed " IT , he added .
Anyone who wants to build their own systems in - house can still do so .
" We 're not moving back to the old days , really , " Haff said .
PORT -AU - PRINCE – Haitian police detained 10 members of a US Christian group after they allegedly tried to leave the country with more than 30 children who survived the country ’s devastating earthquake .
News of the charges came as the UN ’s food agency prepared to launch a massive food effort targeted at vulnerable women in a bid to ease some of the chaos surrounding the relief effort .

Police had arrested five men and five women with US passports , as well as two Haitians , as they tried to cross into the neighboring Dominican Republic with 33 children late Friday , Haitian authorities said .
Border police “ saw a bus with a lot of children .
Thirty - three children .
When asked about the children ’s documents , they had no documents , ” Haitian Culture and Communications Minister Marie Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said .
The Americans were members of an Idaho - based charity called New Life Children ’s Refuge , said Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin , adding : “ This is an abduction , not an adoption . ”
The leader of the group , identified as Laura Silsby , said the group ’s aims were altruistic and that they were only seeking help for the children in the neighboring Dominican Republic , CNN reported .
“ We are trusting the truth will be revealed , and we are praying for that , ” she said , adding that the matter was a misunderstanding over documentation .

But Patricia Vargas , head of an international center caring for the youngsters , said that officials at the Haitian Institute of Social Welfare , which deals with adoptions , told her “ most of the kids have family . ”
Some of the older children had spoken to aid workers and “ say their parents are alive , and some of them gave us an address and phone numbers , ” she said .
The US embassy confirmed that ten US citizens were being held for “ alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration . ”

Workers from aid groups and other non-governmental and religious organizations have poured into Haiti in the aftermath of the January 12 quake which is believed to have killed some 170,000 people .
Amid fears that food is not reaching enough people , the World Food Program said it would open 16 fixed collection sites in Port - au - Prince on Sunday , aiming to feed two million people in two weeks .

Only female quake survivors will be allowed at the sites to avoid scenes at chaotic mobile handouts that have sometimes seen children and women muscled aside in the scramble for bags of rice , beans and cooking oil .
The aid effort suffered a further setback over the weekend , after the US military stopped flying injured Haitians to the United States for treatment because of a dispute over costs .
The governor of Florida has asked the US government to share the financial burden on his state ’s hospitals , putting a block on flights that have so far carried more than 500 people with spinal injuries , burns and other wounds .
ADVERTISEMENT
The United States has spearheaded relief efforts since the 7.0 - magnitude quake , which also injured around 200,000 and left more than one million homeless .
The aid effort has , however , drawn criticism for a lack of coordination .
Haitians , many of whom are living in squalid makeshift tent camps , have complained that relief has been slow to reach them on the ground .
Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive made a fresh appeal for 200,000 tents before the country ’s rainy season starts , most likely in May .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We are very aware of the consequences to all of the people on the streets if it ’s starting to rain , ” Bellerive told CNN , adding that the government only had 3,500 tents so far .
Diseases such as diarrhea , measles , and tetanus are rising in tent camps , prompting UN agencies and the government to prepare a mass vaccination drive , while survivors also face rising insecurity with reports of rape and violence .
Aid officials have warned meanwhile that the reconstruction process in Haiti , already the poorest country in the Americas before the quake , will take decades .
The global economy remains on unstable footing as we see debt problems slam the European markets with Greece in the current spotlight .
Yet the problem of debt is not unique to Greece itself and it is fascinating that the world is only focusing on one country .
The average American over the past four decades has taken on so much debt that household debt outstanding is now equivalent to the U.S. annual GDP .
The biggest amount of debt is with mortgage debt .
Yet with mortgage debt you are securing the mortgage to ideally a property that will reflect the amount of debt linked to the home .
Part of the housing bubble problem stems from the hyper inflated values of homes and now we are seeing the ramifications of this with millions of homes being foreclosed on .
But another large part of this bubble was around the usage of credit cards that hit their apex during this crisis :
For nearly four decades Americans ’ love affair with credit cards grew unabated .
The amount of credit card debt outstanding hit an apex in 2007 at the height of the bubble reaching $ 975 billion in debt ( to put this in perspective Greece ’s GDP is $ 367 billion and their current deficit is 12.7 percent of economic output ) .
Unlike mortgage debt or even auto debt , there is nothing securing credit card debt .
This can be someone going to a club and buying $ 300 in drinks for friends or taking a trip to Antigua and spending thousands and charging it up on easy plastic .
It can also be in the form of consumer goods consumption like buying a new television set or additional appliances .
Yet for the first time since data on revolving debt has been kept we have now seen it contract on a yearly basis .
And part of this contraction stems from the Great Recession but also more people are paying down extremely expensive debt :
The above data comes from an interesting article from the St. Louis Federal Reserve .
The author William T. Gavin examines the low interest rate and its impact on consumers .
As his chart above highlights , even with the Federal Reserve lowering funds to record lows the average interest rate on credit cards has crept up even higher than in 2000 when the Fed funds rate was at 6.5 percent .
With interest rates on savings accounts so low , it is definitely appealing for many consumers to pay down high interest rate credit cards down since this is a guaranteed return of 13 , 15 , 20 , and even 79 percent on some credit cards .
This low interest rate environment is creating some asymmetrical dynamics in the market .
While the above shows interest rates on credit cards as being high , rates on savings accounts are extremely low :
A 90 day certificate of deposit is currently yielding 0.19 percent , or slightly above the rate you would get by sticking your paycheck in the mattress of your bedroom .
So even as we see the amount of revolving debt outstanding decline , there is still $ 866 billion in credit card debt outstanding .
Credit card companies are losing money on charging off accounts as bankruptcies across the country rise .
Many times credit card companies are hiking up the fees whether they are annual payments or jacking up interest rates on even good paying customers .
In this environment it is rather clear that if you have high interest credit card debt , forget about the stock market and focus all your energy on paying down that high debt .
This interest rate spread on debt and savings is enormous .
And as average Americans move their money to safer deposits as the stock market now reflects a speculative casino , many are wondering how they will do with such low rates :
In this current environment it would seem that the best course of action is paying down high interest debt and more importantly , not spending beyond what you can reasonably afford .
Unfortunately many Americans are now realizing that they do not have access to the same lending window banks have with their central bank .
The bailouts were largely a method of shoring up the troubled assets within banks , not a bailout to help the balance sheet of average Americans .
If banks had any faith in their customers you would see lending pick up once again .
But this Great Recession has created a smaller number of quality borrowers .
Or to be more accurate , there were n’t many quality borrowers to begin with over the past decade but that did n’t stop banks from making loans earlier in the decade .
Once banks gained consciousness they slammed shut the door and they went into survival mode primarily by focusing on government support to keep them solvent .
Banks have very little desire to loan money when they are dealing with large imbalances on their internal accounts :
You do n’t need the above chart to tell you that credit has contracted massively during this grand economic calamity .
Just look at the amount of credit card solicitation you now receive in the mail .
Long gone are those zero percent offers for 12 months .
You might get a six month balance transfer offer at zero percent but you will find out in the small print the enormous 5 percent fee for moving any amount over .
Or you might soon come to realize that your annual fee free card now has a service fee .
These are the ways banks are trying to go after additional revenue streams from their customers ( or if you like , taxpayers that saved them from extinction ) .
Until our system is reformed , these are the rules we have been given .
If you have outstanding credit card debt ( $ 866 billion tells us many do ) start paying it down .
Forget about the stock market for the moment .
The stock market is highly volatile and with no real reforms yet , we are in for another crisis in the short - term since the same games that got us here are once again being played out .
By paying down your credit card debt you are assured a fixed return for a defined set of time .
In this current market , that is as close as you will get to any sort of guarantee .

The Land of Gorch was a recurring sketch on the first season of Saturday Night Live .
Lorne Michaels , executive producer of the show , stated in a Tomorrow Show interview prior to the series ' premiere that these sketches would feature a whole new group of adult Muppets " who can stay up late . "
Contents show ]
The Land of Gorch is a swampy alien landscape ruled by the blustering , oafish King Ploobis , who ignores his shrewish wife , Queen Peuta , in favor of his lovely female servant Vazh .
Ploobis ' right hand creature is the toady Scred , who cravenly sucks up to the king while carrying on a discreet love affair with Peuta .
Ploobis ' son , Wisss , is a dropout " crater - head " , who sucks intoxicating gases from holes in the ground .
The ultimate authority in Gorch is the Mighty Favog , who offers wisdom in exchange for regular sacrifices .
Jim Henson , Jerry Nelson , and Frank Oz performed the roles of Ploobis , Scred , and the Mighty Favog respectively , while Alice Tweedie , Fran Brill , and Richard Hunt performed the roles of Peuta , Vazh , and Wisss .
Opening narration for the sketches was supplied by Saturday Night Live staff announcer Don Pardo .
Henson 's original notes include the phrases " Jung / types " and " comedia del arte " ( sic ) , indicating that Henson thought of the Gorch characters as broad comic archetypes -- the " loud / angry / dominant " king , the " haughty / pretentious / shallow " queen , and the " evil / sneaky / crafty " henchman . [ 1 ]
The series of sketches lasted from SNL 's premiere in October 1975 to April 1976 ( and became a recurring joke in the next season ) .
The original proposals and scripts refer to the sketches as Gortch rather than Gorch ; over time the spelling was changed , and both versions are found in the Henson files .
According to the Muppet Morsels on The Muppet Show : Season One DVD , only hired writers for Saturday Night Live , and not Henson employees , were allowed to write Gorch sketches .
Other writing credits went to SNL contributors Chevy Chase and Al Franken .
Despite this , Jim Henson did write one sketch , for the episode hosted by Raquel Welch .
In a 2009 interview Jerry Nelson revealed that he wrote the sketch with Lily Tomlin and Scred . [ 2 ]
The writing staff were generally less than pleased with the presence of the Muppets .
Writer Alan Zweibel expressed his views on the topic :
“ Whoever drew the short straw that week had to write the Muppet sketch .
The first time I met [ Michael ] O'Donoghue , I walked into Lorne 's office ... and I look in a corner of the room and there 's a guy I learned was Michael O'Donoghue .
What was he doing , you ask ?
He had taken Big Bird , a stuffed toy of Big Bird , and the cord from the venetian blinds , and he wrapped the cord around Big Bird 's neck .
He was lynching Big Bird .
And that 's how we all felt about the Muppets .
Franken and Davis and I were the rookie writers , and the others always rigged it so we were the ones who wrote the Muppet sketches .
So I went over to Jim Henson 's townhouse on like Sixty - eighth Street with a sketch I had written .
There was one character named Skred [ sic ] , and I remember we 're reading the sketch , Jim Henson 's reading the pages , and he gets to a line and says , ' Oh , Skred would n't say this . '
And I look , and on a table over there is this cloth thing that is folded over like laundry , and it 's Skred .
' Oh , but he would n't say this . '
Oh , sorry . [ 3 ] ”
During the middle of the season , after a deal to produce The Muppet Show in England had been made , the sets were destroyed , and the Muppets were officially " let go " from the show 's regular cast .
All of the Gorch sketches from the second half of the season revolved around the idea that the Muppets had been fired , and were trying desperately to get their jobs back .
In 1983 , Jim Henson commented on what happened behind the scenes at Saturday Night Live :
“ I saw what he ( Lorne Michaels ) was going for and I really liked it and wanted to be a part of it , but somehow what we were trying to do and what his writers could write for it never jelled .
...
When they were writing for us , I had the feeling they were writing normal sitcom stuff , which is really boring and bland .
...
Yeah , it just never jelled with the particular writers we were working with , but at no time did I ever lose my respect for the show .
I always liked what they were doing . [ 4 ] ”
In early 1999 , Frank Oz also commented on the show :
“ There was good and bad .
The bad unfortunately was that I think we did n't really belong on Saturday Night Live .
I think our very explosive , more cartoony comedy did n't jive with the kind of Second City casual laid - back comedy , so the writers had a lot of trouble writing for us .
They were n't used to that kind of Muppet writing .
But the good part was that every Saturday was very exciting - going through rehearsal , then dress [ rehearsal ] , then air - and meeting and seeing the beginnings of Andy Kaufman , and the great little films of Albert Brooks , and seeing John [ Belushi ] and Chevy [ Chase ] and Danny [ Aykroyd ] , the beginnings of all that .
That was very , very exciting .
A live show on Saturday night is always exciting .
But it was good at the end of the year that The Muppet Show was there for us , because it was just too difficult for them .
We did n't belong on that show anymore .
But we had a great time . [ 5 ] ”
The segments dealt with a number of racy issues : alcohol abuse , adultery , species extinction , drugs , and other " adult " topics , though each was treated with the expected SNL irreverence .
Skits were indeed performed live .
The exception was the January 24 , 1976 episode ; that sketch was pre-taped on January 10th , during the pre-shoot of the Elliott Gould episode .
The Muppets were supposed to have appeared on the Saturday Night Live episode hosted by Gerald Ford 's press secretary , Ron Nessen , as evidenced by a behind - the - scenes photo and Don Pardo 's announcing the Muppet cast during that episode 's credits .
Nessen explained at the end of the episode that they could not be there due to " technical complications . "
The Gorch sketches from the first season were included on the Saturday Night Live : The Complete First Season DVD set .
While the Gorch characters were never significantly utilized following their expulsion from SNL , they can be glimpsed ( minus Favog ) in the crowd of Muppets during the " Rainbow Connection " finale in The Muppet Movie ( 1979 ) .
Their presence was referenced years later in a 2011 episode hosted by Jason Segel , complete with an onscreen photo of Scred .

Larissa MacFarquahar ’s profile of Paul Krugman is worth your attention .
It ’s a substantial tome , full of good stuff , from a portrait of the economist as a young smart guy to the sequence of what I would n’t call radicalization , but his conversion to the assumption of a kind of moral duty to speak .
But while the meat of the piece in many ways lies with this latter end of Krugman ’s career , the bits where he tries to speak truth to power whilst educating the rest of us , the parts of the profile I like best are those that give insight into the practice and competences of economics as an aspiring science .
Krugman acknowledges what his “ fresh - water ” former friends ( go to the piece if the term is n’t already known to you ) mostly do n’t : that much of what economics tells us is obvious , that economists know less that is true than people realize , and conversely , that much of what they do know is n’t true — and that ’s a feature , not a bug .
In discussing one of the key pieces of work that secures Krugman ’s reputation as a top - flight economist , Macfarquahar write :
Again , as in his trade theory , it was not so much his idea that was significant as the translation of the idea into mathematical language .
“ I explained this basic idea ” — of economic geography — “ to a non-economist friend , ” Krugman wrote , “ who replied in some dismay , ‘ Is n’t that pretty obvious ? ’
And of course it is . ”
As an aside , I can affirm the more general truth of this anecdote .
I had the chance to sit in on some of the promotion and hiring reviews pending at MIT ’s economics department ( coincidentally , Krugman ’s former intellectual home ) and while there were certain appointments in which the mathematical sophistication and abstraction from recognizable real - world issues was beyond not only me , but just about everyone in the room too , there were others in which the key ideas were rigorous and meticulous demonstrations of pretty obvious ideas .
The reason such work was seen as good was not because it presented a fundamental new insight , but because it presented that insight with a particular body of data and methodological rigor .
( To add — there are other ways of demonstrating some of these facts ; historians and anthropologists , for example , can and do observe the same phenomena as economists might .
There data may overlap , but not be identical , and their interpretative tools may — often do — yield similar conclusions by their different routes … but all this is a digression . )
To get back on track : MacFarquahar then expands on why economists bother with formalizations of penetrating glimpses of the obvious — and or why other disciplines might know things that economists had forgotten .
She writes :
Krugman began to realize that in the previous few decades economic knowledge that had not been translated into models had been effectively lost , because economists did n’t know what to do with it .
His friend Craig Murphy , a political scientist at Wellesley , had a collection of antique maps of Africa , and he told Krugman that a similar thing had happened in cartography .
Sixteenth - century maps of Africa were misleading in all kinds of ways , but they contained quite a bit of information about the continent ’s interior — the River Niger , Timbuktu .
Two centuries later , mapmaking had become much more accurate , but the interior of Africa had become a blank .
As standards for what counted as a mappable fact rose , knowledge that did n’t meet those standards — secondhand travellers ’ reports , guesses hazarded without compasses or sextants — was discarded and lost .
Eventually , the higher standards paid off — by the nineteenth century the maps were filled in again — but for a while the sharpening of technique caused loss as well as gain .
The point being that economists , for good reasons , often need to rebuild a structure of known facts and ideas — not because they could not know these things by other means ( like a good cartographic historian would ) but because for economists to talk to each other , they need to express the objects of their curiosity in a form that their colleagues can understand .
So far so good — but such mutual comprehensibility can come , as MacFarquahar documents Krugman discovering , at the expense of insights available for the taking .
This is what I mean when I say , as I have on occasion that economics is an aspiring , or simply a young discipline
That is : economics as practiced in the academy is in possession , its practitioners believe ( and I mostly do too , not that my opinion matters ) of a body of methods and a growing number of results that suggest that it is a powerful way of analyzing certain kinds of human behavior , and for making useful predictions about some things .
But it is far from as comprehensive in its explanatory power as some of its practitioners — and many more in the economic pundit class — would have one believe .
What ’s more , it ’s important to remember that there is a difference between a valid result and an empirically valuable one .
More bluntly : it ’s not just possible , but common to come up with something that is absolutely “ right ” within the framework of economic thinking that is simply false in the real world .
MacFarquar writes :
The most successful paper Krugman ever wrote was about target zones , and it was completely wrong .
In the years before Europe adopted the euro , it was thought that establishing something between floating exchange rates and fixed ones — a “ target zone ” within which a currency would be allowed to float — might reap some of the advantages of each .
He estimates that by the time the paper was officially published , in 1991 , some hundred and fifty derivative papers had already appeared .
“ Empirically , it does n’t work at all , ” Krugman says .
“ People loved it as an academic thing , but it had some very strong predictions about interest rates inside target zones .
Those predictions all turned out to be wrong .
But nobody attacked me for that .
I was showing that if target zones worked the way that people say they ’re supposed to work , then this is how it would play out . ”
Economics — academic economics — “ knows ” much more than it knows … and that ’s perfectly alright for the development of a body of thought .
The problem only surfaces either when economics results are given more credence than they deserve in the making of public policy and / or opinion .
I ’d blurt “ supply side ” here , except that this was explicitly controversial within the profession , and so the history of supply side policy is not simply a story of a consensus too confidently achieved , but rather of the catastrophic process by which bad ideas are transformed into political certainties … which leads directly to the second half of my diagnosis of pathologies …
… and that would be when economists — or political / ideological allies — present as settled conclusions that are either uncertain or false .
You see that a lot these days with deficit hawks — those folks who know what ai n’t so , which is that deficit spending in the context of below - capacity employment and production can’t spur growth .
It ’s a view associated with the freshwater school , and disputed hotly by the saltwater crowd , and by reality … and it is discussed amongst much else by Krugman himself within his now famous ( or notorious ) article “ How Did Economists Get It So Wrong . ”
All of which is to say : 1 ) Read the profile ,
. and 2 ) remember : economists , especially those who tell that GOP tax and budget policies will get us out of a recession , match Martin Rees ‘ definition of cosmologists :
Often ( always ? –ed. ) in error … but never in doubt .

World Trade Center 9/11 Photos : A Fresh But Painful Look at Sept. 11 Tragedy World Trade Center images offer a fresh but painful look at the tragedy .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 10 , 2010  --
Twelve images newly released by the government of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorists ' attacks on the World Trade Center provide a fresh look at the tragedy and its impact on New York City .
The photographs obtained by ABC News show , among other things , tugboats and commuter ferries that raced to the shoreline near the burning twin towers .
Aerial images depict the extent of dust and debris plume engulfing lower Manhattan .
Others offer new perspectives on the blanket of white ash that covered the ground .
The latest release follows Monday 's publication of other newly released photos first obtained by ABC News from the federal agency investigating the buildings ' collapse .
The extensive collection of photos and some videos collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) shows the horrific aftermath of two commercial jetliners hitting the towers , leaving 2,750 dead .
While many of the pictures are similar to images the public has seen before , some are from different vantage points or angles .
They include hundreds of shots taken from New York Police Department helicopters , showing the vast clouds of dust and debris when the towers fell .
" I almost did n't realize what I was seeing that day , " ex-NYPD Aviation Unit Detective Greg Semendinger told AP of the photos he contributed to the collection .
" Looking at it now , it 's amazing I took those pictures .
The images are ... stunning . "
The vast image collection was released following a Freedom of Information Act request filed by ABC News last year .
In August 2009 , NIST printed a notice in the Federal Register asking photographers for permission to make public images collected during the agency 's investigation into the towers ' collapse .
After seeing the notice , ABC News sought to obtain the volumes of pictures and video that NIST had collected and studied during its inquiry into the World Trade Center towers ' structural failures .
The Institute fulfilled the request nearly six months later , providing pictures on nine CDs .
There were 2,779 pictures on the discs .
It 's a " phenomenal body of work , " Jan Ramirez , chief curator of the planned Sept. 11 museum , told AP .
The photos are " absolutely core to understanding the visual phenomena of what was happening . "
ABC News has asked for permission to publish more of the images , the rights to which are still retained by the organizations or private individuals who originally took them .
ABC News ' Pierre Thomas , Jack Cloherty , Lisa Jones and the Associated Press contributed to this report .

White roofs could cool cities : study
Painting all the world 's city rooftops white could significantly cool urban areas and perhaps ease the impact of global warming , according to a new study .
Considered a fanciful notion by some critics , research by scientists at the US National Center for Climate Research indicates it has possibilities .
" Our research demonstrates that white roofs , at least in theory , can be an effective method for reducing urban heat , " says Dr Keith Oleson , the study 's lead author .
" It remains to be seen if it 's actually feasible for cities to paint their roofs white , but the idea certainly warrants further investigation . "
Climate change hits cities harder than rural areas because many urban surfaces , including dark - colour asphalt roads and tar - covered roofs , absorb heat from the Sun .
This creates so - called ' heat islands ' where temperatures can be between 1 °C and 3 °C higher than in the countryside .
White roofs and lighter - colour roads would reflect this heat instead of absorbing it .
Researchers used a computer model to simulate how much solar radiation urban surfaces absorb , and figured that if all the roofs in cities around the globe were painted entirely white , the heat island effect could be cut by 33 % .
That would cool the world 's cities by an average of about 0.4 °C , with the cooling effect most pronounced on summer days .
And the white roofs would also keep the interiors of the buildings cooler .
In the real world , it would be difficult for any roof to be painted completely white , because of heating and cooling vents and other openings .
There was n't enough detail in the model to figure how much white roofs would cool individual cities , but there was enough to show temperature change in big metropolitan areas .
For example , the New York area , white roofs would cool summer afternoons by almost 1°C .
The study has been accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Hollywood movies have found a mathematical formula that lets them match the effects of their shots to the attention spans of their audiences .
Psychologist Professor James Cutting and his team from Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , analyzed 150 high - grossing Hollywood films released from 1935 to 2005 and discovered the shot lengths in the more recent movies followed the same mathematical pattern that describes the human attention span .
The pattern was derived by scientists at the University of Texas in Austin in the 1990s who studied the attention spans of subjects performing hundreds of trials .
The team then converted the measurements of their attention spans into wave forms using a mathematical technique known as the Fourier transform .
They found that the magnitude of the waves increased as their frequency decreased , a pattern known as pink noise , or 1 / f fluctuation , which means that attention spans of the same lengths recurred at regular intervals .
The same pattern has been found by Benoit Mandelbrot ( the chaos theorist ) in the annual flood levels of the Nile , and has been seen by others in air turbulence , and also in music .
Cutting made his discovery by measuring the length of every shot in 150 comedy , drama and action films , and then converted the measurements into waves for every movie .
He found that the more recent the films were , the more likely they were to obey the 1/f fluctuation , and this did not just apply to fast action movies .
Cutting said the significant thing is that shots of similar lengths recur in a regular pattern through the film .
Cutting believes obeying the 1/f law makes films “ resonate with the rhythm of human attention spans , ” and this makes them more gripping .
Films edited in this way would then tend to be more successful and the style of shooting and editing more likely to be copied .
Films of Cutting ’s own favorite genre , the Film Noir , do not generally follow the 1/ f law , with shot lengths tending to be more random .
By contrast The Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 ) and the 2005 blockbuster movie Star Wars Episode III ( which Cutting considers to be “ just dreadful ” ) both follow 1/f rigidly .
The researchers concluded that over the next few decades film makers may take more care to follow the 1/f law to try to boost audience engagement .

PORT -AU - PRINCE , HAITI , 25 January , 2010
Only managed to sort out reliable Internet access yesterday evening , so lots to catch up on .
***
We arrived in Port - au - Prince on Saturday afternoon , after a long but uneventful drive from Santo Domingo .
As we approached Jimani , on the Dominican border , we began seeing probable evidence of the situation on the other third of the island : makeshift roadside stalls selling gallon bottles of gasoline , heavy trucks carrying cargo , a motorcycle passenger with his leg bandaged to the thigh .
The area near the border gate was swarming with vehicles and people , and we fully expected border formalities to take some time .
But after a mysterious confab between our driver and the two associates who ’d come along on the trip and a man in a purple cap , we drove through the border gates just like that , with nary a nod from the guards or a request to see a passport , through the few yards of tierra de nadie between the two borders , and into Haiti .
Later I noticed that the man in the purple cap had joined us and was sitting in the tray of the pickup among our luggage — turns out he was our Haitian navigator .
***
It was some time before we saw any earthquake damage — the epicentre was south - west of the city of Port - au - Prince , and we were approaching from the east .
Then , here and there , the odd ill - starred building with a collapsed balcony ; clusters of makeshift tents in parking lots and clearings .
Then both sights became became more frequent : residences with collapsed upper storeys , framed pictures still hanging off the walls , crushed sofas .
The clusters turned into tent cities .
But still not anything like the images from the news .
***
I think that part of me has come to Haiti wanting to believe that the images I ’d been seeing in the media were somehow exaggerated .
In largely middle - class Delmas , where our journey from Santo Domingo ends on Saturday , a number of commercial buildings and residences along the Route de Delmas have collapsed , either entirely or partially , and walls everywhere show cracks and fissures .
From one building , a large pane of glass leans precariously out over the sidewalk , and a pale yellow three - story residence has caved in on itself like a fallen cake , the ground floor flattened beneath the weight of the floors above .
The arbitrariness of the damage was striking — why this building and not that one ?
The Canadian Embassy is perfectly intact , and a reporter is recording a stand - up on one of the parapets above the road .
Businesses , including gas stations , are operating .
People carrying five - gallon water bottles are lined up in orderly fashion in front of a water distribution shop .
Traffic is flowing , and in spite of the damage it appears that things have returned almost to normal in Delmas .
The offices of the National Democratic Institute , which the Internews team has commandeered for its use while in Haiti , are buzzing with activity .
A young Haitian hanging out in front of the building helps us take our luggage up the stairs .
“ Ça va [ How ’s it going ] ? ” he says .
“ Ça va bien , ” I reply .
The stock response , but it displeases him .
“ Ca va * pas * bien [ It 's * not* going well ] ” , he says .
“ J’ai perdu ma maison , mon beau - frère .
Je suis sans - abri [ I ’ve lost my house , my brother - in - law is dead .
I ’m homeless ] . ”
We ’ve arrived just at the moment when the Internews team is rushing to get their daily information programme on air , so nobody pays us much heed .
The place is crammed with suitcases , air mattresses , cases of water , laptops , emergency radios .
Towels are slung over chair backs , and one shelf of a stationery cupboard is loaded with canned food .
It does n't look like there 'll be room for us .
We issue tweets saying we 're looking for accommodation and Alice gets on the phone and starts working her family contacts .
Within 45 minutes
Alice ’s friends L and B have arrived to collect us , and we head back out on to the Route de Delmas , now in darkness except for the headlights of cars and the fires and flambeaux on street vendors ’ stalls .
On our way up to L and B ’s house in Laboule we pass through well - heeled Pétionville , which is reported to have been largely unaffected by the quake .
Two of its gracious squares , Place Boyer and Place St. Pierre , have nevertheless been transformed into teeming tent cities , filled with the newly homeless from other parts of this divided city .
The luckier people are settling down for the night under the canopies of camionettes parked at the side of the road .
In spite of the people milling around in the darkness , it is quiet .
Parked across from the Hotel Kinam on Place St. Pierre is a MINUSTAH truck .
It ’s odd to wake up the next morning in Laboule and look out upon a stunning mountain view .
None of the houses in the area appears to have sustained much damage , though L and B have lost a retaining wall .
The absence of running water and electricity probably have less to do with the earthquake than the fact that we ’re in Haiti .
At L and B ’s house there are a few hairline cracks in the mortar that L , an engineer , has marked with black crayon , so he ’ll know if they widen .
L takes what he calls a scientific approach to the quake .
He explains the math behind the Richter Scale and has decided it ’s not worth worrying about aftershocks .
In fact , L sleeps through the aftershock that occurs on Sunday afternoon .
The radio reports on Sunday indicate that people continue to be evacuated from the city .
Over lunch , L tells us that some “ méchants ” ( troublemakers ) are spreading rumours that people who opt for evacuation wo n’t be allowed to return to the capital for five years .
We also talk about L’s sister , a physician who has come from the States to volunteer her services and is now working in a centre at Croix des Bouquets .
L’s sister reports that Haitian doctors are being sidelined in the relief efforts , and it ’s only after she gives an interview to CNN that she starts getting some grudging respect from the big international agencies .
***
We finally leave Laboule late on Sunday afternoon and descend into Port - au - Prince .
There are fallen buildings all along the Route de Bourdon and a slum that stretches like a skin over the hillside in the distance looks chipped and battered .
It gets worse as we get nearer to the city centre , but it 's still not the total wreckage from the photos .
We arrive at the Champs de Mars , the massive square in the centre of town that 's been partly overtaken by a multi-section tent city .
The sinking feeling sets in officially as we stop in front of the National Palace with its caved - in roof .
That one certainly matches the news photos , except that up close it ’s more massive , and more desolate .
We drive around the Champs de Mars and pass in front of the Plaza Hotel , where a news cameraman is filming what looks like a heap of black rags in the street .
The rags are in fact two dead bodies , perhaps recently pulled from the wreckage , their limbs intertwined .
The area just east of the Champs de Mars is straight out of the news photos .
A long corridor of rubble , not a building left standing .
You ’ve all seen it by now , so I do n’t need to describe it further , or the scent of decay that hangs in the air , now several times less intense than it was a few days ago .
I 'm adding these last few lines just so I can say I did n't end on a note of despair .
I apologise for adding to the heavy burden of bad news already borne by this country .
And now to make a plan for what we 'll be doing while we 're here .

Pelosi : Health Reform Will Create 400,000 Jobs " Almost Immediately "
Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the health summit : " It 's about jobs .
In it 's life , it [ the health bill ] will create 4 million jobs -- 400,000 jobs almost immediately . "
A French man has earned a bravery medal for diving into an icy river and saving a pregnant woman who was trapped inside a crashed car in northeastern France .
The woman had been in a collision with another car which sent her car into a river in Amiens on Wednesday evening .
The woman - eight months pregnant - and her husband were submerged when the car flipped over .
The husband cried for help and Eddy Devauchelle , 42 , dived in , pulling the unconscious woman to safety .
Police and fire crews soon arrived at the scene and the couple were rushed to a hospital in Amiens , where the pregnant woman is being kept under constant observation .
" A firefighter came to see me and said ' the baby and his mother are safe ! ' "
Mr Devauchelle told a local paper , Le Courrier Picard .
Describing the rescue , he said he had first seen " a man in the river , with water up to his neck " and some people watching on the river bank .
" He cried ' Please save my wife ! '
I got out of my car , took off my jacket and got in , up to my neck - it was freezing , " he said .
" The husband was rooted to the spot - I told him , ' Let 's get going ! ' "
Mr Devauchelle said he struggled to release the car door and free the unconscious woman from her seatbelt , but managed to pull her to the bank and put her in the recovery position .
Acknowledging the rescue , the prefect of the Picardy region and Somme , Michel Delpuech , " awarded this man the silver medal of bravery and dedication , " the prefecture said in a statement .
The capital of the Somme department in Picardy , Amiens is 120 km ( 75 miles ) north of Paris .

Deficits :
The media breathlessly report an " unexpectedly " large increase in unemployment applications with inflation rising " faster than expected . "
Given the wasteful spending spree we 've been on , what do they expect ?
The economic gurus at major media outlets such as Reuters are having a dickens of a time explaining why the economy is not responding to the massive doses of monetary steroids we 've been injecting .
Last Thursday , after the Labor Department announced that claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 31,000 to 473,000 , Reuters reported that the surge was " unexpected . "
The market , we were told , was looking for 430,000 .
We were also told " prices paid at the farm and factory gate rose a faster than expected 1.4 % from December after a 0.4 % gain in December , as higher gasoline prices and unusually cold temperatures helped boost energy costs . "
We guess no one expected climate change to be a hoax or lack of drilling to raise prices .
These analysts are shocked - shocked !
- that this hopey - changey thing is n't working out .
But when you have an economic policy that consists of taking money out of the economy to redistribute , after subtracting government overhead and borrowing the rest from places like China , these numbers should not be " unexpected . "
Government has been sucking all the economic oxygen out of the room .
The White House announces the establishment of a debt commission led by two retired politicians after submitting a fiscal 2011 budget with a $ 1.36 trillion dollar shortfall .
Do n't we already have a debt commission - called Congress ?
What did we elect them to do ?
Is n't it a tad disingenuous to freeze 12 % of federal spending after you increased it by 20 % across the board your first year ?
After the $ 862 billion stimulus failed to jump - start the economy and create jobs , the question is , why do we keep spending like this ?
Aside from the crushing debt our children will be burdened with , an ever bigger government will only crowd out the private sector that is the only real hope for genuine recovery .
Remember the triumphant announcement that GDP grew by 5.7 % in the fourth quarter ?
Harm Bandholz , an economist at UniCredit Research in New York , says that " GDP growth is artificially inflated by government stimulus and the inventory cycle rather than driven by final demand , which usually goes hand in hand with an improvement in the labor market . "
It 's small businesses and risk - taking entrepreneurs who create jobs , not the government .
And it is not true , as Vice President Joe Biden once said , that we must keep spending in order to avoid bankruptcy .
Eventually , the national credit card must come due .
We do not need a debt commission to tell us not to spend money we do n't have .
Yet this Congress and this administration unwisely tried to increase spending even more by nationalizing health care and pushing economy - killing cap - and - trade legislation .
The deficit commission , we expect , is merely a cover to raise taxes on the middle class while letting President Obama claim he did n't break his campaign promise .
Will the commission recommend extending the Bush tax cuts due to expire this year ?
Will it recommend returning unspent stimulus funds and paid - back TARP money to the Treasury ?
We expect not .
We do n't need a debt commission to tell us the way to grow is by cutting taxes and spending and creating a degree of certainty so business can plan for the future .
The path to prosperity is for government to get out of the way .
Otherwise , Democrats themselves will experience greater - than - expected losses in November .

Original version written in 1994 and published in the Sun Observer
Awk is an extremely versatile programming language for working on files .
We 'll teach you just enough to understand the examples in this page , plus a smidgen .
The examples given below have the extensions of the executing script as part of the filename .
Once you download it , and make it executable , you can rename it anything you want .
In the past I have covered grep and sed .
This section discusses AWK , another cornerstone of UNIX shell programming .
There are three variations of AWK :
AWK - the ( very old ) original from AT&T
NAWK - A newer , improved version from AT&T
GAWK - The Free Software foundation 's version
Originally , I did n't plan to discuss NAWK , but several UNIX vendors have replaced AWK with NAWK , and there are several incompatibilities between the two .
It would be cruel of me to not warn you about the differences .
So I will highlight those when I come to them .
It is important to know than all of AWK 's features are in NAWK and GAWK .
Most , if not all , of NAWK 's features are in GAWK .
NAWK ships as part of Solaris .
GAWK does not .
However , many sites on the Internet have the sources freely available .
If you user Linux , you have GAWK .
But in general , assume that I am talking about the classic AWK unless otherwise noted .
And now there is talk about MAWK , TAWK , and JAWK .
Why is AWK so important ?
It is an excellent filter and report writer .
Many UNIX utilities generates rows and columns of information .
AWK is an excellent tool for processing these rows and columns , and is easier to use AWK than most conventional programming languages .
It can be considered to be a pseudo - C interpretor , as it understands the same arithmatic operators as C. AWK also has string manipulation functions , so it can search for particular strings and modify the output .
AWK also has associative arrays , which are incredible useful , and is a feature most computing languages lack .
Associative arrays can make a complex problem a trivial exercise .
I 'll try to cover the essential parts or AWK , and mention the extensions / variations .
The " new AWK , " or " nawk " , comes on the Sun system , and you may find it superior to the old AWK in many ways .
In particular , it has better diagnostics , and wo n't print out the infamous " bailing out near line ... " message the original AWK is prone to do .
Instead , " nawk " prints out the line it did n't understand , and highlights the bad parts with arrows .
GAWK does this as well , and this really helps a lot .
If you find yourself needing a feature that is very difficult or impossible to do in AWK , I suggest you either use NAWK , or GAWK , or convert your AWK script into PERL using the " a2p " conversion program which comes with PERL .
PERL is a marvelous language , and I use it all the time , but I do not plan to cover PERL in these tutorials .
Having made my intention clear , I can continue with a clear conscience .
Many UNIX utilities have strange names .
AWK is one of those utilities .
It is not an abbreviation for awkward .
In fact , it is an elegant and simple language .
The work " AWK " is derived from the initials of the language 's three developers : A. Aho , B. W. Kernighan and P. Weinberger .
The essential organization of an AWK program follows the form :
pattern { action }
The pattern specifies when the action is performed .
Like most UNIX utilities , AWK is line oriented .
That is , the pattern specifies a test that is performed with each line read as input .
If the condition is true , then the action is taken .
The default pattern is something that matches every line .
This is the blank or null pattern .
Two other important patterns are specified by the keywords " BEGIN " and " END " .
As you might expect , these two words specify actions to be taken before any lines are read , and after the last line is read .
The AWK program below :
BEGIN { print " START " } { print } END { print " STOP " }
adds one line before and one line after the input file .
This is n't very useful , but with a simple change , we can make this into a typical AWK program :
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , $ 3}
END { print " - DONE -" }
I 'll improve the script in the next sections , but we 'll call it " FileOwner " .
But let 's not put it into a script or file yet .
I will cover that part in a bit .
Hang on and follow with me so you get the flavor of AWK .
The characters " \t " Indicates a tab character so the output lines up on even boundries .
The " $ 8 " and " $ 3 " have a meaning similar to a shell script .
Instead of the eighth and third argument , they mean the eighth and third field of the input line .
You can think of a field as a column , and the action you specify operates on each line or row read in .
There are two differences between AWK and a shell processing the characters within double quotes .
AWK understands special characters follow the " \ " character like " t " .
The Bourne and C UNIX shells do not .
Also , unlike the shell ( and PERL ) AWK does not evaluate variables within strings .
To explain , the second line could not be written like this :
{ print " $ 8\t$ 3 " }
That example would print " $ 8 $ 3 " .
Inside the quotes , the dollar sign is not a special character .
Outside , it corresponds to a field .
What do I mean by the third and eight field ?
Consider the Solaris " /usr / bin/ls - l " command , which has eight columns of information .
The System V version ( Similar to the Linux version ) , " / usr /5 bin/ls - l " has 9 columns .
The third column is the owner , and the eighth ( or nineth ) column in the name of the file .
This AWK program can be used to process the output of the " ls - l " command , printing out the filename , then the owner , for each file .
I 'll show you how .
Update :
On a linux system , change " $ 8 " to " $ 9 " .
One more point about the use of a dollar sign .
In scripting languages like Perl and the various shells , a dollar sign means the word following is the name of the variable .
Awk is different .
The dollar sign means that we are refering to a field or column in the current line .
When switching between Perl and AWK you must remener that " $ " has a different meaning .
So the following piece of code prints two " fields " to standard out .
The first field printed is the number " 5 " , the second is the fifth field ( or column ) on the input line .
BEGIN { x=5 }
{ print x , $x}
So let 's start writing our first AWK script .
There are a couple of ways to do this .
Assuming the first script is called " FileOwner " , the invocation would be
ls -l | FileOwner
This might generate the following if there were only two files in the current directory :
File Owner
a.file barnett
another . file barnett
- DONE -
There are two problems with this script .
Both problems are easy to fix , but I 'll hold off on this until I cover the basics .
The script itself can be written in many ways .
I 've show both the C shell ( csh / tcsh ) , and Bourne / Bash / POSIX shell script .
The C shell version would look like this :
#!/bin/csh -f # Linux users have to change $ 8 to $ 9 awk '\ BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " } \ { print $ 8 , " \t " , $ 3 } \ END { print " - DONE - " } \ '
And of course , once you create this script , you need to make this script executable by typing
chmod +x awk_example.1.csh
Click here to get file : awk_example1.csh
As you can see in the above script , each line of the AWK script must have a backslash if it is not the last line of the script .
This is necessary as the C shell does n't , by default , allow strings to be longer than a line .
I have a long list of complaints about using the C shell .
See Top
Ten reasons not to use the C shell
The Bourne shell ( as does most shells ) allows quoted strings to span several lines :
#!/bin/sh
# Linux users have to change $ 8 to $ 9
awk '
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , $ 3}
END { print " - DONE -" }
'
And again , once it is created , it has to be made executable :
chmod +x awk_example1.sh
Click here to get file : awk_example1.sh
By the way , I give example scripts in the tutorial , and use an extension on the filename to indicate the type of script .
You can , of course , " install " the script in your home " bin " directory by typing
cp awk_example1.sh $ HOME/bin/awk_example1 chmod +x $ HOME/bin/awk_example1
A third type of AWK script is a " native ' AWK script , where you do n't use the shell .
You can write the commands in a file , and execute
awk -f filename
Since AWK is also an interpretor , like the shell , you can save yourself a step and make the file executable by add one line in the beginning of the file :
#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , $ 3}
END { print " - DONE -" }
Then execute " chmod +x " and ise this file as a new UNIX command .
Click here to get file : awk_example1.awk
Notice the " - f " option following '#!/ bin/awk " above , which is also used in the third format where you use AWK to execute the file directly , i.e. " awk -f filename " .
The " - f " option specifies the AWK file containing the instructions .
As you can see , AWK considers lines that start with a " # " to be a comment , just like the shell .
To be precise , anything from the " # " to the end of the line is a comment ( unless its inside an AWK string .
However , I always comment my AWK scripts with the " # " at the start of the line , for reasons I 'll discuss later .
Which format should you use ?
I prefer the last format when possible .
It 's shorter and simpler .
It 's also easier to debug problems .
If you need to use a shell , and want to avoid using too many files , you can combine them as we did in the first and second example .
The format of the original AWK is not free - form .
You can not put new line breaks just anywhere .
They must go in particular locations .
To be precise , in the original AWK you can insert a new line character after the curly braces , and at the end of a command , but not elsewhere .
If you wanted to break a long line into two lines at any other place , you had to use a backslash :
#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , \
$ 3}
END { print " - DONE -" }
Click here to get file : awk_example2.awk
The Bourne shell version would be
#!/bin/sh
awk '
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , \
$ 3}
END { print " done " }
'
Click here to get file : awk_example2.sh
while the C shell would be
#!/bin/csh -f
awk '
BEGIN { print " File\tOwner " }\
{ print $ 8 , " \t " , \\
$ 3} \
END { print " done " } \
'
Click here to get file : awk_example2.csh
As you can see , this demonstrates how awkward the C shell is when enclosing an AWK script .
Not only are back slashes needed for every line , some lines need two , then the old original AWK is used .
Newer AWK's are more flexible where newlines can be added .
Many people , like me , will warn you about the C shell .
Some of the problems are subtle , and you may never see them .
Try to include an AWK or sed script within a C shell script , and the back slashes will drive you crazy .
This is what convinced me to learn the Bourne shell years ago , when I was starting out ( before the Korn shell or Bash shell were available ) .
Even if you insist on use the C shell , you should at least learn enough of the Borne / POSIX shell to set variables , which by some strange coincidence is the subject of the next section .
Since you can make a script an AWK executable by mentioning " #!/bin/awk - f " on the first line , including an AWK script inside a shell script is n't needed unless you want to either eliminate the need for an extra file , or if you want to pass a variable to the insides of an AWK script .
Since this is a common problem , now is as good a time to explain the technique .
I 'll do this by showing a simple AWK program that will only print one column .
NOTE : there will be a bug in the first version .
The number of the column will be specified by the first argument .
The first version of the program , which we will call " Column " , looks like this :
#!/bin/sh
# NOTE - this script does not work !
column = " $ 1 "
awk '{print $ column} '
Click here to get file ( but be aware that it does n't work ) : Column1.sh
A suggested use is :
ls -l | Column 3
This would print the third column from the ls command , which would be the owner of the file .
You can change this into a utility that counts how many files are owned by each user by adding
ls -l | Column 3 | uniq -c | sort -nr
Only one problem : the script does n't work .
The value of the " column " variable is not seen by AWK .
Change " awk " to " echo " to check .
You need to turn off the quoting when the variable is seen .
This can be done by ending the quoting , and restarting it after the variable :
#!/bin/sh
column = " $ 1 "
awk '{print $ '" $ column " '} '
Click here to get file : Column2.sh
This is a very important concept , and throws experienced programmers a curve ball .
In many computer languages , a string has a start quote , and end quote , and the contents in between .
If you want to include a special character inside the quote , you must prevent the character from having the typical meaning .
In the C language , this is down by putting a backslash before the character .
In other languages , there is a special combination of characters to to this .
In the C and Bourne shell , the quote is just a switch .
It turns the interpretation mode on or off .
There is really no such concept as " start of string " and " end of string " .
The quotes toggle a switch inside the interpretor .
The quote character is not passed on to the application .
This is why there are two pairs of quotes above .
Notice there are two dollar signs .
The first one is quoted , and is seen by AWK .
The second one is not quoted , so the shell evaluates the variable , and replaces " $ column " by the value .
If you do n't understand , either change " awk " to " echo " , or change the first line to read " #!/bin/sh -x " .
Some improvements are needed , however .
The Bourne shell has a mechanism to provide a value for a variable if the value is n't set , or is set and the value is an empty string .
This is done by using the format :
$ {variable : - defaultvalue}
This is shown below , where the default column will be one :
#!/bin/sh
column= " $ {1:-1 } "
awk '{print $ '" $ column " '} '
Click here to get file : Column3.sh
We can save a line by combining these two steps :
#!/bin/sh
awk '{print $ ' " $ { 1 : - 1 } " '} '
Click here to get file : Column4.sh
It is hard to read , but it is compact .
There is one other method that can be used .
If you execute an AWK command and include on the command line information in the following form :
variable=value
this variable will be set when the AWK script starts .
An example of this use would be :
#!/bin/sh
awk '{print $ c} ' c= " $ { 1:- 1 } "
Click here to get file : Column5.sh
This last variation does not have the problems with quoting the previous example had .
You should master the earlier example , however , because you can use it with any script or command .
The second method is special to AWK .
Modern AWK 's have other options as well .
See the comp.unix . shell FAQ .
Earlier I discussed ways to start an AWK script .
This section will discuss the various grammatical elements of AWK .
There are several arithmetic operators , similar to C .
These are the binary operators , which operate on two variables :
AWK Table 1
Binary Operators Operator Type Meaning + Arithmetic Addition - Arithmetic Subtraction * Arithmetic Multiplication / Arithmetic Division % Arithmetic Modulo < space > String Concatenation
Using variables with the value of " 7 " and " 3 " , AWK returns the following results for each operator when using the print command :
Expression Result 7+3 10 7-3 4 7*3 21 7/3 2.33333 7%3 1 7 3 73
There are a few points to make .
The modulus operator finds the remainder after an integer divide .
The print command output a floating point number on the divide , but an integer for the rest .
The string concatenate operator is confusing , since it is n't even visible .
Place a space between two variables and the strings are concatenated together .
This also shows that numbers are converted automatically into strings when needed .
Unlike C , AWK does n't have " types " of variables .
There is one type only , and it can be a string or number .
The conversion rules are simple .
A number can easily be converted into a string .
When a string is converted into a number , AWK will do so .
The string " 123 " will be converted into the number 123 .
However , the string " 123X " will be converted into the number 0 . ( NAWK will behave differently , and converts the string into integer 123 , which is found in the beginning of the string ) .
The " + " and " - " operators can be used before variables and numbers .
If X equals 4 , then the statement :
print -x ;
will print " - 4 " .
AWK also supports the " ++ " and " - - " operators of C. Both increment or decrement the variables by one .
The operator can only be used with a single variable , and can be before or after the variable .
The prefix form modifies the value , and then uses the result , while the postfix form gets the results of the variable , and afterwards modifies the variable .
As an example , if X has the value of 3 , then the AWK statement
print x++ , " " , ++x ;
would print the numbers 3 and 5 .
These operators are also assignment operators , and can be used by themselves on a line :
x ++;
--y ;
Variables can be assigned new values with the assignment operators .
You know about " ++ " and " - - " .
The other assignment statement is simply :
variable = arithmetic_expression
Certain operators have precedence over others ; parenthesis can be used to control grouping .
The statement
x=1+2*3 4 ;
is the same as
x = ( 1 + ( 2 * 3 ) ) " 4 " ;
Both print out " 74 " .
Notice spaces can be added for readability .
AWK , like C , has special assignment operators , which combine a calculation with an assignment .
Instead of saying
x=x+2 ;
you can more concisely say :
x+=2 ;
The complete list follows :
AWK Table 2
Assignment Operators Operator Meaning +=
Add result to variable -= Subtract result from variable *= Multiply variable by result /=
Divide variable by result %= Apply modulo to variable
The second type of expression in AWK is the conditional expression .
This is used for certain tests , like the if or while .
Boolean conditions evaluate to true or false .
In AWK , there is a definite difference between a boolean condition , and an arithmetic expression .
You can not convert a boolean condition to an integer or string .
You can , however , use an arithmetic expression as a conditional expression .
A value of 0 is false , while anything else is true .
Undefined variables has the value of 0 .
Unlike AWK , NAWK lets you use booleans as integers .
Arithmetic values can also be converted into boolean conditions by using relational operators :
AWK Table 3
Relational Operators Operator Meaning == Is equal !=
Is not equal to >
Is greater than >=
Is greater than or equal to < Is less than <=
Is less than or equal to
These operators are the same as the C operators .
They can be used to compare numbers or strings .
With respect to strings , lower case letters are greater than upper case letters .
Two operators are used to compare strings to regular expressions :
AWK Table 4
Regular Expression Operators Operator Meaning ~ Matches !~
Does n't match
The order in this case is particular .
The regular expression must be enclosed by slashes , and comes after the operator .
AWK supports extended regular expressions , so the following are examples of valid tests :
word !~ / START /
lawrence_welk ~ /( one|two|three ) /
There are two boolean operators that can be used with conditional expressions .
That is , you can combine two conditional expressions with the " or " or " and " operators : " && " and " | | " .
There is also the unary not operator : " ! " .
There are only a few commands in AWK .
The list and syntax follows :
if ( conditional ) statement [ else statement ]
while ( conditional ) statement
for ( expression ; conditional ; expression ) statement
for ( variable in array ) statement
break
continue
{ [ statement ] ...}
variable =expression
print [ expression - list ] [ > expression ]
printf format [ , expression - list ] [ > expression ]
next
exit
At this point , you can use AWK as a language for simple calculations ;
If you wanted to calculate something , and not read any lines for input , you could use the BEGIN keyword discussed earlier , combined with a exit command :
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { #
Print the squares from 1 to 10 the first way i=1 ; while ( i <= 10 ) { printf " The square of " , i , " is " , i*i ; i = i+1 ; } # do it again , using more concise code for ( i=1 ; i <= 10 ; i++) { printf " The square of " , i , " is " , i*i ; } # now end exit ; }
Click here to get file : awk_print_squares.awk
The following asks for a number , and then squares it :
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { print " type a number " ; } { print " The square of " , $ 1 , " is " , $ 1 * $ 1 ; print " type another number " ; } END { print " Done " }
Click here to get file : awk_ask_for_square.awk
The above is n't a good filter , because it asks for input each time .
If you pipe the output of another program into it , you would generate a lot of meaningless prompts .
Here is a filter that you should find useful .
It counts lines , totals up the numbers in the first column , and calculates the average .
Pipe " wc - c * " into it , and it will count files , and tell you the average number of words per file , as well as the total words and the number of files .
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { #
How many lines lines=0 ; total=0 ; } { # this code is executed once for each line # increase the number of files lines ++ ; # increase the total size , which is field # 1 total +
=$ 1 ; } END { # end , now output the total print lines " lines read " ; print " total is " , total ; if ( lines > 0 ) { print " average is " , total / lines ; } else { print " average is 0 " ; } }
Click here to get file : average .
awk
You can pipe the output of " ls - s " into this filter to count the number of files , the total size , and the average size .
There is a slight problem with this script , as it includes the output of " ls " that reports the total .
This causes the number of files to be off by one .
Changing
lines ++;
to
if ( $ 1 != " total " ) lines ++;
will fix this problem .
Note the code which prevents a divide by zero .
This is common in well - written scripts .
I also initialize the variables to zero .
This is not necessary , but it is a good habit .
I have mentioned two kinds of variables : positional and user defined .
A user defined variable is one you create .
A positional variable is not a special variable , but a function triggered by the dollar sign .
Therefore
print $ 1 ;
and
X=1 ;
print $ X ;
do the same thing : print the first field on the line .
There are two more points about positional variables that are very useful .
The variable " $ 0 " refers to the entire line that AWK reads in .
That is , if you had eight fields in a line ,
print $ 0 ;
is similar to
print $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 , $ 5 , $ 6 , $ 7 , $ 8
This will change the spacing between the fields ; otherwise , they behave the same .
You can modify positional variables .
The following commands
$ 2= " " ;
print ;
deletes the second field .
If you had four fields , and wanted to print out the second and fourth field , there are two ways .
This is the first :
#!/bin/awk -f { $ 1= " " ; $ 3= " " ; print ; }
and the second
#!/bin/awk -f { print $ 2 , $ 4 ; }
These perform similarly , but not identically .
The number of spaces between the values vary .
There are two reasons for this .
The actual number of fields does not change .
Setting a positional variable to an empty string does not delete the variable .
It 's still there , but the contents has been deleted .
The other reason is the way AWK outputs the entire line .
There is a field separator that specifies what character to put between the fields on output .
The first example outputs four fields , while the second outputs two .
In - between each field is a space .
This is easier to explain if the characters between fields could be modified to be made more visible .
Well , it can .
AWK provides special variables for just that purpose .
AWK can be used to parse many system administration files .
However , many of these files do not have whitespace as a separator .
as an example , the password file uses colons .
You can easily change the field separator character to be a colon using the " - F " command line option .
The following command will print out accounts that do n't have passwords :
awk - F : '{ if ( $ 2 == " " ) print $ 1 " : no password ! " } '
</etc / passwd
There is a way to do this without the command line option .
The variable " FS " can be set like any variable , and has the same function as the " - F " command line option .
The following is a script that has the same function as the one above .
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { FS= " : " ; } { if ( $ 2 == " " ) { print $ 1 " : no password ! " ; } }
Click here to get file : awk_nopasswd.awk
The second form can be used to create a UNIX utility , which I will name " chkpasswd " , and executed like this :
chkpasswd </etc / passwd
The command " chkpasswd - F : " cannot be used , because AWK will never see this argument .
All interpreter scripts accept one and only one argument , which is immediately after the " #!/bin/awk " string .
In this case , the single argument is " - f " .
Another difference between the command line option and the internal variable is the ability to set the input field separator to be more than one character .
If you specify
FS= " : " ;
then AWK will split a line into fields wherever it sees those two characters , in that exact order .
You can not do this on the command line .
There is a third advantage the internal variable has over the command line option : you can change the field separator character as many times as you want while reading a file .
Well , at most once for each line .
You can even change it depending on the line you read .
Suppose you had the following file which contains the numbers 1 through 7 in three different formats .
Lines 4 through 6 have colon separated fields , while the others separated by spaces .
ONE 1 I
TWO 2 II
# START
THREE:3:III
FOUR:4:IV
FIVE:5:V
# STOP
SIX 6 VI
SEVEN 7 VII
The AWK program can easily switch between these formats :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( $ 1 == " #START " ) { FS= " : " ; } else if ( $ 1 == " # STOP " ) { FS= " " ; } else { # print the Roman number in column 3 print $ 3 } }
Click here to get file : awk_example3.awk
Note the field separator variable retains its value until it is explicitly changed .
You do n't have to reset it for each line .
Sounds simple , right ?
However , I have a trick question for you .
What happens if you change the field separator while reading a line ?
That is , suppose you had the following line
One Two : Three : 4 Five
and you executed the following script :
#!/bin/awk -f { print $ 2 FS= " : " print $ 2 }
What would be printed ?
" Three " or " Two : Three : 4 ? "
Well , the script would print out " Two : Three : 4 " twice .
However , if you deleted the first print statement , it would print out " Three " once !
I thought this was very strange at first , but after pulling out some hair , kicking the deck , and yelling at muself and everyone who had anything to do with the development of UNIX , it is intuitively obvious .
You just have to be thinking like a professional programmer to realize it is intuitive .
I shall explain , and prevent you from causing yourself physical harm .
If you change the field separator before you read the line , the change affects what you read .
If you change it after you read the line , it will not redefine the variables .
You would n't want a variable to change on you as a side - effect of another action .
A programming language with hidden side effects is broken , and should not be trusted .
AWK allows you to redefine the field separator either before or after you read the line , and does the right thing each time .
Once you read the variable , the variable will not change unless you change it .
Bravo !
To illustrate this further , here is another version of the previous code that changes the field separator dynamically .
In this case , AWK does it by examining field " $ 0 " , which is the entire line .
When the line contains a colon , the field separator is a colon , otherwise , it is a space .
Here is a version that worked with older versions of awk :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( $ 0 ~ /:/ ) { FS= " : " ; } else { FS= " " ; } #print the third field , whatever format print $ 3 }
Click here to get file : awk_example4.awk
However , this behavior changed in later versions , so the above script no longer works .
What happens is that once the FS variable is changed , you have to re-evaluate the fields by using $ 0=$0 :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( $ 0 ~ /:/ ) { FS= " : " ; $ 0=$ 0 } else { FS= " " ; $ 0=$ 0 } # print the third field , whatever format print $ 3 }
Click here to get file : awk_example4a.awk
This example eliminates the need to have the special " #START " and " # STOP " lines in the input .
There is an important difference between
print $ 2 $ 3
and
print $ 2 , $ 3
The first example prints out one field , and the second prints out two fields .
In the first case , the two positional parameters are concatenated together and output without a space .
In the second case , AWK prints two fields , and places the output field separator between them .
Normally this is a space , but you can change this by modifying the variable " OFS " .
If you wanted to copy the password file , but delete the encrypted password , you could use AWK :
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { FS= " : " ; OFS= " : " ; } { $ 2= " " ; print }
Click here to get file : delete_passwd.awk
Give this script the password file , and it will delete the password , but leave everything else the same .
You can make the output field separator any number of characters .
You are not limited to a single character .
It is useful to know how many fields are on a line .
You may want to have your script change its operation based on the number of fields .
As an example , the command " ls - l " may generate eight or nine fields , depending on which version you are executing .
The System V version , " /usr / bin/ls - l " generates nine fields , which is equivalent to the Berkeley " /usr/ucb/ls - lg " command .
If you wanted to print the owner and filename then the following AWK script would work with either version of " ls : "
#!/bin/awk -f # parse the output of " ls - l " # print owner and filename # remember - Berkeley ls -l has 8 fields , System V has 9 { if ( NF == 8 ) { print $ 3 , $ 8 ; } else if ( NF == 9 ) { print $ 3 , $ 9 ; } }
Click here to get file : owner_group.awk
Do n't forget the variable can be prepended with a " $ " .
This allows you to print the last field of any column
#!/bin/awk -f
{ print $ NF ; }
Click here to get file : print_last_field.awk
One warning about AWK .
There is a limit of 99 fields in a single line .
PERL does not have any such limitations .
Another useful variable is " NR " .
This tells you the number of records , or the line number .
You can use AWK to only examine certain lines .
This example prints lines after the first 100 lines , and puts a line number before each line after 100 :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( NR > 100 ) { print NR , $ 0 ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example5.awk
Normally , AWK reads one line at a time , and breaks up the line into fields .
You can set the " RS " variable to change AWK 's definition of a " line " .
If you set it to an empty string , then AWK will read the entire file into memory .
You can combine this with changing the " FS " variable .
This example treats each line as a field , and prints out the second and third line :
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { # change the record separator from newline to nothing RS= " " # change the field separator from whitespace to newline FS = "
" } { # print the second and third line of the file print $ 2 , $ 3 ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example6.awk
The two lines are printed with a space between .
Also this will only work if the input file is less than 100 lines , therefore this technique is limited .
You can use it to break words up , one word per line , using this :
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { RS= " " ; } { print ; }
Click here to get file : oneword_per_line.awk
but this only works if all of the words are separated by a space .
If there is a tab or punctuation inside , it would not .
The default output record separator is a newline , like the input .
This can be set to be a newline and carriage return , if you need to generate a text file for a non-UNIX system .
#!/bin/awk -f # this filter adds a carriage return to all lines # before the newline character BEGIN { ORS= " \r
" } { print }
Click here to get file : add_cr.awk
The last variable known to regular AWK is " FILENAME " , which tells you the name of the file being read .
#!/bin/awk -f # reports which file is being read BEGIN { f= " " ; } { if ( f != FILENAME ) { print " reading " , FILENAME ; f=FILENAME ; } print ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example6a.awk
This can be used if several files need to be parsed by AWK .
Normally you use standard input to provide AWK with information .
You can also specify the filenames on the command line .
If the above script was called " testfilter " , and if you executed it with
testfilter file1 file2 file3
It would print out the filename before each change .
An alternate way to specify this on the command line is
testfilter file1 - file3 < file2
In this case , the second file will be called " - " , which is the conventional name for standard input .
I have used this when I want to put some information before and after a filter operation .
The prefix and postfix files special data before and after the real data .
By checking the filename , you can parse the information differently .
This is also useful to report syntax errors in particular files :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( NF == 6 ) { # do the right thing } else { if ( FILENAME == " - " ) { print " SYNTAX ERROR , Wrong number of fields , " , " in STDIN , line # : " , NR , " line : " , $ 0 ; } else { print " SYNTAX ERROR , Wrong number of fields , " , " Filename : " , FILENAME , " line # " , NR , " line : " , $ 0 ; } } }

As a programmer in the 1980's , I had used several programming lanuages , such as BASIC , FORTRAN , COBOL , Algol , PL/1 , DG/L , C , and Pascal .
AWK was the first language I found that has associative arrays .
( The perl language was released later , and had hash arrays , which are the same thing .
But I will use the term associative arrays because that is how the AWK manual describes them ) .
This term may be meaningless to you , but believe me , these arrays are invaluable , and simplify programming enormously .
Let me describe a problem , and show you how associative arrays can be used for reduce coding time , giving you more time to explore another stupid problem you do n't want to deal with in the first place .
Let 's suppose you have a directory overflowing with files , and you want to find out how many files are owned by each user , and perhaps how much disk space each user owns .
You really want someone to blame ; it 's hard to tell who owns what file .
A filter that processes the output of ls would work :
ls -l | filter
But this does n't tell you how much space each user is using .
It also does n't work for a large directory tree .
This requires find and xargs :
find .
- type f - print | xargs ls -l | filter
The third column of " ls " is the username .
The filter has to count how many times it sees each user .
The typical program would have an array of usernames and another array that counts how many times each username has been seen .
The index to both arrays are the same ; you use one array to find the index , and the second to keep track of the count .
I 'll show you one way to do it in AWK -- the wrong way :
#!/bin/awk -f # bad example of AWK programming # this counts how many files each user owns .
BEGIN { number_of_users=0 ; } { # must make sure you only examine lines with 8 or more fields if ( NF > 7 ) { user=0 ; # look for the user in our list of users for ( i=1 ; i<=number_of_users ; i++) { # is the user known ? if ( username [ i ] == $ 3 ) { # found it - remember where the user is user=i ; } } if ( user == 0 ) { # found a new user username [++number_of_users ]=$ 3 ; user=number_of_users ; } # increase number of counts count[user ] ++ ; } } END { for ( i=1 ; i<=number_of_users ; i++) { print count [ i ] , username [ i ] } }
Click here to get file : awk_example8.awk
I do n't want you to read this script .
I told you it 's the wrong way to do it .
If you were a C programmer , and did n't know AWK , you would probably use a technique like the one above .
Here is the same program , except this example that uses AWK 's associative arrays .
The important point is to notice the difference in size between these two versions :
#!/bin/awk -f { username [ $ 3 ] ++ ; } END { for ( i in username ) { print username [ i ] , i ; } }
Click here to get file : count_users0.awk
This is shorter , simpler , and much easier to understand -- Once you understand exactly what an associative array is .
The concept is simple .
Instead of using a number to find an entry in an array , use anything you want .
An associative array in an array whose index is a string .
All arrays in AWK are associative .
In this case , the index into the array is the third field of the " ls " command , which is the username .
If the user is " bin " , the main loop increments the count per user by effectively executing
username [ " bin " ]++;
UNIX guru 's may gleefully report that the 8 line AWK script can be replaced by :
awk '{print $ 3} ' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
True ,
However , this can't count the total disk space for each user .
We need to add some more intelligence to the AWK script , and need the right foundation to proceed .
There is also a slight bug in the AWK program .
If you wanted a " quick and dirty " solution , the above would be fine .
If you wanted to make it more robust , you have to handle unusual conditions .
If you gave this program an empty file for input , you would get the error :
awk : username is not an array
Also , if you piped the output of " ls - l " to it , the line that specified the total would increment a non-existing user .
There are two techniques used to eliminate this error .
The first one only counts valid input :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( NF > 7 ) { username [ $ 3 ] ++ ; } } END { for ( i in username ) { print username [ i ] , i ; } }
Click here to get file : count_users1.awk
This fixes the problem of counting the line with the total .
However , it still generates an error when an empty file is read as input .
To fix this problem , a common technique is to make sure the array always exists , and has a special marker value which specifies that the entry is invalid .
Then when reporting the results , ignore the invalid entry .
#!/bin/awk -f BEGIN { username [ " " ] =0 ; } { username [ $ 3 ] ++ ; } END { for ( i in username ) { if ( i != " " ) { print username [ i ] , i ; } } }
Click here to get file : count_users2.awk
This happens to fix the other problem .
Apply this technique and you will make your AWK programs more robust and easier for others to use .
Some people ask if AWK can handle multi-dimensional arrays .
It can .
However , you do n't use conventional two - dimensional arrays .
Instead you use associative arrays .
( Did I even mention how useful associative arrays are ? )
Remember , you can put anything in the index of an associative array .
It requires a different way to think about problems , but once you understand , you wo n't be able to live without it .
All you have to do is to create an index that combines two other indices .
Suppose you wanted to effectively execute
a [ 1,2 ] = y ;
This is invalid in AWK .
However , the following is perfectly fine :
a [ 1 " , " 2 ] = y ;
Remember : the AWK string concatenation operator is the space .
It combines the three strings into the single string " 1,2 " .
Then it uses it as an index into the array .
That 's all there is to it .
There is one minor problem with associative arrays , especially if you use the for command to output each element : you have no control over the order of output .
You can create an algorithm to generate the indices to an associative array , and control the order this way .
However , this is difficult to do .
Since UNIX provides an excellent sort utility , more programmers separate the information processing from the sorting .
I 'll show you what I mean .
I often find myself using certain techniques repeatedly in AWK .
This example will demonstrate these techniques , and illustrate the power and elegance of AWK .
The program is simple and common .
The disk is full .
Who 's gonna be blamed ?
I just hope you use this power wisely .
Remember , you may be the one who filled up the disk .
Having resolved my moral dilemma , by placing the burden squarely on your shoulders , I will describe the program in detail .
I will also discuss several tips you will find useful in large AWK programs .
First , initialize all arrays used in a for loop .
There will be four arrays for this purpose .
Initialization is easy :
u_count [ " " ]
=0 ;
g_count [ " " ]
=0 ;
ug_count [ " " ]
=0 ;
all_count [ " " ]
=0 ;
The second tip is to pick a convention for arrays .
Selecting the names of the arrays , and the indices for each array is very important .
In a complex program , it can become confusing to remember which array contains what .
I suggest you clearly identify the indices and contents of each array .
To demonstrate , I will use a " _count " to indicate the number of files , and " _sum " to indicate the sum of the file sizes .
In addition , the part before the " _ " specifies the index used for the array , which will be either " u " for user , " g " for group , " ug " for the user and group combination , and " all " for the total for all files .
In other programs , I have used names like
username_to_directory[username ] =directory ;
Follow a convention like this , and it will be hard for you to forget the purpose of each associative array .
Even when a quick hack comes back to haunt you three years later .
I 've been there .
The third suggestion is to make sure your input is in the correct form .
It 's generally a good idea to be pessimistic , but I will add a simple but sufficient test in this example .
if ( NF != 10 ) { # ignore } else { etc .
I placed the test and error clause up front , so the rest of the code wo n't be cluttered .
AWK does n't have user defined functions .
NAWK , GAWK and PERL do .
The next piece of advice for complex AWK scripts is to define a name for each field used .
In this case , we want the user , group and size in disk blocks .
We could use the file size in bytes , but the block size corresponds to the blocks on the disk , a more accurate measurement of space .
Disk blocks can be found by using " ls -s " .
This adds a column , so the username becomes the fourth column , etc .
Therefore the script will contain :
size=$1 ;
user=$ 4 ;
group=$5 ;
This will allow us to easily adapt to changes in input .
We could use " $ 1 " throughout the script , but if we changed the number of fields , which the " - s " option does , we 'd have to change each field reference .
You do n't want to go through an AWK script , and change all the " $ 1 " to " $ 2 " , and also change the " $ 2 " to " $ 3 " because those are really the " $ 1 " that you just changed to " $ 2 " .
Of course this is confusing .
That 's why it 's a good idea to assign names to the fields .
I 've been there too .
Next the AWK script will count how many times each combination of users and groups occur .
That is , I am going to construct a two - part index that contains the username and groupname .
This will let me count up the number of times each user / group combination occurs , and how much disk space is used .
Consider this : how would you calculate the total for just a user , or for just a group ?
You could rewrite the script .
Or you could take the user / group totals , and total them with a second script .
You could do it , but it 's not the AWK way to do it .
If you had to examine a bazillion files , and it takes a long time to run that script , it would be a waste to repeat this task .
It 's also inefficient to require two scripts when one can do everything .
The proper way to solve this problem is to extract as much information as possible in one pass through the files .
Therefore this script will find the number and size for each category :
Each user
Each group
Each user / group combination
All users and groups
This is why I have 4 arrays to count up the number of files .
I do n't really need 4 arrays , as I can use the format of the index to determine which array is which .
But this does maake the program easier to understand for now .
The next tip is subtle , but you will see how useful it is .
I mentioned the indices into the array can be anything .
If possible , select a format that allows you to merge information from several arrays .
I realize this makes no sense right now , but hang in there .
All will become clear soon .
I will do this by constructing a universal index of the form
< user > < group >
This index will be used for all arrays .
There is a space between the two values .
This covers the total for the user / group combination .
What about the other three arrays ?
I will use a " * " to indicate the total for all users or groups .
Therefore the index for all files would be " * *" while the index for all of the file owned by user daemon would be " daemon * " .
The heart of the script totals up the number and size of each file , putting the information into the right category .
I will use 8 arrays ; 4 for file sizes , and 4 for counts :
u_count[user " * " ]++;
g_count [ " * " group ] ++;
ug_count[user " " group ] ++;
all_count [ " * * " ]++;
u_size [user " * " ] + =size ;
g_size [ " * " group ] + =size ;
ug_size [user " " group ] + =size ;
all_size [ " * * " ] + =size ;
This particular universal index will make sorting easier , as you will see .
Also important is to sort the information in an order that is useful .
You can try to force a particular output order in AWK , but why work at this , when it 's a one line command for sort ?
The difficult part is finding the right way to sort the information .
This script will sort information using the size of the category as the first sort field .
The largest total will be the one for all files , so this will be one of the first lines output .
However , there may be several ties for the largest number , and care must be used .
The second field will be the number of files .
This will help break a tie .
Still , I want the totals and sub-totals to be listed before the individual user / group combinations .
The third and fourth fields will be generated by the index of the array .
This is the tricky part I warned you about .
The script will output one string , but the sort utility will not know this .
Instead , it will treat it as two fields .
This will unify the results , and information from all 4 arrays will look like one array .
The sort of the third and fourth fields will be dictionary order , and not numeric , unlike the first two fields .
The " * " was used so these sub-total fields will be listed before the individual user / group combination .
The arrays will be printed using the following format :
for ( i in u_count ) { if ( i != " " ) { print u_size [ i ] , u_count[i ] , i ; } } O
I only showed you one array , but all four are printed the same way .
That 's the essence of the script .
The results is sorted , and I converted the space into a tab for cosmetic reasons .
I changed my directory to /usr / ucb , used the script in that directory .
The following is the output :
size count user group 3173 81 * * 3173 81 root * 2973 75 * staff 2973 75 root staff 88 3 * daemon 88 3 root daemon
64 2 * kmem 64 2 root kmem 48 1 * tty 48 1 root tty
This says there are 81 files in this directory , which takes up 3173 disk blocks .
All of the files are owned by root .
2973 disk blocks belong to group staff .
There are 3 files with group daemon , which takes up 88 disk blocks .
As you can see , the first line of information is the total for all users and groups .
The second line is the sub -total for the user " root " .
The third line is the sub -total for the group " staff " .
Therefore the order of the sort is useful , with the sub - totals before the individual entries .
You could write a simple AWK or grep script to obtain information from just one user or one group , and the information will be easy to sort .
There is only one problem .
The /usr / ucb directory on my system only uses 1849 blocks ; at least that 's what du reports .
Where 's the discrepancy ?
The script does not understand hard links .
This may not be a problem on most disks , because many users do not use hard links .
Still , it does generate inaccurate results .
In this case , the program vi is also e , ex , edit , view , and 2 other names .
The program only exists once , but has 7 names .
You can tell because the link count ( field 2 ) reports 7 .
This causes the file to be counted 7 times , which causes an inaccurate total .
The fix is to only count multiple links once .
Examining the link count will determine if a file has multiple links .
However , how can you prevent counting a link twice ?
There is an easy solution : all of these files have the same inode number .
You can find this number with the - i option to ls .
To save memory , we only have to remember the inodes of files that have multiple links .
This means we have to add another column to the input , and have to renumber all of the field references .
It 's a good thing there are only three .
Adding a new field will be easy , because I followed my own advice .
The final script should be easy to follow .
I have used variations of this hundreds of times and find it demonstrates the power of AWK as well as provide insight to a powerful programming paradigm .
AWK solves these types of problems easier than most languages .
But you have to use AWK the right way .
Note - this version was written for a Solaris box .
You have to verify if ls is generating the right number of arguments .
The -g argument may need to be deleted , and the check for the number of files may have to be modified .
UpdatedI added a Linux version below - to be downloaded .
This is a fully working version of the program , that accurately counts disk space , appears below :
#!/bin/sh find .

Remember when I said I did n't need to use 4 different arrays ?
I can use just one .
This is more confusing , but more concise

Here is a version that works with modern Linux systems , but assumes you have well - behaved filenames ( without spaces , etc , ) : count_users_new.awk
So far , I described several simple scripts that provide useful information , in a somewhat ugly output format .
Columns might not line up properly , and it is often hard to find patterns or trends without this unity .
As you use AWK more , you will be desirous of crisp , clean formatting .
To achieve this , you must master the printf function .
The printf is very similar to the C function with the same name .
C programmers should have no problem using printf function .
Printf has one of these syntactical forms :
printf ( format ) ;
printf ( format , arguments ... ) ;
printf ( format ) > expression ;
printf ( format , arguments ... ) > expression ;
The parenthesis and semicolon are optional .
I only use the first format to be consistent with other nearby printf statements .
A print statement would do the same thing .
Printf reveals it 's real power when formatting commands are used .
The first argument to the printf function is the format .
This is a string , or variable whose value is a string .
This string , like all strings , can contain special escape sequences to print control characters .
The character " \ " is used to " escape " or mark special characters .
The list of these characters is in table below :
AWK Table 5
Escape Sequences Sequence Description \a ASCII bell ( NAWK / GAWK only ) \b Backspace \f Formfeed
Newline \r Carriage Return \t Horizontal tab \v Vertical tab ( NAWK only ) \ddd Character ( 1 to 3 octal digits ) ( NAWK only ) \xdd Character ( hexadecimal ) ( NAWK only ) \< Any other character >
That character
It 's difficult to explain the differences without being wordy .
Hopefully I 'll provide enough examples to demonstrate the differences .
With NAWK , you can print three tab characters using these three different representations :
printf ( " \t \11\x9
" ) ;
A tab character is decimal 9 , octal 11 , or hexadecimal 09 .
See the man page ascii( 7 ) for more information .
Similarly , you can print three double - quote characters ( decimal 34 , hexadecimal 22 , or octal 42 ) using
printf ( " \" \x22\42
" ) ;
You should notice a difference between the printf function and the print function .
Print terminates the line with the ORS character , and divides each field with the OFS separator .
Printf does nothing unless you specify the action .
Therefore you will frequently end each line with the newline character "
" , and you must specify the separating characters explicitly .
The power of the printf statement lies in the format specifiers , which always start with the character " % " .
The format specifiers are described in table 6 :
AWK Table 6
Format Specifiers Specifier Meaning %c ASCII Character %d Decimal integer %e Floating Point number
( engineering format ) %f Floating Point number
( fixed point format ) %g
The shorter of e or f ,
with trailing zeros removed %o Octal %s String %x Hexadecimal %% Literal %
Again , I 'll cover the differences quickly .
Table 3 illustrates the differences .
The first line states " printf ( %
c
" ,100.0 ) " " prints a " d " .
AWK Table 7
Example of format conversions Format Value Results %c 100.0 d %c " 100.0 " 1 ( NAWK ? ) %c 42 " %d 100.0 100 %e 100.0 1.000000e+02 %f 100.0 100.000000 %g 100.0 100 %o 100.0 144 %s 100.0 100.0 %s " 13 f " 13 f %d " 13 f " 0 ( AWK ) %d " 13 f " 13 ( NAWK ) %x 100.0 64
This table reveals some differences between AWK and NAWK .
When a string with numbers and letters are coverted into an integer , AWK will return a zero , while NAWK will convert as much as possible .
The second example , marked with " NAWK ? " will return " d " on some earlier versions of NAWK , while later versions will return " 1 " .
Using format specifiers , there is another way to print a double quote with NAWK .
This demonstrates Octal , Decimal and Hexadecimal conversion .
As you can see , it is n't symmetrical .
Decimal conversions are done differently .
printf ( " %s%s%s%c
" , " \ " " , " \x22 " , " \42 " , 34 ) ;
Between the " % " and the format character can be four optional pieces of information .
It helps to visualize these fields as :
%< sign >< zero >< width >.< precision > format
I 'll discuss each one separately .
If there is a number after the " % " , this specifies the minimum number of characters to print .
This is the width field .
Spaces are added so the number of printed characters equal this number .
Note that this is the minimum field size .
If the field becomes to large , it will grow , so information will not be lost .
Spaces are added to the left .
This format allows you to line up columns perfectly .
Consider the following format :
printf ( " % st%d
" , s , d ) ;
If the string " s " is longer than 8 characters , the columns wo n't line up .
Instead , use
printf ( " %20s%d
" , s , d ) ;
As long as the string is less than 20 characters , the number will start on the 21st column .
If the string is too long , then the two fields will run together , making it hard to read .
You may want to consider placing a single space between the fields , to make sure you will always have one space between the fields .
This is very important if you want to pipe the output to another program .
Adding informational headers makes the output more readable .
Be aware that changing the format of the data may make it difficult to get the columns aligned perfectly .
Consider the following script :
#!/usr/bin/awk -f BEGIN { printf ( " String Number
" ) ; } { printf ( " % 10s %6 d
" , $ 1 , $ 2 ) ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example9.awk
It would be awkward ( forgive the choice of words ) to add a new column and retain the same alignment .
More complicated formats would require a lot of trial and error .
You have to adjust the first printf to agree with the second printf statement .
I suggest
#!/usr/bin/awk -f BEGIN { printf ( " %10s %6sn " , " String " , " Number " ) ; } { printf ( " %10s %6d
" , $ 1 , $ 2 ) ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example10.awk
or even better
#!/usr/bin/awk -f BEGIN { format1 = " %10s %6sn " ; format2 = " %10s % 6dn " ; printf ( format1 , " String " , " Number " ) ; } { printf ( format2 , $ 1 , $ 2 ) ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example11.awk
The last example , by using string variables for formatting , allows you to keep all of the formats together .
This may not seem like it 's very useful , but when you have multiple formats and multiple columns , it 's very useful to have a set of templates like the above .
If you have to add an extra space to make things line up , it 's much easier to find and correct the problem with a set of format strings that are together , and the exact same width .
CHainging the first columne from 10 characters to 11 is easy .
The last example places spaces before each field to make sure the minimum field width is met .
What do you do if you want the spaces on the right ?
Add a negative sign before the width :
printf ( " %- 10s %-
6d
" , $ 1 , $ 2 ) ;
This will move the printing characters to the left , with spaces added to the right .
The precision field , which is the number between the decimal and the format character , is more complex .
Most people use it with the floating point format ( %f ) , but surprisingly , it can be used with any format character .
With the octal , decimal or hexadecimal format , it specifies the minimum number of characters .
Zeros are added to met this requirement .
With the %e and %f formats , it specifies the number of digits after the decimal point .
The %e " e+00 " is not included in the precision .
The %g format combines the characteristics of the %d and %f formats .
The precision specifies the number of digits displayed , before and after the decimal point .
The precision field has no effect on the %c field .
The %s format has an unusual , but useful effect : it specifies the maximum number of significant characters to print .
If the first number after the " % " , or after the " % - " , is a zero , then the system adds zeros when padding .
This includes all format types , including strings and the %c character format .
This means " %010d " and " %.10d " both adds leading zeros , giving a minimum of 10 digits .
The format " %10.10d " is therefore redundant .
Table 8 gives some examples :

There is one more topic needed to complete this lesson on printf .
Instead of sending output to standard output , you can send output to a named file .
The format is
printf ( " string
" ) > " / tmp/file " ;
You can append to an existing file , by using " > > :"
printf ( " string
" ) >> " / tmp/file " ;
Like the shell , the double angle brackets indicates output is appended to the file , instead of written to an empty file .
Appending to the file does not delete the old contents .
However , there is a subtle difference between AWK and the shell .
Consider the shell program :
#!/bin/sh while x=$ ( line ) do echo got $ x >>/ tmp /a echo got $ x >/tmp / b done
This will read standard input , and copy the standard input to files " / tmp / a " and " / tmp / b " .
File " / tmp / a " will grow larger , as information is always appended to the file .
File " / tmp / b " , however , will only contain one line .
This happens because each time the shell see the " > " or " > > " characters , it opens the file for writing , choosing the truncate / create or appending option at that time .
Now consider the equivalent AWK program :
#!/usr/bin/awk -f { print $ 0 >> " / tmp /a " print $ 0 > " /tmp /b " }
This behaves differently .
AWK chooses the create / append option the first time a file is opened for writing .
Afterwards , the use of " > " or " > > " is ignored .
Unlike the shell , AWK copies all of standard input to file " / tmp / b " .
Instead of a string , some versions of AWK allow you to specify an expression :
# [ note to self ] check this one - it might not work
printf ( " string
" ) > FILENAME " .out " ;
The following uses a string concatenation expression to illustrate this :
#!/usr/bin/awk -f END { for ( i=0 ; i< 30 ;i++ ) { printf ( " i=%d
" , i ) > " / tmp /a " i ; } }
Click here to get file : awk_example12.awk
This script never finishes , because AWK can have 10 additional files open , and NAWK can have 20 .
If you find this to be a problem , look into PERL .
I hope this gives you the skill to make your AWK output picture perfect .
You can exit from an awk script using the exit command .
#!/usr/bin/awk -f { # lots of code here , where you may find an error if ( numberOfErrors > 0 ) { exit } }
If you want to exit with an error condition , so you can use the shell to distinquish between normal and error exits , you can include an option integer value .
Let 's say to expect all lines of a file to be 60 characters , and you want to use an awk program as a filter to exit if the number of characters is not 60 .
Some sample code could be
#!/usr/bin/awk -f { if ( length ( $0 ) > 60 ) { exit 1 } else if ( length ( $ 0 ) < 60 ) { exit 2 } print }
There is a special case if you use a newer version of awk that can have multiple END commands .
If one of the END commands executes the " exit " command , the other END command does not execute .
#!/usr/bin/awk -f { # .... some code here } END { print " EXIT1 " ; exit} END { print " EXIT2 " }
Because of the " exit " command , only the first END command will execute .
The " next " command will also change the flow of the program .
It causes the current processing of the pattern space to stop .
The program reads in the next line , and starts executing the commands again with the new line .
In previous tutorials , I have shown how useful AWK is in manipulating information , and generating reports .
When you add a few functions , AWK becomes even more , mmm , functional .
There are three types of functions : numeric , string and whatever 's left .
Table9 lists all of the numeric functions :
AWK Table 9
Numeric Functions Name Function Variant cos cosine GAWK , AWK , NAWK exp Exponent GAWK , AWK , NAWK int Integer GAWK , AWK , NAWK log Logarithm GAWK , AWK , NAWK sin Sine GAWK , AWK , NAWK sqrt Square Root GAWK , AWK , NAWK atan2 Arctangent GAWK , NAWK rand Random GAWK , NAWK srand Seed Random GAWK , NAWK
Oh joy .
I bet millions , if not dozens , of my readers have been waiting for me to discuss trigonometry .
Personally , I do n't use trigonometry much at work , except when I go off on a tangent .
Sorry about that .
I do n't know what came over me .
I do n't usually resort to puns .
I 'll write a note to myself , and after I sine the note , I 'll have my boss cosine it .
Now stop that !
I hate arguing with myself .
I always lose .
Thinking about math I learned in the year 2 B.C. ( Before Computers ) seems to cause flashbacks of high school , pimples , and ( shudder ) times best left forgotten .
The stress of remembering those days must have made me forget the standards I normally set for myself .
Besides , no - one appreciates obtuse humor anyway , even if I find acute way to say it .
I better change the subject fast .
Combining humor and computers is a very serious matter .
Here is a NAWK script that calculates the trigonometric functions for all degrees between 0 and 360 .
It also shows why there is no tangent , secant or cosecant function .
( They are n't necessary ) .
If you read the script , you will learn of some subtle differences between AWK and NAWK .
All this in a thin veneer of demonstrating why we learned trigonometry in the first place .
What more can you ask for ?
Oh , in case you are wondering , I wrote this in the month of December .
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f # # A smattering of trigonometry ... # #
This AWK script plots the values from 0 to 360 # for the basic trigonometry functions # but first - a review : # # ( Note to the editor - the following diagram assumes # a fixed width font , like Courier .

Assume the following right triangle # # Angle Y # # | # | # | # a | c # | # | # +-------
Angle X # b # # since the triangle is a right angle , then # X+Y=90 # # Basic Trigonometric Functions .
If you know the length # of 2 sides , and the angles , you can find the length of the third side .

Also - if you know the length of the sides , you can calculate # the angles .
# #
The formulas are # # sine ( X ) = a / c # cosine ( X ) = b/c # tangent ( X ) = a /b # # reciprocal functions # cotangent ( X ) = b/a # secant ( X ) = c/b # cosecant ( X ) = c /a # # Example 1 ) # if an angle is 30 , and the hypotenuse ( c ) is 10 , then # a = sine ( 30 ) * 10 = 5 # b = cosine ( 30 ) * 10 = 8.66 # #
The second example will be more realistic : # # Suppose you are looking for a Christmas tree , and # while talking to your family , you smack into a tree # because your head was turned , and your kids were arguing over who # was going to put the first ornament on the tree .
# #
As you come to , you realize your feet are touching the trunk of the tree , # and your eyes are 6 feet from the bottom of your frostbitten toes .
#
While counting the stars that spin around your head , you also realize # the top of the tree is located at a 65 degree angle , relative to your eyes .
#
You suddenly realize the tree is 12.84 feet high !
After all , # tangent ( 65 degrees ) * 6 feet = 12.84 feet #
All right , it is n't realistic .
Not many people memorize the # tangent table , or can estimate angles that accurately .
#
I was telling the truth about the stars spinning around the head , however .
# BEGIN { # assign a value for pi. PI=3.14159 ; # select an " Ed Sullivan " number - really really big BIG=999999 ; # pick two formats #
Keep them close together , so when one column is made larger # the other column can be adjusted to be the same width fmt1 = " % 7s %8s %8s %8s %10s %10s %10s %10sn " ; # print out the title of each column fmt2= " %7d % 8.2 f % 8.2 f % 8.2 f % 10.2 f % 10.2 f % 10.2 f % 10.2fn " ; # old AWK wants a backslash at the end of the next line # to continue the print statement # new AWK allows you to break the line into two , after a comma printf ( fmt1 , " Degrees " , " Radians " , " Cosine " , " Sine " , " Tangent " , " Cotangent " , " Secant " , " Cosecant " ) ; for ( i=0 ;i< =360 ;i++ ) { # convert degrees to radians r = i * ( PI / 180 ) ; # in new AWK , the backslashes are optional # in OLD AWK , they are required printf ( fmt2 , i , r , # cosine of r cos(r ) , # sine of r sin(r ) , # # I ran into a problem when dividing by zero .
#
So I had to test for this case .
# # old AWK finds the next line too complicated # I do n't mind adding a backslash , but rewriting the # next three lines seems pointless for a simple lesson .
#
This script will only work with new AWK , now - sigh ... #
On the plus side , # I do n't need to add those back slashes anymore # # tangent of r ( cos (r ) == 0 ) ? BIG : sin(r ) / cos(r ) , # cotangent of r ( sin(r ) == 0 ) ? BIG : cos(r ) / sin(r ) , # secant of r ( cos (r ) == 0 ) ? BIG : 1 / cos(r ) , # cosecant of r ( sin(r ) == 0 ) ? BIG : 1 / sin( r ) ) ; } # put an exit here , so that standard input is n't needed .
exit ; }

awk
NAWK also has the arctangent function .
This is useful for some graphics work , as
arc tangent ( a /b ) = angle ( in radians )
Therefore if you have the X and Y locations , the arctangent of the ratio will tell you the angle .
The atan2 ( ) function returns a value from negative pi to positive pi .
The following script uses three other arithmetic functions : log , exp , and sqrt .
I wanted to show how these can be used together , so I divided the log of a number by two , which is another way to find a square root .
I then compared the value of the exponent of that new log to the built - in square root function .
I then calculated the difference between the two , and converted the difference into a positive number .
#!/bin/awk -f # demonstrate use of exp ( ) , log ( ) and sqrt in AWK # e.g. what is the difference between using logarithms and regular arithmetic # note - exp and log are natural log functions - not base 10 # BEGIN { # what is the about of error that will be reported ?
ERROR=0.000000000001 ; # loop a long while for ( i=1;i< =2147483647 ;i++ ) { # find log of i logi=log ( i ) ; # what is square root of i ?
# divide the log by 2 logsquareroot=logi / 2 ; # convert log of i back squareroot=exp ( logsquareroot ) ; # find the difference between the logarithmic calculation # and the built in calculation diff=sqrt( i ) - squareroot ; # make difference positive if ( diff < 0 ) { diff * = - 1 ; } if ( diff > ERROR ) { printf ( " %10d , squareroot : % 16.8 f , error : % 16.14f
" , i , squareroot , diff ) ; } } exit ; }

Yawn .
This example is n't too exciting , except to those who enjoy nitpicking .
Expect the program to reach 3 million before you see any errors .
I 'll give you a more exciting sample soon .
All version of AWK contain the int function .
This truncates a number , making it an integer .
It can be used to round numbers by adding 0.5 :
printf ( " rounding % 8.4f gives % 8dn " , x , int( x+0.5 ) ) ;
NAWK has functions that can generate random numbers .
The function rand returns a random number between 0 and 1 .
Here is an example that calculates a million random numbers between 0 and 100 , and counts how often each number was used :
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f # old AWK does n't have rand ( ) and srand ( ) # only new AWK has them # how random is the random function ?
BEGIN { # srand ( ) ; i=0 ; while ( i++< 1000000 ) { x=int ( rand ( ) * 100 + 0.5 ) ; y[x ] ++ ; } for ( i=0 ; i< =100 ;i++ ) { printf ( " %dt%d
" , y[ i ] , i ) ; } exit ; }

awk
If you execute this script several times , you will get the exact same results .
Experienced programmers know random number generators are n't really random , unless they use special hardware .
These numbers are pseudo - random , and calculated using some algorithm .
Since the algorithm is fixed , the numbers are repeatable unless the numbers are seeded with a unique value .
This is done using the srand function above , which is commented out .
Typically the random number generator is not given a special seed until the bugs have been worked out of the program .
There 's nothing more frustrating than a bug that occurs randomly .
The srand function may be given an argument .
If not , it uses the current time and day to generate a seed for the random number generator .
I promised a more useful script .
This may be what you are waiting for .
It reads two numbers , and generates a list of random numbers .
I call the script " lotto.awk " .
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f BEGIN { #
Assume we want 6 random numbers between 1 and 36 # We could get this information by reading standard input , # but this example will use a fixed set of parameters .
# # First , initialize the seed srand ( ) ; #
How many numbers are needed ?
NUM=6 ; # what is the minimum number MIN=1 ; # and the maximum ?
MAX=36 ; # How many numbers will we find ?
start with 0 Number=0 ; while ( Number < NUM ) { r=int ( ( ( rand ( ) *( 1+MAX - MIN ) ) +MIN ) ) ; # have I seen this number before ? if ( array[r ] == 0 ) { # no , I have not Number ++ ; array[ r ] ++ ; } } # now output all numbers , in order for ( i=MIN ;i<= MAX ;i++ ) { # is it marked in the array ? if ( array [ i ] ) { # yes printf ( " %d " , i ) ; } } printf ( "
" ) ; exit ; }

Besides numeric functions , there are two other types of function : strings and the whatchamacallits .
First , a list of the string functions :
AWK Table 10
String Functions Name Variant index( string , search ) AWK , NAWK , GAWK length ( string ) AWK , NAWK , GAWK split ( string , array , separator ) AWK , NAWK , GAWK substr ( string , position ) AWK , NAWK , GAWK substr ( string , position , max ) AWK , NAWK , GAWK sub( regex , replacement ) NAWK , GAWK sub( regex , replacement , string ) NAWK , GAWK gsub( regex , replacement ) NAWK , GAWK gsub( regex , replacement , string ) NAWK , GAWK match ( string , regex ) NAWK , GAWK tolower ( string ) GAWK toupper ( string ) GAWK asort ( string , [ d ] ) GAWK asorti( string , [ d ] ) GAWK gensub ( r , s , h [ , t ] ) GAWK strtonum ( string ) GAWK
Most people first use AWK to perform simple calculations .
Associative arrays and trigonometric functions are somewhat esoteric features , that new users embrace with the eagerness of a chain smoker in a fireworks factory .
I suspect most users add some simple string functions to their repertoire once they want to add a little more sophistication to their AWK scripts .
I hope this column gives you enough information to inspire your next effort .
There are four string functions in the original AWK : index ( ) , length ( ) , split ( ) , and substr ( ) .
These functions are quite versatile .
What can I say ?
The length ( ) function calculates the length of a string .
I often use it to make sure my input is correct .
If you wanted to ignore empty lines , check the length of the each line before processing it with
if ( length ( $0 ) > 1 ) {
. . .
}
You can easily use it to print all lines longer than a certain length , etc .
The following command centers all lines shorter than 80 characters :
#!/bin/awk -f { if ( length ( $ 0 ) < 80 ) { prefix = " " ; for ( i = 1;
i
Click here to get file : center.
awk
The Index Function
If you want to search for a special character , the index ( ) function will search for specific characters inside a string .
To find a comma , the code might look like this :
sentence = " This is a short , meaningless sentence . " ;
if ( index ( sentence , " , " ) > 0 ) {
printf ( " Found a comma in position \%d
" , index ( sentence , " , " ) ) ;
}
The function returns a positive value when the substring is found .
The number specified the location of the substring .
If the substring consists of 2 or more characters , all of these characters must be found , in the same order , for a non -zero return value .
Like the length ( ) function , this is useful for checking for proper input conditions .
The substr ( ) function can extract a portion of a string .
There are two ways to use it :
substr ( string , position )
substr ( string , position , length )
where string is the string to search , position is the number of characters to start looking , and length is the number of characters to extract ( default is 1 ) .
A simple example is to use it to search or extract a specific string at a fixed location .
If you wanted to print columns 40 through 50 , use
#!/bin/awk -f { print substr ( $ 0,40,10 ) }
If you wanted to search for the string " HELLO " at position 20 .
This can easily be done using
#!/bin/awk -f substr ( $ 0,20,5 ) == " HELLO " {print}
One common use is to split a string into two parts based on a special character .
If you wanted to process some mail addresses , where you search for a " @ " character , and split the text into username and hostname , the following code fragment might do the job :
#!/bin/awk -f { # field 1 is the e-mail address - perhaps if ( ( x=index ( $ 1 , " @ " ) ) >
0 ) { username = substr ( $ 1,1 , x - 1 ) ; hostname = substr ( $ 1, x+1 , length ( $ 1 ) ) ; # the above is the same as # hostname = substr ( $ 1,x+1 ) ; printf ( " username = %s , hostname = %s
" , username , hostname ) ; } }
Click here to get file : email.awk
The substr ( ) function takes two or three arguments .
The first is the string , the second is the position .
The optional third argument is the length of the string to extract .
If the third argument is missing , the rest of the string is used .
The substr function can be used in many non-obvious ways .
As an example , it can be used to convert upper case letters to lower case .
#!/usr/bin/awk -f # convert upper case letters to lower case BEGIN { LC=" abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz " ; UC=" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ " ; } { out= " " ; # look at each character for ( i=1 ; i< =length ( $ 0 ) ;i++ ) { # get the character to be checked char=substr ( $ 0 , i,1 ) ; # is it an upper case letter ?
j=index ( UC , char ) ; if ( j > 0 ) { # found it out = out substr ( LC , j,1 ) ; } else { out = out char ; } } printf ( " %s
" , out ) ; }
Click here to get file : upper_to_lower.awk
Another way to split up a string is to use the split ( ) function .
It takes three arguments : the string , an array , and the separator .
The function returns the number of pieces found .
Here is an example :
#!/usr/bin/awk -f BEGIN { # this script breaks up the sentence into words , using # a space as the character separating the words string =
" This is a string , is it not ? " ; search= " " ; n=split( string , array , search ) ; for ( i=1 ; i< =n ; i ++ ) { printf ( " Word [ % d ] =%s
" , i, array [ i ] ) ; } exit ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example14.sh
The third argument is typically a single character .
If a longer string is used , only the first letter is used as a separator .
GAWK has the toupper ( ) and tolower ( ) functions , for convenient conversions of case .
These functions take strings , so you can reduce the above script to a single line :
#!/usr/local/bin/gawk -f { print tolower ( $0 ) ; }
Click here to get file : upper_to_lower.gawk
NAWK ( and GAWK ) have additional string functions , which add a primitive SED - like functionality : sub ( ) , match ( ) , and gsub ( ) .
Sub ( ) performs a string substitution , like sed .
To replace " old " with " new " in a string , use
sub ( / old / , " new " , string )
If the third argument is missing , $ 0 is assumed to be string searched .
The function returns 1 if a substitution occurs , and 0 if not .
If no slashes are given in the first argument , the first argument is assumed to be a variable containing a regular expression .
The sub ( ) only changes the first occurrence .
The gsub ( ) function is similar to the g option in sed : all occurrence are converted , and not just the first .
That is , if the patter occurs more than once per line ( or string ) , the substitution will be performed once for each found pattern .
The following script :
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f BEGIN { string = " Another sample of an example sentence " ; pattern= " [ Aa]n " ; if ( gsub ( pattern , " AN " , string ) ) { printf ( " Substitution occurred : %s
" , string ) ; } exit ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example15.awk
print the following when executed :
Substitution occurred : ANother sample of AN example sentence
As you can see , the pattern can be a regular expression .
As the above demonstrates , the sub ( ) and gsub ( ) returns a positive value if a match is found .
However , it has a side - effect of changing the string tested .
If you do n't wish this , you can copy the string to another variable , and test the spare variable .
NAWK also provides the match ( ) function .
If match ( ) finds the regular expression , it sets two special variables that indicate where the regular expression begins and ends .
Here is an example that does this :
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f # demonstrate the match function BEGIN { regex = " [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ] + " ; } { if ( match ( $ 0 , regex ) ) { # RSTART is where the pattern starts # RLENGTH is the length of the pattern before = substr ( $ 0,1, RSTART - 1 ) ; pattern = substr( $ 0 , RSTART , RLENGTH ) ; after = substr( $0 , RSTART+RLENGTH ) ; printf ( "
%
s<%s>%s
" , before , pattern , after ) ; } }

Lastly , there are the whatchamacallit functions .
I could use the word " miscellaneous " , but it 's too hard to spell .
Darn it , I had to look it up anyway .
AWK Table 11
Miscellaneous Functions Name Variant getline AWK , NAWK , GAWK getline < file NAWK , GAWK getline variable NAWK , GAWK getline variable < file NAWK , GAWK " command " | getline NAWK , GAWK " command " | getline variable NAWK , GAWK system ( command ) NAWK , GAWK close ( command ) NAWK , GAWK systime ( ) GAWK strftime ( string ) GAWK strftime ( string , timestamp ) GAWK
NAWK has a function system ( ) that can execute any program .
It returns the exit status of the program .
if ( system ( " / bin /rm junk " ) != 0 )
print " command did n't work " ;
The command can be a string , so you can dynamically create commands based on input .
Note that the output is n't sent to the NAWK program .
You could send it to a file , and open that file for reading .
There is another solution , however .
AWK has a command that allows you to force a new line .
It does n't take any arguments .
It returns a 1 , if successful , a 0 if end - of - file is reached , and a - 1 if an error occurs .
As a side effect , the line containing the input changes .
This next script filters the input , and if a backslash occurs at the end of the line , it reads the next line in , eliminating the backslash as well as the need for it .
#!/usr/bin/awk -f # look for a as the last character .
# if found , read the next line and append { line = $ 0 ; while ( substr ( line , length ( line ) , 1 ) == " \\ " ) { # chop off the last character line = substr ( line , 1, length ( line ) - 1 ) ; i=getline ; if ( i > 0 ) { line = line $ 0 ; } else { printf ( " missing continuation on line %d
" , NR ) ; } } print line ; }
Click here to get file : awk_example17.awk
Instead of reading into the standard variables , you can specify the variable to set :
getline a_line
print a_line ;
NAWK and GAWK allow the getline function to be given an optional filename or string containing a filename .
An example of a primitive file preprocessor , that looks for lines of the format
#include filename
and substitutes that line for the contents of the file :
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f { # a primitive include preprocessor if ( ( $ 1 == " #include " ) && ( NF == 2 ) ) { # found the name of the file filename = $ 2 ; while ( i = getline < filename ) { print ; } } else { print ; } }
Click here to get file : include.
nawk
NAWK 's getline can also read from a pipe .
If you have a program that generates single line , you can use
" command " | getline ;
print $ 0 ;
or
" command " | getline abc ;
print abc ;
If you have more than one line , you can loop through the results :
while ( " command " | getline ) { cmd [ i++] = $ 0 ; } for ( i in cmd ) { printf ( " %s=%s
" , i , cmd [ i ] ) ; }
Only one pipe can be open at a time .
If you want to open another pipe , you must execute
close ( " command " ) ;
This is necessary even if the end of file is reached .
The systime ( ) function returns the current time of day as the number of seconds since Midnight , January 1 , 1970 .
It is useful for measuring how long portions of your GAWK code takes to execute .
#!/usr/local/bin/gawk -f # how long does it take to do a few loops ?
BEGIN { LOOPS=100 ; # do the test twice start=systime ( ) ; for ( i=0 ; i< LOOPS ;i++ ) { } end = systime ( ) ; # calculate how long it takes to do a dummy test do_nothing = end - start ; # now do the test again with the * IMPORTANT * code inside start=systime ( ) ; for ( i=0 ; i< LOOPS ;i++ ) { #
How long does this take ?
while ( " date " | getline ) { date = $ 0 ; } close ( " date " ) ; } end = systime ( ) ; newtime = ( end - start ) - do_nothing ; if ( newtime <= 0 ) { printf ( " %d loops were not enough to test , increase it
" , LOOPS ) ; exit ; } else { printf ( " %d loops took % 6.4 f seconds to execute
" , LOOPS , newtime ) ; printf ( " That 's % 10.8 f seconds per loop
" , ( newtime ) / LOOPS ) ; # since the clock has an accuracy of +/- one second , what is the error printf ( " accuracy of this measurement = % 6.2 f % %
" , ( 1 / ( newtime ) ) * 100 ) ; } exit ; }

GAWK has a special function for creating strings based on the current time .
It 's based on the strftime ( 3c ) function .
If you are familiar with the " + " formats of the date ( 1 ) command , you have a good head - start on understanding what the strftime command is used for .
The systime ( ) function returns the current date in seconds .
Not very useful if you want to create a string based on the time .
While you could convert the seconds into days , months , years , etc. , it would be easier to execute " date " and pipe the results into a string .
( See the previous script for an example ) .
GAWK has another solution that eliminates the need for an external program .
The function takes one or two arguments .
The first argument is a string that specified the format .
This string contains regular characters and special characters .
Special characters start with a backslash or the percent character .
The backslash characters with the backslash prefix are the same I covered earlier .
In addition , the strftime ( ) function defines dozens of combinations , all of which start with " % " .
The following table lists these special sequences :
AWK Table 12
GAWK 's strftime formats %a
The locale 's abbreviated weekday name %A
The locale 's full weekday name % b
The locale 's abbreviated month name %B
The locale 's full month name %c
The locale 's " appropriate " date and time representation %d
The day of the month as a decimal number ( 01 -- 31 ) %H
The hour ( 24 - hour clock ) as a decimal number ( 00 -- 23 ) % I The hour ( 12 - hour clock ) as a decimal number ( 01 -- 12 ) %j
The day of the year as a decimal number ( 001 -- 366 ) %m
The month as a decimal number ( 01-- 12 ) %M
The minute as a decimal number ( 00 -- 59 ) %p
The locale 's equivalent of the AM / PM %S
The second as a decimal number ( 00 - - 61 ) .
%U
The week number of the year ( Sunday is first day of week ) %w
The weekday as a decimal number ( 0 - - 6 ) .
Sunday is day 0 %W
The week number of the year ( Monday is first day of week ) %x
The locale 's " appropriate " date representation %X
The locale 's " appropriate " time representation %y
The year without century as a decimal number ( 00-- 99 ) %Y
The year with century as a decimal number %Z
The time zone name or abbreviation %% A literal % .
Depending on your operating system , and installation , you may also have the following formats :
AWK Table 13
Optional GAWK strftime formats %D Equivalent to specifying %m/%d/%y %e
The day of the month , padded with a blank if it is only one digit %h Equivalent to %b , above %n A newline character ( ASCII LF ) %r Equivalent to specifying %I : %M : %S %p %R Equivalent to specifying %H : %M %T Equivalent to specifying %H:%M : %S %t A TAB character %k
The hour as a decimal number ( 0 - 23 ) %l
The hour ( 12 - hour clock ) as a decimal number ( 1 - 12 ) %C
The century , as a number between 00 and 99 %u is replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [ Monday == 1 ] %V is replaced by the week number of the year ( using ISO 8601 ) %v
The date in VMS format ( e.g. 20 - JUN - 1991 )
One useful format is
strftime ( " %y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S " )
This constructs a string that contains the year , month , day , hour , minute and second in a format that allows convenient sorting .
If you ran this at noon on Christmas , 1994 , it would generate the string
94_12_25_12_00_00
Here is the GAWK equivalent of the date command :
#! /usr/local/bin/gawk -f # BEGIN { format = " %a %b %e %H : %M : %S %Z %Y " ; print strftime ( format ) ; }

gawk
You will note that there is no exit command in the begin statement .
If I was using AWK , an exit statement is necessary .
Otherwise , it would never terminate .
If there is no action defined for each line read , NAWK and GAWK do not need an exit statement .
If you provide a second argument to the strftime ( ) function , it uses that argument as the timestamp , instead of the current system 's time .
This is useful for calculating future times .
The following script calculates the time one week after the current time :
#!/usr/local/bin/gawk -f BEGIN { # get current time ts = systime ( ) ; # the time is in seconds , so one_day = 24 * 60 * 60 ; next_week = ts + ( 7 * one_day ) ; format = " %a %b %e %H : %M : %S %Z %Y " ; print strftime ( format , next_week ) ; exit ; }

Finally , NAWK and GAWK support user defined functions .
This function demonstrates a way to print error messages , including the filename and line number , if appropriate :
#!/usr/bin/nawk -f { if ( NF != 4 ) { error ( " Expected 4 fields " ) ; } else { print ; } } function error ( message ) { if ( FILENAME != " - " ) { printf ( " %s : " , FILENAME ) > " / dev/tty " ; } printf ( " line # %d , %s , line : %s
" , NR , message , $ 0 ) >> " / dev/tty " ; }

In my first tutorial on AWK , I described the AWK statement as having the form
pattern {commands}
I have only used two patterns so far : the special words BEGIN and END .
Other patterns are possible , yet I have n't used any .
There are several reasons for this .
The first is that these patterns are n't necessary .
You can duplicate them using an if statement .
Therefore this is an " advanced feature " .
Patterns , or perhaps the better word is conditions , tend to make an AWK program obscure to a beginner .
You can think of them as an advanced topic , one that should be attempted after becoming familiar with the basics .
A pattern or condition is simply an abbreviated test .
If the condition is true , the action is performed .
All relational tests can be used as a pattern .
The " head - 10 " command , which prints the first 10 lines and stops , can be duplicated with
{ if ( NR <= 10 ) {print}}
Changing the if statement to a condition shortens the code :
NR <= 10 {print}
Besides relational tests , you can also use containment tests , i. e. do strings contain regular expressions ?
Printing all lines that contain the word " special " can be written as
{ if ( $ 0 ~ / special / ) {print}}
or more briefly
$ 0 ~ / special / {print}
This type of test is so common , the authors of AWK allow a third , shorter format :
/ special / {print}
These tests can be combined with the AND ( && ) and OR ( || ) commands , as well as the NOT (! ) operator .
Parenthesis can also be added if you are in doubt , or to make your intention clear .
The following condition prints the line if it contains the word " whole " or columns 1 and 2 contain " part1 " and " part2 " respectively .
( $0 ~ / whole / ) || ( ( $ 1 ~ / part1 / ) && ( $ 2 ~ / part2 / ) ) {print}
This can be shortened to
/ whole / || $ 1 ~ / part1 / && $ 2 ~ / part2/ {print}
There is one case where adding parenthesis hurts .
The condition
/ whole / {print}
works , but
( / whole / ) {print}
does not .
If parenthesis are used , it is necessary to explicitly specify the test :
( $0 ~ / whole ) {print}
A murky situation arises when a simple variable is used as a condition .
Since the variable NF specifies the number of fields on a line , one might think the statement
NF {print}
would print all lines with one of more fields .
This is an illegal command for AWK , because AWK does not accept variables as conditions .
To prevent a syntax error , I had to change it to
NF != 0 {print}
I expected NAWK to work , but on some SunOS systems it refused to print any lines at all .
On newer Solaris systems it did behave properly .
Again , changing it to the longer form worked for all variations .
GAWK , like the newer version of NAWK , worked properly .
After this experience , I decided to leave other , exotic variations alone .
Clearly this is unexplored territory .
I could write a script that prints the first 20 lines , except if there were exactly three fields , unless it was line 10 , by using
NF == 3 ? NR == 10 : NR < 20 { print }
But I wo n't .
Obscurity , like puns , is often unappreciated .
There is one more common and useful pattern I have not yet described .
It is the comma separated pattern .
A common example has the form :
/ start/,/stop / {print}
This form defines , in one line , the condition to turn the action on , and the condition to turn the action off .
That is , when a line containing " start " is seen , it is printed .
Every line afterwards is also printed , until a line containing " stop " is seen .
This one is also printed , but the line after , and all following lines , are not printed .
This triggering on and off can be repeated many times .
The equivalent code , using the if command , is :
{ if ( $ 0 ~ / start / ) { triggered =1 ; } if ( triggered ) { print ; if ( $ 0 ~ / stop / ) { triggered =0 ; } } }
The conditions do not have to be regular expressions .
Relational tests can also be used .
The following prints all lines between 20 and 40 :
( NR==20 ) , ( NR==40 ) {print}
You can mix relational and containment tests .
The following prints every line until a " stop " is seen :
( NR==1 ) , / stop / {print}
There is one more area of confusion about patterns : each one is independent of the others .
You can have several patterns in a script ; none influence the other patterns .
If the following script is executed :
NR==10 {print}
( NR==5 ) , ( NR==15 ) {print}
/ xxx / {print}
( NR==1 ) ,/NeVerMatchThiS/ {print}
and the input file 's line 10 contains " xxx " , it would be printed 4 times , as each condition is true .
You can think of each condition as cumulative .
The exception is the special BEGIN and END conditions .
In the original AWK , you can only have one of each .
In NAWK and GAWK , you can have several BEGIN or END actions .
See Flow Control with next and exit for a special condition with the " exit " command and multiple END statements .
Many readers have questions my style of AWK programming .
In particular , they ask me why I include code like this :
# Print column 3
print $ 3 ;
when I could use
print $ 3 # print column 3
After all , they reason , the semicolon is unnecessary , and comments do not have to start on the first column .
This is true .
Still I avoid this .
Years ago , when I started writing AWK programs , I would find myself confused when the nesting of conditions were too deep .
If I moved a complex if statement inside another if statement , my alignment of braces became incorrect .
It can be very difficult to repair this condition , especially with large scripts .
Nowadays I use emacs or eclipse to do the formatting for me , but in the 1980's , I did n't have this option .
My solution at the time was to use the program cb , which is a " C beautifier " .
By including optional semicolons , and starting comments on the first column of the line , I could send my AWK script through this filter , and properly align all of the code .
I 've described the 7 special variables in AWK , and briefly mentioned some others NAWK and GAWK .
The complete list follows :
AWK Table 14
Special Variables Variable Purpose AWK NAWK GAWK FS Field separator Yes Yes Yes NF Number of Fields Yes Yes Yes RS Record separator Yes Yes Yes NR Number of input records Yes Yes Yes FILENAME Current filename Yes Yes Yes OFS Output field separator Yes Yes Yes ORS Output record separator Yes Yes Yes ARGC # of arguments Yes Yes ARGV Array of arguments Yes Yes ARGIND Index of ARGV of current file Yes FNR Input record number Yes Yes OFMT Ouput format ( default " %.6g " ) Yes Yes RSTART Index of first character after match ( ) Yes Yes RLENGTH Length of string after match ( )
Yes Yes SUBSEP
Default separator with multiple subscripts in array ( default " \034 " ) Yes Yes ENVIRON Array of environment variables Yes IGNORECASE Ignore case of regular expression Yes CONVFMT conversion format ( default : " %.6g " ) Yes ERRNO Current error after getline failure Yes FIELDWIDTHS list of field widths ( instead of using FS ) Yes BINMODE Binary Mode ( Windows ) Yes LINT Turns -- lint mode on / off Yes PROCINFO Array of informaiton about current AWK program Yes RT Record terminator Yes TEXTDOMAIN Text domain ( i.e. localization ) of current AWK program Yes
Since I 've already discussed many of these , I 'll only cover those that I missed earlier .
The variable ARGC specifies the number of arguments on the command line .
It always has the value of one or more , as it counts its own program name as the first argument .
If you specify an AWK filename using the " - f " option , it is not counted as an argument .
If you include a variable on the command line using the form below , NAWK does not count as an argument .
nawk -f file.awk x=17
GAWK does , but that is because GAWK requires the " - v " option before each assignment :
gawk -f file.awk -v x=17
GAWK variables initialized this way do not affect the ARGC variable .
The ARGV array is the list of arguments ( or files ) passed as command line arguments .
The ARGIND specifies the current index into the ARGV array , and therefore ARGV [ ARGIND ] is always the current filename .
Therefore
FILENAME == ARGV [ ARGIND ]
is always true .
It can be modified , allowing you to skip over files , etc .
The FNR variable contains the number of lines read , but is reset for each file read .
The NR variable accumulates for all files read .
Therefore if you execute an awk script with two files as arguments , with each containing 10 lines :
nawk ' { print NR} ' file file2
nawk ' { print FNR} ' file file2
the first program would print the numbers 1 through 20 , while the second would print the numbers 1 through 10 twice , once for each file .
The OFMT variable Specifies the default format for numbers .
The default value is " %.6g " .
I 've already mentioned the RSTART and RLENGTH variables .
After the match ( ) function is called , these variables contain the location in the string of the search pattern .
RLENGTH contains the length of this match .
Earlier I described how you can construct multi-dimensional arrays in AWK .
These are constructed by concatenating two indexes together with a special charac
( Tel Aviv ) - Governments responsible for serious human rights violations have over the past year intensified attacks against human rights defenders and organizations that document abuse , Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2010 .
The 612 - page report , the organization 's 20th annual review of human rights practices around the globe , summarizes major human rights trends in more than 90 nations and territories worldwide , reflecting the extensive investigative work carried out in 2009 by Human Rights Watch staff .
The volume 's introductory essay by Executive Director Kenneth Roth argues that the ability of the human rights movement to exert pressure on behalf of victims has grown enormously in recent years , and that this development has spawned a reaction from abusive governments that grew particularly intense in 2009 .
" While attacks on rights defenders might be seen as a perverse tribute to the human rights movement , that does n't mitigate the danger , " Roth said .
" Under various pretexts , abusive governments are attacking the very foundations of the human rights movement . "
Attacks on human rights monitors are not limited to authoritarian governments like Burma and China , Human Rights Watch said .
In countries with elected governments that are facing armed insurgencies , there has been a sharp rise in armed attacks on human rights monitors , such as in Thailand .
Although the armed conflict in Chechnya has wound down , there was a devastating series of killings and threats against lawyers and activists fighting impunity in the North Caucasus .
Human Rights
Watch noted that some governments are so abusive against individuals and organizations that no domestic human rights movement can function , citing Eritrea , North Korea , and Turkmenistan .
The introduction to the report said that in addition to Russia and Sri Lanka , other countries where human rights monitors were murdered in order to silence them included Kenya , Burundi , and Afghanistan .
Human Rights
Watch cited Sudan and China as countries that routinely shut down human rights groups and Iran and Uzbekistan as countries that openly harass and arbitrarily detain human rights workers and other critics .
Colombia , Venezuela , and Nicaragua threaten and harass rights defenders .
Human rights advocates face violence in countries such as The Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka .
Some governments , such as Ethiopia and Egypt , use extremely restrictive regulations to stifle the work of nongovernmental organizations .
Local and international human rights groups working in Israel have experienced a more hostile climate than ever before after documenting abuses committed by Israel , as well as Hamas , during the December 2008 - January 2009 fighting in Gaza and Israel and in connection with Israel 's ongoing blockade of Gaza .
Human Rights
Watch said that the only way abusive governments will end their assault on rights defenders is if other governments that support human rights make rights a central part of their bilateral relations .
" Governments that support human rights need to speak out , to make respecting human rights the bedrock of their diplomacy - and of their own practices , " Roth said .
" They need to demand real change from abusive governments . "
Roth said that the Obama administration , in particular , faced the challenge of restoring America 's credibility on human rights .
So far , he said , the results are mixed , with a marked improvement in presidential rhetoric , but an incomplete translation of that rhetoric into policy and practice .
The US government has ended the CIA 's coercive interrogation program , but should still uphold domestic and international law against torture by investigating and prosecuting those who have ordered , facilitated , or carried out torture and other ill - treatment , he said .
The Obama administration has insisted on maintaining military commissions that provide substandard justice and on continuing to hold suspects indefinitely without charge or trial , both of which risk perpetuating the spirit of Guantanamo , Roth said .
Human Rights
Watch also said in the introduction to its report that an emerging system of international justice including the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has been the focus of attack .
The assault unfolded after the court issued an arrest warrant in March for President Omar al - Bashir of Sudan for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Sudanese forces and allied militia against the civilian population of Darfur .
Instead of applauding the ICC for taking action to redress the mass murder and forced displacement of so many Africans in Darfur , when the African Union resolved in July not to cooperate in executing the arrest warrant , a number of African leaders went along with the decision to protect Bashir rather than Darfurian victims of abuses .
Human Rights
Watch research over the past year covered a wide range of abuses in virtually every region of the world .
An additional essay in the report , " Civilian Protection and Middle East Armed Groups , " notes that there have been years of violence in the Middle East during which governments and armed groups have had little regard for civilian lives .
Against this backdrop , the essay says , there is a need to find authoritative voices who can advance civilian protection in terms of the shared prohibitions against targeting civilians in both the laws of war and Islamic ethics .
The essay draws upon a Human Rights Watch advocacy project that over several years has sought to identify and encourage important voices in the region to speak out against attacks against civilians , whether in Iraq , Israel , or elsewhere .
In the Middle East and North Africa , Human Rights Watch monitored and reported on developments in 17 countries and territories , from Morocco to Iran .
In Iran , Human Rights Watch covered the continuing governmental crackdown on peaceful activists following the disputed presidential election of June 2009 .
Human Rights
Watch documented the arrests of thousands of ordinary and high - profile people , providing detailed accounts of state violence against peaceful protesters , arbitrary detention of human rights defenders , and abuse and torture in Iran 's illegal detention centers .
In Gaza and Israel , Human Rights Watch documented laws - of - war violations by both Israel and Palestinian armed groups .
Israel 's military assault of a year ago included the unlawful use of white phosphorus munitions , the killing of civilians with missiles launched by drones , and the shooting of civilians waving white flags .
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched rockets at Israeli population centers , and Hamas killed alleged collaborators and abused political opponents during the war .
The UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict recommended that both Israel and Hamas investigate alleged war crimes by their forces ; the UN General Assembly called on both sides to report on their investigations by early February .
Hamas has not held anyone accountable for abuses , and Israel has prosecuted only one soldier , for stealing a credit card .
Human Rights
Watch called on Israel to lift the blockade it imposes ( with Egypt 's help ) on Gaza , a form of collective punishment of Gaza 's civilians .
In Libya , Human Rights Watch released a report critical of the government at a news conference in Tripoli .
The event was the first open news conference in Libya .
The report said that while limited improvements are under way , including expanded space for freedom of expression , repressive laws continue to stifle free expression and association , and abuses by the Internal Security Agency remain the norm .
Human Rights
Watch reported in depth on the situation in Yemen , including the armed conflict between government forces and Huthi rebels in the north , the increasingly violent unrest in the south between local secessionist protesters and central government security forces , and the gruesome journey and harsh welcome of Ethiopian refugees via Somalia to Yemen .
In Egypt , where the government holds an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 persons without charge , Human Rights Watch monitored the suppression of political dissent by arbitrary detention and unfair trials .
Authorities harassed rights activists and detained journalists , bloggers , and members of the Muslim Brotherhood , the banned Islamist organization that is the country 's largest opposition group .
In Saudi Arabia , Human Rights Watch reported on indefinite and arbitrary detention and unfair trials on charges ranging from " sorcery " to terrorism .
The report documents the systematic suppression and failure to protect the rights of 14 million Saudi women and girls , eight million foreign workers , and two million Shia .
In China , in addition to its continuing work documenting the targeting and jailing of human rights defenders , Human Rights Watch issued a report that described the secret operation of " black jails , " where authorities detain people they abduct off the streets of Beijing and other major cities .
Most of those held are petitioners seeking redress for abuses ranging from government corruption to police torture .
In Zimbabwe , researchers continued to monitor and report on rights violations by President Robert Mugabe 's former ruling party against its partners and their supporters in a power - sharing government .
Human Rights
Watch also documented brutal tactics by the army and police in the Marange diamond fields to control access to the fields and take over unlicensed diamond mining and trading .
In Democratic Republic of Congo , Human Rights
Watch documented the deliberate killing of more than 1,400 civilians , a pattern of vicious rapes , and other abuses by government and rebel forces during two successive Congolese army operations against a Rwandan Hutu militia in the east of the country .
Human Rights
Watch also reported serious flaws in the UN peacekeeping operation in Congo that limited its ability to effectively protect civilians .
In Guinea , Human Rights Watch produced a detailed report on killings , sexual assaults , and other abuses at an opposition rally in the capital , committed largely by members of the elite Presidential Guard .
Human Rights
Watch said that despite the growth in the human rights movement , human rights defenders remain vulnerable and greatly in need of support by rights - respecting governments .
" Governments that consider themselves human rights supporters often keep silent in the face of these abuses by allies , citing diplomatic or economic priorities , " Roth said .
" But that silence makes them complicit in the abuse .
The only proper response to serious human rights violations is to turn up the heat on the abusers . "

The internet 's great advantages – speed , access and shared communication – can also have drawbacks , as Richard Dawkins found out last week .
Here , author James Harkin reflects on the nature of discourse when everyone has their say
Even hell hath no fury like an electronic crowd , as Richard Dawkins discovered to his cost last week .
Dawkins 's mistake was to update his website with a letter politely giving notice of a few planned changes to its " community " bulletin - board , where 85,000 enthusiastic atheists come to air their views and discuss them with like minds .
" Dear forum members , " his cheery email began , and before long the feedback was coming in thick and fast .
Dawkins returned to his computer to find himself being described as " a suppurating rat 's rectum " .
Another anonymous community member expressed a " sudden urge to ram a fistful of nails down your throat " , while a third described the author of The God Delusion as having " a slack - jawed turd - in - the - mouth mug if ever I saw one " .
The reaction must have confirmed Dawkins 's worst suspicions .
He was already concerned at the amount of gossip , abuse and irrelevant discussion turning up on his site , which was why he was keen to subject it to greater editorial control .
Dawkins is no wallflower , but even for someone familiar with the fury of American creationists , the bile he unleashed seems to have taken him aback .
" Surely there has to be something wrong with people who can resort to such over - the - top language , overreacting so spectacularly to something so trivial , " he wrote .
" Was there ever such conservatism , such reactionary aversion to change , such vicious language in defence of a comfortable status quo ?
What is the underlying agenda of these people ? "
There must , he felt , be " something rotten in the internet culture that can vent it " .
His language is extravagant , but he makes an interesting point .
When anyone can have their say , what use is the stuff that comes out the other end ?
What can be done with it , and who is going to be in charge of quality control when things go wrong ?
This weekend , three Google executives will be mulling over at least some of those questions .
Last Wednesday they were convicted and awarded six - month suspended sentences for allowing a clip of an autistic boy being viciously bullied to play on Google Video .
Google , the judges claimed , violated the boy 's privacy , even though the company removed the video as soon as it was brought to its attention .
The judgment is likely to be overturned on appeal ; were it to stand , it would make much of the worldwide web unworkable .
Once again , however , it raises the question of what to do with the mass of material that is piling up on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter , Facebook and Google Video .
For the internet gurus who travel around like fire - breathing evangelists , preaching hate for the old world and an all - consuming love for the new , the answer is clear .
The vast ocean of electronic information out there on the net , according to them , represents a historic triumph of web users over the institutions that have kept them at bay .
There 's no question that the deluge of data can be a great resource , or that social media is a fantastic way of passing around nuggets of information .
Much of our media diet is made up of recommendations from social media – shared playlists on Spotify , for example , or articles that come our way via Twitter .
It 's also a great way to get things out , burrowing under the control of authorities .
Trafigura is a case in point ; in October 2009 , a single elliptical tweet from the Guardian 's editor lit the touch paper of a campaign that helped overturn a bullying legalistic attempt to silence the paper 's investigations into the company .
Sometimes , however , the bullies are on the other side – witness the over - the - top online monstering of Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir in the same month , after her ill - advised ruminations on the death of singer Stephen Gately .
Both examples , however , can be seen as two sides of the same coin .
The paradox of the " wisdom of online crowds " is that it only works in clubbable , relatively small groups of like - thinking minds .
The reason why the richest and most productive audiences online are for the most arcane subjects – on the relationship between economics and law , for example , or how to care for cats – is because everyone involved feels part of an exclusive club dedicated to finding out more about the same thing .
However , it 's for exactly the same reason that many of these clubs can become breeding grounds for vicious tribalism .
The brevity required for communication on Twitter does not lend itself to decorous etiquette , but neither is it the soul of wit to circulate snide , snarky tweets to an enthusiastic group of followers .
Too often the online audience separates into a series of rival gangs , each of them patting each other on the back and throwing stink - bombs at the other side .
In this environment civility can disappear , with the result that those who do not take an extreme approach in offering their views decide that online forums are not for them .
When everyone is reinforcing everyone else 's opinion in an online echo - chamber , there 's little need to state a case or debate one 's opponent .
It 's easier – like the schoolyard bully – just to abuse them .
The other problem with online " communities " is that decisions about quality often become snagged in a highly conservative and self - reinforcing feedback loop in which everyone queues up to follow the leader .
In an intriguing experiment , three social network theorists at Columbia University used the web to invite more than 14,000 young people to rate songs by relatively unknown bands and download the ones they liked .
The researchers began by dividing their subjects into two groups .
The first group was asked to make their decisions independently of each other , while the second was allowed to see a rolling chart of how many times , in descending order , each song had been downloaded by others – telling them , in effect , which songs were the most popular among their peers .
When they came in , the results were as clear as day .
Those who could see the download charts , the researchers discovered , tended to give higher ratings to the songs at the top of the chart and were more likely to download those songs .
People tended to like songs more , in other words , if other people liked them .
The result was to make the choices of those in the second group highly unpredictable , with a great deal depending on who rolled up to make their choices first .
Identical songs were judged to be hits or flops depending on whether other people had been seen to download them earlier .
In their haste to rustle up an audience , mainstream institutions have not quite grasped the implications of all this , which is why they keep trying to flatter the vast , anonymous masses by inviting them in .
The results can be ruinous .
When Penguin invited millions of web users to collaborate on a " group novel " called A Million Penguins in 2007 , for example , the story was so chaotic as to be unreadable , and kept splintering off in new directions ; at one point it even divided itself into " Novel A " and " Novel B " with links to alternative endings .
Characters multiplied out of control , paragraphs and whole sections ended at random , plot lines drifted hopelessly and were left hanging in mid-air .
Some collaborative novelists took it upon themselves to try to sabotage the whole experiment ; one took the trouble to litter the text with references to bananas .
In the end , just like Dawkins , the organisers were forced to " lock down " the project for a few hours every day to ward off the vandals and to allow the novel time to develop .
One of the reasons for the novel 's incoherence , it became apparent , was that not even the masses of novelists who had queued up to help to write the book had bothered to read what had gone before .
They were too busy writing .
Penguin 's failed attempt to persuade an electronic crowd to co-write a novel illustrates one last problem throwing open one 's organisation to electronic feedback .
Often it only works until its beneficiaries realise that , no matter how many messages they fire off , those in authority are bound to retain the ultimate reins of control .
At that point it is likely that they will switch from offering " good " or helpful feedback into pushing " bad " or destructive feedback back into the system .
The angry , splenetic or downright abusive tone sometimes exhibited by those former fans of Richard Dawkins is a good example of this kind of feedback .
By then , of course , it 's a little too late to show them the door .
James Harkin is the author of Cyburbia : the Dangerous Idea That 's Changing How We Live and Who We Are .

Come see a space shuttle launch before time runs out
BY JUSTIN RAY
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 4 , 2010
Endeavour 's predawn blastoff Sunday begins the final countdown to retirement of the storied spaceships this year , leaving only a few opportunities left to see a shuttle launch in person .
" I 'm trying to motivate as many people as I can right now to go and see one of these last handful of shuttle missions that are left and actually see the glory or more importantly just to feel the kind of palpable excitement that everyone has when they actually see humans launch on a big vehicle like the space shuttle and get into orbit , " says Bob Behnken , the lead spacewalker on Endeavour 's crew .

Witnessing the spectacle of a space shuttle launch , its Earth - shaking departure from the Florida spaceport on seven million pounds of thrust , is truly an awe - inspiring sight to behold .
The technological marvel that is the space shuttle , the most complicated machine man has ever produced , leaves the planet with humans strapped inside on the power generated from the controlled explosion of rocket fuels , accelerating from zero to 17,500 miles per hour in less than nine minutes time .
" It 's a different feeling when you watch people launch into space than it is when you watch a Delta or an Atlas rocket take off , " Behnken said .
" So I think that aspect for anybody who 's actually been to a human launch is something that 's always going to be memorable for them .
We all watch differently , I think , even if it 's just on the television when we know there are people at the pointy end of that rocketship , that folks are doing something hard and it's really critical that everything goes smoothly . "
Sunday morning 's planned 4:39 a.m. EST liftoff of Endeavour could be the last shuttle launch to occur at night .
If the projected schedule for the four remaining flights later this year remains unchanged , those missions will have morning and afternoon launch times .
Night launches are special treats , lighting up the dark with a man -made sunrise of golden flame .
The shuttle streaks across the sky trailing a fiery plume 700 feet long from its solid rocket boosters that can be spotted hundreds of miles away .
All launch dates , of course , are subject to change .
But here 's a look at the dates and times for the final five shuttle missions as currently scheduled : STS - 130 on Endeavour is targeted for launch on Sunday , February 7 at 4:39 a.m. EST to deliver the Tranquility module and cupola observation port to the International Space Station .

STS - 133 concludes the space shuttle program with Discovery 's mission to bring more spare parts and a storage module to the station .
It launches on Thursday , September 16 at 11:57 a.m. EDT .
The specific liftoff times are dictated by the International Space Station 's orbit .
The shuttles have roughly 10 minutes per day to launch on the necessary path to reach the station for rendezvous and docking .
If a shuttle mission is delayed , the launch time moves approximately 25 minutes earlier with each day a flight is postponed .
That means the July mission , for example , could end up occurring in the predawn darkness if it slips a few days .

With the uncertain future of America 's space program , it could be several years before another human is launched into orbit from U.S. soil .
NASA is buying seats in Russian Soyuz capsules flown from Kazakhstan to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station for the foreseeable future .
When the shuttles stop flying , the Soyuz will be the only available transportation for Americans to reach orbit until some new vehicle is developed and built .
NASA had envisioned the Ares 1 rocket and Orion capsules would start flying astronauts by 2014 , but budget woes and politics have intervened with that plan .
President Obama is directing the space agency to look at commercial providers , such as SpaceX with its planned Falcon 9 booster and Dragon spacecraft , to replace the space shuttle and reopen human access to space for the U.S. later this decade .

FREETOWN — Yeniva Sisay - Sogbeh left the United States three years ago to return to her parents ’ homeland of Sierra Leone where she runs the Excel Education Program which promotes high achievement and leadership skills .
“ I moved back to contribute to the development of this nation , ” she said .
She ’s not alone .
Thousands of exiles and refugees are returning to Sierra Leone .
Sierra Leone 's civil war ended in 2002 , after 11 years of bitter fighting in which an estimated 50,000 people were killed .
Now that peace and stability have been established , the government is encouraging people to return to their homeland and play a role in its transformation .
Others living abroad are making more frequent trips to the nation now that the infrastructure has become more reliable , perhaps testing the waters before making such a move .
“ It ’s very encouraging .
The diaspora people are coming back in flocks , ” said Nikita Johnson , a native Sierra Leonean who left in 1989 and now lives in London , but makes frequent trips to visit family in Freetown .
He said he plans to spend more time here this year , looking for positions in the logistics sector .
“ You see more young people taking up responsible positions , ” he said .
That ’s the goal .
President , Ernest Koroma has extended an open invitation to Sierra Leoneans living abroad to return and be a part of the restoration of the nation .
Yet the uncertainty of a lasting peace has kept some Sierra Leoneans away , said Saidata F. Sesay , deputy minister of information and communications .
“ Most of them are ( away ) because of the fear of the unknown , the horrors of the war , of the doubts they have of the solidarity and permanency of this peace , ” she said .
“ So they need that confidence this government will do whatever it needs to keep the peace . ”
Sesay herself lived in Atlanta for more than 10 years .
But it did n’t take Koroma ’s call to bring her home in 2007 .
“ After the war I saw a lot of nationalities who were not Sierra Leoneans coming to rebuild this country , ” she said .
“ I said to myself , ‘ Hey , what am I doing ?
People are risking their lives to go to that country and I ’m sitting here enjoying the luxuries that America is providing for me .
That is unfair , Americans are going to my country to help turn it around , ’ ” she recalled .
“ So I said , ‘ I have to go back to do my bit .
If all these strangers can go there out of love and humanity , why should I not go back ? ’ ”
It ’s difficult to pin down exactly how many nationals have returned since the end of the war , during which Sierra Leone lost 30 percent of its educated population , according to U.N. estimates .
Thousands of Sierra Leoneans remain abroad , with the greatest concentration in the United Kingdom .
Sierra Leone 's total population is 6.4 million .
Sesay said it ’s essential that those who return bring the experience they ’ve gained abroad to put some of the Western world ’s best practices in place in Sierra Leone , particularly when it comes to areas such as health , governance and finance .
Sisay - Sogbeh ’s commitment to “ do her bit ” has n’t ended with her Excel education program .
She teamed up with nine other returnees to form the Ma Dengn Association .
In December , the group hosted the first annual Ma Dengn Festival , a two - day celebration of Salonean culture .
“ We wanted to showcase Sierra Leone as a melting pot , ” Sisay - Sogbeh said .
“ We are trying to bring back indigenous Sierra Leone culture . ”
According to the organizers , Ma dengn is the Kuranko word for " let 's meet " or " let 's get together . "
Several hundred people attended the event held on Lumley Beach in Freetown .
There were dozen of food and arts and crafts vendors on hand , selling everything from “ raffias , ” straw hats traditionally worn by male beachgoers to local foods such as pepper soup and fufu — boiled cassava roots ground to the consistency of mashed potatoes .
Sisay - Sogbeh said one of the goals was to get local businesses used to participating in such events to showcase the brighter side of Sierra Leone .
“ This is a new concept here , to have booths … and to pay to come in , ” she said .
Sesay at the Ministry of Information says she ’s committed to backing — and communicating — the president ’s call to rebuild the country and shed the image of its bloody past .
“ I do n’t know if I have succeeded in making any difference , but I ’m trying , ” she said .
“ At least I ’m here . ”

BBC Newsnight , Zimbabwe
Thursday marks the first anniversary of Zimbabwe 's so - called " inclusive government " .
It has been a year since President Robert Mugabe swore in his former political rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , as Prime Minister and the two agreed to a series of conditions enshrined in the Global Political Agreement and to work on a new constitution which would pave the way to free and fair elections .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
So what has been achieved ?
" The inclusive government has bought peace and there is food in the shops , " Julius , a 35 - year - old teacher said .
" Anytime you get a dollar , you can rest assured that you will find something to buy . "
The problem is getting a dollar .
Teachers like Julius will mark the anniversary by going on strike this week .
He said he welcomes the fact that the coalition government has restored peace to the country , but complained that he still cannot feed his family .
Julius takes homes $ 150 ( £ 96 ) a month .
Over $ 100 goes on renting two rooms in a house , which leaves him with a little more than a dollar a day to spend on food .
Reminder of past pain
We followed him to the supermarket where the shelves were stocked high .
He bought one loaf of white bread - " our weekly treat " he explained - and then walked outside to a market stall to purchase his family 's more regular fare - 1 kg ( 2lb ) of potatoes .
When she was born , we had no food at all .
She went for hours without food .
She is three years old but looks like a two - year - old .
Julius , teacher talking about his daughter
He took us home to meet his wife and two daughters .
" Of course , things are better than they were , " he said , pointing to his younger daughter .
" When she was born , we had no food at all .
She went for hours without food .
She is three years old but looks like a two - year - old .
" I feel like crying every time I look at my daughter - it reminds me of the history I do n't want to remember , " he said .
He is right .
Things were a lot worse .
I have travelled to Zimbabwe regularly over the last tumultuous decade and , if I were to write a report card at the end of this , the first year of the inclusive government , it would read : " A good start , could do better , but with a very uncertain future . "
Mass rallies
The timetable for political reform has slipped badly .
It is a year since Zimbabwe 's former political rivals struck a deal
Only the former opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , have been holding outreach meetings with their supporters to discuss a new constitution , which is meant to pave the way for free and fair elections .
These meetings should have been concluded last November .
At a rowdy , dancing and singing MDC gathering two hours ' drive east of Harare which I went to , people were celebrating that they are able to meet at all .
" It was horrible before , " Susan , a local party organiser , said .
" Zanu PF thugs would come and beat people .
Now , we thank God that we can move freely and meet together . "
The meeting was addressed by the MDC deputy Prime Minister , Thokozani Khupe .
To cheers , she told the crowds that her party wants to restore political power to the prime minister and to parliament .
Zanu - PF are not holding mass , outreach meetings .
Asset control Back in Harare I found Paul Mangwana , Zanu - PF 's constitutional expert , at his legal practice putting finishing touches to what his party believe should be the shape of the new constitution - to put the power firmly in the hands of the one executive authority because of Zimbabwe 's wealth .
Four thousand white commercial farmers have had farms seized " We have a rich inheritance - nickel , platinum , diamonds - every mineral known in the world , " he said .
" We need to concentrate power in one , strong individual to safeguard those resources and protect them from being taken by foreigners . "
Indigenisation is the key to the Zanu - PF political philosophy , a philosophy which would appear to exclude white Zimbabweans .
Four thousand white commercial farmers have now had their farms confiscated and given to black farmers , many of whom are supporters of Mr Mugabe .
A diamond mine has been taken from its white Zimbabwean owner and is being operated by a government - owned company , protected by soldiers .
From 1 March , any company operating in Zimbabwe must ensure that the majority of shareholders are indigenous Zimbabweans .
Luxury lifestyle My " minder " at the Ministry of Information was very keen that I should meet someone he believes is a model of a successful businessman in Zimbabwe today .
Philip Chiyangwa , Mr Mugabe 's nephew , bought several companies at a time when high inflation , price controls and shrinking demand made it difficult for them to operate in Zimbabwe .
Now a millionaire , he displays the full list in his " Native Investments " portfolio on full - length wall charts .
It encompasses everything from luxury hotels , foodstuffs to the window frame company he says he bought from Roland " Tiny " Rowlands .
It is a gift from God .
It is a blessing from God .
I know people are hungry and we are very grateful for what has been done for us .
Elizabeth Chiyangwa
Married to President Mugabe 's nephew
He is optimistic about Zimbabwe 's future : " It is in our hands to take the country wherever it needs to go .
Look at me - I have never left Zim for any other country , I do n't intend to leave this country , I am doing business here and I am successful here .
" If I want to buy a jet tomorrow , I will do it here .
If I want to buy a Rolls Royce , I have one .
If I want to drive a Bentley then I have one .
If it 's a beautiful mansion house , I bought one .
I built it myself , " he said .
Mr Chiyangwa invited me to visit the 35 - room mansion where his wife , Elizabeth , showed me around the family car collection - her husband 's Rolls Royce and Bentley , her Mercedes and their daughter 's sports cars .
I asked her whether she feels comfortable with such wealth when people in her country are starving .
" It is a gift from God , " she replied , " it is a blessing from God .
I know people are hungry and we are very grateful for what has been done for us " .
As Julius puts his children to bed that night , after another meal of potatoes , he could be forgiven for wondering whether it is not his turn , and the turn of millions like him in Zimbabwe , to receive such gifts and blessings .

Former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are appealing to Americans to donate to the Haiti earthquake relief effort , but Bush said on Sunday that with widespread devastation the response will likely take longer than the public wants .
President Obama has pledged $ 100 million in aid , and authorized the Pentagon to mobilize military reserve units to help as needed .
Clinton is traveling to the Caribbean nation on Monday to discuss how to coordinate U.S. relief efforts with those of the Haitian government .
Is the U.S. doing enough ?
( Watch a report about orphans in Haiti )
The U.S. should be proud of its response : President Obama has shown the leadership such a calamity requires , says Steven Cohen in The Huffington Post .
And it 's inspiring to see Obama , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush getting together to announce the Clinton - Bush Haiti Fund .
" The simple humanitarian impulse that led these national leaders to set aside partisanship represents this country at its very best . "
" We have reason to be proud of the American response in Haiti "
The rescue is too slow : Money and supplies are pouring in , says Linda Polman in the London Times , but the rescue operation is " becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims . "
Rescue teams have " pulled survivors from five - star hotels " while victims in devastated poor areas — where the United Nations and other foreigners seem afraid to go — wait to see their first foreign rescuer .
And Obama is n't helping ease fears by putting the U.S. military in charge .
" Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue "
We could do a lot more : Haiti needs relief donations , but cash is n't enough , says blogger Siun at Firedoglake .
The U.S. and organizations such as the International Monetary Fund must send money for Haiti 's reconstruction without strings attached — not in the form of loans .
The last thing Haiti needs now is more foreign debt , which is one of the things that has crippled the government financially and " led to the weak infrastructure that made the Haitian people so vulnerable " to the earthquake .
" Haiti is waiting "
Compassion for Haitian immigrants will also help : " The Obama administration acted properly , and humanely , " by extending temporary amnesty for Haitians in the U.S. illegally , say the editors of The Wall Street Journal .
" The suffering and chaos since the earthquake should make it obvious that Haiti is no place to return people whose only crime was coming to America to escape the island 's poverty and ill - governance . "
And since Haitian immigrants as a group are among America 's most successful , " we do n't mind if they stay here permanently . "
" Haitian amnesty "
This is a long - term job :
To help Haiti long - term , we must also " dramatically increase educational opportunities " for those who stay in their country , says Walter Russell Mead in The New York Times .
The U.S. contributed to the rough start Haiti got as " the second republic in the Americas " — we and France punished the nation of former slaves in the 1800s for throwing out their French colonial masters .
Now we need to help Haiti develop its own " human capital , " because creating a larger class of educated professionals will do more for the country 's development than foreign aid programs can .
" Is the U.S. doing enough for Haiti ? "

While Serbia is a deeply religious nation , it also happens to be steeped in superstition .
The BBC's Mark Lowen finds that folklore , legends , old wives ' tales and stories of medieval military glory are part of daily life for many Serbians .
Belgrade 's Saborna Cathedral is a gorgeous little place , its vaulted ceilings adorned with gilded frescoes and its baroque facade decorated with intricate mosaics .
Its beauty is such that I did n't mind getting up at an ungodly hour on a freezing Saturday morning for the enthronement of the new Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church .
The only downside was being stuck next to undoubtedly the least musical member of the congregation .
My ears suffered for the next hour or so as she sang out of sync and out of tune .
I tried to move away from my tone - deaf and rhythmically challenged neighbour , but to no avail .
Physically , there was no space left .
The ornate cathedral was bursting with believers , their eyes closed in worship , breaking their concentration only to make a sign of the Orthodox cross , or to kiss the hand of the new Patriarch as he passed by .
It was a holy occasion for a deeply spiritual nation - 85 % of Serbs declare themselves Orthodox .
Myth and folklore Religion and ethnicity have always been fundamentally linked in this region .
If you were Serb , you were Orthodox , and if you were Croat you were Catholic .
After decades of suppression under communism , religion again flourished as the 90s began - but it also fed ethnic division , playing its part in the Yugoslav wars that ensued .
As modern Serbia has emerged from the ashes of Yugoslavia , Orthodoxy remains central to the Serb identity .
Turn back many centuries , though , before the Christianisation of Slavs , and it was Paganism , not Orthodoxy , that commanded a widespread following .
If you dare to sit on the corner of a table , you 'll never get married .
With it came myth and folklore - some of which still live on for this nation of believers , as I 've come to discover .
Invited for dinner by my landlord in early January , he handed me a belated Christmas gift of a wallet .
No sooner had I opened it , than he gasped , grabbed it back and quickly put a token 20 dinar note ( around 20 pence ) inside .
" It 's bad luck to offer an empty wallet to somebody , " he told me .
It was my first taste of Serb superstition .
But there were many more ...
Never place your handbag on the ground , or you 'll become penniless .
Do n't even think about going outside with wet hair , or your brain will become inflamed .
And if you dare to sit on the corner of a table , you 'll never get married .
If you do find your future spouse ( which would , incidentally never happen if you let somebody sweep the floor with a broom in your direction ) , you 'd better not sing at the table , or your other half will go mad .
And whatever happens , make sure you call a newborn baby ugly .
If you say it 's sweet , the infant will be plagued by bad luck .
Above all , though , beware of the draught .
Ladies who expose their stomachs to cold air will end up with frozen ovaries and never be able to have children .
Sit next to an open window and you 'll have an eternally stiff neck .
Even at the height of summer , you see older Serbs frantically closing windows on public buses .
There is even a Serbian saying : many have died from draughts , but nobody has died from a bad smell .
Vampire legend
When swine flu hit Serbia last year , people put their faith in natural remedies and sales of garlic soared - appropriate , perhaps , for a country which saw one of the world 's first known vampires .
In the early 18th Century a local peasant , Peter Plogojowitz , died in eastern Serbia .
In the week following his death , nine other villagers mysteriously passed away too .
Plogojowitz was blamed , his body exhumed and a stake driven through his heart .
So perhaps it is understandable that hordes of Serbs would tune in to watch a bizarre transvestite prophet on national television in the 90s .
The mysterious Kleopatra shot to fame predicting the future of anything from marriage problems to the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovan war .
Serbs still commemorate the 1389 Battle of Kosovo
But it is when nationalist politicians have harnessed the power of belief that Serbia has known some of its darkest moments .
Slobodan Milosevic gained power by whipping up patriotic frenzy , evoking the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 .
The facts are still debated , but it has taken on a legendary status for this nation of believers , who are taught how their brethren died as martyrs on the fields of their cherished southern province , defending Christian Europe from the marauding Ottomans .
And President Milosevic led his people into wars , rekindling that old legend of the Greater Serbia .
Still today , Serbs ' obsession with legend and myth means they often turn to the past for inspiration , rather than the future , searching for lost power and prestige .
I have been told by Serbs how they were eating with cutlery long before the rest of Europe and , spuriously , that they invented tweezers in the 12th Century .
It shows , perhaps , the uncertainty they feel about the road ahead for their country , smaller and weaker than it once was .
For this proud nation , it is somehow comforting to believe .

Building a Weather Satellite Station
System 1 ...
Our first system ( see below ) was the simplest and cheapest .
We set it up at the institute where I worked and also at my apartment in Stockholm .
The antenna on the roof of the institute gave a wide field of view while the home setup , with the antenna attached to balcony railing , was hemmed in tightly by nearby buildings .
Two example images :
Image obtained with System 1 at the
physics institute with a wide field of view .
Image obtained with System 1 from apartment in city .
The institute images were sharper and longer ( i.e. the longer the satellite is visible , the more of the image you can obtain ) .
However , we also worked with this setup during the November - December period when the weather was bad and the days were short , so it was difficult to obtain an interesting image regardless .
Our first system Our apartment was in the center of Stockholm .
The antenna was mounted on our balcony and connected by a cable running through the window to a laptop running on our kitchen table !
Unfortunately , the " field of view " to the sky was very limited by the buildings surrounding our courtyard .
Combined with the bad weather of winter and the short days , the images from home were dark and short ( see one above ) .
However , this first setup was still a lot of fun , especially when I first managed to hear the ' tick - tock ' sound of the NOAA satellite AM signal .
When the same system was set up at the institute with the antenna on top of the building we obtained much better pictures .
( See example above . )
Setup : a basic system as show above consists of the following : Antenna - for the apartment we used a discone , which is useful for a wide range of signals but crossed dipole or QFH ( quadrifilar helix ) are normally recommended for APT reception .
These cost as low as $ 50 - 100 range .
Receiver - a typical consumer shortwave scanner will not work well for APT satellite reception .
The IF ( Intermediate Frequency ) bandwidth is either too wide or too narrow .
( Ideally , it is 42 Khz . )
So we purchased an Icom IC - PCR1000 [ Update Nov.1.08 : Icom now offers the PCR1500 in place of the PCR1000 . ] receiver that is controlled from a PC via a serial port connection .
Its IF bandwidth can be set as desired from the control program .
PC with sound card - the PC controls the receiver and uses the sound card to decode the image signal from the receiver 's audio output .
Software : Radio control - the PCR1000 comes with a control program but we more often used RadioCom 3.0 ( now available in version 5.0 ) , which has many features useful for all kinds of shortwave scanning .
( RadioCom screen image )
Image decoder - the audio from the receiver must be decoded to obtain the weather sat image .
We used the freeware WXSAT progam in this setup .
It can run directly from the sound card or from a WAV file .
( WXSAT screen image ) Satellite tracker - the NOAA polar satellites crosses overhead about twice during the day .
( Areas , like Sweden , near the poles can see them more often . )
Currently two of the NOAA satellites are active ( NOAA - 14 & NOAA - 15 ) .
So one must know when the pass will occur and how high in the sky it will be above the horizon .
Therefore , a tracking program is needed .
There are a number of such programs , both freeware and for purchase , with a varying range of features .
Here we used the WinOrbit freeware program .
.( WinOrbit screen image )
Procedure - the essential steps to get an image : Track the satellites with WinOrbit to find when NOAA - 14 or NOAA - 15 would come into view and how high in elevation it would rise .
Tune the receiver with RadioCom to the right frequency ( 137.620MHz for NOAA - 14 , 137.500MHz for NOAA - 15 ) in the FM mode and 50 KHz IF .
Listen for the " tick - tock " sound of the satellite signal .
Record the audio to a WAV file with RadioCom , starting as soon as you first hear the satellite 's signal .
( The decoder can also work in real - time but its safer to record to a file and do the decoding later since I might want to try different settings . )
Decode the WAV file with WXSAT .
Save the image to a bitmap file .
( Note : we had to play with the parameter setup in WXSAT to decode the image successfully . )
Image processsing , e.g. cropping the visible or IR images , with a graphics program such as Photoshop .
As I continue to emphasize , the above components and procedures can be varied considerably from the approach given above .
See the WeatherSat section of the top Space Radio page for links to other equipment and software options .

XBox LIVE Coming To A Windows Phone Near You
by Corey Dockendorf [ Monday , 15th of February 2010 - 11:00 PM ]
Windows Phone 7 OS is going to be Microsoft 's mobile entertainment platform , by bringing gaming to the player anywhere they go , and the ability to network with all your LIVE friends , Microsoft is coming out the gate swinging .
Steve Ballmer announced today the games hub will not only connect you to your XBox LIVE accounts but also bring a new wave of gaming to your mobile hand held .
The games hub will provide many popular XBox LIVE gaming and community features found on the XBox 360 today , including the ability to : Collect Achievements and build your Gamerscore
View XBox LIVE leaderboards
See your XBox LIVE Avatar
Access Spotlight feeds , including the latest tips and tricks , game news , updates and more
Add XBox LIVE friends to your friends list while out on the go
Turn - based ( asynchronous ) multiplayer gaming
With almost 23 million players on LIVE , and the ability to use this operating system on any number of phones this OS could give Apple a run for it 's money .
I really like the ability to Collect Achievements , this feature is what has made apps like Gowalla and Foursquare so popular .
This could be a turning point in mobile gaming , a milestone for the " gamer on the go " .
We should hear more about Windows Phone 7 in the coming weeks , and with a tentative release date of " Holiday 2010 " , XBox LIVE users could start switching phone OS's .
Microsoft will be explaining more details of the XBox LIVE integration at the MIX10 Web Conference in Las Vegas this March .
We will keep everyone posted as we hear more details .
Press release here .
Steve Ballmer announcement here .
Demonstration of Phone OS in the video below .
If you want to skip all the technical mumbo jumbo and get to the actual XBox LIVE talk , skip to 21:10 to hear them talk about the integration .
Microsoft has a 22 - page document which outlines how they store all your private data in their online servers .
The document also tells government agencies how they can get it .
But , oh surprise , they do n't want you to see it :
Microsoft Spy Click to view
The document was unearthed by Cryptome , the site who previously unveiled similar papers by Facebook , Skype , and other online giants .
When Microsoft learned about it , they sent their rabid law dogs to tear Cryptome apart , Digital Millennium Copyright
Act in one hand , iron bar in the other .
So far they have managed to coerce Cryptome 's host company to take down the site the pages are n't taken down .
Network Solutions complied with Microsoft 's barking , passing along the message to Cryptome that , if they do n't take down the " secret " material , they would take down the whole site .

Obviously , Microsoft and Network Solutions do n't give a damn about public interest .
Make no mistake : Knowing what Microsoft can disclose and how , no matter if you are a criminal or just some innocent dude using Microsoft 's services , should interest you .

Bacteria naturally turn carbon dioxide into methane gas over billions of years .
Now Japanese researchers want to give that process a speed boost , to help counter global warming and create some much - needed natural gas .
Advertisement
Agence France - Presse reports that Japan hopes to reduce the transformation period from billions to about 100 years .
The researchers at the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology plan to develop a method within five years for speeding up the bacterial transformation .
Their target : produce methane gas from carbon dioxide buried about 6,600 feet ( 2,000 m ) beneath the sea bed , just off the northern tip of Japan 's main island .
Many nations have already built massive carbon sequestration plants that can store carbon dioxide underground , as part of a worldwide effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
And some researchers have experimented with synthetic trees that can soak up carbon even better than the real things .

Few would probably complain if the Japanese can pull off this neat trick and produce some natural gas in the bargain .
But we 'll keep our fingers crossed that the new super - strain of bacteria does n't cause any unforeseen consequences .

The Villa Vals in Switzerland is a pair of dwellings built into a hillside with the intention of remaining concealed and unobtrusive to the natural beauty surrounding it .
Set within walking distance to the famous thermal springs of Therme Vals ; a hotel / spa complex that is built directly over the natural springs .
Villa Vals is certainly one of the coolest and unique designs I ’ve come across , a joint - venture between SeARCH and Christian Muller Architects

VILLA VALS DESCRIPTION by SeARCH
Should n’t it be possible to conceal a house in an Alpine slope while still exploiting the wonderful views and allowing light to enter the building ?
Surprised that it was permissible to construct a pair of dwellings so close to the world famous thermal bath of Vals , the client seized the opportunity to develop the site , without disturbing the bath ’s expansive views .
The introduction of a central patio into the steep incline creates a large facade with considerable potential for window openings .
The viewing angle from the building is slightly inclined , giving an even more dramatic view of the strikingly beautiful mountains on the opposite side of the narrow valley .
The local authority ’s well intentioned caution , that unusual modern proposals were generally not favoured , proved unfounded .
The planners were pleased that the proposal did not appear ‘ residential ’ or impose on the adjacent bath building .
The scheme was not perceived as a typical structure but rather an example of pragmatic unobtrusive development in a sensitive location .
The placing of the entrance via an old Graubunder barn and an underground tunnel further convinced them that the concept , while slightly absurd , could still be permitted .
Switzerland ’s planning laws dictate that it is only possible to grant a definitive planning permission after a timber model of the building ’s volume has first been constructed on site .
This can then be accurately appraised by the local community and objected to if considered unsuitable .
For this proposal , logic prevailed and this part of the process was deemed to be unnecessary .

VILLA VALS DESCRIPTION by CHRISTIAN MULLER ARCHITECTS
The Swiss village of Vals , well known for its world famous thermal spa designed by architect Peter Zumthor , is getting a new building , a project initialized by Bjarne Mastenbroek and Christian Müller .
Surprised that it was allowed to build so close to the famous bath , the question that immediately rose was ‘ how ’ .
The intension was an unobstructed development of a structure that does not look residential .
The villa is fully embedded in the landscape .
Access is provided via an existing wooden barn , located on a lower level of the mountain .
An underground tunnel , slightly absurd , will lead to the main programme situated in a circular cut made in the mountain slope .
The presence of the villa in the landscape is thus limited to minimum .
The view from the villa looks over the narrow mount valley of Vals and its dramatic surrounding scenery .
The villa is developed with the support of the local authority and is being realized with local manpower .
With the ability , experience and technique deriving from a remote mountain village .
Hardly any details are being drawn in advance .
The design of the building and the realization of it as a simultaneous happening .

THERME VALS
Therme Vals is the hotel / spa complex in Vals , built over the only thermal springs in the Graubünden canton in Switzerland .
In the 1960s a German property developer , Karl Kurt Vorlop , built a hotel complex with over 1,000 beds to take advantage of the naturally occurring thermal springs and the source , which provides the water for Valser mineral water , sold throughout Switzerland .
After the developer went bankrupt , the village of Vals bought up the five hotels in the development in 1983 and resolved to commission a hydrotherapy centre at the centre of the five hotels , at the source of the thermal springs .
Today the Hotel und Thermalbad AG ( Hoteba ) company is 100 % owned by the Vals community .

Doctor 's research triggered a furore and was direct cause of slump in take - up of MMR , which has led to outbreaks of measles in some parts of the country
Andrew Wakefield , the doctor who claimed to have discovered a link between measles virus , bowel diseases and autism and thereby sparked widespread fear of the combined MMR jab , conducted unnecessary , invasive tests on children , the General Medical Council found today .
Branding him a dishonest , irresponsible doctor , the GMC disciplinary panel , which has sat and heard evidence for 148 days over two and a half years , finally found a long array of charges against him proven .
But there were shouts of protest and dismay from the doctor 's supporters .
Wakefield and two other doctors at the Royal Free hospital in London were brought before the GMC over the paper they published in February 1998 in the Lancet medical journal .
On the basis of case studies of just eight children , it suggested that measles virus might be linked to inflammatory bowel disease , which in turn might play a role in autistic spectrum disorder .
The paper conceded that the doctors had not found a definite link , but Wakefield , in a press conference , told the world he believed the measles , mumps and rubella vaccines in the MMR jab should not be given in one combined shot , but in single doses , preferably a year apart .
It triggered a furore and was the direct cause of the major slump in take - up of MMR which has led to outbreaks of measles in some parts of the country .
The GMC found that Wakefield had flouted the rules in pursuit of his theory – and profit .
At the centre of the case against him is the ethical conduct of the trial which resulted in the Lancet paper .
The panel found he had subjected 11 children to invasive tests such as lumbar punctures and colonoscopies that they did not need , without ethical approval .
But investigations revealed more .
In June 1997 , before the paper was published , he filed a patent as one of the inventors of a vaccine for the elimination of measles virus and for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease .
In February 1998 , the same month as the Lancet paper , he applied for ethical permission to run a trial of a new potential measles vaccine and set up a company called Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Ltd which would produce and sell it .
The father of one of the children he had seen with developmental problems and bowel disease would be the managing director .
Wakefield tried out the new vaccine on the child , without mentioning it in the medical notes or telling the child 's GP .
He was also found to have unethically arranged for his son's friends to have blood samples taken from them during his birthday party – for which he paid them £ 5 each .
Wakefield hit on his theory after seeing children with bowel disease who also had developmental problems .
The crucial third step in the hypothesis was the timing of the MMR vaccine : the first shot is given at around 18 months , which is also when autistic spectrum disorders start to be noticed .
In front of the GMC with him were two doctors who were at the time colleagues in the department of paediatric gastroenterology at the Royal Free , Prof John Walker - Smith and Dr ( now Prof ) Simon Murch .
The GMC decided they shared responsibility for the ethical conduct of the trial , although neither one was said to have acted dishonestly .
The trial that Wakefield proposed troubled the ethics committee of the Royal Free .
It is a fundamental principle in paediatrics that no child should be subjected to more than a blood test unless it is necessary for their treatment .
But Wakefield proposed a barrage of invasive procedures .
Dr Evan Harris , the Liberal Democrat spokesman who complained to the GMC , believes the committee should have sought advice from an independent paediatrician .
Instead , it asked a gastroenterologist colleague of Wakefield .
The committee gave its conditional approval .
The GMC panel decided that those conditions had been flouted – and that the trial had been unethical .
The GMC looked into the cases of eleven children who were entered into the trial .
Many rules had been broken .
Wakefield 's contract was for " experimental gastroenterology " and he was not allowed to treat children , but he ordered tests and procedures that were not necessary for their health .
In the interests of proving Wakefield 's theory , children were given lumbar punctures in the spine , colonoscopies and barium meals – all significant procedures .
Children were enrolled who did not fit the strict criteria for entry to the trial and they had not come from a GP who was referring them because they needed treatment .
Wakefield , now based in the US , has also been found not to have been open with the Lancet .
He did not tell them that £ 55,000 funding for the study came from the legal aid board .
Wakefield was advising Richard Barr , a solicitor who wanted evidence to sue the vaccine manufacturers on behalf of the parents of children with autism .
It was a clear conflict of interest and should have been declared .
All three doctors will now come back before the panel in April , where the GMC will decide if they are guilty of serious professional misconduct , which could end in one or more of them being stripped of their licence to practise medicine .
Harris said Wakefield 's reputation and that of his campaign was " in tatters and it is sad that it has taken so long for this to be demonstrated .
" That the GMC has found Wakefield guilty of unapproved and unnecessary invasive tests , including spinal taps , on young children , is the most damning indictment possible .
The findings of failure to declare financial interest are a secondary consideration . "
Dr Shona Hilton , of the Medical Research Council , said the scare had a huge impact on parents , undermining their trust in MMR vaccination .
" Thankfully confidence is returning and the uptake of MMR vaccine is increasing , " she said .
" We need to continue rebuilding trust with parents that MMR vaccination is safe and ensure that those parents caring for children with autism do not blame themselves . "
Wakefield , who was not at the hearing but spoke outside the GMC offices minutes after the ruling , said he was " extremely disappointed " by the outcome .
He said : " The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust … and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion . "
He went on : " It remains for me to thank the parents whose commitment and loyalty has been extraordinary .
Thousands of people , mainly parents of autistic children , have continued to support Wakefield .
Panel chairman Dr Surendra Kumar was heckled by parents as he delivered the verdicts in central London this afternoon .
One woman shouted : " These doctors have not failed our children .
You are outrageous . "

Last week before the game against Calgary , the Panthers held their third town hall meeting for season ticket holders .
The first was held two seasons ago by owner Alan Cohen after yet another losing season .
Head Coach Jacques Martin had been promoted to General Manager after Mike Keenan 's firing and it was obvious he could n't handle both jobs .
The team looked uninspired , Captain Olli Jokinen had attempted to lead a locker room revolt to get rid of Martin .
The fans wanted change .
Now .
Cohen held the meeting shortly after the season ended and a couple of days later , Martin was out as coach , but signed for another three years as GM .
Olli Jokinen found himself traded to Phoenix .
This season , minority owners Cliff Viner and Stu Siegel have taken over from Cohen as managing partners ( Cohen still owns a majority interest in the team , but is now acting as a silent partner ) .
They promised to be accountable and open to the fans and to this end have instituted a series of town hall meetings with season ticket holders before games .
This was the second .
I do n't believe the media is invited to these , but as a season ticket holder , I was .
Given that not everyone is invited , many can't attend and no one with half - season or other ticket plans can attend , I present the following summary of what happened .
My notes were taken on a smartphone , so this is n't a verbatim transcript , but a general summary with a few direct quotes I was able to take down .
Present and taking questions were Viner , Siegel and President and COO Michael Yormark .
The first question was about the season ticket holder package and in particular the fact that last year a discounted area ( the so - called " Panthers Locker Room " ) was put on offer well after renewals were sent out , and the many discount tickets that are available for most games .
" Should n't season ticket holders cancel and buy the cheaper tickets " that would likely be available later .
Mr. Yormark responded that he felt there was " significant value " in season ticket packages besides the tickets themselvesand that the " Panthers Locker Room " was an undersold area of the arena .
He also said that the feedback he has received regarding the renewal offer from season ticket holders has been positive .
Another person asked about the large number of empty seats in the arena .
" What can you so to get season ticket holders to show up ? " Mr. Yormark said that the show rate is a " significant issue we 're all dealing with , " not just the Panthers or NHL , but all of the major sports leagues .
He also added that season ticket holders should contact the team to distribute tickets they can't use .
The team distributes tickets to various charitable organizations .
Returning to the issue of the renewal package , one ticket holder complained about the offer of extra tickets that may or may not be in the same section as the two tickets she currently had .
" What am I supposed to do with extra seats in a different section , split the kids ?
If you can't sell them , then wo n't we have an even harder time ? "
Mr. Yormark said to call him if her rep was n't giving her the response she wanted .
He further stated that in the past , season ticket holders had asked that the team give them unsold tickets to distribute rather than to hand them out to random people at local businesses .
This was the genesis of the extra tickets offer .
The next question was about the lack of scoring , in particular , will the team make a trade to get the scorer we need ?
Mr. Viner said that they had 2 meetings that week and had been handed five scenarios .
He also said that the team wants to improve and make the playoffs , but not with quick , short - term solutions .
They have to look long - term .
My. Yormark followed up saying that team ownership is committed .
" The issue has never been how much money was spent , but how we spent it . "
The question of renewal packages was brought up again , with the questioner stating that it was n't fair to full - season ticket holders that half - season ticket holders basically got a full season for the half - season price , but full - season ticket holders get extra seats in a different section , so he was n't renewing .
Mr. Yormark said again to " call your rep . "
The next question regarded the roster .
" What kind of team are we getting .
Old GMs have made horrible moves ...
What are you going to do at the deadline to get a key player or players ? "
Mr. Siegel responded that they sit down with Randy Sexton a lot .
" We know what we want in a Panther and we recognize there are players on this team who do n't fit that mold but they 're under contract .
We have to try to trade them .
We are looking at potential deals .
I ca n't talk about them "
Another questioner brought up the Den of Honor , calling its removal a " disgrace " and asking if tthe team was going to retire any numbers .
Mr. Yormark responded that the team had already announced they were building a 3500 square foot Den of Honor , to open on March 20 .
It will also honor South Florida youth and high school hockey players as well as the Panthers .
All of the old players have been invited back for the ceremony .
Mr. Siegel mentioned that the team had recently brought former Panther goalie John Vanbiesbrouck in to a game to sign autographs and they hoped to do that in the future with more players .
Mr. Yormark said they are considering retiring some numbers , but Mr. Siegel cautioned that " we can't take that lightly . "
The next questioner asked instead of making the playoffs , why can't our goal be winning the conference ?
" Why can't you translate your passion for the business to the players ?
Mr. Siegel repeated his earlier statement about the roster and that they 're not " all the way there " yet .
" We 're not the guys who pick the players .
We 're responsible for hiring the guys who do .
We hope you hold us accountable . "
Mr. Viner followed up .
" Everyone should know Pete DeBoer has passion .
That group is playing as hard as they can every night .
We'd be selling the guys short to say that they 're not . "
Another questioner brought up the home " road games , " saying " it 's not fun when it 's 80 percent Montreal fans and 20 percent us .
Also as the other person said , we 've made some terrible trades .
If we do n't have the roster we want , get rid of people .
It 's time to go out and get some players . "
It was agreed there was no question in there and they moved on to the next .
" What I do n't understand is what is wrong with out power play ? "
Mr. Siegel answered , saying " our power play has been pretty good lately , our penalty kill is one of the best in the league .
With Horton out we 've shifted the type of game we 're playing .
We have full faith in Pete DeBoer , who has gotten a lot out of this group of players .
We have some depth in Rochester and have some guys who have played well with us . "
The final questioner brought up the scoreboard , and that other arenas have stats up during the breaks in play .
He asked if there were any plans to do that .
Mr. Yormark answered that he would " look into that . "
He further stated that " You guys are going to scream at me for this , but we do use quite a bit of time for advertising .
It 's an important revenue stream for us .
I 'm being transparent . "

Why the cold weather ?
The current big chill is a result of high pressure over the polar region , which has pushed cold air out of the Arctic towards much of northern Europe , parts of Asia and the US .
Winds from the north and north east , rather than the south and south west , have brought freezing temperatures to the UK .
Provisional Met Office figures for December show temperatures for much of the UK were 1.5C and 2.5C below the mean temperatures for the last 30 years .
Scotland saw temperatures dip still lower - from 2.5C to 3.5C .
On Thursday , temperatures in Scotland plunged to - 22.3C in places .
Winds from the north also brought cold weather to parts of Asia , with Beijing receiving its heaviest snowfall for nearly 60 years .
At the weekend , up to 30 cm ( 12in ) of snow fell in China 's capital and its neighbouring port city of Tianjin .
Dozens of people have also died in a cold snap in northern India .
However , while parts of the world suffer freezing temperatures , the seesaw patterns mean other areas are warmer than usual , including Alaska , northern Canada and the Mediterranean .
Met Office figures for the end of 2009 show some places dropped 10C below the average , while others were 10C above .

Continuing their impressive record of quick delivery of fresh KDE software , the KDE Windows team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of packages with the latest KDE release for the Windows platform .
showFoto 1.1 on Windows showFoto 1.1 on Windows
The installer provides not only most of the applications from Software Compilation 4.4 , but also the latest versions of a number of independently released KDE applications .
Highlights include the latest stable version of digiKam ( and the KIPI plugins ) and Konversation .
Although Amarok is not yet included in the installer there is progress being made .
Packages have been split from the KDE modules allowing easy installation of just what you want to use .
The KDE Windows developers are also introducing metapackages that make it possible to easily install groups of popular applications from for example KDE Graphics , the KDE Software Development Kit and KDE Games .
Metapackages are not yet functional in the installer but are expected in a future release .
As always , you can install KDE applications on your Windows platform using the latest installer ( Windows executable ) .
Please remember that KDE software on Windows is still a work in progress , so not all applications are suitable for day to day use at the moment .
Nick Clegg said unpaid carers saved the country £ 87bn a year A million unpaid carers in England could get a week 's break every year under plans from the Liberal Democrats .
The scheme would apply to those caring for more than 50 hours a week and would cost £ 460 m .
The Lib Dems say money allocated by the government for the Personal Care at Home Bill could be redirected to fund the new scheme .
Leader Nick Clegg said he wanted to offer respite to the " hidden army of heroes " working as voluntary carers .
' Saving billions '
The Personal Care at Home Bill is designed to provide free care in the home for 280,000 of the most vulnerable people in England .
It was announced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown last year , with £ 420 m of government money allocated to it .
Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme the bill was " flawed " and needed to be re-examined .
" But in the meantime [ we want to ] do something with the money ... to help those people who are like a hidden army of heroes in this country , " he said .
" There are five million people in this country saving the rest of us , the rest of us taxpayers , £ 87bn a year because of all the help they are giving to people who are very vulnerable - feeding , washing , dressing and so on .
As well as breaks , carers need specialist advice , back - up in emergencies and emotional support
Carole Cochrane
Princess Royal Trust for Carers
" And so one thing we can do with this money is give a week 's break to the million carers who do the most . "
Under the proposals , carers would receive a " personal budget " equivalent to the cost of a week 's residential care .
This would allow them to take a seven - day holiday or series of shorter breaks while their loved one was looked after elsewhere .
In a speech on Monday to healthcare charity the King 's Fund , Mr Clegg said carers were " some of the most dedicated , hardworking and undervalued " people in the country , and a week 's respite could make a big difference to their lives .
The government is urging anyone who voluntarily cares for a friend or relative for more than 20 hours a week to take advantage of a new scheme to build up their state pension entitlement .
It says up to 4.7 million people could benefit from the Carer 's Credit , which launches in April .
' Substantial investment needed ' Carole Cochrane , chief executive of The Princess Royal Trust for Carers , said she was " delighted " the Lib Dems had chosen to focus on the issue .
" With demand for caring starting to outstrip supply , a substantial investment in carer support is the thing most likely to avoid collapse in our social care system , " she said .
" As well as breaks , carers need specialist advice , back - up in emergencies and emotional support . "
Imelda Redmond , chief executive of charity Carers UK , also welcomed the proposal .
But she said : " We do not want this to be at the expense of the improvements that would be delivered through the Personal Care at Home Bill .
None of the political parties have got a fully worked - out solution to this huge demographic problem
Nick Clegg
" This would give people the right to free personal care - something families have campaigned for since 1993 . "
' Death tax ' Social care for the elderly and other vulnerable people has been the subject of a political row in recent weeks .
On Friday , the Conservatives boycotted a conference to discuss the issue after Labour proposed a compulsory £ 20,000 levy to pay for care .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham has called for a cross-party consensus to be reached , but his shadow , Andrew Lansley , has said he wants the so - called " death tax " scrapped as an option .
Instead , the Tories have put forward a plan for an optional £ 8,000 fee to be paid on retirement .
Mr Clegg called for an independent cross-party commission to be set up to examine the future of care in England .
" None of the political parties have got a fully rounded , fully worked - out solution to this huge demographic problem of how we provide care for the growing number of people who need care , " he said .
In his speech , he also set out five priorities for a " flexible , accountable and fair " NHS : protecting front - line services
giving patients more say over their treatment
giving guarantees of quality care for all
disease prevention
putting doctors and nurses in charge

That iPhone you adore may have been built by a child .
Nearly a dozen underage teens were working for Apple - contracted facilities in 2009 , the company has revealed .
The news was posted to Apple 's Web site under a section labeled " Supplier Responsibility . "
Apple 's Child Labor Discovery
The underage workers , Apple says , were at three different suppliers ' facilities .
Though the specific locations are n't disclosed , the report says inspectors visited facilities in China , the Czech Republic , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand , and the United States .
The factories in question built iPhones , iPods , and various Apple computers .
" Across the three facilities , our auditors found records of 11 workers who had been hired prior to reaching the legal age , although the workers were no longer underage or no longer in active employment at the time of our audit , " the report says .
The legal age in the facilities ' countries , according to Apple 's report , is 16 .
The workers in question were only 15 when they were hired .
Apple 's Audit : Additional Violations
The Apple production problems do n't end there :
More than 60 different facilities were also overworking their employees , Apple says .
Apple 's code requires suppliers to work employees no more than 60 hours a week with " at least one day a rest per seven days of work . "
Beyond that , Apple 's audit found two dozen facilities that were paying their people less than the minimum required wage and another 57 that were cheating workers out of legally required benefits -- things like sick time and maternity leave .
Some factories even cut workers ' wages for " disciplinary purposes , " according to Apple 's report .
Apple says it 's requiring the suppliers to develop new measures to correct the violations .
Some of the measures include repaying workers who were underpaid and implementing new systems to ensure correct payment and weekly work - time in the future .
The company promises to follow up with the factories to be certain they 've taken the appropriate steps .
You can read Apple 's full report ( PDF ) here .
This story , " Apple : Underage Workers May Have Built Your iPhone " was originally published by PCWorld .
Feb. 10 , 2010  -- Australian twins Angela and Maryanne Vourlis logged on to Facebook the morning of their 20th birthday , expecting to find birthday messages from friends , but instead they learned the heartbreaking news that their 17 - year - old brother was killed in a fatal car crash .
" I did n't get it .
All these people were writing , ' RIP Chris Naylor ' and ' RIP Bobby , ' and I thought : ' What 's going on ? ' , " Angela Vourlis told the The Daily Telegraph in Sydney .
Wondering if there had been a mix - up , she tried to call her brother .
When she failed to reach him , she called their mother .
" So I rang Mum and said , ' Chris Naylor must have died -- I just read it on Facebook .
But where 's Bobby ?
People are writing ' RIP Bobby ' too , " Angela Vourlis told the Telegraph .
" Mum said ' Bobby was with Chris Naylor last night ' . "
When the family called the police , they confirmed the news that had already spread across Facebook -- their son and brother had indeed died .
Police Spokesman : Authorities Can't Jump to Conclusions
" It 's every parent 's worst nightmare to lose a child in a car accident , but to have to hear it on Facebook , then have to chase up the police yourself , is just horrifying , " Peter Matelis , Bobby 's uncle , told the Telegraph .
A spokesman for the New South Wales Police Force confirmed for ABCNews.com that the Vourlis family had learned of Bobby Vourlis ' death on Facebook , before authorities had a chance to alert the family themselves .
But he defended the police department 's actions , saying that due to the nature of the crash , it took longer than usual to confirm his identity .
" [ Police ] can't jump to conclusions , " he said .
" Police understand the trauma of families in these situations and sympathize with the plight of the Vourlis family .
But St. Marys Police [ which is one station in the greater New South Wales Police Force ] believe they did all they could in these circumstances to inform the family as soon as they did . "
Nature of Crash Contributed to Delays in Identifying Victim , Informing Family
Along with Bobby Vourlis , two other teenagers died shortly after 3:15 a.m. on Feb. 7 , when they struck a pole on a New South Wales highway , while traveling in a Ford sedan .
The driver , the 19 - year - old Naylor , and Kelsie Coleman , 15 , who was sitting in the back seat , also died .
According to the Telegraph , two other teenage rear - seat passengers were taken to a local hospital and treated for multiple non-life threatening injuries .
The wreckage at the crash scene and the multiple fatalities contributed to the delay in identifying Bobby Vourlis and informing his family , the police spokesman said .
" Police did all they could to handle this sad task with care and sensitivity , " he said , adding that the rapid pace of social networking sites complicated this particular case .
" Word spreads among young people very quickly and they 're very savvy , tech - wise .
Without confirmation [ from police ] they had alerted the family , " he said .
Messages of Hope , Remembrance Spread on Facebook
But though Facebook was initially the messenger of tragedy , it has also become the messenger of hope .
On the social networking site , friends of the three dead teenagers have posted messages of remembrance and support for the Vourlis , Naylor and Coleman families .
" R.I.P CHRIS NAYLOR ... tommorro [ sic ] is not going to be easy we all need to be strong my deepest sympathys go out to the naylor family ... " wrote one friend .
" life is way too short , live it up and dont take it for granted , its times like this when you realise things like this , " wrote another .
Facebook fan pages for the three teenagers have also appeared , in some cases drawing thousands of supporters .
" R.I.P. Bobby Vourlis , Chris Naylor and Kelsie Coleman " has more than 4,000 members and hosts photographs , video and discussions from bereaved loved ones .
Dedicated pages for each of the deceased teenagers have also come online .
In October 2009 , Facebook announced that families and friends of deceased members will be able to contact the site to have their loved ones ' profiles memorialized .
When an account is memorialized , other members will no longer see that person appear in their " Suggestions , " and the privacy settings are changed so that only confirmed friends can see the profile or find it in search .
" When someone leaves us , they do n't leave our memories or our social network , " Facebook wrote on its blog at the time .
" To reflect that reality , we created the idea of " memorialized " profiles as a place where people can save and share their memories of those who 've passed . "

I recently ran across a presentation entitled Python vs. Ruby : A Battle to the Death .
I did n't consider it to be a particularly fair battle , and may well reply in more detail in a later post .
However , what struck me as most worthy of explanation was the presenter 's concern about the fact that Procs are not callable via parens .
x = Proc.new { puts " HELLO " } x ( ) # => undefined method `x ' for #< Object : 0x1001bd298 >< x.call #=> " HELLO " x [ ] # => " HELLO "
For those coming from a callable - oriented language , like Python , this seems horribly inconsistent .
Why are methods called with ( ) , while Procs are called with [ ] .
But what 's going on here is that Ruby does n't have a notion of " callable " , like Python .
Instead , it has a pervasive notion of Object .
Here , x is an instance of the Proc class .
Both call and [ ] are methods on the Proc class .
Designing for the Common Case : Calling Methods
Coming from a callable - oriented language , this might seem jarring .
But Ruby is designed around Objects and the common cases of working with objects .
Calling methods is far more common than wanting to get an instance of Method , so Ruby optimizes the case of calling methods , with a slightly less elegant form to access an instance :
class Greeter def say puts " Hello world ! " end end Greeter.new.say #=> " Hello world ! " Greeter.method( :new ) #=> #< Method : Class#new > Greeter.new.method(:say ) #=> #< Method : Greeter#say > #
This is so that you do n't have to say : Greeter.new ( ) .say ( )
Ruby considers the common case of calling methods , and optimizes that case while still making the less common case possible .
Designing for the Common Case : How Blocks Are Really Used
One of the reasons that the Proc.new case throws off Rubyists in debates is that Rubyists literally never call Proc objects using [ ] .
In Ruby , Procs are the object passed to methods when using block syntax .
Here is how Proc s are actually used :
def hello puts " Hello world ! " yield puts " Goodbye cruel world ! " end hello { puts " I am in the world ! " }
When examining languages that support passing anonymous functions to functions ( like JavaScript ) , it turns out that the vast majority of such cases involve a single anonymous function .
As a result , Matz ( inspired by Smalltalk ) built in the idea of a block as a core construct in Ruby .
In the vast majority of cases , blocks are created using lightweight syntax ( {} or do / end ) and called using yield .
In some cases , blocks are passed from one method to the next , before they are finally called using yield :
def step1 ( &block ) puts " Step 1 " step2 ( &block ) end def step2 puts " Step 2 " yield end step1 { puts " Do the action ! " } #= > " Step 1
Step 2
Do the action ! "
As you can see , Ruby builds in the idea of calling a block into the core language .
I searched through Rails ( a fairly large codebase ) for instances of using [ ] to call a Proc and while we use blocks extremely commonly , we do n't use [ ] to call them .
I suspect that the reason this comes up is that people who are used to having to define standalone functions , pass them around , and then call them are looking for the analogous constructs in Ruby , but are missing the different paradigm used by Ruby .
Consistent Method Execution
Fundamentally , the issue here comes down to this :
def foo proc {} end foo ( )
Since the dawn of the biological sciences , humankind has struggled to comprehend the relationships among the major groups of " jointed - legged " animals -- the arthropods .
Now , a team of researchers , including Dr. Joel Martin and Dr. Regina Wetzer from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County ( NHM ) , has finished a completely new analysis of the evolutionary relationships among the arthropods , answering many questions that defied previous attempts to unravel how these creatures were connected .
Their study is scheduled for publication in the journal Nature on Feb. 24 .
Now , for the first time , science has a solid grasp of what those relationships are , and a framework upon which to build .
The new study makes a major contribution to our understanding of the nature and origins of the planet 's biodiversity .
The paper 's other researchers are Jerome C. Regier , Andreas Zwick and April Hussey from the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute ; Jeffrey W. Shultz of the University of Maryland 's Department of Entomology ; and Bernard Ball and Clifford W. Cunningham from Duke University 's Department of Biology .
There are millions of distinct species of arthropods , including all the insects , crustaceans , millipedes , centipedes , spiders , and a host of other animals , all united by having a hard external shell and jointed legs .
They are by far the most numerous , and most diverse , of all creatures on Earth -- in terms of the sheer number of species , no other group comes close .
They make up perhaps 1.6 million of the estimated 1.8 to 1.9 million described species , dominating the planet in number , biomass , and diversity .
The economic aspects of arthropods are also overwhelming .
From seafood industries worth billions of dollars annually to the world 's economy , to the importance of insects as pollinators of ornamental and agriculturally important crops , to the medical role played by arthropods ( e.g. as disease vectors and parasites ) , to biological control of introduced species , to their role in every known food web , to toxicology and biopharmaceuticals , arthropods are by far the planet 's most important group of animals .
" We 've never really known how arthropods , the most successful animals on Earth , evolved into the diversity we see today , " said research scientist and co-author Dr. Regina Wetzer .
" For me , what makes this study really exciting is getting such a solid understanding of how these animals are related , so that now we can better understand how they evolved . "
Because of their amazing diversity , deciphering the evolutionary history and relationships among the major subgroups of arthropods has proven difficult .
Scientists have tried using various combinations of features , in recent years including DNA sequences , to try to understand which groups are related through common ancestors .
To date , those attempts have been stymied by the sheer number of species and wild shape variations between the various groups .
One of the most important results of this new study is support for the hypothesis that the insects evolved from a group of crustaceans .
So flies , honeybees , ants , and crickets all branched off the arthropod family tree from within the lineage that gave rise to today 's crabs , shrimp , and lobsters .
Another important finding is that the " Chelicerata " ( a group that includes the spiders , scorpions , ticks , and mites ) branched off very early , earlier than the millipedes , centipedes , crustaceans , and insects .
That means that the spiders , for example , are more distantly related to the insects than many researchers previously thought .
This team approached the problem of illuminating the arthropod family tree by using genetic data ( DNA sequences ) obtained from 75 species carefully selected to sample the range of arthropod diversity .
Many previous analyses were based on the sequences of a handful of genes .
The researchers in this study , knowing the daunting diversity they faced , used DNA sequence information from as many genes as they could .
In the end , they were able to apply data from 62 protein - coding genes to the problem , leading to an extremely well - supported analysis .
" The Museum 's collection of arthropods , and in particular its collection of crustaceans , are what made a study like this possible in the first place , " says Dr. Joel W. Martin , NHM Curator of Crustacea and one of the authors who designed the study nearly eight years ago .
" The wealth of stored biodiversity information contained in it , both in terms of specimens and in terms of the data , theories , and research related to those specimens , are why natural history museums exist , and why they play such a critical role in explaining the world 's diversity .
Studies like this confirm the incredible value , not only of existing natural history museum collections , but of continuing to add to these collections every year . "
A key problem that the research team had to solve was obtaining specimens of some of rare and obscure organisms whose DNA was needed for the analysis .
Because of their extensive experience in field biology , this was a major contribution to the project from NHM scientists .
Dr. Wetzer recalls lying on the beach with a microscope at Woods Hole , Massachusetts .
She was hunting for specimens of a tiny , little - known crustacean that lives between grains of sand .
" I got the mystacocarids we needed , but I think I also provided pretty good entertainment to the families at the beach that day , " Dr. Wetzer said .
Robonaut is evolving .
NASA and General Motors are working together to accelerate development of the next generation of robots and related technologies for use in the automotive and aerospace industries .
Engineers and scientists from NASA and GM worked together through a Space Act Agreement at the agency 's Johnson Space Center in Houston to build a new humanoid robot capable of working side by side with people .
Using leading edge control , sensor and vision technologies , future robots could assist astronauts during hazardous space missions and help GM build safer cars and plants .
The two organizations , with the help of engineers from Oceaneering Space Systems of Houston , developed and built the next iteration of Robonaut .
Robonaut 2 , or R2 , is a faster , more dexterous and more technologically advanced robot .
This new generation robot can use its hands to do work beyond the scope of prior humanoid machines .
R2 can work safely alongside people , a necessity both on Earth and in space .
" This cutting - edge robotics technology holds great promise , not only for NASA , but also for the nation , " said Doug Cooke , associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" I 'm very excited about the new opportunities for human and robotic exploration these versatile robots provide across a wide range of applications . "
NASA and General Motors have come together to develop the next generation dexterous humanoid robot .
The robots -- called Robonaut2 -- were designed to use the same tools as humans , which allows them to work safely side - by - side humans on Earth and in space .

" For GM , this is about safer cars and safer plants , " said Alan Taub , GM 's vice president for global research and development .
" When it comes to future vehicles , the advancements in controls , sensors and vision technology can be used to develop advanced vehicle safety systems .
The partnership 's vision is to explore advanced robots working together in harmony with people , building better , higher quality vehicles in a safer , more competitive manufacturing environment . "
The idea of using dexterous , human - like robots capable of using their hands to do intricate work is not new to the aerospace industry .
The original Robonaut , a humanoid robot designed for space travel , was built by the software , robotics and simulation division at Johnson in a collaborative effort with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency 10 years ago .
During the past decade , NASA gained significant expertise in building robotic technologies for space applications .
These capabilities will help NASA launch a bold new era of space exploration .
" Our challenge today is to build machines that can help humans work and explore in space , " said Mike Coats , Johnson 's center director .
" Working side by side with humans , or going where the risks are too great for people , machines like Robonaut will expand our capability for construction and discovery . "
NASA and GM have a long , rich history of partnering on key technologies , starting in the 1960s with the development of the navigation systems for the Apollo missions .
GM also played a vital role in the development of the Lunar Rover Vehicle , the first vehicle to be used on the moon .

Geostationary Highway

Explanation :
Put a satellite in a circular orbit about 42,000 kilometers from the center of the Earth ( 36,000 kilometers or so above the surface ) and it will orbit once in 24 hours .
Because that matches Earth 's rotation period , it is known as a geosynchronous orbit .
If that orbit is also in the plane of the equator , the satellite will hang in the sky over a fixed location in a geostationary orbit .
As predicted in the 1940s by futurist Arthur C. Clarke , geostationary orbits are in common use for communication and weather satellites , a scenario now well - known to astroimagers .
Deep images of the night sky made with telescopes that follow the stars can also pick up geostationary satellites glinting in sunlight still shining far above the Earth 's surface .
Because they all move with the Earth 's rotation against the background of stars , the satellites leave trails that seem to follow a highway across the celestial landscape .
For example , in this wide view of the nearly equatorial Orion region , individual frames were added to create a 10 minute long exposure .
It shows Orion 's belt stars and well - known nebulae along with many 2.5 degree long geostationary satellite trails .
The frames are from an ingenious movie , featuring the geostationary satellite highway .
Human interaction is changing the blackcap ( Image : FLPA / Neil Bowman )
The friendly bird - feeder could be an evolutionary force to be reckoned with .
British people who feed birds are contributing to the evolution of a whole new species of blackcap , new research suggests .
Martin Schaefer at the University of Freiburg in Germany and colleagues measured genetic variation between blackcaps in two German sites 800 kilometres apart just after the birds had returned from their winter grounds on the Iberian peninsula and in the UK , respectively .
Both groups return annually to the same forest in Germany , where they live for six months of …
In a unique experiment , The Guardian published online the full manuscript of its major investigation into the climate science emails stolen from the University of East Anglia , which revealed apparent attempts to cover up flawed data ; moves to prevent access to climate data ; and to keep research from climate sceptics out of the scientific literature .
As well as including new information about the emails , we allowed web users to annotate the manuscript to help us in our aim of creating the definitive account of the controversy .
This was an attempt at a collaborative route to getting at the truth .
We hoped to approach that complete account by harnessing the expertise of people with a special knowledge of , or information about , the emails .
We wanted the protagonists on all sides of the debate to be involved , as well as people with expertise about the events and the science being described or more generally about the ethics of science .
The only conditions are the comments abide by our community guidelines and add to the total knowledge or understanding of the events .
The annotations - and the real name of the commenter - were added to the manuscript , initially in private .
The most insightful comments were then added to a public version of the manuscript .
We hoped the process will be a form of peer review .
Almost all the media and political discussion about the hacked climate emails has been based on soundbites publicised by professional sceptics and their blogs .
In many cases , these have been taken out of ­context and twisted to mean something they were never intended to .
Elizabeth May , veteran head of the Canadian Green party , claims to have read all the emails and declared : " How dare the world 's media fall into the trap set by ­contrarian propagandists without reading the whole set ? "
If those journalists had read even a few words beyond the soundbites , they would have realised that they were often being fed lies .
Here are a few examples .
The most quoted soundbite in the affair comes from an email from Prof Phil Jones , director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , to Prof Mike Mann of the University of Virginia in 1999 , in which he discussed using " Mike 's Nature trick " to " hide the decline " .
The phrase has been widely spun as an effort to prevent the truth getting out that global temperatures had stopped rising .
The Alaska governor Sarah Palin , in the Washington Post on 9 December , attacked the emailers as a " highly politicised scientific circle " who " manipulated data to ' hide the decline ' in global temperatures " .
She was joined by the Republican senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma – who has for years used his chairmanship of the Environment and Public Works Committee to campaign against climate scientists and to dismiss anthropogenic global warming as " the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people " .
During the Copenhagen climate conference , which he attended on a Senate delegation , he referred to Jones 's " hide the decline " quote and said : " Of course , he means hide the decline in temperatures . "
This is nonsense .
Given the year the email was written , 1999 , it can not be anything of the sort .
At that time there was no suggestion of a decline in temperatures .
The previous year was the warmest on record .
The full email from Jones says : " I 've just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith [ Briffa ] 's , to hide the decline .
"
The decline being referred to was an apparent decline in temperatures shown in analysis of tree rings , which have historically correlated well with changes in temperature .
That relationship has broken down in the past half century .
The reasons are still debated .
The " trick " was a graphic device used by Mann in a 1998 paper in Nature to merge tree ring data from earlier times with thermometer data for recent decades .
He explained it in the paper .
Jones was repeating it in another paper .
" This is a trick only in the sense of being a good way to deal with a vexing problem , " Mann told the Guardian .
Clearly , this problem with modern tree data raises questions about older data – at least until the reason for the divergence is nailed down .
But it is not clandestine data ­manipulation , or , as claimed by Palin and Inhofe , a trick to hide global cooling .
That charge is a lie .
While he was in Copenhagen , Inhofe made a link between the " trick " to " hide the decline " and the second most popular soundbite .
He said that " of course [ Jones ] meant hide the decline in temperatures , which caused another scientist , Kevin Trenberth of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , to write : ' The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can 't . ' "
The link is bogus .
The two emails were 10 years apart .
Unlike Jones , Trenberth 's remark from October 2009 was indeed about the slackening of the warming trend that some like to interpret as cooling .
That much is agreed .
But Inhofe and other sceptics latched on to Trenberth 's " travesty " phrase as a revelation that scientists were trying to keep cooling secret because it undermined their arguments about global warming .
Again this is demonstrably false .
Nothing was hidden .
For months , Trenberth had been discussing publicly his concerns about the inability of scientists to pin down the precise reason for the " absence of warming " since 1998 .
He had argued in the journal Current Opinion in Environmental Stability in early 2009 that " it is not a sufficient explanation to say that a cool year [ he had 2008 in mind ] is due to natural variability ( pdf ) " .
Such explanations " do not provide the physical mechanisms involved " .
This was the " travesty " he was referring to in his email .
He wanted scientists to do better .
He said the best way to improve the explanation and make it more specific was to make better measurements of the planet 's energy budget .
This would allow scientists to distinguish between any changes in the greenhouse effect , which would result in more or less heat overall in the atmosphere and oceans , and short - term natural cycles of variability , which merely redistribute heat .
He was debating this with the former head of the Climatic Research Unit Tom Wigley , who took a different view .
But their genuine scientific discussion has , since the publication of the emails online , been hijacked by ignorant or malicious invective .
Several other soundbites were subject to perverse or dishonest interpretations by commentators .
Patrick Michaels , the climatologist and polemicist for the rightwing Cato Institute , published a long op - ed piece in the DC Examiner , slamming Mann for an email quote about keeping sceptics ' papers out of the IPCC report " even if we have to redefine what the peer - reviewed literature is " .
Michaels is an old foe of Mann's , but this genuinely damaging statement was actually made by Jones .
In another case George Will , celebrated in some circles as an intellectual , told ABC's This Week programme that Mann had said in an email that he wished to " delete , get rid of , the medieval warming period " .
No such words appear anywhere in the emails .
What Mann said was that " it would be nice to try to ' contain ' the putative ' MWP ' " .
And an intellectual like Will should have known that , in this context , " contain " means to understand its dimensions – how warm it was and how long it was .
Mann explained as much to anyone who asked .
Verdict : not guilty .

With electric vehicles like the Tesla Roadster , we are interested in how fast they will go from 0 - 60 mph .
Think announced today that it has teamed up with AeroVironment , Inc. , a leading developer and supplier of electric vehicle charging infrastructure , to demo the company ’s level III fast - charge system and the Think City electric - car .
The team held a 15 - minute news conference at the 2010 Washington Auto
Show where they charged a Think City from 0 - 80 % using AV ’s fast - charge system in 15 minutes .
“ THINK and AeroVironment are setting a new standard for extremely quick re-charging – zero to 80 percent in just 15 minutes , ” said THINK CEO Richard Canny .
“ This is a major leap forward for electric vehicles .
The development and deployment of very - fast - charge stations will help speed the electrification of automobiles in the United States and globally . ”
“ For electric vehicles to achieve broad adoption as a practical alternative to gasoline - powered cars , safe , reliable and accessible charging infrastructure is necessary , ” said Michael Bissonette , AV senior vice president and general manager of its Efficient Energy Systems business segment .
“ Our portfolio of true fast - charge systems , commercial opportunity charge stations , and overnight home charge stations will help drivers integrate electric vehicles , such as the THINK City , into their lives and realize the benefits of zero emission transportation . ”
THINK also announced that it has chosen EnerDel , the Indiana - based lithium ion battery manufacturer , to be the exclusive battery supplier for THINK City electric vehicles sold in the U.S. through 2012 .
EnerDel also will supply at least 60 percent of the batteries for THINK City electric vehicles sold in Europe .
“ EnerDel has developed an extremely energy - dense lithium ion battery for the THINK City , ” said EnerDel President Rick Stanley .
“ This battery has been designed from the earliest stages of cell development to accommodate the surge of current required for a new standard of rapid charging . ”
The AV level III fast - charge system employs a protocol developed by Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ) .
THINK and EnerDel have for several months been using TEPCO fast charging daily to quickly recharge development vehicles .
This work has confirmed the suitability of the fast - charge technology and readiness for commercialization .
AV level III is a constant current 3 phase ( 200 - 430V ) switching type power supply capable of 50 - 100 kW output at up to 200 Amps .
The EV ECU determines optimal current ; charger supplies current based on order from EV ECU .
THINK City , to be sold in the United States beginning this year , will have a top speed of more than 70 miles per hour and a range of more than 100 miles per full charge .
THINK City has an onboard AC charger that can be coupled with an economically priced 220 - volt THINK home charging station to provide overnight charging for the vehicle .
It can also be charged using 110 - volt current on a regular household outlet .
The fast - charge system will be a supplementary alternative for customers ’ added sense of security and for fleets with daily mileage requirements exceeding the car ’s range .
“ Our experience with more than 1,500 vehicles in use in Europe is that customers using the vehicle for daily commutes and trips around town quickly become comfortable with THINK City ’s range of more than 100 miles , ” Canny said .
“ For them , the standard over - night charging is a very practical solution .
Fast charging ’s importance will be for high - use fleets . ”
THINK recently announced plans for a North American manufacturing facility in Elkhart , Indiana , where the company will build the THINK City beginning early in 2011 .
The new facility will be in addition to THINK ’s current manufacturing capability in Finland , where it has contracted with Valmet to build the THINK City .
THINK expects commercial fleet customers in the U.S. to be among the first users of the fast - charge system , but also anticipates that commercial enterprises – including shopping malls , convenience stores and parking garages – will quickly see the value in offering fast - charging services for their customers as a way to grow business and to demonstrate environmental responsibility .
Writing Leiningen Plugins 101
I 'm trying to switch , building my projects using Ant to leiningen .
Almost all of them requires customs tasks such as building native executables , move files around etc .
Which requires I have to come up with a lein plugin for each ant task , unfortunately not much documentation exists about writing lein plugins , this post collects bits and pieces of information I gathered over the web .
To begin with lein tasks are functions named " your - task " defined in the namespace " leiningen.your - task " .
They take a project argument containing information defined in defproject and command - line arguments .
For simple tasks or quickly testing something , you can create a tasks directory in your project root and a .lein - classpath file containing tasks .
Then you can put your tasks in there , like tasks / leiningen / foo.clj .
( ns leiningen. foo ) ( defn foo [ project & args ] ( println " Hello Foo ! ! " ) )
Now lein should have a new task named foo , running it should print " Hello Foo ! ! " .
Since tasks are just functions , making a task depend on another task is as easy as calling depencies on top of the function .
; ; leiningen / bar.clj ( ns leiningen . bar ) ( defn bar [ projects & args ] ( apply leiningen.foo / foo projects args ) ( println " Hello Bar ! ! " ) )
Now running bar task should give you , " Hello Foo ! ! " and " Hello Bar ! ! " .
For sharing plugins across projects create a separate lein project for the plugin , after creating a Jar with " lein jar " , push it to clojars then add your plugin as a user - level plugin for your project .

VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN complains that he is being driven crazy because so many people are betting on America ’s demise .
Reports of it are not just exaggerated ; they are , he insists , ridiculous .
Like President Obama , he will not accept “ second place ” for the United States .
Despite the present crippling budget deficit and the crushing burden of projected debt , he denies that the country is destined to fulfill a “ prophecy that we are going to be a great nation that has failed because we lost control of our economy and overextended . ”
Mr. Biden was referring in particular to the influential book “ The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers ” by Paul Kennedy , a British historian who teaches at Yale .
Published in 1988 , the book argues that the ascendancy of states or empires results from the superiority of their material resources , and that the wealth on which that dominance rests is eroded by the huge military expenditures needed to sustain national or imperial power , leading inexorably to its decline and fall .
The thesis seems a tad schematic , but Professor Kennedy maintains it with dazzling cogency .
In any debate about the development of the United States , one would certainly tend to side with the detached historian rather than the partisan politician .
All too often , however , students of the past succumb to the temptation to foretell the future .
For reasons best known to himself , for example , the eminent British historian A. J. P. Taylor predicted that the Second World War would reach its climax in the Spanish port of Vigo .
Equally preposterous in its way was Francis Fukuyama ’s claim that the conclusion of the cold war marked the end of ideological evolution , “ the end of history . ”
When indulging his own penchant for prophecy , Paul Kennedy too proved sadly fallible .
In his book , he wrote that Japan would not stagnate and that Russia , clinging to Communism , would not boom economically by the early 21st century .
Of course , Professor Kennedy did not base his forecasts on runes or entrails or stars .
He weighed the available evidence and extrapolated from existing trends .
He studied form , entered suitable caveats and hedged his bets .
In short , he relied on sophisticated guesswork .
However , the past is a map , not a compass .
It charts human experience , stops at the present and gives no clear sense of direction .
History does not repeat itself nor , as Arnold Toynbee would have it , does it proceed in rhythms or cycles .
Events buck trends .
Everything , as Gibbon said , is subject to “ the vicissitudes of fortune . ”
Alon Hilu chooses his words with the sort of forensic care you would expect from a man whose day job is as an intellectual property lawyer .
Even so , the Israeli writer never imagined the political storm he would unleash with his best - selling novel , The House of Rajani .
Hailed as one of his country 's rising literary talents , Hilu came under fire when the book was first published in Hebrew two years ago — not because of its stylistic merits or otherwise but because of what some saw as its provocatively pro-Palestinian slant .
Condemned bluntly by another Israeli novelist as " anti-Zionist , " it won the prestigious Sapir prize last summer , though it was quickly withdrawn amid accusations of bias by the judges .
" I feel as if the author is using language as a weapon against us , " complained one Jewish reader .
" Disgusting , " thundered another .
" How low will you stoop ? "
Hilu , now promoting the English translation of The House of Rajani , makes no apology for what he calls his " narrative of the other , " which foreshadows the nakbah – the dispossession and flight of the Palestinians during Israel 's 1948 war of independence .
" If I was a Palestinian author I 'd try to explain the significance of the Holocaust , but since I am a Jew I write about the suffering of the Palestinians – without necessarily comparing the two , " explains Hilu , 38 .
" Our history can be told in a different way . "
Older Israeli writers such as AB Yehoshua , Amos Oz and David Grossman have tackled different aspects of the conflict .
But Hilu goes right back to the beginnings of what he identifies as an unmistakably colonialist enterprise , framed by the encounter between a young Arab and a Jewish immigrant in the first years of Zionist settlement in Ottoman Palestine .
The year is 1895 , the location Jaffa .
The Polish - born hero – Isaac Luminsky – is a handsome agronomist who is sharply aware of the fertile soil of the promised land – and of the Arab peasants who till it .
( In two years ' time Theodor Herzl will convene the first Zionist congress in his native Vienna ) .
Salah Rajani is a sensitive Muslim boy who lives with his beautiful mother in a dilapidated mansion surrounded by orange groves .
Luminsky covets – and conquers – both the woman and the land .
Salah suffers from disturbing , apocalyptic visions about a disaster which is set to befall his people .
He " sees " one man with a black eyepatch , another who is handsome and black - bearded , and a mannish woman , easily recognisable as Moshe Dayan , Herzl , and Golda Meir – Zionist and Israeli heroes who came to haunt the Palestinians .
He sees a century or more into the future how the family estate has been stolen to build one of the icons of the modern Tel Aviv skyline , the glittering Azrieli Towers .
Edward Said 's Orientalism has been invoked by some to deconstruct the book 's themes of sexual and colonial domination .
But it is the menacing shadow of future catastrophe – the unique experience of the Palestinian nakbah – that gives the story both its dramatic force and contemporary relevance : moves are under way in Israel to stop official funding for nakbah commemoration .
Politics apart ,
Hilu was widely praised for his recreation of an archaic Hebrew idiom in the early years of its revival from a language of liturgy to a spoken vernacular .
The English translation has a Dickensian quality , and differs slightly from the original : Lubinsky is based on a real Jewish land agent whose litigious descendants disliked the negative way he was portrayed ; Salah's " real " surname is that of a leading Palestinian family .
A more striking omission is a map showing today 's Tel Aviv , stripped back to the late 19th century sand dunes , Arab hamlets and orange groves that lie buried under the high - rise office blocks , hotels and parking lots of a 21st century metropolis , Israel 's Manhattan - on - the - Med .
Hilu says his own taboo - breaking views were partly moulded by his background : parents who immigrated to Israel from Syria and who did not share the dominant Ashkenazi ( European Jewish ) experience , with its emphasis on the Holocaust , and with no affinity for Arab life , language and culture .
He also sees a link to the work of Israel 's " new " historians who have de-bunked the old " David versus Goliath " narrative in recent years .
This extraordinary book is set in the distant past but forms part of a red - hot contemporary debate , in Israel and beyond , about the origins and meaning of the world 's most intractable conflict .
Iconoclast he may be , but Hilu ponders carefully before answering his critics : " Zionism does have a colonialist character and Jews did behave in condescending ways towards Arabs , " he says .
" I am angry at our founding fathers for the damage that they did . "
Yet there are limits to his critique : " I do n't define myself as an anti-Zionist , " he insists .
" I believe that facing up to the Palestinian past of Tel Aviv and of the Land of Israel in general and awareness of the Palestinian narrative actually strengthens Zionism because that 's the only way to make peace with the Palestinians and our other Arab neighbours . "

This weekend , the largely informal Tea Party movement attempts to take a step toward becoming a formal organization .
Thousands are gathering in Tennessee forthe Tea Party ’s first national convention and begin to organize innumerable numbers of citizens who are dissatisfied with the direction our government has been and is going in .
Although the Tea Party movement is new , the anti-government sentiment that motivates those in it , is not new .
There has always been an anti-establishment and “ they ’re all alike ” component that has motivated people and inspired attempts to create “ third parties ” .
The most recent one to have come closest to , but still fall short of success , was sponsored and headed up by H. Ross Perot in 1992 .
In his first bid for the presidency , Perot ’s near 19 % of the vote earned him no electoral votes but did essentially throw the election to Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton .
Third parties do not have a good track record in the United States .
That is in large part due to the fact that we have a two Party system .
It is not solely a two Party system , but it essentially is .
Even so , there do exist many official third parties .
Take a state like New York .
There in addition to Democrats and Republicans you have four other major parties .
There is the Liberal Party , the Conservative Party , the Libertarian Party and the Right To Life Party .
There are even more than that , but those are the four most prominent .
They often run their own candidates but more often than not , they cross endorse candidates .
For instance a Democrat may occasionally be found also running on the Conservative line .
Usually , the Republican is endorsed by the Conservative Party and the Democrat is endorsed by the Liberal Party .
On many occassions , Republicans run on the Conservative and Right To Life lines .
These crossed endorsed candidacies have the total vote on the Republican line added to the total votes that they get on the Right To Life and Conservative Party lines .
What this essentially does is give individuals who ca n’t get themselves to pull the lever for a Republican , the opportunity to vote for the Republican , but on the Conservative or Right To Life line .
This is how Rudy Giuliani became Mayor of overwhelmingly Democrat New York City .
He won the Republican nomination but there were far too many New Yorkers who refused to ever vote Republican , even if they did like Rudy .
So what did he do ?
He got enough signatures to create a third Party line called the “ Independent Fusion Party . ”
It was that line that gave Rudy enough votes to win , because the total he received on the Republican line would never have been enough to elect him .
But the point to all this is that regardless of these third party entities that may exist , they more often than not , align themselves with either the Republican or the Democrat candidate .
Why ?
Because we are essentially a two Party nation .
For some of us the two Parties represent clear differences .
To some of us , it is not so much Republican or Democrat as it is right or wrong .
It is that clear cut .
For others , both Parties are the same .
These angry voters are today calling themselves Tea Party members .
And so at their convention , they are organizing .
For those who could afford the exorbitantly high priced tickets that are required for each of the events at their convention , they are being offered workshops such as “ How to do Voter Registration Drives and Where to Find Conservative Votes ” & “ Women in Politics ” or a workshop sponsored by the Young Americans for Freedom called “ How to Involve the Youth in the Conservative Movement ” .
Training in these areas are crucial for any movement so I commend the organizers of the Tea Party convention for understanding what needs to be done to be a successful activist .
But my question to all these new activists and their newfound enthusiasm is … …… Where the hell have you been ??
Why did it take elected Republicans who went astray and the most left leaning , socialist admiring , wealth spreading , President in history , to wake you up and get you up off of your collective arses ?
And now that you have finally woken up to the fact that we are losing our country and shredding its Constitution , what are you doing ?
You ’re trying to take the same historic path to failure that others who believe the grass is greener on some imaginary third side of the street took .
And that is despite the fact that you know there are only two sides to a street .
I find myself greatly frustrated by the new awakening that suddenly has millions of people saying “ hey , wait a minute , that is n’t right ” or “ Hey , can they do that ” .
What “ they ” have been doing has n’t been right for years , but your lack of civic responsibility allowed it to get to where it is today .
Which brings me to the direction I advise that Tea Party activists take .
Now that our government has your attetion , use the Tea Party Convention well .
Be inspired by its speakers .
Absorb the organizational knowledge being provided in the truly useful workshops that the convention offers .
Then take that inspiration and knowledge and do what you should have started doing a long time ago .
Apply that organizational ability and activism into taking over the two Parties that exist .
Make those Parties the political organization that represent what you want them to represent , not what the establishment political class wants it to stand for .
Start at the local level .
Whether you know it or not , there are elections held that elect your local Republican or Democrat Leaders .
The first subset of leaders are your local committeemen .
One man and one woman within small sections of your neighborhood are elected by the registered voters of the respective Parties who live in that area .
They are usually called “ election districts ” .
The people who win the election in their respective election district or precinct , then become municpal or district committeemen .
At the same time , there is also usually an election for either district leaders or Municipal Chairmen .
These people organize the district or municipality represented by district or precinct committeemen .
In some cases these leaders are not voted on in the general election but by the town or precinct committeemen who were elected by the voters in a general election .
District Leaders or Municipal Chairs then organize their committeemen and together they select County Chairmen .
This occurs at a county convention where the county committeemen elect the County Chairmen .
As we climb the organizational pyramid , at a state Party convention , County Chairmen elect a State Chairman and at national conventions , State Chairmen elect a national Chairman .
This is how the Parties , that Tea Party protestors so despise , organize .
Now if only these Tea Party Patriots participated in that process , they could be controlling the Parties and stop being controlled by the Parties .
It should also be known that in many cases , the same process that elects the Party leadership , also takes place in regards to the official endorsement process of candidates .
In many cases , it is how nominees of the respective Parties are selected when local , county or state offices open up , especially in the event of seats that become vacant .
In those cases , the same process that elected your district or municipal chairmen will select the nominee who will run in a special State Senate , State Assembly or City Council election .
Understanding this process is essential to any Tea Party Patriot .
By understanding the methodology involved , instead of trying to build a third side to a street , you can rebuild the existing side that you prefer and make it into what you want .
If you can get Tea Party Patriots elected to County Committeemen positions , you can put into office the Republican or Democrat Party leader of your municipality .
Elect Tea Party Patriots to Municipal Chairmen positions and they can elect the Tea Party protestors that they want to be Republican or Democrat County Chairs .
From there you do the same with State Chairmen and ultimately the Chairmen of the Democrat and Republican National Committees .
It is also how you effect and in many cases select the candidates for state assembly , state senate , Governor , Congress , and the Senate .
If you were apart of that process , you could shape your party platform , you could also be a part of the screening process that endorses candidates and throws the full weight of the Party establishment behind those endorsed candidates .
If you were a part of that process , you would be the establishment and you would be able to eventually take credit for electing people who will take this country in the direction that you want to see it go in .
So my advice to Tea Party Patriots is this .
Change things from the inside out .
Energize , stay angry and motivated , stay focused and become a part of the process instead of fighting the process and succumbing to the failure of all other third Parties .
Do you want to cross endorse or throw your weight behind the establishment ’s candidates or do you want be the candidates that others cross endorse and help ?
Do n’t fight with the political Parties ………..
TAKE THEM OVER AND MAKE THEM REPRESENT YOU AND WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO REPRESENT !!!!
When I hit my financial bottom , I realized that a lot of things in my life needed to change .
I went through my closets and sold off a lot of my entertainment collections .
I started trying out every frugal tactic under the sun .
I created a debt repayment plan and hammered some of my debts with the money I made from the sales and from the frugality .
Yet the biggest shift – naturally choosing not to spend money at every opportunity – was much more of a gradual change .
I did n’t wake up one morning with complete success in this area .
In fact , it took quite a while before my “ default ” mode when I went into a bookstore was not to buy a book .
It took a long time before I stopped putting unnecessary stuff into my shopping cart .
Why did it take a long time ?
For one , the old ways were my normal behaviors .
It was just the way I had done things my entire adult life , and bulldozing those patterns – especially bulldozing a lot of patterns at once – is easier said than done .
For another , I still derived a lot of personal short - term comfort from those choices .
I got a nice rush from owning a new book or something like that in the short term – it was only later on when that book was read ( or sitting unread on my shelf ) and I realized that it had gobbled down $ 15 or so that I felt bad about it .
What caused an overall mind shift away from that ?
Obviously , from the subject of this post , it was a gradual shift .
However , there were three big key elements that convinced me to break the habits of unnecessary spending in my life .
First , I focused in on one or two key areas where I had a lot of money leaks .
For me , the big one was the book store .
I love to read , do n’t get me wrong , but buying three or four new books a week is n’t exactly a habit that creates long - term financial security .
So , to start with , I really focused on my book - buying habit .
I went on a lengthy sabbatical from bookstores .
I just did n’t buy any new books .
The effect of this is that it forced me to discover and utilize other methods for feeding my book - reading hobby .
I found PaperBackSwap ( one of my first orders from there was the remaining four Douglas Coupland novels I ’d never read , for example ) .
I rediscovered the library – and I started utilizing the waiting lists for big new releases .
I started swapping more books with friends as well .
By the time I gave up on the book store sabbatical , I found that my tendency to buy books with reckless abandon had been broken .
I still pick up a book on occasion , but more often than not , it ’s one that I ’m pretty sure I ’m going to read multiple times and thus mine extreme value from .
Second , I tried to be mindful of spending in other areas but I did n’t beat myself up over failures .
I found that , time and time again , if I beat myself up over a mistake , I would be much more prone to just repeat that mistake .
A much better approach for me was to simply say , “ I made a spending mistake .
That ’s okay , though – one mistake does n’t break me .
What can I do in the future to not repeat that mistake ? ”
From there , I ’d try different things .
I eventually adopted a new driving route to work , for example .
I altered my evening routine so that I ’d often have a lunch packed for me to take to work the next day so I did n’t have to eat out each day .
I was mindful of my mistakes and I constantly experimented .
Sometimes things would click and just work .
Sometimes I ’d repeat a mistake a few times .
It was a learning process .
Finally , I got more involved in communities and interpersonal relationships that did n’t value spending .
I started spending more time with some community groups while spending less time with my buddies that were spending money left and right in a seemingly never - ending game of one - upsmanship .
I focused a lot on a small handful of personal relationships with people who reflected where I wanted to be with my life and did n’t focus as much on relationships that pulled me away from that ideal state .
Over time , I found myself doing less “ going out with the boys ” to do expensive things and more evenings inviting people over to our house to play board games .
I found myself filling my evenings with community meetings instead of going out with people who spent most of their time being negative .
I joined groups that matched my interests instead of just trying to keep up with the others in my usual gang .
The people I surrounded myself with began to gradually reinforce good spending behaviors instead of reinforcing bad ones .
I no longer felt a social need to have the latest and greatest thing – and that helped a lot .
A final tip that helped : I reduced my mass media consumption .
I ’m not talking about the advertisements – I ’m talking about a lot of the content itself .
Shows where people demonstrate unbridled excitement at the possibility of winning some material item .
Magazines that talk breathlessly about the latest and greatest product .
Whenever I see those things , I just toss them out .
I have no need to be influenced by what other people want .
It takes time – at least , it did for me .
Good luck .

RZA Burger
I ’ve discovered one of my favorite new foods .
I recently started getting into the music of the Wu - Tang Clan and its members ( many of whom are vegetarians ) , and when reading up on one of their albums I stumbled upon an interview in which the RZA describes one of his signature dishes ..
“ A RZA burger is a veggie patty with a fried egg , cheese , lettuce , pickles and all that , smashed between two delicious waffles .
Spread mustard and mayo on it with a little butter and put that shit together .
Trust me , son , that shit needs to be in stores . ”
As soon as I read that I knew I had to make one .
I sat on the idea for a while , but finally whipped up my own version : two buttermilk waffles , a portabello garden - burger , fried egg , american cheese , some caramelized onions , and to top it all off , a leftover chile relleño from Chevy’s .
I poured a glass of cold water , turned up some Orchestra Baobab , snapped a few photos , and dug into one of the most intensely satisfying meals I can remember .
Every flavor came through in perfect balance ; sweetness from the waffles combined with umami from the mushroom and egg , slight saltiness from the cheese , and just the right amount of heat from the poblano pepper .
Delicious .
“ Ho sempre avuto l ’impressione che in ultima analisi , nel corso della vita , un individuo deve una buona volta schierarsi , prendere posizione , ed essere disposto ad affrontare le conseguenze quali che siano .
E se è invaso dalla paura non può farlo .
La mia preghiera più grande è sempre che Dio mi preservi dal terrore che paralizza , perchè quando una persona vive accompagnata dalla paura per le conseguenze dei propri atti sulla sua vita personale , non potrà mai fare niente per contribuire a sollevare l’umanità intera e a risolvere i molti problemi sociali che ci troviamo di fronte in tutte le epoche e a ogni nuova generazione ” .

Latest figures show the world 's glaciers are continuing to melt so fast that many will disappear by the middle of this century
Glaciers across the globe are continuing to melt so fast that many will disappear by the middle of this century , the World Glacier Monitoring Service ( WGMS ) said today .
The announcement of the latest annual results from monitoring in nine mountain ranges on four continents comes as doubts have been cast on how much climate scientists have exaggerated the problem of glacier melt , which is seen as a leading indicator of how much the planet is heating up .
Last week the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) apologised for " a paragraph " in its four - volume 2007 report which warned there was a " very high " risk that the Himalayan glaciers , on which at least half a billion of the world 's poorest people depend for water , would disappear by 2035 .
However the director of the WGMS , Professor Wilfried Haeberli , said the latest global results indicated most glaciers were continuing to melt at historically high rates .
" The melting goes on , " said Haeberli .
" It 's less extreme than in years [ immediately before ] but what 's really important is the trend of 10 years or so , and that shows an unbroken acceleration in melting . "
Haeberli also repeated his warning that many glaciers are set to disappear in the next few decades , due to an expected continuation in the rise of global average temperatures .
The most vulnerable glaciers were those in lower mountain ranges like the Alps and the Pyrenees in Europe , in Africa , parts of the Andes in South and Central America , and the Rockies in North America , said Haeberli .
" We are on the path of the highest scenario [ of global warming ] in reality , but if you take a medium scenario in the Alps about 70 % will be gone by the middle of the century , and mountain ranges like the Pyrenees may be completely ice - free . "
Glaciers at much higher altitudes - particularly in the Himalayas and Alaska , where it was colder and global warming could increase snowfall - could grow in the short term and were likely to last " centuries " , said Haeberli .
" But even for the large glaciers , for a realistic [ mid - range warming ] scenario , it 's centuries , not millennia , and not many centuries , " he added .
The WGMS records data for nearly 100 of the world 's approximately 160,000 glaciers , including 30 " reference " glaciers , with data going back to at least 1980 .
Scientists also use methods from geology to photos and travel journals and other data to estimate glacier sizes further back in history .
The latest preliminary figures for 2007 - 08 show the average reduction in thickness across all the 96 glaciers was nearly half a metre , and since 1980 they have collectively lost an average of 13 m thickness .
During that year 30 of the 96 glaciers gained in mass .
Two years ago the WGMS preliminary figures revealed the biggest melt - rate in one year on record .
The figure was later revised so it was slightly less " catastrophic " than the other extreme year in 2002 - 03 , said Haeberli .
The IPCC uses WGMS data throughout its report , but the offending statement regarding 2035 was blamed on a quote from a scientist given to a journalist , and never presented in a peer - reviewed journal .
The Goldman Sachs - AIG scandal may be worse than we think .
Former New York Fed President and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is being castigated for paying off AIG 's counterparties - Goldman foremost among them - 100 cents on the dollar and then keeping these payments secret .
But it seems likely that Goldman actually got much more than 100 % .
What is worse , Goldman may have received this windfall by trading on information that was deliberately withheld from the public .
A brief recap of the Goldman - AIG story is necessary .
Goldman has revealed that it had $ 20 billion in trades on with AIG , where it had bought protection on various toxic assets from AIG .
Goldman believed this translated into $ 10 billion of risk to AIG , meaning that the mortgage assets might be worth as little as 50 % .
Against this $ 10 billion of AIG risk , Goldman had $ 7.5 billion in collateral from AIG .
The rest of the risk , $ 2.5 billion , was hedged with Credit Default Swaps , whereby Goldman bought protection on AIG from a variety of highly rated banks .
Goldman felt it was well - hedged , thus the repeated claim that it was not at risk if AIG defaulted .
The result of all this hedging was that a crisis at AIG would become a crisis at whatever banks Goldman had used to hedge its AIG exposure .
Through its purchase of protection on toxic assets from AIG , and subsequent purchase of protection on AIG , Goldman created a situation whereby its risk to AIG became systemic risk .
Unfortunately for Goldman 's critics , this is all fair play .
If Goldman 's purchase of AIG protection from other banks created a doomsday scenario , it was someone else 's problem .
Many on Wall Street have realized that being perfectly correlated with the end - of - the - world usually works out just fine .
Thus far in the story , none of the facts are really in dispute .
One can criticize Goldman for creating a scenario where the only way it could fail was if the whole world imploded , but we might also commend the firm for its good risk management .
Therefore , the criticism of Geithner for " giving away the store " is overly harsh .
Geithner had limited options .
Through its swaps with AIG , Goldman had the power to start the chain of events that would destroy AIG .
And through its hedges , GS had the power to ensure that this failure would reverberate through the rest of the banking system .
It was a form of financial mutually assured destruction .
Therefore Goldman 's unyielding position was that it intended to collect from AIG 100 % of what it was owed .
Bet is to you , Mr. Geithner .
It is easy to hope that a New York Fed president would have had a bit more fortitude to play out the next turn of the cards .
But we should not be surprised that Geithner blinked , folded , and paid the bill in full .
The Fed 's decision to keep these payments secret is less defensible .
If this were the end of the story , one would have no recourse but to grit and maybe buy stock in Goldman Sachs .
But the story does not quite end there .
The bigger story , still unexplored by regulators and Goldman 's critics , concerns that $ 2.5 billion in protection Goldman had acquired before the crisis hit .
What became of those hedges ?
What did Goldman Sachs do with its AIG protection ?
Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag made a disingenuous case in a letter to the Wall Street Journal last April .
He implied that nothing much became of the hedges : " In order to collect under a credit default swap , there has to be an event of default .
No event of default means no payout . "
Goldman would have us believe that since AIG did not default , the CDSs expired and vanished forever .
This is not quite right .
A company can avoid default , but one can make a lot of money selling protection on the company when everybody else thinks they are going to default .
That is especially true if one has been involved in meetings with the Fed where the subject of the meetings was how to avoid such a default .
A good trader buys protection when a company seems very safe , and sells it when the company seems very risky .
It is not appropriate for a trader to sell protection when he has non-public information that the risks have diminished , that the government has unequivocally committed to saving this company .
When did Goldman sell its $ 2.5 billion of AIG protection ?
Goldman representatives have said that the protection was sold in the six months following the September 15 , 2008 bailout loan .
This is problematic .
That is so because the details of the bailout were not released until March 15 of last year , when the famous AIG counterparty payments at last became public .
This suggests that Goldman sold its protection to counterparties that knew materially less about the actual risk of AIG than Goldman did .
Remember that this bailout was specifically designed to avoid an AIG default , the event that forces Credit Default Swaps to be triggered .
Goldman , in frequent conversations with Paulson and Geithner , knew that the government had just committed $ 85 billion to avoid exactly this outcome .
The rest of the world , purposely kept in the dark , saw the risk of an AIG failure as imminent .
In fact , on September 21 , 2008 then - Treasury Secretary Paulson went on Meet the Press and explained that the $ 85 billion bailout loan would " allow the government to liquidate this company . "
Paulson may have been speaking loosely , but in the specific language of Credit Default Swaps a government " liquidation " is a Credit Event akin to bankruptcy and would " trigger " these swaps .
This is why , immediately after the bailout was announced , the cost of protecting AIG risk skyrocketed .
It rose to more than 40 % of the amount hedged ; meaning that Goldman , which had $ 2.5 billion in hedges , would have been sitting on over a $ 1 billion profit .
Not bad , even for Goldman .
The government had just met their collateral calls , their risk to AIG was gone , and their hedges were in the money by $ 1 billion .
What to do now ?
The right thing is to not sell the protection until the full details of the bailout are in the public domain .
To wait until you have no material , non-public information .
It appears Goldman did not wait until after March to sell its protection .
Yet Goldman has denied making a windfall gain on AIG .
AIG CDS protection ended the second quarter of 2008 at about 200 basis points .
From September 15 , 2008 to March 15 , 2009 AIG CDS never closed below 400 basis points .
It is hard to see how Goldman could not have had a windfall .
Depending on when Goldman sold this protection , the gain could have been as much as $ 1.5 billion .
This would mean that while most of AIG 's counterparties got 100 cents on the dollar , Goldman actually got far more .
Criticism of Geithner seems appropriate .
Paying counterparties 100 cents on the dollar was unnecessary .
Keeping the whole thing a secret was indefensible .
Allowing windfall profits was unconscionable .
But the Fed 's behavior may not be the worst element of this episode .
Frankly , it is hard to see how , in having sold its AIG protection before March 2009 , that Goldman Sachs can avoid the appearance that these trades were improper .
Over a year on , we still await a clear explanation of how much the firm made from this protection and how its subsequent sale can be justified when Goldman had information that the federal government was deliberately keeping from the public .
DENVER —
A former hospital technician and admitted heroin addict was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison for swapping drug - filled syringes intended for patients with used syringes whose needles were contaminated with the deadly hepatitis C virus .
The needle swapping infected at least 18 patients at Rose Medical Center here in 2008 and 2009 , according to DNA analysis .
And the judge , in imposing a much stiffer sentence than federal prosecutors had initially agreed to , called the crime “ as incomprehensible as it is unconscionable . ”
He said the hospital worker , Kristen D. Parker , had shown “ a terrible selfishness . ”
But it was the victims of Ms. Parker ’s actions and their families who claimed the emotional spotlight in Federal District Court on Wednesday , telling Judge Robert E. Blackburn before the sentencing about the bitter trajectory their lives had taken because of what she had done .
Hepatitis C affects liver function and can have lifelong consequences .
Some talked about going in for routine surgical procedures , others for serious operations — but all happened , through the worst of luck , to have been in the operating room on days that Ms. Parker was working .
“ She deliberately and intentionally harmed us , ” said a man who was identified in court only by his initials , B.K. , and who spoke about his wife ’s debilitation and bleak health outlook since contracting hepatitis at Rose Medical .
“ We have been traumatized , violated , sickened and forever altered by these crimes . ”
( CNN ) --
The Transportation Security Administration has launched an internal investigation into an air marshal field office in Florida where supervisors are alleged to have used a crew assignment board to ridicule and keep score on women , gays and minorities , sources told CNN .
The board , resembling the TV game show " Jeopardy , " includes categories such as " pickle smokers , " " our gang " and " creatures , " which sources said were names used by managers for gay men , African - Americans and lesbians .
A photograph of the board was sent to CNN .
The Transportation Security Administration confirmed the investigation in a written statement but did not elaborate on when the board was in use , where it was displayed or how it was used .
" Following a referral from DHS Office of the Inspector General , TSA 's Office of Inspection is conducting an ongoing investigation at the Orlando Field office , " the statement said .
" The Transportation Security Administration is dedicated to ensuring all employees are treated in a fair and lawful manner , " it said .
" Accordingly , TSA takes all allegations of misconduct seriously .
The Federal Air Marshal Service will continue to provide its full cooperation and support to the investigation . "
TSA 's Office of Inspection will present its findings to TSA 's acting administrator for appropriate action , the agency said .
Numbers do n't lie , do they ?
In the last year of the Bush administration , the monthly job loss numbers built steadily to a peak which then began to reverse itself during Obama 's first year .
It 's a perfect mirror image , as this chart from Nancy Pelosi 's office demonstrates .
Now , whether this was the result of Obama 's and Bush 's policies ... or whether it 's just a matter of timing , is obviously open for debate .
We know what Speaker Pelosi would have you believe .

When it comes to calling relatives in far - flung locales , it 's hard to beat the ease of Skype .
It 's free , usually pretty fast , and includes video , so we can see exactly what kind of sweater Uncle Frank is wearing to dinner .
And according to the analytics firm TeleGeography , we 're not alone .
In a paper released this week , TeleGeography reports that Skype experienced a 60 percent growth in user - to - user traffic last year .
( Translation : When one Skype user chats directly with another Skype user , as opposed to using Skype to dial a regular old phone . )
By the time analysts finish crunching the data , they expect Skype to have generated 54 billion minutes of international traffic in 2009 , up from 33 billion minutes in 2008 .
" The volume of traffic routed via Skype is tremendous , " TeleGeography analyst Stephan Beckert said in a statement .
" Skype is now the largest provider of cross border communications in the world , by far . "
By comparison , growth in international telephone traffic has slowed to 8 percent .
( 8 percent sounds pretty good , yes .
But as TeleGeography notes , over the past quarter century , international call volume on telephones has grown at a compounded annual rate of 15 percent . )
Mexico , for instance , is the world 's largest calling destination .
But calls to Mexico declined 4 percent in 2008 , perhaps an effect of the sagging global economy .
" Demand for international voice has been remarkably robust , but it ’s clearly not recession - proof , " Beckert said .
As Amy Farnsworth Nagel pointed out last year , Skype 's success is based partly on its broad appeal .
" Some music and foreign - language teachers rely on the software to instruct students in distant or remote areas .
Businesses strike international deals by videoconferencing .
Students studying abroad can keep in touch with family free of charge , " she wrote .

Public interest in the forthcoming appearance of Tony Blair before the Chilcot panel is already high and the ballot for tickets to the occasion takes place today .
Yesterday the Sunday Times published a document that has raised anticipation for the occasion even higher : a leaked 2002 letter to Blair from Jack Straw , in which the then foreign secretary expresses his strong doubts about the wisdom of invading Iraq .
This is the text of that letter , dated 25 March 2002 .
SECRET AND PERSONAL PM/02/019
PRIME MINISTER
Crawford / Iraq
1 . The rewards from your visit to Crawford will be few .
The risks are high , both for you and for the government .
I judge that there is at present no majority inside the PLP for any military action against Iraq , ( alongside a greater readiness in the PLP to surface their concerns ) .
Colleagues know that Saddam and the Iraqi regime are bad .
Making that case is easy .
But we have a long way to go to convince them as to :
( a ) the scale of the threat from Iraq and why this has got worse recently ;
( b ) what distinguishes the Iraqi threat from that of eg Iran and North Korea so as to justify military action ;
( c ) the justification for any military action in terms of international law ; and
( d ) whether the consequence of military action really would be a compliant , law - abiding replacement government .
2 . The whole exercise is made much more difficult to handle as long as conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is so acute .
The scale of the threat
3 . The Iraqi regime plainly poses a most serious threat to its neighbours , and therefore to international security .
However , in the documents so far presented it has been hard to glean whether the threat from Iraq is so significantly differently from that of Iran and North Korea as to justify military action ( see below ) .
What is worse now ?
4 . If 11 September had not happened , it is doubtful that the US would now be considering military action against Iraq .
In addition , there has been no credible evidence to link Iraq with UBL and al - Qaida .
Objectively , the threat from Iraq has not worsened as a result of 11 September .
What has however changed is the tolerance of the international community ( especially that of the US ) , the world having witnessed on September 11 just what determined evil people can these days perpetuate .
The difference between Iraq , Iran and North Korea
5 . By linking these countries together in this " axis of evil " speech , President Bush implied an identity between them not only in terms of their threat , but also in terms of the action necessary to deal with the threat .
A lot of work will now need to be to de-link the three , and to show why military action against Iraq is so much more justified than against Iran and North Korea .
The heart of this case – that Iraq poses a unique and present danger – rests on the facts that it :
• invaded a neighbour ;
• has used WMD and would use them again ;
• is in breach of nine UNSCRs .
The position in international law
6 . That Iraq is in flagrant breach of international legal obligations imposed on it by the UNSC provides us with the core of a strategy , and one which is based on international law .
Indeed , if the argument is to be won , the whole case against Iraq and in favour ( if necessary ) of military action , needs to be narrated with reference to the international rule of law .
7 . We also have better to sequence the explanation of what we are doing and why .
Specifically , we need to concentrate in the early stages on :
• making operational the sanctions regime foreshadowed by UNSCR 1382 ;
• demanding the readmission of weapons inspectors , but this time to operate in a free and unfettered way ( a similar formula to that which Cheney used at your joint press conference , as I recall ) .
8 . I know there are those who say that an attack on Iraq would be justified whether or not weapons inspectors were readmitted .
But I believe that a demand for the unfettered readmission of weapons inspectors in essential , in terms of public explanation , and in terms of legal sanction for any subsequent military action .
9 . Legally there are two potential elephant traps : ( i ) regime change per se is no justification for military action ; it could form part of the method of any strategy , but not a goal .
Of course , we may want credibly to assert that regime change is an essential part of the strategy by which we have to achieve our ends – that of the elimination of Iraq 's WMD capacity ; but the latter has to be the goal ; ( ii ) on whether any military action would require a fresh UNSC mandate ( Desert Fox did not ) .
The US are likely to oppose any idea of a fresh mandate .
On the other side , the weight of legal advice here is that a fresh mandate may well be required .
There is no doubt that a new UNSCR would transform the climate in the PLP .
Whilst that ( a new mandate ) is very unlikely , given the US 's position , a draft resolution against military action with 13 in favour ( or handsitting ) and two vetoes against could play very badly here .
The consequences of any military action
10 .
A legal justification is a necessary but far from sufficient pre-condition for military action .
We have also to answer the big question – what will this action achieve ?
There seems to be a larger hole in this than on anything .
Most of the assessments from the US have assumed regime change as a means of eliminating Iraq 's WMD threat .
But none has satisfactorily answered how that regime change is to be secured , and how there can be any certainty that the replacement regime will be better .
11 . Iraq has had no history of democracy so no one has this habit or experience .

Abstract .
Constructivism is the idea that we construct our own world rather than it being determined by an outside reality .
Its most consistent form , Radical Constructivism ( RC ) , claims that we cannot transcend our experiences .
Thus it does n't make sense to say that our constructions gradually approach the structure of an external reality .
The mind is necessarily an epistemological solipsist , in contrast to being an ontological solipsist who maintains that this is all there is , namely a single mind within which the only world exists .
RC recognizes the impossibility of the claim that the world does not exist .
Yet , RC has the potential to go much further .
I claim that RC provides the foundation of a new world - view in which we can overcome hard scientific problems .
Thus , the paper is urging us to carry RC further , not just on philosophical grounds , but also into the domain of science .
Keywords .
Epistemology , instrumentalism , scientific realism , truth , solipsism .
Introduction
Radical Constructivism ( RC ) is the insight that we cannot transcend the horizon of our experiences .
Experiences are all we can work with ; out of experiences we construct our world .
Thus , there are no mind - independent entities on which our cognition is based .
This does not imply that Radical Constructivists deny the existence of such an objective world populated by mind - independent entities , the reality .
Neither do they assert its existence .
RC is agnostic .
Clinging to an external reality would make us acolytes in a cult of claiming something which we can never know , and which  this is the constructive aspect of RC  we also do n't even need in order to explain cognition and what we commonly refer to as ' the world ' .
The present issue sheds more light on the consequences of this , what is for many people still an unusual and  understandably  hard to accept insight .
In the ' traditional Cartesian world - view ' , we see ourselves as entities among other entities in a reality that is independent of us .
We are separated from that reality by the classical subject - object dichotomy .
Here the I , on the other side the Everything - else , to which the I makes reference .
White snow is white because it is white , as Tarski's ( 1944 ) Semantic Theory of Truth claims .
What the new world - view , RC , says is the following .
Although we can at anytime assume perception and experience in general to be the result of the impact of the reality on the I , we cannot prove this in any way .
We are ' epistemological solipsists ' rather than God - like creatures equipped with the omnipotence to recognize reality  cf. Putnam 's ( 1990 ) " God 's Eye point of view " : " Realism is an impossible attempt to view the world from Nowhere " ( p28 ) .
Nor are we ontological solipsists who want to negate something ( or claim its non-existence ) which can not be proven anyway [ 1 ] .
So simple this insight may seem , yet so difficult it is to find acceptance .
It is therefore not surprising that much of the ongoing discussion in and at the periphery of RC is still concerned with the basics of RC  defending itself against attacks from the realists ' camp who accuse RC of being solipsist  instead of being devoted to developing RC further .
Book titles like " How real is real ? " ( Watzlawick 1976 ) seem to suggest that RC would be concerned with questions of ontology , i.e. , with the existence ( or non-existence ) of reality .
But it is exactly this epistemological question which is strictly speaking not part of the RC discourse .
It is faintly reminiscent of ' Kant 's Scandal ' according to which it is a scandal that philosophy has n't been able to falsify idealists ' claims , and Heidegger 's response that the true scandal is that philosophy has never given up attempting to find such a falsification .
As Searle ( 1999 ) rightly comments , " the biggest single obstacle to progress of a systematic theoretical kind has been the obsession with epistemology " .
Asking
What is knowledge ? , is meaningless and does not lead anywhere .
What plays an important role is the question :
How do we gain knowledge ?
As a consequence , RC is interested in investigating the mechanisms of knowledge construction .
Therefore , RC has the constructive opportunity to transform from a purely philosophical - argumentative framework into a scaffolding for science .
In order to explore the dimensions of its impact on science , I will first provide a short sketch of the surprisingly long history of RC which shows that it is more than just a temporary fashion .
Along its historical evolution , RC has developed a variety of interpretations amongst authors .
We are therefore challenged to extract the main principles which lie at the bottom across all variants .
Equipped with the basic claims of RC , we will again pick up the question to what degree RC and realism opponents and whether this schism can be bridged .
Furthermore , I will investigate how science and scientific activity can be understood from a RC point of view , and what the main differences with scientific realism are .
An overview of the contributions to the present issue follows .
Finally , the conclusions summarize the main arguments and implications , and point at the fact that with RC science has the opportunity to expand in new realms .
An Abridged History of Radical Constructivism
The notion " radical constructivism " was originally coined by Ernst von Glasersfeld in the early 1970s .
However , modern RC is a condensate which brings together key ideas of historical thinkers , and merges them with contemporary findings [ 2 ] .
Glasersfeld traces the history of RC many centuries back , even back to the Greek sceptics .
While the sceptics clearly recognized one of the basic tenets of RC  namely that there is no proof for an external reality  they failed to provide any constructive solution to this sudden lack of an ' anchor ' .
Many authors of previous centuries can be considered precursors of RC as long as their statements are interpreted in a non-ontological manner .
George Berkeley 's " esse est percipi " ( to be is to be perceived ) read in a realist context of course does n't make sense .
Also Giambatista Vico , whose dictum " verum ipsum factum " ( the truth is the same as the made ) already points in the direction of knowledge construction , belongs to the long term history of forerunners to RC , as well as Hans Vaihinger , whose " philosophy of the as - if " bears remarkable similarity to other constructivist features ( for more details see Glasersfeld 1995 ) .
Putting emphasis on the construction of knowledge in infants , Piaget contributes to the history from a psychological point of view ( see e.g. , Piaget 1954 ) .
In the strict sense , however , the history of modern radical constructivism starts in the 20th century .
Apart from its philosophical roots , RC also has cybernetic ones which are closely linked to Heinz von Foerster and what is called second order cybernetics .
While traditionally , cybernetics is the science of communication and control in animal and machine , its second order version focuses on self - referential systems ( the " observation of observing systems " ) and the importance of eigenbehaviors for the explanation of complex phenomena .
The term refers to the behavior through which a system asserts its autonomy from other systems .
Eventually , this idea would give rise to the concept of ' operational closure ' : any cognitive system is semantically independent ( and impenetrable ) .
From the late 50s to the mid 70s , Foerster had been running a lab , the Biological Computer Laboratory ( BCL ) , at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign which was a wellspring of people thinking along similar lines ( for an overview see Müller 2000 ) .
Among others , prominent members of the BCL were
Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela who , as the founders of the theory of autopoiesis , focus on the central role of the observer .
Autopoiesis is the process whereby a system constitutes and maintains its own organization  see also Ziemke 's contribution in this issue .
Gordon Pask who developed a conversation theory  see the contribution by Scott .
In German - speaking countries , an avalanche was triggered in the late 80s by translations of major works by the above authors , plus original contributions in German by Siegfried J. Schmidt , Hans- Rudi Fischer , Gerhard Roth , Gebhard Rusch , and others ( e.g. , Schmidt 1987 ) .
What are the challenges of RC which attract so many scientific writers and readers ; what can we find behind the stir RC created ?
The rather long history of RC suggests that it is an interdisciplinary melting pot of critical thoughts that have been congregated as principles under its label .
In the next section we will look closer at these fundamentals .
Basic Claims of Radical Constructivism
As the previous section has shown , a variety of authors have left their fingerprints , making RC a somewhat heterogeneous field , but what lies at its core is the following .
The Radical Constructivist Postulate says that the cognitive system ( mind ) is operationally closed .
It interacts necessarily only with its own states .
The nervous system is " a closed network of interacting neurons such that any change in the state of relative activity of a collection of neurons leads to a change in the state of relative activity of other or the same collection of neurons " ( Winograd & Flores 1986 , p. 42 ) .
This is a consequence of the neurophysiological principle of undifferentiated encoding , as already formulated by Johannes Müller in the 19th century .
" The response of a nerve cell does not encode the physical nature of the agents that caused its response . "
( Foerster 1973 / 1981 , p. 293 ) .
Maturana ( 1978 ) suggests that we can compare the situation of the mind with a pilot using instruments to fly the plane .
All he does is " manipulate certain internal relations of the plane in order to obtain a particular sequence of reading in a set of instruments " ( p. 42 ) .
In other words , the pilot does n't even need to look ' outside ' .
Since the mind is operationally closed , i.e. , semantically impenetrable , we cannot know any ' external semantics ' ; thus we arrive at the Epistemological Corollary : Reality is neither rejected nor confirmed , it must be considered irrelevant [ 3 ] .
Any explanation within the RC framework forgoes recourses to a mind - independent reality .
As mentioned above , it is this postulate which draws a sharp distinction between RC and solipsism which explicitly objects to reality on grounds which are as obscure as any grounds to assert reality .
As an immediate result , any correspondence theory of representation is rendered impossible ( Peschl & Riegler 1999 ) .
In neurophysiology , it is useless to search for neuron clusters whose activations correlate with external events in a stable referential manner .
Understanding representation from the perspective of constructivism gives us a clue as to what we have to look for in the representational substratum ; namely , mechanisms which allow the generation of adequate behavior .
Traditionally these mechanisms have been thought of in terms of manipulations of referential representations .
However , there is neither neuroscientific nor epistemological evidence in favor of such a view .
As the representational structure is the result of a system - relative construction process , it is no wonder that we are experiencing difficulties identifying ( traditional referential ) representations in natural and artificial neural systems .
It seems that it is simply the wrong thing to search for .
Likewise , it is useless to implement agents in artificial intelligence or artificial life with an a priori defined set of concepts , and to claim they were ' intelligent ' .
This is what I call the PacMan Syndrome ( Riegler 1997 ) .
Artificial agents interact with anthropomorphically defined entities , such as " food " and " enemy " , which make sense only to the programmer of the system [ 4 ] .
No attention is paid to questions like :
How have organisms arrived at the idea that something is a source of food ?
How do they ' know ' that another creature is a dangerous opponent ?
Predators do not have signs on their backs saying " I 'm your enemy " .
Even if this were the case  how would cognitive beings have learned to understand the meaning of those labels ?
The RC view offers the opportunity to investigate the phylogenetic and ontogenetic emergence of system - relative representations , i.e. , " meanings " for the cognitive systems .
Such insights also have impacts on communication and language .
( a ) Meaning is a human construct .
It does not reside somewhere else and is not independent of the person who makes it .
( b ) Meaning cannot be transmitted as an entity .
It is not in the words , gestures , symbols with which we express ourselves .
Language therefore , must be seen as a behavioral system which triggers orienting actions within the cognitive domain of the interlocutor .
Thus language is an ongoing process of interpretation and mutual adaptation .
As Glasersfeld ( 1991 b , p. 25 ) puts it , " [ t ] o find a fit simply means not to notice any discrepancies " .
This is in contrast to matching something against something else ; there are no ways to validate a ' correct match ' .
For Glasersfeld , the main characteristic of a cognitive system is to stay viable in the above sense of fitting , of displaying adequate behavior .
The operational closure results also in a Methodological Corollary : Explanations are necessarily circular since there is no outside point of reference [ 5 ] .
Experience is thus a form of self - reference [ 6 ] .
" Cognition serves the subject 's organization of the experimental world , not the discovery of an objective reality " , as Glasersfeld ( 1988 , p. 83 ) points out .
The radical constructivist world - view is only then consistent iff it gives rise to the world which generates it .
In contrast to trivial constructivism , RC does not propose that differently constructed world - views gradually converge towards a knowledge system which represents the world : " those who merely speak of the construction of knowledge , but do not explicitly give up the notion that our conceptual constructions can or should in some way represent an independent , ' objective ' reality , are still caught up in the traditional theory of knowledge " ( Glasersfeld 1991 b , p. 16 ) .
Thus , RC is necessarily complete , i.e. , radical , with its claim to uncompromisingly apply the idea of constructions on all levels [ 7 ] .
While the inescapable self - referential circularity of knowledge is a threat to realist world - views , it is a logical consequence within RC .
It requires scientific disciplines to acknowledge their own roots , and thus be open to critical re-examinations and proper integration of new insights .
Finally I want to point at an important issue which I call the Limitations of Construction Postulate .
One of the most frequent arguments against constructivism consists of a mere question such as " Surely , you still believe that when the door is closed you cannot walk through it do n't you ? " .
It seems that an adverb inevitably sneaks in : Constructing our own world is equated with arbitrarily constructing our own world .
However , RC is far from confusing both versions .
Experiences are made subsequently .
As such , they are connected with each other in a historical manner and form a network of hierarchical interdependencies ( Riegler 2001 ) .
The components of such a network are therefore mutually dependent ; removing one component may change the context of another component .
In this sense they impose constraints on each other .
Let us compare the situation with a traffic network consisting of different means of transportation .
By car , you can reach only those points which are connected to the road network .
By foot , all the points ( such as mountain peaks ) in between can be accessed , but only if they are within walking distance .
The basic component in both cases is the means of transportation which restricts the availability of reachable destinations .
Free arbitrariness is not possible since different means of transportation have different degrees of flexibility and speeds .
Similarly , the construction network of the mind is also necessarily non-arbitrary .
It follows the canalizations which result from the mutual interdependencies among experiences .
Once a certain path is taken relating experiences to each other in a particular manner , the mind uses previous constructions as building - blocks for further constructions .
The expectation that the mind is free to construct whatever it wants is as illusionary as the idea that natural evolution could bring forth pigs with wings .
Although we can have fantasies about such a hybrid being , physiological constraints within the animal would result in a lethal mutant ( Riedl 1977 ) [ 8 ] .
Likewise , the idea of a door , the mental construct , and the experience of bumping into something one has decided fits the mental construct are constructs which are mutually dependent .
On a meta - level , we can reflect on the components of the compound constructions and do as if we could deal with each component separately , or change the features of isolated entities as if those features would not depend on other elements .
However , there are cases in which we can deliberately change constructions to different degrees .
Our capacity to solve problems is restricted by factors that are commonly referred to as the ' set - effect ' in cognitive psychology , a mental ' laziness ' which prevents us from looking for alternative solutions once a workable solution has been found ( Duncker 1935 / 1945 , Luchins 1942 ) .
Such constructions can be revised rather easily .
Already more difficult are problems related to human relations .
Such problems have a longer history and thus involve more dependent factors .
Watzlawick 's family therapy ( 1990 , see also footnote 4 ) aims at finding alternative constructions ( reframing ) which can make the previously existing problem disappear .
From constructs with an even longer history and / or bigger number of mutually dependent components we can expect even more insuperable obstacles in somebody 's attempt to change them , such as our idea of doors and bumping into them .
Usually we hold an outside reality responsible in such cases .
However , the different degrees of changeability of constructs suggest that we find the reasons rather in the constructs and their mutual relations .
While RC is consistent and well thought through , people ( and among them , scientists ) have sometimes problems committing themselves to RC and its consequences .
In the following I will further investigate this apparent gap .
Constructivism vs. Realism ?
From a common - sense perspective there seem to be good reasons for opposing the RC view .
Appealing to reality as the ultimate arbiter of ( scientific ) disputes gives rise to the belief that there exists a mind - independent reality ( MIR ) which defines what is true and what is not .
What is the sense of clinging to such a concept which is the metaphysical extrapolation of our experiences ( or observations ) ?
Clearly , many psychological and social reasons can be put forward to account for this way of reasoning , among which we can find : ( R1 ) Claiming authority by referring to an external truth makes one 's own point of view unassailable ( Mitterer 1994 ) .
( R2 ) Justifying research expenses , as the true description of reality " ... is what we are working for and what we spend the taxpayers ' money for " ( Weinberg 1998 ) .
( R3 ) In more general terms , claims of objectivity are for the purpose of forcing others to do what they would not otherwise do themselves ( Maturana 1988 ) .
( R4 ) Finally , realism is equated with seriousness and rationality .
As Searle ( 1995 ) puts it , maintaining ' external realism ' is a " first step in combatting irrationality " ( p. 197 ) .
However important such pressure from outside science is , no logical reason could seriously challenge the strict sceptical foundation of RC .
Quite on the contrary , it seems that the belief in MIR is the unscientific alternative .
Here , the ultimate reason for any phenomenon is reality , the metaphysical transcending of the realm of our experiences .
If data does n't fit the theory realists claim an almighty reality responsible .
This resembles religious argumentations in which inconsistencies or unexplainable phenomena are due to an ultimate divine instance far beyond human accessibility .
René Descartes could escape the consequences of his fundamental scepticism only by referring to the ultimate instance of God , since the " faculty of knowledge which God has given us can never disclose to us any object which is not true " ( quoted after Osler 1970 ) .
In times before modern science started to become a dominant factor , people believed in God as the source and engine of all phenomena .
" Then faith shifted from God to science and the world that science was mapping was called ' Nature ' and believed to be ultimately understandable and controllable " ( Glasersfeld 1991a , p. 237 ) .
Paradoxically , realism - based science sets out to uncover this real Nature .
We have to wonder whether this is not a major yet unavoidable foundational flaw .
The description of so - called scientific realism ( SR ) reads as follows : " Science aims to give us , in its theories , a literally true story of what the world is like ; and acceptance of a scientific theory involves the belief that it is true . "
( Van Fraassen 1980 , p. 8 ) .
Metaphysically , this means to claim the existence of MIR with a definite structure .
Epistemologically , SR maintains that we can gain knowledge about that world and that the aim of science is to comprehend its structure .
It is the " success " of science which is held up as evidence of the validity of SR by its advocates .
Their " miracle " - argument says that the evident success of science would be a miracle if things would n't exist ontologically .
Such an argument is logically inconclusive .
Furthermore the claimed " comprehensiveness " of reality would require us to find a correspondence between the real entity and its representation in the mind of the scientist .
But as Franklin ( 1995 ) tersely says , " things do n't come labelled " .
There is no label attached to the object I recognize as tree which would say that it is a tree [ 9 ] .
Foerster ( 1973/1981 ) reminds us to strictly separate confirmation ( realism ) from correlation ( RC ) : " My sensation of touch is confirmation for my visual sensation that here is a table ...
My sensation of touch in correlation with my visual sensation generate an experience which I may describe by ' here is a table ' " ( p. 295 ) .
The table itself , the Kantian Ding an sich , in no way says that it is a table .
It is our experience which makes us construct the concept of ' table ' out of ongoing interactions of various modalities over a longer period of time ( e.g. , Piaget 1954 ; see also the Limitations of Construction Postulate above ) .
Therefore , not the question " What is knowledge ? " but " How is knowledge generated ? " ought to be the subject of investigations .
RC , stressing the mind - dependency , and SR , clinging to the idea of ontological objectivity , are incommensurate  at least on this level .
Foerster ( quoted from Glasersfeld 1995 ) summarizes the crucial point in a single statement , " Objectivity is the delusion that observations could be made without an observer " .
The gap between realism and constructivism seems to be unbridgeable .
Defining science as an instrumentalist enterprise in which we attempt to find regularities among our experiences in order to arrive at useful predictions , is hardly acceptable for a realist .
It is just as difficult to imagine finding a solution to this schism on philosophical grounds since the conception of RC appears to be so hard to accept .
Nevertheless , I do n't think that this is necessary .
There appear to be at least two solutions .
Recalling Bohr 's complementarity principle , the rupture can be cemented .
The principle says , " Any new theory should reduce to the old theory for those cases in which the old theory is known to hold " ( Umpleby 1990 ) .
And indeed , as Maturana ( 1988 ) convincingly shows , we embed our common - sense understanding of reality  or ' objectivity Ðwithout Ðparenthesis ' in Maturana 's terms  within a constructivist framework  the ' objectivity ÐinÐparenthesis ' .
In our daily lives , we work with a realist concept of the world around us .
For an understanding of simple mechanical phenomena neither relativity theory nor RC is necessary .
In such cases the  for us still  unusual context of constructivist concepts is more of an obstacle than a help .
But when it comes to explaining cognitive or quantum phenomena , for instance , we leave the familiar domain of the simplifying Cartesian world , and we have to take the observer into the theory .
The second solution to bridging the apparent gap between realism being so strongly anchored in our thinking and RC is to transcend purely philosophical discourses .
RC has to prove its usefulness with working applications .
Following Pagels ' imperative ( 1988 )  which he accidentally called ' strict constructivism ' 
" You have got to design and build , not just talk about your philosophical fantasies " is more than a sagacious recommendation .
Glasersfeld , one of the main proponents of RC , does not hesitate to agree to Pagels ' imperative when he says , " Ultimately , of course , a way of thinking must not only be claimed feasible but , in order to become attractive , its advantage be shown in action " ( 1991 b , p. 12 ) .
His primary target is early education , a domain in which the consequences of epistemological solipsism become very clear ( Glasersfeld 1995 ) :
The pupil as well as the teacher are mutually closed systems with regard to their experience .
Both sides have established their own world , but now the teacher wants to enrich the world of the pupil .
No direct transfer of new ideas is possible , no royal road to learning is available .
Instead the whole problem of interpersonal communication becomes evident .
Scott 's paper in this issue is devoted to aspects of this problem .
After having outlined the relationship between RC and SR in detail , we will take a closer look at the link between RC and scientific practice in the next section .
Radical Constructivism and Science
One of the goals of science is to explain phenomena .
Another is to make predictions .
Usually , instrumentalists abandon the idea of being able to explain and focus on predictions instead .
At its core , an explanation is the attempt to set the explicandum in relation ( e.g. , scientifically by employing the covering - law thesis ) to another phenomenon which in turn is related to yet another phenomenon etc .... ad infinitum ?
Ad reality ?
Or to what Latour ( 1987 ) labels ' black boxes ' : successful experiments , procedures , devices etc. which are taken for granted and treated as an unquestionable fact ?
Naturally , there is no need to look inside the black box again as it is thought to be the safe rock , the reality upon which the scientific building is erected .
Be it because we get tired of stepping increasingly deeper into the explanatory circle  like the curious child who stops asking question after question because it becomes increasingly difficult to receive further answers  , or be it that we are afraid of asking further as this may reveal inconsistencies within our own world - view .
In any case , equating black boxed explanations with reality is but the motor that keeps spinning off scientific revolutions .
Differently made - up black boxes are incompatible with each other , even though they might focus on a similar class of phenomena .
Clearly , both facets  prediction and explanation  make use of cognitive capabilities .
We can safely say that the cognitive mechanisms underneath common - sense reasoning and science are the same .
Both are brought forth by a mind .
However , science must be considered as the systematic investigation of experienced phenomena subject to further processing .
These investigations are based on the idea of reproducibility in order to eliminate fraudulent subjective " It happens just to me " - claims [ 10 ] .
This means to expose one 's ideas to rigorous examinations through others and their potential refutation .
A second means to avoid fraud is explicitness when quoting other scientists , or observers in general .
None of these mechanisms of science is sufficient in its own [ 11 ] .
In scientific textbooks , however , the aspect of explicit citations seems to fall short .
History of science is smoothed out by re-writing it [ 12 ] .
Textbooks provide students with the impression that natural laws exist ( ontologically ) as described , rather than pointing out that these are statements / findings of a certain person [ 13 ] , acclaimed by the scientific community .
This is a psychological trick , of course , to win the competition among other world - views which claim to be the correct one .
The more students learn perspective A the more likely they will , as later scientists , consider A true .
I think we have to look at this from a historical point of view .
Science , after all , has helped us to get rid of many forms of superstition and literal beliefs in legends and myths [ 14 ] .
Without doubts , by insisting on rigor when observing phenomena , science lets us arrive at more reliable results with a wider range of applicability .
Reliable in the sense that we have encountered less exceptions to rules and laws proposed by science than to rules established by different world - views .
Living organisms are conservative systems [ 15 ] , they seek confidence in phenomena which are repeated rather than getting cognitively overloaded in chaotic environments .
From this perspective , we can unroll the objective of the aforementioned ' competition ' among different world - views as a competition in order to establish confidence rather than to get closer to an objective truth .
Traditionally , the search for viable solutions has been equated with instrumentalism  and indeed several RC authors write in this line .
Instrumentalism holds that theories are just tools or calculation devices for useful predictions rather than representations of an external reality .
But I think there is more to it as the instrumentalist conception cannot account for why science has always been considered to be looking for the absolute truth while at the same time blessed us a greater degree of confidence in established natural laws and insights than other anschauungen .
Let 's look at an example .
Early encyclopedias such as ' Natural History ' by Plinius the Elder in the first century AD did n't manage to distinguish between fact and legend ( de Camp 1974 ) .
For Plinius the story that elephants could be taught to write appeared plausible because he was not exposed to what is commonly referred to as the scientific method .
Modern science sets out to eliminate such views by providing a rigorous procedure , the scientific method .
It rests basically on the idea of reproducibility ( i.e. , try to teach elephants writing ) and being explicit when referring to other authors .
In his contribution , de Zeeuw argues that observation has to get ' detached ' in order to eliminate prejudices , social influences , etc .
But the price to pay for weeding out other , potentially more attractive  because easier to obtain  ways of gaining knowledge was to claim that the scientific method indeed reveals reality .
Science became the only legitimate form of knowledge .
It is a matter of claiming to be superior compared to others if you want to win acceptance in a world of arbitrariness .
One had to ascribe to such a strong claim mainly due to sociological factors .
The ' uninformed ' audience is not an ideal , neutrally biased audience without any other need and biasing factors they are exposed to .
Especially in former days , the life of people was situated in a much less free society and depended on very down - to - earth issues which would n't forgive mistakes .
Hence we owe much to science as it enabled better organized investigations into the world of experienced phenomena  even though it has been a realist enterprise .
However , the time may now be ripe to climb up the ladder into a new , RC - based era of science , as the contributions in the present issue suggest .
The Contributions
RC has already gained great influence in literature , media and educational science .
However , there is little ( if any ) attention paid to RC in other disciplines .
The contributors to these two issues on " The Impact of Radical Constructivism on Science " set out to provide arguments for the usefulness of RC in other domains .
These arguments may be related to already existing applications of constructivist ideas , may give reasons to import these ideas to currently realist - dominated branches of sciences , or may point out the success of RC in ' traditional ' areas .
The goal is to increase the acceptance and plausibility of constructivism outside its ' classical ' domains .
Therefore , typical questions addressed may encompass :
What is the impact of RC on science ?
What has RC changed so far in scientific disciplines ?
Having a constructivist background certainly changes the way of thinking ( for a sceptical thought on this see Schwegler 's contribution ) .
This also applies to scientists and the way science is carried out .
In literature , e.g. , there once was a dominant view that focussed on the communication signal itself rather than on the reader .
Thus , transformations of meanings were differently explained than within a constructivist framework ( Spivey 1997 ) .
In physics , to mention another example , the concept of science , its goals , and functioning are mostly non-constructivist .
Despite results from research in quantum physics , which urges us to give up the objectivist perspective , physicists are ( still [ 16 ] ) indoctrinated to believe that they are generating an ever more accurate picture of physical reality .
Many base their whole sense of profession and self on the notion that they are generating absolute truth ( e.g. , Weinberg 1998 ; for a popular overview see Horgan 1996 ) .
For them , if physics is not that , then why bother ?
Getting to the ' truth ' is the whole reason why they went into physics .
To question the notion of knowing ' truth ' is for them a direct attack on their self - understanding .
So what would change if physics became a constructivist - biased discipline ?
It could give an answer to Penrose 's ( 1986 ) remark that although quantum mechanics exhibits " marvellous agreements ... with every experimental result " and is of " astonishing and profound mathematical beauty " , it " makes absolutely no sense " ( p. 129 )  apparently when trying to link it to a common - sense conception of reality .
Or , on a more general level we can continue to ask :
How could RC be applied in all domains of human scientific activity ?
Or are there reasons to exclude RC as a methodology and background epistemology in some disciplines ?
Since some disciplines seem to contain a higher dose of constructivism than others , we have to provide a representative overview and ask :
What is the ( detailed ) picture of the current situation in various disciplines ?
By comparing the application in different branches of science we might finally get answers to the question of how to carry RC to those domains in which RC is still neglected
Yet another issue is that many scientists who have heard of RC and postmodernist tendencies lump them together and see them as a very serious threat to their profession .
Searle 's ( 1995 ) call for realism as a first step in combatting irrationalism expresses this very clearly .
In response , the reply of RC is also clear .
As a discipline that is centered on the processes of how knowledge is generated , it lends itself naturally to the purpose and goals of scientific activity .
There is nothing from RC that would lead us to question the fit of current theory to experience .
RC suggests that scientists re-examine scientific activity and their ideas about the nature of theory .
For example , the theory of Autopoiesis ( Maturana and Varela 1980 ) does not involve any fundamentally new biology .
The authors were reinterpreting existing biology and so arrived at new insights without appealing to ' esoteric ' knowledge .
In this sense , RC sets out to find a better understanding of scientific activity in order to increase its efficiency .
Of course , such a claim can only be cashed in by bringing forth convincing arguments in favor of the usability of RC in order to distinguish it from postmodernist ' cargo cult science ' ( Feynman 1985 ) .
To sum up , the goal of this special issue is to come up with an overview of the relationship between RC as an epistemology / methodology and various scientific disciplines as target domains .
This implies both examples where RC has already been successfully merged with disciplines and strategies of how to proceed in those domains which still neglect RC or even oppose it .
Science consists of many facets , many areas of investigations .
Naturally , the contributions to this special issue focus on various disciplines .
In the beginning , three articles are concerned with the paradigm of RC itself .
They investigate the content of the RC - movement from the perspectives of philosophy of science and pay also heed to sociological aspects .
Ernst von Glasersfeld starts with a general exposition of RC .
Quoting Einstein who once said that all science is the enterprise of coordinating and arranging our experiences , Glasersfeld points out that all scientific rationality can work with experiences .
There is no ' going beyond ' .
There is no fanciful retreat into the realm of objectivity possible .
Likewise , a ' phenomenon ' does not connote a mind - independent entity .
Instead , it refers to an isolated part of the experience .
A possible objection goes , experience is a common feature of common - sense and scientific reasoning .
What makes science so unique is , among others , exact measurement and quantifying , which does not allow for ' subjective interpretation ' .
But again , to measure means to compare two phenomena with each other , one of which already assigned with a dimension .
Assigning a scale or units to a phenomenon means to compare it with yet another one , etc .
Therefore , the act of quantifying does not save the realists ' argument either .
By introducing the notion of ' functional fit ' , von Glasersfeld clearly defines what it means to ' know ' in a RC context .
It is to possess ways and means of acting and thinking that allow one to attain one 's own goals , rather than to posses a true representation of ' reality ' .
Ranulph Glanville 's contribution is concerned with the possible reconciling RC and realism .
He urges us to distinguish between the ' as is ' and the 'as if ' of our experiences .
Being all our life encouraged to belief in the mind - independent existence of things , we tend to confuse ' as is ' and 'as if ' .
Glanville also makes it clear that our understanding of the world depends on how well we understand the processes which enable us to understand .
See also the paper of Schwegler .
Also the paper of Gerard de Zeeuw tries to bridge the gap between RC and SR .
He outlines a solution of how to resolve the dilemma that the justification of RC is obvious from its own perspective but not from the position of SR , and vice versa .
The solution can be found in clarifying the historical development of observation and knowledge .
De Zeeuw identifies two methods to combine and systematize publicly reported observations : ' attached ' and ' detached ' observations .
Attachment sorts observations in terms of time , direction , viewing position , etc . Detaching observations ( recognizing observations as closed classes ) from situated interests is important in order to make them resist societal influence .
Only this ' standardization ' of observation has made the development of modern science possible ( see also the example of Plinius the Elder above ) .
De Zeeuw notes that detachment does not require an ( assumed ) reality  contrary to the common - sense expectation .
This is in line with Glasersfeld 's skeptics argument .
On this basis he is able to conclude that certain extensions of SR converge to RC , in particular combinations of attached observations .
As collectives , they prove detachable themselves .
This convergence allows for the development of concrete research designs for RC , as shown by examples .
It also suggests a possibly fruitful communication between RC and SR .
Important areas of application for RC are biological sciences and artificial intelligence .
Unfortunately , RC has had little impact on them to date .
This is somewhat surprising .
Firstly , the evolution of RC has largely been influenced by biological cybernetics ( such as Foerster 's BCL ) and Maturana and Varela 's theory of ' autopoietic systems ' even explicitly refers to a ' biology of cognition ' ( Maturana and Varela 1980 ) .
And secondly , in the case of artificial intelligence and artificial life , one could expect that through adaptive learning artifacts necessarily construct internal ' knowledge ' structures which are not a priori provided by the designer of the system .
In order to investigate the reasons why so little attention has been paid in these disciplines to RC , and how RC might contribute to progress , three papers are devoted to this topic .
John Stewart provides us with an overview of how RC changes the world - view in biology and cognitive science .
In the context of realism vs. constructivism , he discusses the relation between the two opposed views of the organization of the living .
The currently dominating neo-Darwinian world - view is portrayed as timeless and ahistorical .
The alternative paradigm of autopoiesis deals with processes of self - construction and is thus historical .
This classification parallels the distinction in cognitive science between classical cognitivism and enaction .
Cognitivism plays an important role in the explanation of cognitive capabilities and their implementation in artifacts .
Symbols are placed at the root of computational processes .
Meaning is imposed on these symbols by the designer of the artifact through the fact that symbols are representations of some states in the outside world .
Enaction , on the contrary , focuses on the self - creation of meaning through the system itself .
The conclusion Stewart draws from his investigations is that constructivism rehabilitates realism as a pragmatic possibility in cognitive science which points at an even - handed reciprocity between these apparently contrary world - views .
Regarding the little impact of constructivism in mainstream biology , Stewart claims that while authors take the constructivist theory of Autopoiesis as granted not much effort has been spent in the mechanisms of autopoiesis itself .
This is a clear call for further research in this area .
Markus Peschl steps deeper into the problem of representation .
In particular he investigates the relationship between cognitive and scientific processes for which ' knowledge representation ' is a key concept .
By relating the notion of ' representational spaces ' to ' theory spaces ' , Peschl applies concepts from neuroscience and genetics .
Representation can now be described as trajectories in activation and synaptic weight spaces , and genetic drift accounts for the creation of scientific knowledge and its paradigmatic changes .
Such a cognitive foundation of science characterizes scientific activity as extracting regularities from experience , predicting and manipulating .
However , in an epilogue , Peschl is sceptical about whether a purely quantitative - functionalist view can indeed tell the ' full story ' and explain the intellectual satisfaction of doing science .
He attributes this lack of a ' deep ' understanding in traditional science to the fact that by measuring and computing the effects of a phenomenon under investigation , the description of these effects are confused with the phenomenon itself .
One possible answer to this fundamental question is provided by RC and Glasersfeld 's notion of ' function fit ' .
In contrast to a pure instrumentalist perspective , RC emphasizes that whatever theory is able to ' fit ' the ' data ' must also be embedded in the conceptual network of the scientist .
As solutions to ( scientific ) problems arise from this network , they not only allow for predictions but also for explanations which are characterized as relations to the conceptual network .
Finally , an important potential area of application of RC are technical disciplines which heavily borrow from natural sciences , such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) and artificial life .
In Riegler ( 1992 ) I have provided early sketches of how the design of artifacts can or should be guided by principles of RC .
Tom Ziemke 's paper furnishes an extensive account on this topic .
The lengthy paper unrolls the problems of AI on the backdrop of realism , which is somewhat surprisingly the mainstream view in this field .
The difficulties arise from the fact that AI has focused on human - constructed formal - computational devices which can be interpreted as models of cognition only through an observer .
But they cannot be considered cognitive on their own stand .
In order to overcome those problems , Ziemke introduces the concepts of ' situatedness ' and ' embodiment ' , as they have been defined within the alternative ' New AI ' movement .
The basic idea here is that artifacts ( robots ) are in direct interaction with their environment , such that their actions are part of a dynamic with the world .
Ziemke argues with Uexküll , Maturana and Varela that even a New AI cannot fulfill the goal of creating cognitive artifacts as long as it is committed to heteronomous computationalism .
In part two of these journal issues ( Foundations of Science , volume 6 , number 2 ) , three authors discuss the relevance of RC to physics .
Since the early days of modern science , physics has played a dominant role and has been a model for other disciplines as it is the incarnation of exact science .
Physics is about measuring exactly , and applying the strict framework of mathematics to solving problems .
However , when it comes to re-examining the physical world - view , one has to notice that physics fails to recognize the constructivist content of any human - erected cognitive scaffold , including physics .
So writes Weinberg ( 1998 ) , " What drives us onward in the work of science is precisely the sense that there are truths out there to be discovered , truths that once discovered will form a permanent part of human knowledge . "
And although physics is no longer in the state of employing a mechanist world - view with rigid causal relationships , the insights gained in quantum physics have not led to an acknowledgment of its constructivist nature .
Why , thus , is physics still a domain of realists ?
Indeed , in his article , Helmut Schwegler expresses a certain amount of skepticism about whether RC can also address the domain of exact and objective science .
He argues that all science including physics is basically a language game in the sense of Wittgenstein , i.e. , scientists communicate via language and work via these communications .
But in order to play this language game correctly one does n't need to adopt the RC world - view .
This calls for a deeper inquiry into scientific activity .
Certainly , Schwegler mainly addresses the social aspects of the scientific community .
It is clear that the support within the community obeys entirely different laws than the ways a single scientist comes up with a new idea .
One may come up with a bad idea and nevertheless find acknowledgment within the community simply because one is a good ' language - player ' .
Therefore , the article triggers a series of interesting questions which still have to be solved .
Does the old distinction of Reichenbach between context of discovery and context of justification ( in Schwegler 's case : within the community ) still hold ?
Is science about satisfying the needs of the prevailing community , or is it a tool of self - erkenntnis , as Peschl asks in his paper ?
As for the influence of the epistemological background on scientific practice , Stewart vehemently negates its irrelevance .
He argues that this dimension of reflexivity is not just metaphysically , but also scientifically relevant .
Following a proposal by Schwegler ( personal communication ) , we could draw the analogy of a shoemaker before and after having read RC literature .
In the ' realist mode ' the shoemaker will stick to the principles of shoemaking which are believed to be true .
The RC shoemaker , on the contrary , will more flexibility adopt alternative approaches as for him the commitment to a hypothetical truth is no longer an essential criterion ( Dewey Dykstra , personal communication ) .
If this analogy is correct , then one of the advantages of an RC - biased science certainly has more potential to come up with new solutions .
Science is a form of cognitive activity .
Thus one should expect to find similarities between the evolution of both .
Gerhard Grössing 's contribution is the attempt to parallel the development of cognition , and the progress of physics in general .
His paper takes us into a domain which attracts an increasing number of scientists , the problem of consciousness , and how it relates to the evolution of physics .
His arguments are largely based on the work of Roland Fischer who presented a cartography of states of consciousness some 30 years ago .
Grössing argues that the emergence of new invariants in reality and physical theory construction correlates with moving towards increasing arousal ( measured as the desynchronization of EEG amplitudes ) on the perception - hallucination continuum onto which states of consciousness are mapped .
Moving along the continuum means to go from the I of the objectified physical world to the Self of personal experience  a hint of how to reconcile realism and RC .
Certainly further research has to be undertaken on this promising subject .
The main idea in Grössing 's paper  the perceived non-classical structure of space and time in relativistic cases is not objective in the sense of realism but rather a human specific artifact based on neurophysiological processes  links directly to the last paper in the physics section .
Olaf Diettrich offers us a reinterpretation of physical results in the light of the theory of cognitive operators , and delivers as such support for a non-trivial constructivism from a physics point of view .
Diettrich 's theory starts with the insight that " properties are defined as invariants of measurement devices " , i.e. , that certain notions in physics can no longer be defined independent of the measurement .
Diettrich now claims that structures of observations also have to be seen as results of measurements of the cognitive operators in the mind .
The crucial point is that observation can only be understood as invariants of these cognitive measuring devices .
Therefore , they are strictly human - specific , and do not represent independent ontological elements of an outside reality .
The notion of truth can no longer be used as a criterion to evaluate physical theories .
Instead theory - building must seek for consistency .
This leads to the RC - typical circularity as mentioned above .
Furthermore , the fact that different set of cognitive operators brings forth a different cognitive phenotype makes it virtually impossible to communicate with beings equipped with that alternative operators .
However , such beings do not necessarily have a less consistent or efficient world - view .
Diettrich goes even a step further when drawing the conclusion that there is a homology between the mechanisms generating mathematical terms and those generating observational ones .
That mathematical equations fit physical observations so well would then no longer be surprising .
Diettrich also vehemently rejects the view of evolutionary epistemology according to which to evolutionary success of a species is linked to a match between reality and the body - plan or cognitive capabilities of the species in question ( cf. Glasersfeld 's distinction between ' match ' and ' fit ' ) .
The concept of ' reality ' is only brought about as a ' shortcut ' in order to secure observations against doubts in situations when quick action is required .
It may thus be regarded as ' cognitive burden ' .
In Schwegler 's paper the topic of science education was already briefly mentioned .
Certainly , science education shapes the reasoning of the later scientist .
Revealing the processes by which we ' gain knowledge ' is of outmost importance if we want to improve the working of science in total .
The contribution by Bernard Scott devotes space to this topic and focuses on a domain - independent theory of conversation which was originally developed by Gordon Pask , and further elaborated by others .
From an RC point of view , communication  especially between a teacher ( someone who has learned already ) to a student ( someone who starts to learn or is still learning )  deals with the apparent paradox that we as epistemological solipsists living in our ' bubble of experiences ' have to communicate with others who are in the same situation .
RC denies the possibility of exchanging information like pieces of chocolate , as von Glasersfeld puts it .
Likewise , science education cannot be built on the royal road to learning either .
Scott 's ' constructivist learning ' is taken to depend on the relation between what is to be learned and what is learned .
This relation may take on different forms .
It may be of a representational nature ( both are structurally the same ) , or of an analogical nature ( in which case what is learned has to be ' coherent ' ) , or both may serve to effectuate the same tasks or actions .
The last contribution of this issue is concerned with the question of how we can explain knowledge - growth from an RC perspective .
The SR point of view teaches us that the boundaries of what is thinkable is determined by the structures of ( classical ) logics .
As Gardenförs ( 1994 ) , among others , shows , this classical logical approach to rational reasoning cannot account for everything .
The critique addresses foremost the traditional distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification as introduced by Hans Reichenbach ( 1938 ) and further elaborated in the writings of Sir Karl Popper .
While for Popper justification could be handled by logical deductions ( falsification ) he failed to find an explanation for discovery .
Hans Rudi Fischer 's contribution picks up the critical opinion regarding the limitations of classical logics .
He argues that the attempt to exclude illogicality must necessarily be illogical itself .
By ' illogical reasoning ' he refers to Charles Sanders Peirce 's formulation of abduction .
Fischer argues that , from an RC perspective , only through abduction scientists may arrive at new insights .
Abductive inferences also change the semantics of a conceptual system by introducing new relations amongst the entities of the conceptual network that could not be seen before .
Fischer ties this insight to the event of scientific revolutions which take place when new hypotheses erected through abduction are confirmed by induction .
Conclusion
The contributions make clear : From a RC perspective the purpose of science is not to seek for truth or to map out ' reality ' .
There is no justification for an exclusive claim of objectivity .
As I have shown this is n't necessary anyway .
Glasersfeld points out that science is the attempt to make sense in the manifold of experiences , to look out for regularities .
As scientists we do this with greater rigor than in everyday situations , but this is a gradual rather than fundamental difference .
At both ends of the continuum of common - sense and scientific cognition we employ a set of mental scaffolds .
Scaffolds guide us in what we perceive and how we reason .
Since " neither problems nor solutions are ontological entities , but arise out of particular ways of constructing " ( Glasersfeld 1991 b , p. 27 ) , experiences must fit into the current web of knowledge in order to make sense  a fact which is stressed by the constructivism movement in education .
And it has consequences for questions of representation , communication , and language .
Words can no longer be considered carriers of informations but triggers of a mutual interpretation and communication process .
Clearly , this has profound implications for scientific language as well .
To speak of a universal scientific language which anchors in an external reality cannot be justified .
RC also suggests that we move away from epistemology , i.e. , asking What is knowledge ? , to the mechanisms of knowledge construction .
We are not passively flooded by information from the outside .
Rather , as RC suggests , we actively construct our world .
Therefore , we can expect deeper insights in scientific model building from advanced findings in the cognitive sciences .
The constructivist view of science goes beyond the conception of instrumentalism which acknowledges only the utility of theories as science as sole raison d'être .
The mental constructions in a scientist 's mind form an operationally closed system .
No semantics from an outside reality intrudes upon them .
Rather than referring to the metaphysical ( and possibly science - impeding ) concept of a mind - independent reality , these mental constructs create meaning by relating to each other .
Finding appropriate pieces in this puzzle game is the ultimate drive to go on with scientific inquiry .
Critics of RC often conclude that because knowledge is constructed , the mind is in principle free to construct anything it wants .
We must not forget that constructions are historical assemblies .
The historical aspect imposes a hierarchical organization in which more recent additions build on older ones .
Such a hierarchy causes mutual dependencies and thus canalization among its components .
It severely restricts the degrees of freedom in the way constructions can be accomplished , as described by the Limitations of Construction Postulate .
Therefore , the constructions of the mind cannot be arbitrary .
It would be wrong to say that RC was an already fully developed theory .
The contributions show that there are still many open questions which are subject to further investigations and argumentations .
In this sense , RC does not only offer a new world - view which  propelled by the problems of realism in many recent developments in science such as cognitive science and quantum physics  has the potential to lead to significantly better results in science ( not to mention science education as well ) .
Radical constructivism is , as its name suggests , consistent in its claim of applying the idea of viable constructions also to itself rather than proposing a dogmatic world - view .
Borrowing the best from both sides  the rigor of the scientific method and the undogmatic characteristic  radical constructivist science is equipped with the possibility of carrying research into new and promising realms .

Footnotes
The constructivism propagated here is to be distinguished from the social constructivism movement , e.g. , Knorr - Cetina ( 1981 ) , Latour ( 1987 ) .
The latter claims that ( scientific ) knowledge does not arise within cognizing individuals or within nature but is socially constituted .
See http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/ for a collection of papers and other RC - related material that is available on the world wide web .
However , this does not say that our constructions are arbitrary .
See the " Limitations of Construction Postulate " below .
Let us not forget that the word ' fact ' derives from Latin ' facere ' = ' to make ' .
In this regard , the aforementioned motto " verum ipsum factum " of Vico gains distinctness .
An agent , natural or artificial , has to be the artificer of the concepts used .
While we  as designer of artificial life models  would like , let 's say , the upper left pixel on the computer screen to be a food pill for the pixel in the lower right corner representing the cognitive creature , this is not necessarily the case from the perspective of the creature and its cognitive apparatus .
Likewise , the relevance for RC - based education becomes evident .
The teacher cannot expect the student knowing facts in the same way as she does ; a fact has to be ' made ' , i.e. , constructed from components of the existing conceptual network .
Finally , Paul Watzlawick ( 1990 ) applies this insight to family therapy .
While a realism - based therapy would want the patient to adapt to the true matter of affairs , his approach focuses on a viable consensus among all participants .
This consensus has to be constructed by the patients ( by ' reframing ' a habitual situation ) rather than specified a priori .
This is to be contrasted to formal logical systems in which a set of axioms is introduced a priori , and which serve as a truth criterion .
Postulated statements are logically true if they can be derived from the axioms .
This does not mean that RC is in favor of tautologies .
Rather , the conceptual network in the mind is considered to be without a ' beginning ' or ' ending ' since its relational structure has developed with a bootstrapping process that allows only self - referential links .
In the absence of external references other criteria for checking the validity of proposed theories must be pulled up .
Such yardsticks are consistency , coherence , and richness of referential concepts involved .
Tautologies are thus to be rejected on grounds of these criteria .
The adjective ' radical ' ( lat. radix = root ) is used in the sense of ' thoroughly consistent ' ( rather than ' extreme ' ) .
In this sense , RC is also different from other constructivist movements in science such as the ' Erlangen Constructivism ' ( Janich 1993 ) which wants to avoid the RC - typical circularity .
It tries to explain science from the perspective of unconditional linguistic constructions .
Its proponents maintain that science can be reduced to a ' proto - science ' which , in turn , is defined in terms of a pre-scientific common - sense vocabulary .
However , such an argumentation not only drives an ( unjustified ) wedge between scientific and common - sense reasoning , it also cannot account for the construction of common - sense knowledge .
Note that such a mutant is lethal not because of environmental selection  again , we could imagine that pigs with wings have an edge over normal pigs  , but because of interferences among physiological structures during early developmental stages ( i.e. , the epigenesis ) of the animal .
See arguments against the correspondence principle in the previous section .
Evidently , this makes it difficult to understand subjectivity as a cognitive phenomenon when the only way to investigate certain phenomena is introspection .
From this perspective the claim seems to be justified to say that not all our experiences can be tackled by science .
See also Peschl 's paper .
For postmodernist authors , for example , to whom ' text ' is everything , explicitly quoting others seems to be enough rigor .
See the ' Sokal affair ' ( Sokal 1996 ) as a demonstration .
Already Thomas Kuhn ( 1962 ) claimed that it is not desirable to teach future scientists accurate history .
As Martin Klein ( 1972 ) points out , philosophers and historians of science on the one hand and science teachers on the other hand do n't have necessarily common purposes .
However , leaving out all history does n't solve the problem either since an ahistorical perspective even reinforces the impression of a mind independent existence of natural laws .
Maturana reminds us that " everything said is said by an observer to another observer that could be him - or herself . "
( Maturana 1988 , p. 27 ) .
This is not to say that the scientific world - view is ' more true ' than others .
To claim that something is more true than something else means to neglect a basic principles of RC , namely the self - applicability of its findings .
As Glasersfeld ( 1991a , p.13 ) puts it , " I would be contradicting one of the basic principles of my own theory if I were to claim that the constructivist approach proved a true description of an objective state of affairs ...
[ I ]ts values will depend mainly on its usefulness in our experimental world " .
" A living system , due to its circular organization , is an inductive system and functions always in a predictive manner ; what occurred once will occur again .
Its organization ( both genetic and otherwise ) is conservative and repeats only that which works . "
( Maturana 1980 , p. 39 ) Already in 1957 , Max Jammer demanded : " As a result of modern research in physics , the ambition and hope [...] that physical science could offer a photographic picture and true image of reality had to be abandoned . "

Kathleen Hanna , feminist role model , former Bikini Kill frontwoman and current member of Le Tigre , went on GRITtv to talk about the future of feminism , riot grrrl and , because this is now a requirement for every public figure , John Mayer .

The interview covers a lot of ground we 've covered before - from the difficulties of being a woman in the 90s punk scene to the recent acquisition of Hanna 's papers by the NYU library - but there are some interesting soundbites .
Take , for example , her opinion on John Mayer and Miley Cyrus :
Feminist Sweepstakes Kathleen Hanna , she of Bikini Kill , Le Tigre , and awesome feminist fame , has donated her zines , … Read more
I just think that that stuff is crap .
I just do n't care about it .
There is so much good art and literature and music to choose from that it is great if that stuff has n't been invaded by creepy people and ruined .
I just want to read great books and go to great shows ...
I actually have not been listening to that much music .
I 've been on a break .

She is a little less dismissive of the blogosphere , which interviewer Laura Flanders suggests can be read as the logical evolution of zines and zine - culture .
Hanna rightly argues that zines paved the way with their ephemeral , DIY - nature .
There is also a sense of immediacy to zines , which applies to blogs .
Hanna describes the creation of zines as " frantic , very much in keeping with the punk rock sensibility , and in a way , the arrogance of youth . "
However ,
The thing that 's different between blogging and zines is that zines were supposed to be historical ...
They existed in this one specific time period .
And the thing I sometimes do n't like about blogs is that they are can seem really ahistorical ...
And I like the objectness .

Although blogs have n't entirely replaced zines , there is a continued movement away from messy , tangible object - ness of pen and paper and toward the borrowed - polish of blogs .
While zines are , by nature , sort of unprofessional in appearance - unless you make an active effort to avoid it , they show all the staples and glue smears of production - the websites that host blogs automatically lend a standardized neatness to the work that runs counter to the Riot Grrrrl aesthetic .
But I personally feel that the long - reaching arm of the internet makes it all worth it , especially since it provides a platform from which multiple feminist leaders can emerge .
And on the topic of feminism : Hanna obviously has n't stopped growing , both as a feminist and as a musician , and she is unafraid to reflect on this shift .
In a moment of self - reflection , she discusses the pitfalls of her earlier brand of politics :
I think when I was in my 20s I got really caught up in some horizontal oppression stuff , some petty intrigues , at the expense of real productive dialogue ...
I mean , a lot of arguments that were based in semantics more than action , and people 's insecurities being played off as though they were political dialogues when really they were just personal things that were recast in a political light as a way to gain power for themselves .

Hanna 's criticism is just vague enough that it still appears relevant .
There is still a tendency to become bogged down in personal wars and enter into skirmishes about the " real " meaning of feminism , and whether or not one is allowed to refer to themselves as a feminist ( I am , of course , partially referring to the whole Linda Hirshman brouhaha ) .
Another criticism Hanna levels modern feminism has to do with the lack of leadership .
When asked about " Hillary Clinton , Sarah Palin , all the talk about post - feminism , " Hanna replies :
I 'm so sick of the post - feminism thing .
It 's ridiculous .
I want more interesting leaders .
I think it is really hard for feminist women who are also interested in challenging all kinds of oppression is that we 're freaked out about leadership , so there 's not more interesting leaders .
A lot of times we kill off our leaders , I mean not just because we 're women , but we 're in a culture where we create products and we destroy those products .
The same way that we lift people up - it 's the kill your idols syndrome ...
We get all picky about everything .
I wish there were more feminist leaders to choose from , more variety .
Advertisement
Leaving aside the comments on consumer culture , this is where I stopped following Hanna .
The idea that the feminist movement is lacking interesting leaders and faces feels wrong .
Maybe this is a sentiment born in part from her disinterest in blogs , but there are plenty of great feminist leaders out there , from Hillary Clinton to Nancy Keenan , Barbara Boxer and even Barack Obama , and we 're not even going to begin listing all the great feminist writers ( but do n't forget our favorite cartoon feminist hero , Lisa Simpson ! ) .
We also recently saw the launch of fbomb , a blog for the younger feminists , and XY , a site for pro-feminist men .
Perhaps most annoying is the idea that part of the reason we destroy our own idols has to do with the fact that , as women , we 're too picky .
The squabbles of feminist writers may occasionally tend toward self - promotion rather than activism , but it seems that for the most part we want to support our leaders .
And annoying as it may be , the battles between feminists are the result ( at least partially ) of a multiplicity of ideas and contrasting viewpoints .
Maybe the problem has less to do with tearing down idols , but the very fact that we build them in the first place .
But at least Hanna seems to have a pretty good grasp on what it means to be a real life , effective role model : " my whole joke was that I 'd rather be a Rollerblade model ...
If I am a role model , I want to be a really three dimensional model . "

Sucks .
When asked about Obama ’s plan ( without being given any details about what the legislation includes ) , 49 percent opposed it and 40 percent were in favor .
But after hearing key features of the legislation described , 48 percent supported the plan and 43 percent remained opposed .
The NEWSWEEK Poll asked respondents about eight health - care - reform provisions that Obama and many Democrats in Congress have generally supported .
It found that the majority of Americans supported five of those provisions , three by particularly large margins .
Eighty - one percent agreed with the creation of a new insurance marketplace , the exchange , for individual subscribers to compare plans and buy insurance at a competitive rate .
Seventy - six percent thought health insurers should be required to cover anyone who applies , including those with preexisting conditions ; and 75 percent agreed with requiring most businesses to offer health insurance to their employees , with incentives for small - business owners to do so .
It ’s clearly not the details of the plan that ’s the problem if , when people hear about it , they like it .
Hell , 70 % of the American people liked the public option .
But the White House , for whatever reason , refused to do anything to push for its passage .
And now , large majorities like many of the major details in the remaining Senate and House plans .
So what ’s the problem ?
The same problem that leads only 6 % of the American people to believe that the stimulus created any jobs ( it did , according to CBO and every other authoritative study ) .

As for mean and nasty , does anyone remember Newt Gingrich in the 90s ?
The only thing that ’s changed this time around is that , for some reason , Democrats in the White House and the Hill have lost their ability , or willingness , to fight back .

Guest Commentary by Jim Bouldin ( UC Davis )
How much additional carbon dioxide will be released to , or removed from , the atmosphere , by the oceans and the biosphere in response to global warming over the next century ?
That is an important question , and David Frank and his Swiss coworkers at WSL have just published an interesting new approach to answering it .
They empirically estimate the distribution of gamma , the temperature - induced carbon dioxide feedback to the climate system , given the current state of the knowledge of reconstructed temperature , and carbon dioxide concentration , over the last millennium .
It is a macro - scale approach to constraining this parameter ; it does not attempt to refine our knowledge about carbon dioxide flux pathways , rates or mechanisms .
Regardless of general approach or specific results , I like studies like this .
They bring together results from actually or potentially disparate data inputs and methods , which can be hard to keep track of , into a systematic framework .
By organizing , they help to clarify , and for that there is much to be said .
Gamma has units in ppmv per ºC .
It is thus the inverse of climate sensitivity , where CO2 is the forcing and T is the response .
Carbon dioxide can , of course , act as both a forcing and a ( relatively slow ) feedback ; slow at least when compared to faster feedbacks like water vapor and cloud changes .
Estimates of the traditional climate sensitivity , e.g. Charney et al. , ( 1979 ) are thus not affected by the study .
Estimates of more broadly defined sensitivities that include slower feedbacks , ( e.g. Lunt et al. ( 2010 ) , Pagani et al. ( 2010 ) ) , could be however .
Existing estimates of gamma come primarily from analyses of coupled climate - carbon cycle ( C4 ) models ( analyzed in Friedlingstein et al. , 2006 ) , and a small number of empirical studies .
The latter are based on a limited set of assumptions regarding historic temperatures and appropriate methods , while the models display a wide range of sensitivities depending on assumptions inherent to each .
Values of gamma are typically positive in these studies ( i.e. increased T => increased CO2 ) .
To estimate gamma , the authors use an experimental ( “ ensemble ” ) calibration approach , by analyzing the time courses of reconstructed Northern Hemisphere T estimates , and ice core CO2 levels , from 1050 to 1800 , AD .
This period represents a time when both high resolution T and CO2 estimates exist , and in which the confounding effects of other possible causes of CO2 fluxes are minimized , especially the massive anthropogenic input since 1800 .
That input could completely swamp the temperature signal ; the authors ’ choice is thus designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting the T signal on CO2 .
The T estimates are taken from the recalibration of nine proxy - based studies from the last decade , and the CO2 from 3 Antarctic ice cores .
Northern Hemisphere T estimates are used because their proxy sample sizes ( largely dendro - based ) are far higher than in the Southern Hemisphere .
However , the results are considered globally applicable , due to the very strong correlation between hemispheric and global T values in the instrumental record ( their Figure S3 , r = 0.96 , HadCRUT basis ) , and also of ice core and global mean atmospheric CO2 .
The authors systematically varied both the proxy T data sources and methodologicalvariables that influence gamma , and then examined the distribution of the nearly 230,000 resulting values .
The varying data sources include the nine T reconstructions ( Fig 1 ) , while the varying methods include things like the statistical smoothing method , and the time intervals used to both calibrate the proxy T record against the instrumental record , and to estimate gamma .
Figure 1 .
The nine temperature reconstructions ( a ) , and 3 ice core CO2 records ( b ) , used in the study .
Some other variables were fixed , most notably the calibration method relating the proxy and instrumental temperatures ( via equalization of the mean and variance for each , over the chosen calibration interval ) .
The authors note that this approach is not only among the mathematically simplest , but also among the best at retaining the full variance ( Lee et al , 2008 ) , and hence the amplitude , of the historic T record .
This is important , given the inherent uncertainty in obtaining a T signal , even with the above - mentioned considerations regarding the analysis period chosen .
They chose the time lag , ranging up to +/- 80 years , which maximized the correlation between T and CO2 .
This was to account for the inherent uncertainty in the time scale , and even the direction of causation , of the various physical processes involved .
They also estimated the results that would be produced from 10 C4 models analyzed by Friedlingstein ( 2006 ) , over the same range of temperatures ( but shorter time periods ) .
So what did they find ?
In the highlighted result of the work , the authors estimate the mean and median of gamma to be 10.2 and 7.7 ppm/ºC respectively , but , as indicated by the difference in the two , with a long tail to the right ( Fig. 2 ) .
The previous empirical estimates , by contrast , come in much higher –about 40 ppm/ degree .
The choice of the proxy reconstruction used , and the target time period analyzed , had the largest effect on the estimates .
The estimates from the ten C4 models , were higher on average ; it is about twice as likely that the empirical estimates fall in the model estimates ?
lower quartile as in the upper .
Still , six of the ten models evaluated produced results very close to the empirical estimates , and the models ’ range of estimates does not exclude those from the empirical methods .
Figure 2 . Distribution of gamma .
Red values are from 1050 - 1550 , blue from 1550 - 1800 .
Are these results cause for optimism regarding the future ?
Well the problem with knowing the future , to flip the famous Niels Bohr quote , is that it involves prediction .
The question is hard to answer .
Empirically oriented studies are inherently limited in applicability to the range of conditions they evaluate .
As most of the source reconstructions used in the study show , there is no time period between 1050 and 1800 , including the medieval times , which equals the global temperature state we are now in ; most of it is not even close .
We are in a no-analogue state with respect to mechanistic , global - scale understanding of the inter- relationship of the carbon cycle and temperature , at least for the last two or three million years .
And no-analogue states are generally not a real comfortable place to be , either scientifically or societally .
Still , based on these low estimates of gamma , the authors suggest that surprises over the next century may be unlikely .
The estimates are supported by the fact that more than half of the C4 - based ( model ) results were quite close ( within a couple of ppm ) to the median values obtained from the empirical analysis , although the authors clearly state that the shorter time periods that the models were originally run over makes apples to apples comparisons with the empirical results tenuous .
Still , this result may be evidence that the carbon cycle component of these models have , individually or collectively , captured the essential physics and biology needed to make them useful for predictions into the multi-decadal future .
Also , some pre-1800 , temperature independent CO2 fluxes could have contributed to the observed CO2 variation in the ice cores , which would tend to exaggerate the empirically - estimated values .
The authors did attempt to control for the effects of land use change , but noted that modeled land use estimates going back 1000 years are inherently uncertain .
Choosing the time lag that maximizes the T to CO2 correlation could also bias the estimates high .
On the other hand , arguments could also be made that the estimates are low .
Figure 2 shows that the authors also performed their empirical analyses within two sub-intervals ( 1050 - 1550 , and 1550 - 1800 ) .
Not only did the mean and variance differ significantly between the two ( mean / s.d. of 4.3/3.5 versus 16.1/12.5 respectively ) , but the R squared values of the many regressions were generally much higher in the late period than in the early ( their Figure S6 ) .
Given that the proxy sample size for all temperature reconstructions generally drops fairly drastically over the past millennium , especially before their 1550 dividing line , it seems at least reasonably plausible that the estimates from the later interval are more realistic .
The long tail –the possibility of much higher values of gamma–also comes mainly from the later time interval , so values of gamma from say 20 to 60 ppm / ºC ( e.g. Cox and Jones , 2008 ) certainly cannot be excluded .
But this wrangling over likely values may well be somewhat moot , given the real world situation .
Even if the mean estimates as high as say 20 ppm / ºC are more realistic , this feedback rate still does not compare to the rate of increase in CO2 resulting from fossil fuel burning , which at recent rates would exceed that amount in between one and two decades .
I found some other results of this study interesting .
One such involved the analysis of time lags .
The authors found that in 98.5 % of their regressions , CO2 lagged temperature .
There will undoubtedly be those who interpret this as evidence that CO2 cannot be a driver of temperature , a common misinterpretation of the ice core record .
Rather , these results from the past millennium support the usual interpretation of the ice core record over the later Pleistocene , in which CO2 acts as a feedback to temperature changes initiated by orbital forcings ( see e.g. the recent paper by Ganopolski and Roche ( 2009 ) ) .
The study also points up the need , once again , to further constrain the carbon cycle budget .
The fact that a pre-1800 time period had to be used to try to detect a signal indicates that this type of analysis is not likely to be sensitive enough to figure out how , or even if , gamma is changing in the future .
The only way around that problem is via tighter constraints on the various pools and fluxes of the carbon cycle , especially those related to the terrestrial component .
There is much work to be done there .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has won reexamination of an illegitimate patent on voice - over - Internet protocol ( VoIP ) that could cripple the adoption of new VoIP technologies .
A company named Acceris Communications Technologies , now C2 Communications Technologies , was awarded the bogus patent for hardware , software , and processes for implementing VoIP using analog telephones as endpoints -- covering many telephone calls made over the Internet .
EFF and the law firm Fenwick & West LLP filed a reexamination request showing that both a prior patent and published reference materials described the underlying technology long before Acceris made its claim .
Today the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) granted EFF 's reexamination request , ruling that there were substantial new questions of patentability .
" Our American patent system is meant to encourage invention and innovation , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" Undeserved patents instead serve to quash competition and hurt business and consumers . "
" We are pleased that the USPTO agrees with the substantial new questions of patentability raised in EFF 's request , and we look forward to the USPTO 's ultimate decision on this patent , " said Nikhil Iyengar of Fenwick & West .
The challenge to this patent is part of EFF's Patent Busting Project , which combats the chilling effects of bad patents on the public and consumer interests .
So far eight patents targeted by EFF have been busted , invalidated , narrowed , or had a reexamination granted by the Patent Office .

Ken Block is one of the fastest growing faces of an American in motorsports today .
After making it big in the skateboarding world selling sneakers and apparel , Ken quietly decided to get into rally racing .
In the past few years Ken has helped bring that electric type of racing to the mainstream , winning X - Games medals , performing all kinds of amazing stunts and becoming a YouTube sensation along the way .
Next year he moves up to the big leagues to race in the WRC and compete against the world ’s best .
So how does Ken relax before a big season of sliding through mud at 100 mph on a road as wide as a shoelace ?
He drives his Subaru Impreza WRX STI to Utah for some snowboarding .
You see , to Ken Block , an STI is a Swiss Army knife .
It can rally , drive a snowboard park , clear 100 foot gaps and run a Gymkhana course .
His Subaru probably even has a slot for tweezers .
Now Ken Block has decided to make the world ’s fastest snow - cat .
Essentially this is a competition - ready Subaru STI mounted on a set of snow - cat tracks instead of tires .
It was prepared by Vermont SportsCar , the same shop that builds all of the Monster Team ’s rally cars .
It has a 400 hp , 2.5L turbo engine and a 5 speed gearbox .
Some serious shocks had to be put in to make room for the tracks .
The final result is the beast of a car you see here .
Clearly this new method of driving did n’t slow down the car much because the Subaru TRAX STI absolutely rips .
What Ken Block does in the snow had me amazed and laughing the whole time .
The car floats through powder like it ’s swimming through whipped cream , yet it ’s going too fast to seem possible .
It carves S turns while never seeming to falter .
And then on the packed stuff , it ’s like a normal STI , power - sliding around snowy bends .
It looks insane , intimidating , ridiculous , and awesome .
And there is even a Santa Claus - style sleigh for brave passengers willing to come along for the ride .

We 've made the leap from resistive to capacitive touchscreens that are more accurate — and multitouchy — so what 's next ?
Screens that feel how hard you tickle them .

One of several approaches to making that happen uses a quantum tunneling composite — quantum tunneling happens when you bring two conductors close together , but with an insulating layer still between them , and electrons jump between the two conductors .
Peratech 's way to do this is with a polymer that changes resistance as you apply force for the insulating layer , so that bottom line , screens using this tech can tell how hard you pressing on the screen , since the sensors are able tell within two micrometers of how far in the screen 's bending .
While there 's other tech out there for pressure - sensing screens , Peratech says their tech uses less power and is more sensitive .
The first gadgets with Peratech 's sauce is coming out as early as April , so we 'll able to poke things with that much more intent .

Adam Giambrone will announce next week he 's running for Mayor of Toronto .
In a note sent to supporters earlier today , the current City Councilor for Ward 18 and Chair of the TTC outlined next Monday February 1st as the date he will throw his hat into the ring during a celebration at Revival .
Although the invitation ( pictured below ) asks recipients merely to " Celebrate Toronto , " Giambrone has all but confirmed that such a celebration will serve as the kick - off to his campaign .
When he officially files his papers ( earlier that day ) , it 'll end considerable speculation as to his intentions .
Although critics of the TTC have scoffed at the idea of Giambrone running for mayor , after John Tory revealed he would not enter the race , an Angus Reid - Toronto Star poll put him in second place among the candidates at 17 per cent .
He trailed George Smitherman at 44 per cent and was narrowly ahead of former Liberal strategist Rocco Rossi at 15 per cent .

This year CBS refused to run an ad during the Superbowl from Gay dating site mancrunch.com , saying that it did not meet their standards .

It has been said by many American commentators critical of Israeli policy in the occupied territories that Israel in effect writes U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East .
It is hard to dispute the claim even though on occasion the U.S. does balk at the most outrageous Israeli plans such as its eagerness to bomb Iranian nuclear sites ( the U.S. knows it would n't stop there and a wider war would almost certainly ensue ) .
If any proof were needed one only has to look at the policies of Barack Obama who , it could be argued , is even more sycophantic towards Israel than George Bush was .
Before he was inaugurated as president , Obama made it clear that the enormous military and civilian aid provided by the U.S. -- some $ 2.5 billion a year -- was not on the table .
In other words , before even developing a policy towards Israel , Obama gave up literally the only leverage he had .
And just in case the Israelis were too slow to get the message he followed by allowing Israel to continue building more settlements in the West Bank -- literally the only deal breaker as far as the Palestinians are concerned .
It was an unmistakable message : the U.S. has no intention of pressing for a peace deal and the two - state solution , the focus of bargaining for 20 years , is dead .
It is difficult to imagine a country more accepting than the U.S. of any Israeli policy or bad faith but Stephen Harper and his Israel file manager , Jason Kenney , have shown they can outdo the U.S.
The Harper government appears to develop its policy vis a vis Israel and the Palestinians not from any consideration of Canadian interests in the Middle East or by any reference to the considerable expertise in DFAIT -- the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade .
These normal inputs into foreign policy are simply by - passed and the government seems to simply seek the direction of Frank Dimant , executive vice president of Jewish advocacy group B'Nai Brith .
Every time Canada announces another policy plank -- that is , an attack on any agency or civil society group that ever criticizes Israel -- Dimant is there to congratulate them .
The latest chapter was revealed recently ( following closely on the heels of the attack on Kairos and the elimination of its $ 7 million development budget ) -- the decision by Ottawa to cancel its $ 15 million ( we were the seventh largest donor ) in general fund contributions to UNRWA -- the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East , or UNRWA , alleging strong ties between it and terrorist groups .
Like the claim used to justify the cancellation of funding to Kairos ( that it was a strong advocate of the boycott of Israel ) this claim is vehemently denied by literally everyone close to the situation except , of course , Israel , B'nai Brith and other Israeli lobby groups in Canada .
The government 's own foreign affairs officials have never made such a claim .
CIDA Minister Bev Oda and ( then ) Treasury Board president Vic Toews two weeks ago quietly confirmed that Canada 's would be directing its $ 15 million specifically to " food security " instead of supplementing core funding and the general budget of UNRWA .
According to Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East ( CJPME ) : " UNRWA provides assistance to 4.67 million Palestinian refugees scattered throughout the Middle East and administers programs in the areas of education , health and other social services in 59 Palestinian refugee camps .
The agency operates solely through donations from various organizations and governments .
It is currently under severe financial duress due to the increasing number of Palestinian refugees , the deterioration of their socio- economic level , unemployment and food insecurity . "
The alleged terrorist group that the UN is " tied " to is Hamas -- the duly elected government in the Gaza Strip .
As with the Kairos example , the government presented no evidence of any kind to support its claim .
This put Canada far to the right of even the US which continues to be the second largest funder of UNRWA and flies in the face of the request by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Abbas -- the last real Western hope for a moderate Palestinian leader -- told Canadian parliamentarians in Ottawa last year to continue its funding of UNRWA .
According to NDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar :
" When we met with Abbas here , he was very straightforward with us .
When we asked the classic question , ‘ What can Canada do to help ? ' he said ‘ Stick with your commitments , the commitments that you have made , including UNRWA . '
He was very specific . "
None of this matters to the Harper government .
It listens to Frank Dimant who said of the move : " This is certainly a step in the right direction .
I believe it 's beginning to break out of the mold and the pattern and so I believe it's a very progressive step forward . "
His organization and other Jewish groups have long lobbied for Canada to end funding to UNWRA .
Ironically , people on the ground say that this move will actually have the effect of making Palestinians even more dependent on Hamas which offers similar services to those of UNWRA .
After a weekend of brinksmanship , Amazon.com on Sunday surrendered to a publisher and agreed to raise prices on some electronic books .
Amazon shocked the publishing world late last week by removing direct access to the Kindle editions as well as printed books from Macmillan , one of the country ’s six largest publishers , which had said it planned to begin setting higher consumer prices for e-books .
Until now , Amazon has set e-book prices itself , with $ 9.99 as the default for new releases and best sellers .
But in a statement Sunday afternoon , Amazon said it would accept Macmillan ’s decision .
On Friday , Amazon removed “ buy ” buttons from thousands of titles published by Macmillan , including recent best sellers like “ Wolf Hall ” by Hilary Mantel and “ The Gathering Storm , ” by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson .
Customers who wanted to buy print editions could do so only from third - party sellers .
Digital editions made for Amazon ’s Kindle device disappeared .
In a strongly worded message on its Web site on Sunday , Amazon said that while it disagreed with Macmillan ’s stance , it would bow to the publisher ’s plan .
Transport Minister John Baird says Canada must improve its airline security in the wake of a failed U.S. terror attack -- but he insists that Ottawa is not following the lead of Washington on security issues .
Baird announced Tuesday afternoon that body scanners that can see through the clothes of air travellers will be installed at airports across Canada over the next two months .
Under the new system , travellers who are singled out for extra screening will be able to choose whether they prefer to undergo a pat - down search or to be scanned by trained security staff .
On Wednesday morning , Baird told CTV's Canada AM that Canada chose to pursue the high - tech scanner technology months ago , putting an order in to manufacturers " before the United States were in the queue ... and before some of the countries in Europe . "
" We 're taking the leadership in this .
We have to move quickly and expeditiously , we 're confident that these are the best machines available on the market and they are the only ones recognized by the ( U.S. ) Transportation Security Administration , so that was an important part of our decision , " Baird said during an interview from Ottawa .
The new scanners will be up - and - running only weeks after the failed attempt by an alleged terror suspect to blow up a U.S. - bound airliner on Christmas Day .
Umar Farouk Abdulmatallab , a 23 - year - old Nigerian , is accused of sewing an explosive device into his underwear and attempting to ignite it on a Northwest Airlines flight that was travelling from Amsterdam to Detroit .
He was subdued in the air by flight staff and passengers .
The attack has prompted major criticism from U.S. President Barack Obama who said his country 's security system failed in a " potentially disastrous way . "
Since then , Washington has introduced tough new screening procedures that target airline passengers from 14 countries that are considered to be state sponsors of terrorism , or " countries of interest " to the U.S .
When Baird was asked if the body scanners would have been able to catch the explosive materials involved in the Dec. 25 incident , he told Canada AM that authorities from around the world were carefully reviewing what happened and will " learn from that . "
But he said the scanner technology was in the works well before the events in recent weeks , leaving Canadian authorities well - informed about the practical concerns of implementing them at nationwide airports .
" This is something we 've been working on for about 15 months , " said Baird .
" We did a trial for more than six months in Kelowna , B.C. , and an overwhelming majority of people that use the system preferred it considerably better than a physical pat - down . "
Baird said the scanners are " the only system " that the U.S. Transportation Security Administration recognizes in the United States .
By choosing to employ it north of the border , it will make it easier for Canadians " to come and go across the border as easily as possible , " Baird said .
Moving forward , Ottawa will need to make better use of its intelligence and contacts with its allies " to do everything that we reasonably can to ensure the public 's safety and the security of Canadian families , " Baird said .
He said Ottawa will remain in close contact with Washington , other allies and worldwide aviation officials to tighten security , both now and in the long - run .
" We 've always got to be raising our game , because the terrorists are always going to be changing theirs , " said Baird .

This story first appeared at the TomDispatch website .
The big Afghanistan debate in Washington is not over whether more troops are needed , but just who they should be : Americans or Afghans — Us or Them .
Having just spent time in Afghanistan seeing how things stand , I would n’t bet on Them .
Frankly , I would n’t bet on Us either .
In eight years , American troops have worn out their welcome .
Their very presence now incites opposition , but that ’s another story .
It ’s Them — the Afghans — I want to talk about .
Afghans are Afghans .
They have their own history , their own culture , their own habitual ways of thinking and behaving , all complicated by a modern experience of decades of war , displacement , abject poverty , and incessant meddling by foreign governments near and far — of which the United States has been the most powerful and persistent .
Afghans do not think or act like Americans .
Yet Americans in power refuse to grasp that inconvenient point .
In the heat of this summer , I went out to the training fields near Kabul where Afghan army recruits are put through their paces , and it was quickly evident just what ’s getting lost in translation .
Our trainers , soldiers from the Illinois National Guard , were masterful .
Professional and highly skilled , they were dedicated to carrying out their mission — and doing the job well .
They were also big , strong , camouflaged , combat - booted , supersized American men , their bodies swollen by flack jackets and lashed with knives , handguns , and god only knows what else .
Any American could be proud of their commitment to tough duty .
The Afghans were puny by comparison : Hundreds of little Davids to the overstuffed American Goliaths training them .
Keep in mind : Afghan recruits come from a world of desperate poverty .
They are almost uniformly malnourished and underweight .
Many are no bigger than I am ( 5 ’ 4 ″ and thin ) — and some probably not much stronger .
Like me , many sag under the weight of a standard - issue flack jacket .
Their American trainers spoke of “ upper body strength deficiency ” and prescribed pushups because their trainees buckle under the backpacks filled with 50 pounds of equipment and ammo they are expected to carry .
All this material must seem absurd to men whose fathers and brothers , wearing only the old cotton shirts and baggy pants of everyday life and carrying battered Russian Kalashnikov rifles , defeated the Red Army two decades ago .
American trainers marvel that , freed from heavy equipment and uniforms , Afghan soldiers can run through the mountains all day — as the Taliban guerrillas in fact do with great effect — but the U.S. military is determined to train them for another style of war .
Still , the new recruits turn out for training in the blistering heat in this stony desert landscape wearing , beneath their heavy uniforms , the smart red , green , and black warm - up outfits intended to encourage them to engage in off - duty exercise .
American trainers recognize that recruits regularly wear all their gear at once for fear somebody will steal anything left behind in the barracks , but they take this overdressing as a sign of how much Afghans love the military .
My own reading , based on my observations of Afghan life during the years I ’ve spent in that country , is this :
It ’s a sign of how little they trust one another , or the Americans who gave them the snazzy suits .
I think it also indicates the obvious : that these impoverished men in a country without work have joined the Afghan National Army for what they can get out of it ( and keep or sell ) — and that does n’t include democracy or glory .
In the current policy debate about the Afghan War in Washington , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin wants the Afghans to defend their country .
Senator John McCain , the top Republican on the committee , agrees but says they need even more help from even more Americans .
The common ground — the sacred territory President Obama gropes for — is that , whatever else happens , the U.S. must speed up the training of “ the Afghan security forces . ”
American military planners and policymakers already proceed as if , with sufficient training , Afghans can be transformed into scale - model , wind - up American Marines .
That is not going to happen .
Not now .
Not ever .
No matter how many of our leaders concur that it must happen — and ever faster .
“ Basic Warrior Training ”
So who are these security forces ?
They include the Afghan National Army ( ANA ) and the Afghan National Police ( ANP ) .
International forces and private contractors have been training Afghan recruits for both of them since 2001 .
In fact , the determination of Western military planners to create a national army and police force has been so great that some seem to have suppressed for years the reports of Canadian soldiers who witnessed members of the Afghan security forces engaging in a fairly common pastime , sodomizing young boys .
Current training and mentoring is provided by the U.S. , Great Britain , France , Canada , Romania , Poland , Mongolia , New Zealand , and Australia , as well as by the private for - profit contractors MPRI , KBR ( formerly a division of Halliburton ) , Pulau , Paravant , and RONCO .
Almost eight years and counting since the “ mentoring ” process began , officers at the Kabul Military Training Center report that the army now numbers between 88,000 and 92,000 soldiers , depending on who you talk to ; and the basic training course financed and led by Americans , called “ Basic Warrior Training , ” is turning out 28,800 new soldiers every year , according to a Kabul Military Training Center “ fact sheet . ”
The current projected “ end strength ” for the ANA , to be reached in December 2011 , is 134,000 men ; but Afghan officers told me they ’re planning for a force of 200,000 , while the Western press often cites 240,000 as the final figure .
The number 400,000 is often mentioned as the supposed end - strength quota for the combined security forces — an army of 240,000 soldiers and a police force with 160,000 men .
Yet Afghan National Police officials also speak of a far more inflated figure , 250,000 , and they claim that 149,000 men have already been trained .
Police training has always proven problematic , however , in part because , from the start , the European allies fundamentally disagreed with the Bush administration about what the role of the Afghan police should be .
Germany initiated the training of what it saw as an unarmed force that would direct traffic , deter crime , and keep civic order for the benefit of the civilian population .
The U.S. took over in 2003 , handed the task off to a private for - profit military contractor , DynCorp , and proceeded to produce a heavily armed , undisciplined , and thoroughly venal paramilitary force despised by Kabulis and feared by Afghan civilians in the countryside .
Contradicting that widespread public view , an Afghan commanding officer of the ANP assured me that today the police are trained as police , not as a paramilitary auxiliary of the ANA .
“ But policing is different in Afghanistan , ” he said , because the police operate in active war zones .
Washington sends mixed messages on this subject .
It farms out responsibility for the ANP to a private contractor that hires as mentors retired American law enforcement officers — a Kentucky state trooper , a Texas county lawman , a North Carolina cop , and so on .
Yet Washington policymakers continue to couple the police with the army as “ the Afghan security forces ” — the most basic police rank is “ soldier ” — in a merger that must influence what DynCorp puts in its training syllabus .
At the Afghan National Police training camp outside Kabul , I watched a squad of trainees learn ( reluctantly ) how to respond to a full - scale ambush .
Though they were armed only with red rubber Kalashnikovs , the exercise looked to me much like the military maneuvers I ’d witnessed at the army training camp .
Like army training , police training , too , was accelerated months ago to insure “ security ” during the run-up to the presidential election .
With that goal in mind , DynCorp mentors shrunk the basic police training course from eight weeks to three , after which the police were dispatched to villages all across the country , including areas controlled by the Taliban .
After the election , the surviving short - course police “ soldiers ” were to be brought back to Kabul for the rest of the basic training program .
There ’s no word yet on how many returned .
You have to wonder about the wisdom of rushing out this half - baked product .
How would you feel if the police in your community were turned loose , heavily armed , after three weeks of training ?
And how would you feel if you were given a three - week training course with a rubber gun and then dispatched , with a real one , to defend your country ?
Training security forces is not cheap .
So far , the estimated cost of training and mentoring the police since 2001 is at least $ 10 billion .
Any reliable figure on the cost of training and mentoring the Afghan army since 2001 is as invisible as the army itself .
But the U.S. currently spends some $ 4 billion a month on military operations in Afghanistan .
The Invisible Men
What is there to show for all this remarkably expensive training ?
Although in Washington they may talk about the 90,000 soldiers in the Afghan National Army , no one has reported actually seeing such an army anywhere in Afghanistan .
When 4,000 U.S. Marines were sent into Helmand Province in July to take on the Taliban in what is considered one of its strongholds , accompanying them were only about 600 Afghan security forces , some of whom were police .
Why , you might ask , did n’t the ANA , 90,000 strong after eight years of training and mentoring , handle Helmand on its own ?
No explanation has been offered .
American and NATO officers often complain that Afghan army units are simply not ready to “ operate independently , ” but no one ever speaks to the simple question :
Where are they ?
My educated guess is that such an army simply does not exist .
It may well be true that Afghan men have gone through some version of “ Basic Warrior Training ” 90,000 times or more .
When I was teaching in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2006 , I knew men who repeatedly went through ANA training to get the promised Kalashnikov and the pay .
Then they went home for a while and often returned some weeks later to enlist again under a different name .
In a country where 40 % of men are unemployed , joining the ANA for 10 weeks is the best game in town .
It relieves the poverty of many families every time the man of the family goes back to basic training , but it ’s a needlessly complicated way to unintentionally deliver such minimal humanitarian aid .
Some of these circulating soldiers are aging former mujahidin — the Islamist fundamentalists the U.S. once paid to fight the Soviets — and many are undoubtedly Taliban .
American trainers have taken careful note of the fact that , when ANA soldiers were given leave after basic training to return home with their pay , they generally did n’t come back .
To foil paycheck scams and decrease soaring rates of desertion , they recently devised a money - transfer system that allows the soldiers to send pay home without ever leaving their base .
That sounds like a good idea , but like many expensive American solutions to Afghan problems , it misses the point .
It ’s not just the money the soldier wants to transfer home , it ’s himself as well .
Earlier this year , the U.S. training program became slightly more compelling with the introduction of a U.S. - made weapon , the M - 16 rifle , which was phased in over four months as a replacement for the venerable Kalashnikov .
Even U.S. trainers admit that , in Afghanistan , the Kalashnikov is actually the superior weapon .
Light and accurate , it requires no cleaning even in the dust of the high desert , and every man and boy already knows it well .
The strange and sensitive M - 16 , on the other hand , may be more accurate at slightly greater distances , but only if a soldier can keep it clean , while managing to adjust and readjust its notoriously sensitive sights .
The struggling soldiers of the ANA may not ace that test , but now that the U.S. military has generously passed on its old M - 16s to Afghans , it can buy new ones at taxpayer expense , a prospect certain to gladden the heart of any arms manufacturer .
( Incidentally , thanks must go to the Illinois National Guard for risking their lives to make possible such handsome corporate profits . )
As for the police , U.S. - funded training offers a similar revolving door .
In Afghanistan , however , it is far more dangerous to be a policeman than a soldier .
While soldiers on patrol can slip away , policemen stuck at their posts are killed almost every day .
Assigned in small numbers to staff small - town police stations or highway checkpoints , they are sitting ducks for Taliban fighters .
As representatives of the now thoroughly discredited government of President Hamid Karzai , the hapless police make handy symbolic targets .
British commanders in Helmand province estimated that 60 % of Afghan police are on drugs — and little wonder why .
In the Pashtun provinces of southern Afghanistan , where the Taliban is strong , recruiting men for the Afghan National Police is a “ problem , ” as an ANP commander told me .
Consequently , non-Pashtun police trainees of Hazara , Tajik , Uzbek , or other ethnic backgrounds are dispatched to maintain order in Pashtun territory .
They might as well paint targets on their foreheads .
The police who accompanied the U.S. Marines into Helmand Province reportedly refused to leave their heavily armed mentors to take up suicidal posts in provincial villages .
Some police and army soldiers , when asked by reporters , claimed to be “ visiting ” Helmand province only for “ vacation . ”
Training Day
In many districts , the police recently supplemented their low pay and demonstrated allegiance to local warlords by stuffing ballot boxes for President Karzai in the presidential election .
Consider that but one more indication — like the defection of those great Islamist fundamentalist mujahidin allies the U.S. sponsored in the anti-Soviet jihad of the 1980s who are now fighting with the Taliban — that no amount of American training , mentoring , or cash will determine who or what Afghans will fight for , if indeed they fight at all .
Afghans are world famous fighters , in part because they have a knack for gravitating to the winning side , and they ’re ready to change sides with alacrity until they get it right .
Recognizing that Afghans back a winner , U.S. military strategists are now banking on a counterinsurgency strategy that seeks to “ clear , hold , and build ” — that is , to stick around long enough to win the Afghans over .
But it ’s way too late for that to work .
These days , U.S. troops sticking around look ever more like a foreign occupying army and , to the Taliban , like targets .
Recently Karen DeYoung noted in the Washington Post that the Taliban now regularly use very sophisticated military techniques — “ as if the insurgents had attended something akin to the U.S. Army ’s Ranger school , which teaches soldiers how to fight in small groups in austere environments . ”
Of course , some of them have attended training sessions which teach them to fight in “ austere environments , ” probably time and time again .
If you were a Talib , would n’t you scout the training being offered to Afghans on the other side ?
And would n’t you do it more than once if you could get well paid every time ?
Such training is bound to come in handy — as it may have for the Talib policeman who , just last week , bumped off eight other comrades at his police post in Kunduz Province in northern Afghanistan and turned it over to the Taliban .
On the other hand , such training can be deadly to American trainers .
Take the case of the American trainer who was shot and wounded that same week by one of his trainees .
Reportedly , a dispute arose because the trainer was drinking water “ in front of locals , ” while the trainees were fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramazan .
There is , by the way , plenty of evidence that Taliban fighters get along just fine , fighting fiercely and well without the training lavished on the ANA and the ANP .
Why is it that Afghan Taliban fighters seem so bold and effective , while the Afghan National Police are so dismally corrupt and the Afghan National Army a washout ?
When I visited bases and training grounds in July , I heard some American trainers describe their Afghan trainees in the same racist terms once applied to African slaves in the U.S. : lazy , irresponsible , stupid , childish , and so on .
That ’s how Afghan resistance , avoidance , and sabotage look to American eyes .
The Taliban fight for something they believe — that their country should be freed from foreign occupation .
“ Our ” Afghans try to get by .
Yet one amazing thing happens to ANA trainees who stick it out for the whole 10 weeks of basic training .
Their slight bodies begin to fill out a little .
They gain more energy and better spirits — all because for the first time in their lives they have enough nutritious food to eat .
Better nutrition notwithstanding — Senator Levin , Senator McCain — “ our ” Afghans are never going to fight for an American cause , with or without American troops , the way we imagine they should .
They ’re never going to fight with the energy of the Taliban for a national government that we installed against Afghan wishes , then more recently set up to steal another election , and now seem about to ratify in office , despite incontrovertible evidence of flagrant fraud .
Why should they ?
Even if the U.S. could win their minds , their hearts are not in it .
One small warning :
Do n’t take the insecurity of the Afghan security forces as an argument for sending yet more American troops to Afghanistan .
Aggressive Americans ( now numbering 68,000 ) are likely to be even less successful than reluctant Afghan forces .
Afghans want peace , but the kharaji ( foreign ) troops ( 100,000 , if you include U.S. allies in NATO ) bring death and destruction wherever they go .
Think instead about what you might have won — and could still win — had you spent all those military billions on food .
Or maybe agriculture .
Or health care .
Or a civilian job corps .
Is it too late for that now ?

The definitive article on the battle that erupted between Family Guy and Sarah Palin has been written : it 's an A1 NYT feature , it 's comprehensive , and with any luck , finally puts this stupid , boring , predictable saga out of sight forever .
In the event that you can't understand why a cartoon on Fox would be embroiled in a highly quotable media brouhaha with a former vice - presidential candidate , all you have to know is that it 's Family Guy and Sarah Palin .
But if you need more background , basically : Family Guy airs episode starring character with Down 's Syndrome voiced by actress with Down 's Syndrome .
Vague allusion / " joke " is made about Sarah Palin as character with Down 's Syndrome notes that her mother used to be the governor of Alaska , har har .
Palin , who has child with Down 's Syndrome , gets angry , gets on Facebook , and writes about how hurt she is , as former Vice - Presidential candidates are wont to do .
So !
In comes New York Times ArtsBeat writer Dave Itzkoff , recapping the entire thing , with quotes from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane , Sarah Palin , Palin 's daughter Bristol , the Family Guy actress in question , and the executive director of the Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles , who helped get said actress cast .
Naturally , the actress ( Andrea Fay Friedman ) was delighted to be a part of all of this .
In an email ( that the New York Times apparently saved in full for this here definitive roundup ) Friedman notes :
" I guess former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor . "
She added that in her family , " we think laughing is good , " and that she was raised by her parents " to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life . "
Ms. Friedman continued , " My mother did not carry me around under her arm like a loaf of French bread the way former Governor Palin carries her son Trig around looking for sympathy and votes . "
Well , basically , yes .
Even more astute is the observation from said advocate :
Gail Williamson , executive director of the Down Syndrome Association of Los Angeles , which , among other services , assists films and television series in casting actors with the disability , and helped Ms. Friedman get hired by " Family Guy , " said it did not matter whether she thought the episode was funny .
" Within ‘ Family Guy , ' the character was fully included , well - rounded , dynamic , not dealing with stereotypical Down syndrome issues , " Ms. Williamson said .
She added : " Am I a fan of that kind of humor ?
Eh .
It 's beside the point . "
Also correct !
The ends here are n't necessarily bad .
Someone got an acting gig , and someone pushed a unarguably " good " cause ( equality ) forward .
There are worse results , and naturally , Friedman and Williamson are happy .
Palin and MacFarlane , however , come out of this looking worse for the wear .
Just for a moment , let 's consider Seth MacFarlane telling the New York Times that he was proud of what he did , noting that the character 's Down Syndrome being played as a secondary element was essentially the point .
Seth MacFarlane's in the TV business , and he did n't do this to advocate a cause .
There 's an inherent shock factor in having a character with Down 's Syndrome make a joke about Sarah Palin , who has a kid with Down 's Syndrome .
He took an audience by the eyeballs , and exploited a willing actress with Down 's Syndrome to do it .
And equality , indeed :
What working , career actresses trying to make a living — Down 's Syndrome or not — can you think of that would turn down a gig as high profile as Family Guy ?
None of 'em , and this one , like the rest , was more than willing to cash a paycheck .
Ca n't blame her .
On the other side , Sarah Palin has again and again fed into being baited by irreverent people making irreverent jokes at her family 's expense .
If you have a very large platform , and you say something that can even remotely be perceived as mildly controversial by Palin , it 's pretty much a given that she 's going to mic up and talk about this , as opposed to just writing guys like David Letterman and Seth MacFarlane off ( just like the rest of the people they take on manage to do ) .
She used the moment to step up on a platform and advocate a separate side of the same cause , but moreover , herself as a voice in " the conversation " about " the controversy . "
Like clockwork :
1. Seth MacFarlane makes " controversial " episode of thing meant to entertain with Sarah Palin joke .
2. Sarah Palin joke elicits Sarah Palin reaction on internet and TV .
3. Sarah Palin reaction elicits Seth MacFarlane reaction .
4. Separate reactions of Sarah Palin and Seth McFarlane are yielded by " controversy , " producing more " controversy . "
5. More " controversy " yields NYT story .
6. Family Guy gets press , Sarah Palin gets soapbox , Fox gets viewers for Palin 's argument on Fox News and for Family Guy 's ratings , worthy cause gets talked about more .
Everybody " wins . "
But mostly Dave Itzkoff , because he got more money than I did to write about this .
Kind of related : if Robot Chicken made this joke , it 'd ( A ) be funnier and ( B ) would n't be a story .

Foursquare is a fast growing service that back in July 2009 both the Washington Post and Mashable were tipping as a potential " breakout hit " or " next Twitter " .
Foursquare provides a cross between a friend - finder , a social city - guide and a game that rewards you for doing interesting things .
It aims to keep you up with the places your friends go , and encourage you to discover new places and explore your neighborhood .
Ever more people are enjoying the discovery experience .
With a rapidly growing base of hundreds of thousands of users Harry Heymann at Foursquare decided to move all the services to Scala / Lift based servers .
Harry recently announced to the Lift community that this high profile , heavy duty web server application had been ported to the Scala / Lift web framework .
He explained that the conversion took a surprisingly short time , just 3 months .
The Foursquare website , a mobile website ( m.foursquare.com ) and a simple ( but growing ! ) REST api ( api.foursquare.com ) are all now running on Lift .
Average post rates of over 1 per second and peaks several orders of magnitude larger .
Harry says that they found Lift 's view - first architecture well suited to interactive , AJAX - infused pages and an easy transition to make .
As well as thanking the Lift community and David Pollak for their great support Harry says , " they 've built a really great framework , and I look forward to using it and seeing it grow for many years to come . "

Painter Jeremy Tinder has shared another piece from Giant Robot SF 's returning video game - themed art exhibit .
While his last work offered a totem pole re-imagining of Super Mario Bros .'s cast , this watercolor twists a familiar Gauntlet phrase in a new ( and very depressing ) way .
Times have not been good for Blue Wizard .
The third annual Game Over exhibit kicks off at San Francisco 's Giant Robot store and gallery this March 12th , the same week as the 2010 Game Developers Conference -- it 's just a short drive from the Moscone Center , too !

Biologists affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History and City College of the City University of New York have found that grizzly bears are roaming into what was traditionally thought of as polar bear habitat — and into the Canadian province of Manitoba , where they are officially listed as extirpated .
The preliminary data was recently published in Canadian Field Naturalist and shows that sightings of Ursus arctos horribilis in Canada 's Wapusk National Park are recent and appear to be increasing in frequency .
" Grizzly bears are a new guy on the scene , competition and a potential predator for the polar bears that live in this area , " says Robert F. Rockwell , a research associate at the Museum and a professor of Biology at CUNY .
" The first time we saw a grizzly we were flying over the middle of Wapusk , counting fox dens , when all of the sudden Linda Gormezano , a graduate student working with Rockwell and a co-author of the paper , shouted ' Over there , over there — a grizzly bear . '
And it was n't a dirty polar bear or a moose — we saw the hump . "
That sighting in August 2008 spurred Rockwell and Gormezano to look through records to get a better picture of the bear population in the park .
There was no evidence of grizzly bears before 1996 , not even in the trapping data from centuries of Hudson Bay Company operation .
But between 1996 and 2008 the team found nine confirmed sightings of grizzly bears , and in the summer of 2009 there were three additional observations .
" The opportunistic sightings seem to be increasing , " says Gormezano .
" This is worrying for the polar bears because grizzly bears would likely hibernate in polar bear maternity denning habitat .
They would come out of hibernation at the same time and can kill polar cubs . "

Before this study , researchers thought that the barren landscape north of the Hudson Bay was an impassable gap in resources for potentially migrating grizzly bears .
But some U. arctos horribilis have managed to move from their historic ranges in the Rockies , the Yukon , and Nunavut , probably because of their flexible , mixed diet of berries and meat .
The potential gap was navigable , and now some grizzly bears have reached the abundant caribou , moose , fish , and berries found to the south in Canada 's Wapusk National Park .
" Although we do n't yet know if they are wandering or staying — the proof will come from an observed den or cubs — these animals will eventually be residents of this national park , " says Rockwell .
" The Cree elders we talked to feel that now that grizzly bears have found this food source they will be staying . "
" A big question is how to deal with these new residents , " continues Gormezano .
" In Canada , both the polar and grizzly bear are federally listed as species of special concern .
In Manitoba , the polar bear is provincially listed as threatened while the prairie population of the grizzly bear is listed as extirpated . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A pension fund may ask the Supreme Court to let it sue BAE Systems Plc in the United States over allegations that the company paid more than $ 2 billion in bribes to win a record Saudi arms deal , the fund ’s lead attorney said on Friday .

A U.S. appeals court ruled this week against the fund for employees of the city of Harper Woods , Michigan .
The court said English law , not U.S. law , governed the shareholder lawsuit over alleged bribes to Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan and others .
The appeals court , which upheld a lower court ’s finding , left the fund to pursue its case in Britain .
Patrick Coughlin , the plaintiffs ’ lead attorney , said the fund had no plans to take its case to England .
Instead , he said it may appeal to the high court against the dismissal of the case on Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
“ Will consider ” going to the Supreme Court , Coughlin , of Coughlin , Stoia , Geller , Rudman , Robbins LLP , said in a terse email reply to Reuters .
“ No current plans to litigate in England . ”
He did not respond to questions about why he did not plan to take the case to England .
The original suit was brought in September 2007 .
The pension fund has charged that current and former directors and executives of BAE , Britain ’s No. 1 arms maker , breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets by allegedly allowing illegal bribes and kickbacks in the 1980s arm deal known as al - Yamamah , or “ the Dove . ”
BAE has denied that wrongful payments were made to secure the deal in which Tornado fighter jets , Hawker trainer aircraft and other military hardware were sold to Saudi Arabia in exchange for oil starting in 1985 .
The value of the government - to - government barter has been estimated at up to $ 80 billion , Britain ’s costliest arms deal .
BAE welcomed the U.S. appeals court ruling , said Lindsay Walls , a company spokeswoman in London .
Lawyers for Bandar , a former ambassador to the United States , have denied any wrongdoing on his part .
The plaintiffs had argued the United States should have jurisdiction because more than $ 2 billion in alleged bribes went to Bandar through an account at Riggs Bank , a defunct Washington D.C. financial institution .
BAE defendants countered that nearly all of them reside outside the United States , and none in Washington D.C .
Britain ’s Serious Fraud Office in December 2006 dropped an inquiry into the al - Yamamah deal .
Then - Prime Minister Tony Blair said pursuing the matter threatened national security and ties with Saudi Arabia , which he called crucial for counter - terrorism efforts and Middle East peace .
In June 2007 , BAE said the U.S. Justice Department had opened its own investigation of BAE ’s compliance with anti-bribery laws , including dealings with Saudi Arabia .
The department did not respond to a request for comment on its investigation .

I ’m giving a talk today to a group of high school students .
Most of the talk focusses on climate models , and the kinds of experiments you can do with them .
But I thought I ’d start with a little bit of history , to demonstrate some key points in the development of our understanding of climate change .
Here ’s some of the slides I put together ( drawing heavily on Spencer Weart ’s the Discovery of Global Warming for inspiration ) .
Comments on these slides are welcome .
I plan to start with this image :
… and ask some general questions like :
What do you think of when you see this image ?
Where did all that energy come from ?
Where does all that energy go ?
( remember , energy cannot be created or destroy , only transformed … )
What happens when you add up the energy needs of 6 billion people ?
and , introducing the spaceship earth metaphor :
Who ’s driving this spaceship , and are the life support systems working properly ?…
For millions of years , the planet had a natural control system that kept the climate relatively stable .
We appear to have broken it .
Now we ’ve got to figure out how to control it ourselves , before we do irreversible damage .
We ’re not about to crash this spaceship , but we could damage its life support systems if we do n’t figure out how to control it properly .
I then show some graphs showing temperature changes through pre-history , together with graphs of the recent temperature rise .
As a prelude to a little history .

Update : Judicial
Watch provided separate documents from an earlier FOIA request which show that " most , if not all " of the flights did indeed have the Speaker aboard .
This is being researched and , until complete , corrections are noted below .
Update II : Commenters provide links to DOD 4515 .
12 - R " DoD Support for Travel of Members and Employees of Congress and DOD 4515.13 - R " Air Transportation Eligibility " , both of which seem to indicate any travel by the Speaker 's adult -- non-dependent -- children and grandchildren is off - limits .
Update III : An article at Mudville Gazette offers additional useful information .

Is it a legitimate use of military jets to transport the Speaker of the House and her favored Congressional coterie for routine travel ?
Even if you believe it is -- and , personally , I do not -- any rational taxpayer would admit that it is monumental waste of money .
Military flights cost between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000 per hour to operate .
The Speaker and her passengers routinely reimburse the Air Force $ 120 to $ 400 for each flight .
Since Nancy Pelosi took over as Speaker in 2006 , she 's rung up millions in military travel expenses to commute between San Francisco and Washington .
Worse still , she also appears to have liberallyused these flights to shuttle her children and grandchildren back and forth to DC .
That is , , her kids , in - laws and grandchildren areusing military passenger jets for their routine travel needs .
Using the documents obtained by Judicial Watch 's Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests , I have discovered the following manifests and travel requests . :
A military jet is used for the travel needs of the Speaker 's son , Paul Jr. :
A military jet is utilized for the travel of the Speaker 's daughter , son - in - law and grandson . :
A military jet is used for the travel needs of the Speaker 's son , Paul Jr. :

A military jet is used for the Speaker 's daughter and a son - in - law , Peter Kaufman . :
A military jet is used for the Speaker 's daughter , her son - in - law and two grandchildren .
This is not an exhaustive list by any stretch .
On dozens of occasions , various of the Pelosi children and grandchildren appear to have traveled with ( ) the Speaker .
Rep. Nancy Pelosi -- in my humble opinion -- has abused her office by using military jets for the travel convenience of her children .
It would seem that the instances highlighted above constitute , at minimum , a complete disregard for the American taxpayer 's funds .
On a day that Google augmented Gmail with a social networking feature , Facebook and AOL announced a partnership that will allow millions of their users to add friends and chat across the Web environments .
Tuesday ’s dueling announcements underscore the growing rivalry between Google , the Internet ’s leading company , and Facebook , which recently passed AOL to rank third in Web traffic .
The alliance integrates Facebook Chat into AIM , AOL ’s instant messaging platform , and its new Lifestream feature .
Lifestream already provides many of the same updates and social features that Google is now introducing with Google Buzz , said Brad Garlinghouse , a former Yahoo executive who now leads AOL operations in Silicon Valley .
AIM is the first major instant messaging service to integrate with Facebook ’s new interface .
“ In today ’s online environment , you ca n’t be competitive without being open and allowing partners , developers and consumers to leverage your technology , ” said Ethan Beard , Facebook ’s director of platform marketing .
About 70 percent of AOL users also use Facebook .
The integration with Facebook , Garlinghouse said , “ is a sign of where AOL is heading ” as it tries to restore its reputation as an Internet innovator .

Many technologists and entrepreneurs have argued that mobile phones can empower people in the developing world by providing civic and commercial resources where traditional infrastructure is lacking .
But what actually happens when people start using such technologies ?
An MIT economist 's detailed new study from Kenya sheds light on the impact of a mobile phone - based money system in a developing economy .
Kenya's new mobile - money system , called M - PESA , really is changing the way Kenyans manage their money , by letting them borrow , save and pay for services more easily , according to Tavneet Suri , an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management , who along with Georgetown University economist William Jack is leading a major research project on the subject .
" I do n't think anybody thought it would take off quite as fast as it did or be as popular as it's been , " says Suri .
" The adoption has been very quick compared to almost any other technology we 've seen . "
Since its introduction in 2007 , the researchers found , 38 percent of Kenyan households have at least one M - PESA user in them ; by contrast , only 22 percent of adults have bank accounts .
" In these sorts of economies , there 's not much of a bank presence , but money transfers are still important , " notes Suri .
" People do them all the time . "
Kenya 's rapid adoption of mobile money is occurring with a larger global trend of increased cellphone use .
There are now over 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide , compared to 1 billion in 2002 , according to a 2009 report by the International Telecommunications Union , a United Nations agency .
Of those subscriptions , about two - thirds are in developing countries .
Saving your savings
The M- PESA system , introduced by phone provider Safaricom , lets users deposit , transfer and withdraw funds via text message .
M-PESA is not technically considered to be a bank , and does not pay interest on savings .
It does , however , charge fees for withdrawals and transfers .
In a 2008 survey of 3,000 households in areas representing 92 percent of Kenya 's population , Suri and Jack found that despite M - PESA 's fees , large numbers of Kenyans are using it for basic banking functions .
About 38 percent of money transfers originated in rural areas .
According to Suri , farmers are one group that employs the technology to lend each other money in lean times .
" Many of these people work in agriculture where you have highly variable incomes because of the weather , " explains Suri .
" That means banks also do n't want to lend to them because of the risk is much higher .
So people insure risk , by making informal agreements : ' I 'm going to lend you money if you need it . '
And if you were not able to feed your family , you would receive transfers from people in your network .
This happens in a lot of developing countries . "
The researchers ' data also shows that 41 percent of M - PESA money transfers are sent to parents , and only 8 percent to children , which also strongly suggests that M - PESA fills a classic role in a developing economy ; children who leave home to work may be sending money back to help their parents .
The physical separation of people has always made money transfers difficult in developing countries , however , notes Suri , a Kenya native whose family lives outside Nairobi , the capital .
Sending money from one place to another has often been " hard to do , costly , not very safe .
You might send money with a bus driver and it would n't get there , because he might get robbed .
Now it gets there within five seconds , as soon as it takes a text message to arrive . "
And despite their inability to earn interest , Kenyans appear to use M - PESA as a savings tool .
In a current working paper summarizing their results , " Mobile Money : The Economics of M - PESA , " Suri and Jack note that 77 percent of Kenyans say they keep money " under the mattress " at home , so to speak .
About 11 percent of households say they have had savings stolen or become lost , though , meaning that tucking cash away is a money - losing strategy .
By contrast , under 2 percent of M - PESA users believe they have lost money through the system ( by sending it to an unintended recipient ) .
That means Kenyans without access to banks should , on aggregate , retain more of their savings through M - PESA .
Technology entrepreneurs who have worked in Kenya say they are unsurprised by the rapid spread of M - PESA " Kenyans certainly want to do additional things on their phones , including mobile banking , " says Ting Shih , executive vice - president and co-founder of Click Diagnostics , a health - care firm that has developed applications for clinicians in developing countries , including Kenya .
" I think it 's a matter of educating people , telling them what a service entails . "
But does it help the economy ?
Still , questions about the effects of M - PESA remain .
For one : Can it help Kenya 's economy become more productive and grow ?
In theory , it could do so by allowing routine transactions to be processed more quickly and reliably .
Moreover , by making lending easier , M - PESA could allow capital to move around Kenya more efficiently , allowing economic activity to take place which might not otherwise occur .
Whether that is happening is something Suri and Jack intend to analyze in future studies .
" If M - PESA is increasing transactions that much , we should see it in the data , " says Suri .
They would also like to quantify in more detail how much M - PESA lets Kenyans " smooth out " stretches of time when their incomes are uneven .
The researchers are currently analyzing a second wave of survey data , and are planning two additional surveys , to be conducted later in 2010 , with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ( the first survey was commissioned by the Central Bank of Kenya ; M-PESA was initially funded by the Department for International Development , a British government agency ) .
" Technologies such as mobile phones are one way to overcome some of the obstacles that block the poor from having access to financial services , " says Ignacio Mas , deputy director of the Financial Services for the Poor Initiative at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
In the course of backing research and development of new technologies meant to expand financial services , Mas adds , the foundation is " focusing on savings because it addresses a crucial need that has been previously overlooked , and unmet . "
M-PESA has also been introduced into neighboring Tanzania and could expand to other African countries , including South Africa .
Observers may thus have more opportunities to find out if there is a " revealed preference " for the service as economists say .
That means , as Suri says , " People would n't do it if it were n't particularly useful . "
Lost type TV Show Where to watch Close Streaming Options
Warning , SPOILERS ahead .
If you have n’t seen the season premiere of Lost yet , you might not want to continue past the jump yet .
Lost fans who have now seen the premiere can read ahead for some explanation from Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof .
( Comments are likely to be full of spoilers also , you ’ve been warned again . )
Once upon a time in Germany , a very smart and spiritual man tried to answer a very tricky and troubling question .
In a world created by an allegedly benevolent and omnipotent God , why the heck is there suffering and evil ?
In the world of philosophy , this field of inquiry is called Theodicy , generally defined as an attempt to understand and justify the behavior of God .
The genius German dude thought long and hard about this “ problem of evil ” question and came up with an answer that was unusually heady for the time .
He said that despite the existence of evil , this world is actually “ the best of all possible worlds , ” as if our universe is the least offensive of countless alternatives , or even a pastiche comprised of pieces from the best parts of all .
Wild .
Over the next 300 years , physicists , philosophers , and science fiction writers have blown out Gottfried Leibniz ’s “ possible worlds ” concept in many different radical , challenging directions to serve all sorts of scientific and intellectual purposes , their various nuanced permutations producing a slough of different , seemingly synonymous yet not necessarily equal terms .
Parallel worlds .
Many worlds .
Alternate realities .
Mirror realities .
Modal realities .
Pocket universes .
Bubble universes .
And my favorite , “ Island universes , ” because it reminds me of a TV show I ’m supposedly writing about , one that has referenced perhaps the foremost philosopher in this field , David Lewis .
Today , there are eggheads who believe that these “ island universes ” or whatnot are real — that they exist somewhere , as real and concrete as “ our world , ” inhabited by variations of ourselves .
Naturally , this assertion has invited intense debate .
Where are these worlds ?
Can we find them ?
If so , can we access them ?
Communicate with them ?
Visit them ?
Is there one “ official world ” and all the others of deviations ?
Did all these worlds pop into being at the same time , or do we continually create new worlds with every choice and non-choice ?
If so , do the other versions of you that exist across the multiverse of worlds create new worlds with their choices and non-choices , too ?
And who are these other “ yous , ” anyway ?
Are you separate , unique individuals ?
Do you share consciousness and / or a soul ?
Are you and your other yous destined to reach similar fates , played out through different events or circumstances ?
Are you and your other yous unique entities with unique destinies ?
Yes ?
No ?
Who knows ?
What does any of this Fringe - sounding s— have anything to do with Lost ?!?!
Maybe everything .
Maybe… nothing !
Maybe something somewhere in the middle .
What ’s definitely for certain is this :
If you ’ve seen the season premiere of Lost ( final SPOILER ALERT now ! ) , you now know the hush - hush new storytelling device for the final season is this whole notion of parallel worlds .
We were presented with two of them : one in which Oceanic 815 never crashed ; and another that keeps continuity with the past five years of Lost having all the characters trapped in the Dharma Initiative past magically uploaded to the Island present of 2007 where the Jacob - Fake Locke - Ben drama is all going down .
I ’ll have a lot more to say on this tomorrow AM in my recap .
But before then , I bring you news from two guys who you probably MOST want to hear from right now : Lost exec producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof .
My “ Totally Lost ” partner Dan Snierson and I sat down with them to talk about the year ’s ” flash - sideways ” storytelling device .
Jokes Damon Lindelof : “ You [ had ] all these fundamental mysteries going into season 6 .
What ’s the Monster ?
What ’s the Island ?
Why is Richard Alpert not able to age ?
But here ’s this new mystery .
How dare they !
How dare they present us with a new mystery at this late stage in the game ! ”
Fortunately , here are the producers to offer some assurance of answers and provide some helpful context for season 6 .
EW : The whole idea of flash - sideways and the plan to use season 6 to show us a world where Oceanic 815 never crashed — how long has that been in the works ?
Why did you want to do it ?
DAMON LINDELOF :
It ’s been in play for at least a couple of years .
We knew that the ending of the time travel season was going to be an attempt to reboot .
And as a result , we [ knew ] the audience was going to come out of the “ do - over moment ” thinking we were either going start over or just say it did n’t work and continue on .
[ We thought ] would n’t it be great if we did both ?
That was the origin of the story .
CARLTON CUSE :
We thought just doing one [ of those options ] would inherently not be satisfying .
Since the very beginning of the show , characters started crossing through each other ’s stories .
Part of our desire [ in season 6 ] is to show that there ’s still this kind of weave , that these characters still would have impacted each other ’s lives even without the event of crashing on the Island .
Obviously , the big question of the season is going to be :
How do these [ two timelines ] reconcile ?
However , for the fans who have not watched the show closely , that ’s an intact narrative .
You can just watch the flash sideways — they stand alone all by themselves .
For the fans who are more deeply embedded in the show , you can watch those flash sideways , compare them to what transpired in the flashbacks and go , “ Oh , that ’s an interesting difference . ”
LINDELOF : Right out of the gate , in the first five minutes of the premiere , you get hit over the head with two things that you ’re not expecting .
The first is that Desmond is on the plane .
The second thing that we do is we drop out of the plane and we go below the water and we see that the Island is submerged .
What we ’re trying to do there is basically say to you , “ God bless the survivors of Oceanic 815 , because they ’re so self - centered , they thought the only effect [ of detonating the bomb ] was going to be that their plane never crashes . ”
But they do n’t stop to think , “ If we do this in 1977 , what else is going to affected by this ? ”
So that their entire lives can be changed radically .
In fact , it would appear that they ’ve sunken the Island .
That ’s our way of saying , “ Keep your eyes peeled for the differences that you ’re not expecting . ”
Some of these characters were still in Australia , but some were n’t .
Shannon ’s not there .
Boone actually says that he tried to get her back .
There are all sorts of other people that we do n’t see .
Where ’s Libby ?
Where ’s Ana Lucia ?
Where ’s Eko ?
These are all the things that you ’re supposed to be thinking about .
When our characters posited the “ What if ? ” scenario , they neglected to think about what the other effects of potentially changing time might be and we ’re embracing those things .
That said , are you saying definitively that detonating Jughead was the event that created this new timeline ?
Or is that a mystery which the season 6 story will reveal ?
LINDELOF : It ’s a mystery .
A big one .
CUSE : We did have some concern that it might be confusing kind of going into the season .
To clear that up a little bit :
The archetypes of the characters are the same and that ’s the most significant thing .
Kate is still a fugitive .
If you were to look at the Comic - Con video , for instance , that now comes into play .
There was a different scenario in that story .
She basically blew up an apprentice plumber as opposed to killing her biological father / stepfather .
Those kind of differences exist , but who the characters fundamentally are is the same .
If it becomes too confusing for you , you can just follow the flash sideways for what they are .
It ’s not as though there ’s narrative that hangs on the fact that you need to know that this event was different in that world , in the flashback world versus the sideways world .
That ’s not critical for being able to process the narrative this season .
Is there a relationship between Island reality and sideways reality ?
Will they run parallel for the remainder of the season ?
Will they fuse together ?
Might one fade away ?
LINDELOF : For us , the big risk that we ’re taking in the final season of the show is basically this very question .
[ Lindelof then explains the show has replaced the trademark “ whoosh ! ” sound effect marking the segue between Island present story and flashbacks or flash - forwards , thus calling conspicuous attention to the relationship between the Island world and the Sideways world . ]
This is the critical mystery of the season , which is , “ What is the relationship between these two shows ? ”
And we do n’t use the phrase “ alternate reality , ” because to call one of them an “ alternate reality ” is to infer that one of them is n’t real , or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real .
CUSE : But the questions you ’re asking are exactly the right questions .
What are we to make of the fact that they ’re showing us two different timelines ?
Are they going to resolve ?
Are they going to connect ?
Are they going to co-exist in parallel fashion ?
Are they going to cross ?
Do they intersect ?
Does one prove to be viable and the other one not ?
I think those are all the kind of speculations that are the right speculations to be having at this point in the season .
LINDELOF : But it is going to require patience .
We ’ve taught the audience how to be patient thus far , so while they ’re getting a lot of mythological answers on the island early in the season , this idea of what is the relationship between the two [ worlds ] is a little bit more of a slow burn .
Did Jughead really sink the Island ?
And is it possible that the Sideways characters are now caught in a time loop in which they might have to go back in time and fulfill the obligation to continuity by detonating the bomb ?
LINDELOF : These questions will be dealt with on the show .
Should you infer that the detonation of Jughead is what sunk the island ?
Who knows ?
But there ’s the Foot .
What do you get when you see that shot ?
It looks like New Otherton got built .
These little clues [ might help you ] extrapolate when the Island may have sunk .
Start to think about it .
A couple of episodes down the road , some of the characters might even discuss it .
We will say this : season 6 is not about time travel .
It ’s about the implications , the aftermath , and the causality of trying to change the past .
But the idea of continuing to do paradoxical storytelling is not what we ’re interested in this year .
There you go .
Some food for thought .
Dan and I will have more Messrs .
Cuse and Lindelof later this week at EW.com and in the new issue of Entertainment Weekly , on sale Friday .
If you ’ve made it this far into this post , stay tuned :
There ’s a monstrously epic recap coming your way tomorrow .
Until then , please : Get talking !
What did you love ?
What did you hate ?
What left you totally baffled ?
What theories do you have to explain it all ?
The floor is yours !

John Kamm , a veteran American human rights campaigner , said that during three decades working in China he had rarely seen such a hard line toward dissidents  and unbridled defiance against pressure from abroad .
“ China right now does n’t feel like it owes anyone anything on human rights , ” said Mr. Kamm , the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation , which seeks clemency for political prisoners through quiet diplomacy .
“ I ’ve never seen a downward spiral like this . ”
In the 31 years since the People ’s Republic of China and the United States established diplomatic relations , Chinese officials have often resisted American intervention on human rights , calling the issue a domestic matter .
But there has generally been some give and take , largely behind the scenes , especially in the years after the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square , when China was eager to shed its pariah status abroad .
That leverage began dissipating in 2001 after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization , and Congress surrendered the right to review China ’s human rights record before granting it favorable trade status .
There is little space in Chinese society for unyielding dissidents like Mr. Gao .
But until recently , the authorities often allowed them to stay at home under close surveillance .
If they crossed certain unwritten lines , they might be prosecuted , often for the crime of inciting subversion or leaking state secrets .
Even if stymied in their defense , lawyers can expect a modicum of information about their clients .
Family jailhouse visits are not uncommon .
But Mr. Gao ’s case has defied these norms .
In September , a security agent who took Mr. Gao into custody told one of his brothers that he had simply disappeared during a walk .
The brother , Gao Zhiyi , said he suspected the worst .
“ If he were alive , they would have allowed me to visit him , ” he said in a telephone interview from his home in Shaanxi Province .
“ Either that or he ’s in such bad shape , it would be too horrible for anyone to see him . ”
Image In December , China executed Akmal Shaikh , above , a Briton , despite appeals by Britain .

Rights advocates say Mr. Gao ’s predicament can be partly traced to his persistent and caustic criticism of the ruling Communist Party .
A self - educated lawyer , Mr. Gao , 46 , was named one of China ’s top 10 lawyers by the Ministry of Justice in 2001 for his work defending victims of medical malpractice and farmers whose land had been seized for redevelopment .
Imagine finding a living dinosaur in your backyard .
Astronomers have found the astronomical equivalent of prehistoric life in our intergalactic backyard : a group of small , ancient galaxies that has waited 10 billion years to come together .
These " late bloomers " are on their way to building a large elliptical galaxy .
Such encounters between dwarf galaxies are normally seen billions of light - years away and therefore occurred billions of years ago .
But these galaxies , members of Hickson Compact Group 31 , are relatively nearby , only 166 million light - years away .
New images of this foursome by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope offer a window into the universe 's formative years when the buildup of large galaxies from smaller building blocks was common .
Astronomers have known for decades that these dwarf galaxies are gravitationally tugging on each other .
Their classical spiral shapes have been stretched like taffy , pulling out long streamers of gas and dust .
The brightest object in the Hubble image is actually two colliding galaxies .
The entire system is aglow with a firestorm of star birth , triggered when hydrogen gas is compressed by the close encounters between the galaxies , and collapses to form stars .
The Hubble observations have added important clues to the story of this interacting group , allowing astronomers to determine when the encounter began and to predict a future merger .
" We found the oldest stars in a few ancient globular star clusters that date back to about 10 billion years ago .
Therefore , we know the system has been around for a while , " says astronomer Sarah Gallagher of The University of Western Ontario in London , Ontario , leader of the Hubble study .
" Most other dwarf galaxies like these interacted billions of years ago , but these galaxies are just coming together for the first time .
This encounter has been going on for at most a few hundred million years , the blink of an eye in cosmic history .
It is an extremely rare local example of what we think was a quite common event in the distant universe . "
Everywhere the astronomers looked in this group they found batches of infant star clusters and regions brimming with star birth .
The entire system is rich in hydrogen gas , the stuff of which stars are made .
Gallagher and her team used Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys to resolve the youngest and brightest of those clusters , which allowed them to calculate the clusters ' ages , trace the star - formation history , and determine that the galaxies are undergoing the final stages of galaxy assembly .

The analysis was bolstered by infrared data from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope and ultraviolet observations from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) and NASA 's Swift satellite .
Those data helped the astronomers measure the total amount of star formation in the system .
" Hubble has the sharpness to resolve individual star clusters , which allowed us to age - date the clusters , " Gallagher adds .
Hubble reveals that the brightest clusters , hefty groups each holding at least 100,000 stars , are less than 10 million years old .
The stars are feeding off of plenty of gas .
A measurement of the gas content shows that very little has been used up -- further proof that the " galactic fireworks " seen in the images are a recent event .
The group has about five times as much hydrogen gas as our Milky Way Galaxy .
" This is a clear example of a group of galaxies on their way toward a merger because there is so much gas that is going to mix everything up , " Gallagher says .
" The galaxies are relatively small , comparable in size to the Large Magellanic Cloud , a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way .
Their velocities , measured from previous studies , show that they are moving very slowly relative to each other , just 134,000 miles an hour ( 60 kilometers a second ) .
So it 's hard to imagine how this system would n't wind up as a single elliptical galaxy in another billion years . "
Adds team member Pat Durrell of Youngstown State University : " The four small galaxies are extremely close together , within 75,000 light - years of each other -- we could fit them all within our Milky Way . "
Why did the galaxies wait so long to interact ?
Perhaps , says Gallagher , because the system resides in a lower - density region of the universe , the equivalent of a rural village .
Getting together took billions of years longer than it did for galaxies in denser areas .
Hickson Compact Group 31 is one of 100 compact galaxy groups catalogued by Canadian astronomer Paul Hickson .
Gallagher 's results appear in the February issue of The Astronomical Journal .
Her science team consists of Pat Durrell ( Youngstown State University ) , Debra Elmegreen ( Vassar College ) , Rupali Chandar ( University of Toledo ) , Jayanne English ( University of Manitoba ) , Jane Charlton , Caryl Gronwal , and Jason Young ( Penn State ) , Panayiotis Tzanavaris ( NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center ) , Kelsey Johnson ( University of Virginia ) , Claudia Mendes de Oliveira ( University of Sao Paulo ) , Brad Whitmore ( STScI ) , Ann Hornschemeier ( NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center ) , Aparna Maybhate ( STScI ) , and Ann Zabludoff ( University of Arizona ) .
The Internet has become one more tool hijacked by corporate interests to accelerate our cultural , political and economic decline .
The great promise of the Internet , to open up dialogue , break down cultural barriers , promote democracy and unleash innovation and creativity , has been exposed as a scam .
The Internet is dividing us into antagonistic clans , in which we chant the same slogans and hate the same enemies , while our creative work is handed for free to Web providers who use it as bait for advertising .
Ask journalists , photographers , musicians , cartoonists or artists what they think of the Web .
Ask movie and film producers .
Ask architects or engineers .
The Web efficiently disseminates content , but it does not protect intellectual property rights .
Writers and artists are increasingly unable to make a living .
And technical professions are under heavy assault .
Anything that can be digitized can and is being outsourced to countries such as India and China where wages are miserable and benefits nonexistent .
Welcome to the new global serfdom where the only professions that pay a living wage are propaganda and corporate management .
The Web , at the same time it is destroying creative work , is forming anonymous crowds that vent collective rage , intolerance and bigotry .
These virtual slums do not expand communication or dialogue .
They do not enrich our culture .
They create a herd mentality in which those who express empathy for “ the enemy ” — and the liberal class is as guilty of this as the right wing — are denounced by their fellow travelers for their impurity .
Racism toward Muslims may be as evil as anti-Semitism , but try to express this simple truth on a partisan Palestinian or Israeli website .
Jaron Lanier , the “ father of virtual reality technology , ” in his new book “ You Are Not a Gadget , ” warns us of this frightening new collectivism .
He notes that the habits imposed by the Internet have reconfigured how we relate to each other .
He writes that “ Web 2.0 , ” “ Open Culture , ” “ Free Software ” and the “ Long Tail ” have become enablers of this new collectivism .
He cites Wikipedia , which consciously erases individual voices , and Google Wave as examples of the rise of mass collective thought and mass emotions .
Google
Wave is a new communication platform that permits users to edit what someone else has said in a conversation when it is displayed as well as allow collaborators to watch each other as they type .
Privacy , honesty and self - reflection are instantly obliterated .
Tastes and information on the Internet are determined by the crowd , what Lanier calls the hive mentality .
Music , books , journalism , commercials and bits of television shows and movies , along with inane YouTube videos , are thrust onto our screens and into national consciousness because of the statistical analysis of Internet crowd preferences .
Lanier says that one of the biggest mistakes he and other computer scientists made when the Internet was developed was allowing contributions to the Internet to go unpaid .
He says decisions such as this have now robbed people , especially those who create , of their ability to make a living and ultimately the capacity for dignity .
Digital collectivism , he warns , is destroying the dwindling vestiges of authentic creativity and innovation , including journalism , which takes time , investment and self - reflection .
And while there are a few sites that do pay for content —
Truthdig being one — the vast majority are parasites .
The only income left for most of those who create is earned through self - promotion , but as Lanier points out this turns culture into nothing but advertising .
It fosters a social ethic in which the capacity for crowd manipulation is more highly valued than truth , beauty or thought .
While the severing of intellectual property rights from their creators , whether journalists , photographers or musicians , means that those who create lose the capacity to make a living from their work , aggregators such as Google make money by collecting and distributing this work to lure advertisers .
Original work on the Internet , as Lanier points out , is “ copied , mashed up , anonymized , analyzed , and turned into bricks in someone else ’s fortress to support an advertising scheme . ”
Lanier warns that if this trend is not halted it will create a “ formula that leaves no way for our nation to earn a living in the long term . ”
“ Funding a civilization through advertising is like trying to get nutrition by connecting a tube from one ’s anus to one ’s mouth , ” Lanier says .
“ The body starts consuming itself .
That is what we are doing online .
As more and more human activity is aggregated , people huddle around the last remaining oases of revenue .
Musicians today might still be able to get paid to make music for video games , for instance , because games are still played in closed consoles and have n’t been collectivized as yet . ”
I called Lanier in San Francisco .
He began by saying that he was not against the Internet , but against how it has evolved .
He has sounded his warning , he said , because he fears that if we fall into an economic tailspin , the Internet , like other innovative systems of mass communication in human history , could be used to exacerbate social enmity and lead to an American totalitarianism .
“ The scenario I can see is America in some economic decline , which we seem determined to enter into because we are unable to make any adjustments , and a lot of unhappy people , ” Lanier said .
“ The preponderance of them are in rural areas and in the red states , the former slave states .
And they are all connected and get angrier and angrier .
What exactly happens ?
Do they start converging on abortion clinics ?
Probably .
Do they start converging on legislatures and take them over ?
I do n’t know , maybe .
I should n’t speak it .
It is almost a curse to imagine these things .
But any intelligent person can see the scenario I am afraid to see .
There is a potential here for very bad stuff to happen .
” And yet the utopian promoters of the Internet tell us that the hive mind , the vast virtual collective , will propel us toward a brave new world .
Lanier dismisses such visions as childish fantasy , one that allows many well - intentioned people to be seduced by an evolving nightmare .
“ The crowd phenomenon exists , but the hive does not exist , ” Lanier told me .
“ All there is , is a crowd phenomenon , which can often be dangerous .
To a true believer , which I certainly am not , the hive is like the baby at the end of ‘ 2001 Space Odyssey . ’
It is a super creature that surpasses humanity .
To me it is the misinterpretation of the old crowd phenomenon with a digital vibe .
It has all the same dangers .
A crowd can turn into a mean mob all too easily , as it has throughout human history . ”
“ There are some things crowds can do , such as count the jelly beans in the jar or guess the weight of the ox , ” Lanier added .
“ I acknowledge this phenomenon is real .
But I propose that the line between when crowds can think effectively as a crowd and when they ca n’t is a little different .
If you read [ James ] Surowiecki’s “ The Wisdom of Crowds , ” he , as well as other theorists , say that if you want a crowd to be wise the key is to reduce the communication flow between the members so they do not influence each other , so they are truly independent and have separate sample points .
It brings up an interesting paradox .
The starting point for online crowd enthusiasts is that connection is good and everyone should be connected .
But when they talk about what makes a crowd smart they say people should not be talking to each other .
They should be isolated .
There is a contradiction there .
What makes a crowd smart is the type of question you ask .
If you ask a group of informed people to choose a single numeric value such as the weight of an ox and they all have some reason to have a theory that is not entirely crazy they will center on the answer .
You can get something useful .
This phenomenon is what accounts for price fitting in capitalism .
This is how markets can function .
If you ask them to create anything , if you ask them to do something constructive or synthetic or engage in compound reasoning then they will fail .
Then you get something dull or an averaging out .
One danger of the crowd is violence , which is when they turn into a mob .
The other is dullness or mundaneness , when you design by committee . ”
Humans , like many other species , Lanier says , have a cognitive switch that permits us to be individuals or members of a mob .
Once we enter the confines of what Lanier calls a clan , even a virtual clan , it possesses dynamics that appeal to the basest instincts within us .
Technology evolves but human nature remains constant .
The 20th century was the bloodiest in human history because human beings married the newly minted tools of efficient state bureaucracies and industrial slaughter with the dark impulses that have existed since the dawn of the human species .
“ You become hypersensitive to the pecking order and to your sense of social status , ” Lanier said of these virtual clans .
“ There is almost always the designated loser in your own group and the designated external enemy .
There is the enemy below and the enemy afar .
There become two classes of disenfranchised people .
You enter into a constant obligation to defend your status which is always being contested .
It is time - consuming to become a member of one of these things .
I see a lot of designs on line that bring this out .
There is a recognizable sequence , whether it is pianos , poodles or jihad ; you see people forming into these clans .
It is playing with fire .
There are plenty of examples of evil in human history that did not involve this effect , such as Jack the Ripper , who worked alone .
But most of the really bad examples of human behavior in history involve invoking this clan dynamic .
No particular sort of person is immune to it .
Geeks are no more immune to it than Germans or Russians or Japanese or Mongolians .
It is part of our nature .
It can be woken up without any leadership structure or politics .
It happens .
It is part of us .
There is a switch inside of us waiting to be turned .
And people can learn to manipulate the switch in others . ”
“ The Machine Stops , ” a story published by E.M. Forster in 1909 , paints a futuristic world where people are mesmerized by virtual reality .
In Forster ’s dystopia , human beings live in isolated , tiny subterranean rooms , like hives , where they are captivated by instant messages and cinematophoes — machines that project visual images .
They cut themselves off from the external world and are absorbed by a bizarre pseudo - reality of voices , sounds , evanescent images and abstract sensations that can be evoked by pressing a few buttons .
The access to the world of the Machine , which has replaced the real world with a virtual world , is provided by an omniscient impersonal voice .
We are , as Forster understood , seduced and then often enslaved by technology , from the combustion engine to computers to robotics .
These marvels of humankind ’s ingenuity are inevitably hijacked by modern slave masters who use the newest technologies to keep us impoverished , confused about our identity and passive .
The Internet , designed by defense strategists to communicate after a nuclear attack , has become the latest technological instrument in the hands of those who are driving us into a state of neofeudalism .
Technology is morally neutral .
It serves the interests of those who control it .
And those who control it today are ravishing journalism , culture and art while they herd the population into clans that fuel intolerance and hatred .
“ A common rationalization in the fledgling world of digital cultures back then was that we were entering a transitional lull before a creative storm — or were already in the eye of the storm , ” Lanier writes in his book .
“ But we were not passing through a momentary calm .
We had , rather , entered a persistent somnolence , and I have come to believe that we will escape it only when we kill the hive . ”
Menu extras are the little icon menus that live over on the right - hand side of your menu bar .
Most people will probably have the Volume and Airport menus , but there are loads more that you can enable .
You can find 26 built in ones located in / System / Library / CoreServices / Menu Extras that you can just double - click to start .
On top of this there are many more that come with applications ( like Evernote , QuickSilver and Tweetie ) and some that are small applications themselves ( like Caffeine , F.lux and iStat menus ) .
If you have a lot of menu extras , you can rearrange them by holding the command key and dragging them around .
To remove one , just hold command and drag it off the menu bar .
One not so well known trick is holding down the Option key when clicking on the menus .

Obama answers failed airline bombing with threat of new wars
By Bill Van Auken
30 December 2009
Three days after the failed attempt by a 23 - year - old Nigerian student to trigger an explosion on a Northwest Airlines passenger jet , President Barack Obama threatened to unleash US military power in Yemen and across the globe .
Obama interrupted his Hawaii vacation Monday to deliver his bellicose remarks in the face of a crescendo of Republican criticism .
The Republican right has tried to exploit the abortive attack in order to indict the Democratic administration as “ soft ” on terrorism .
This campaign has been fueled in part by the claim initially made by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that “ the system worked ” in the incident , which easily could have claimed the lives of 300 passengers and crew members .
In fact , there are serious questions about how the student , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was able to board the plane .
He reportedly bought a one - way ticket , paid for in cash , and checked no luggage .
Moreover , according to an account given by fellow passengers , he and an accomplice had tried to get him on the flight without showing a passport .
On Tuesday , the Associated Press cited unnamed intelligence officials as stating that they had recordings of conversations between Abdulmutallab and at least one member of al Qaeda .
His father had informed the US Embassy in Lagos more than a month earlier that his son had fallen in with Islamist extremists in Yemen , which resulted in his name being placed on a terror watch list .
Any one of these things should have triggered intense scrutiny .
That they did not suggests the possibility that Abdulmutallab ’s boarding the flight was facilitated from within the national security apparatus , allowing him to carry out an action that is now being used to justify yet another US military intervention abroad .
Clearly , the Republicans in Congress have no interest in probing any of these issues .
Rather , they are trying to turn the failed bombing into an argument in defense of torture , for keeping open the US prison camp at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and to vindicate all of the criminal policies of the Bush administration .
Obama ’s response has been an attempt to outflank his Republican critics from the right by threatening another expansion of US militarist aggression .
There can be little doubt that this will be supplemented with intensified attacks on democratic rights and the continuation of the policies of torture and preventive detention .
In his remarks Monday , Obama vowed “ to use every element of our national power to disrupt , to dismantle , and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us — whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan , Yemen or Somalia , or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the US homeland . ”
The US administration is already in the midst of an escalation that is sending another 30,000 US troops into Afghanistan .
It has mounted an intensified campaign of Predator drone missile attacks against Pakistan , while , according to recent press reports , also sending Special Operations units and CIA operatives into the country to conduct covert assassination and “ snatch and grab ” missions .
It has justified these acts of military aggression as a necessary defense of the “ homeland ” against terrorist attacks , the same rationale given by the Bush administration for launching the eight - year - old war in Afghanistan as well as the invasion and occupation of Iraq , now in its seventh year .
Now , the Obama White House is preparing to unleash “ every element of our national power ” against Yemen and Somalia , and perhaps other nations yet unnamed .
The Pentagon and the CIA are already involved in semi-covert operations in both of these countries .
In Somalia , having organized a proxy invasion by US - assisted Ethiopian troops in 2006 , Washington is now channeling arms and other military aid to the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) , while carrying out clandestine assassination raids by American commandos operating from US warships .
In Yemen , US warplanes have carried out repeated strikes against purported Al Qaeda targets as well as against Shia rebels known as the Huthis in the country ’s northwest .
Washington has cemented increasingly close relations with the repressive dictatorship of Field Marshal Ali Abdullah Saleh , dispatching top officials , including Central Command chief General David Petraeus and Obama ’s counterterrorism advisor , John Brennan , to the Yemeni capital of Sana’a .
The December 25 bombing attempt on the Northwest flight may now be used to make the US military interventions in both countries more direct , overt and deadly .
In his remarks Monday , Obama justified these actions as a means of keeping the American public “ safe and secure ” in the face of what he termed “ a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those who threaten our homeland . ”
The reality is that the military actions being prepared by Washington will have just the opposite effect .
If the statement attributed to the group Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula claiming responsibility is to be believed , the attempted airline bombing was undertaken in retaliation for the December 17 US bombing of Yemen that claimed the lives of more than 60 civilians , nearly half of them women and children .
What does the December 25 incident reveal about “ the nature of those who threaten our homeland ” ?
Abdulmutallab , the son of one of Nigeria ’s wealthiest bankers , was apparently radicalized while attending the prestigious University College London .
Like millions of young Muslims , most from far less privileged backgrounds , he undoubtedly was outraged by the images of dead and wounded men , women and children produced by the US invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as by the slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza by Washington ’s closest ally and client state , Israel .
That this anger is channeled into the retrograde Islamist politics and reactionary terrorist methods of groups like Al Qaeda is no accident .
These organizations represent in a real sense Washington ’s Frankenstein ’s monster .
For decades , the CIA promoted Islamist movements ranging from the Muslim Brotherhood to the precursor of Hamas as a means of undermining socialist and left - nationalist movements in the Middle East .
This policy found its most lethal expression in Afghanistan , where Washington spent billions of dollars in financing and arming an Islamist insurgency against the Soviet - backed regime in Kabul , triggering a war that devastated the country and killed more than 1 million Afghans .
It was in this war , initiated in 1978 , that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda got their start .
Similarly , in Yemen , as part of its Cold War crusade , Washington backed the Islamist regime in the North against secular nationalists in the South who called themselves socialists and forged ties with Moscow .
In the country ’s 1994 civil war , Yemenis returning from fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan played a prominent role in helping to secure the rule of Saleh .
That the Obama administration is now threatening to launch offensives in Yemen and Somalia , supposedly to root out terrorism , only exposes similar justifications for the wars in Afghanistan - Pakistan and Iraq as a fraud against the people of the United States and the world .
Three hundred innocent people nearly lost their lives in Detroit on December 25 .
If they had , their deaths would have been one more episode of “ collateral damage ” in a military offensive by US imperialism that has cost the lives of well over a million people over the past eight years in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere .
These military campaigns have been driven by the interests of US capitalism in asserting dominance over the strategic oil supplies as well as the pipelines and shipping routes of the Middle East and Central Asia .
In targeting Yemen and Somalia , Washington is preparing to militarily straddle the Bab el - Mandeb Strait , giving it control of the chokepoint in a key route for shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to the West .
America ’s ruling financial elite is pursuing these aims with cold - blooded indifference to the loss of human life that they entail , including among innocent American civilians forced to pay the price for the criminal acts of their government .
For lots of factors , many that you do n’t realize , you are carrying much more pounds than you would like to .
Why is it that you have always struggled with your weight but your greatest friend by no means has ?
Why is the fact that we all know someone who can “ eat anything they want ” and never gain a single pound , whilst all you must do is look at a piece of chocolate and you acquire three pounds ?
Do n’t focus on your scale .
If you are always weighing yourself , you can feel disappointed .
If you are working out , you are likely putting on muscle , which is heavier than fat .
Examine how your clothes fit , instead , and you ’ll know whether you are succeeding .
A 2008 study of bariatric surgeons indicates they are suggesting anywhere from 60 grams of protein a day to as many as 105 grams of protein a day , depending upon the surgeon and the patient .
At a minimum , that means we need about 20 grams per meal three times a day .
Without falling back to protein bars , shakes or powders here are some quick meal suggestions that come in at 21 grams of protein and a volume of 1 - cup or less food .
With busy lives , weight loss is very hard to squeeze in .
More people are turning to weight loss surgery face as a result .
Some people find it necessary to lose weight due to a medical condition .
Regardless of your reasons for considering weight loss surgery face , you need to make sure that you are a good candidate for it .
If you are , then you can explore your options further .
Ignorance is bliss , so do not get on the weight scales .
You will be disappointed if you are using the scale to constantly gauge your progress .
If you have included exercise in your weight loss plan , the muscle you build is heavier than fat , meaning your weight may not change as much as you expect .
A better indication of how well you are doing is by monitoring the fit of your clothing .
Indeed , the concept that permanent weight loss is a change of lifestyle is exactly about will power .
Changing lifestyle means changing your everyday decisions to agree with the desire to have a healthy weight .
Obesity is no laughing matter and the battle with the bulge is always an uphill climb .
The number of casualties is just a reminder that it is difficult to quit life - long destructive habits that cause obesity such as lack of exercise , poor eating habits , and a predilection for greasy food .
In some cases , the condition is caused by the body ’s zealous production of steroid hormones or it could be a lazy thyroid gland .
For some unlucky individuals , the culprit is genetics .

Police named a 33 - year - old Tel Aviv man as a suspect in an investigation into Internet pedophilia on Monday , saying he may have contacted as many as 1,000 girls .
Avinoam Braverman , who once served in a specialized IDF computer unit , allegedly targeted girls aged eight to 15 in recent years , luring them into text - based and video communications , in which he exposed himself , masturbated in front of them and convinced at least three of them to have sex with him .
Braverman is suspected of rape , sodomizing minors , indecent acts , sexual harassment and possessing and distributing pedophilic materials .
Police are also checking to see if he was in touch with other pedophiles .
“ He is one of the most sophisticated suspects we have come across , ” a spokesman for the police ’s Lahav 433 unit ’s Computer Crimes Division , which led the investigation , toldOn three occasions , virtual relations crossed the line into the real world , police said , adding that they are looking for more victims .
Braverman would convince the girls to let him visit after they came home from school , and before their parents returned from work , police said .
He allegedly calculated with cold precision the time he had to have sex with the girls .
Some of the virtual relationships went on for months , until the youngsters agreed to meet with Braverman , police said .
In some cases , he would “ convince the girls to pretend to be sick , thereby giving him time to meet them at home when their parents were away , ” police added .
“ The suspect drove to the girls ’ homes , or would invite them to his home , and pay their travel expenses .
He would offer them other treats , like a trip , or pizza , ” police said .
Online , Braverman allegedly exploited everyday Web technology to satisfy his pedophilic urges .
“ The suspect would send close - up images of his genitals and carry out indecent acts before the girls until reaching climax , ” police said in a statement .
“ He convinced the girls to carry out indecent acts .
“ Girls ’ underwear was found in the suspect ’s home .
He would take them after having sexual relations .
Furry dolls were also recovered – he would apparently hand them out to the girls , ” officers said .
According to police , Braverman would spend months and years building up virtual relations .
He allegedly used an array of screen names , such as “ Mos , ” “ Tomcat , ” “ Avi ” or “ Avinoam , ” and posed as a man in his early 20s while frequenting Web sites targeted at children and youths .
“ He would invite the minors to private conversations on ICQ and MSN Messenger , and begin sexually harassing them during the chats , ” police said .
The suspect was arrested on January 6 , and has had his custody extended repeatedly by the Rishon Lezion Magistrate ’s Court .
A partial gag order on the case was lifted on Monday .
Police are asking to keep him in custody until the end of legal proceedings .
Ch. -Supt .
Udi Shefran , head of the Lahav 433 unit ’s Computer CrimesDivision , said a great deal of evidence has been amassed against thesuspect , including computers with pedophilic images of young girlsseized from his home .
Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said , “ This case shows that while the Internet can be a positive tool , italso leaves minors utterly exposed .
I would urge all parents to monitortheir children ’s Internet activities .
” Police are asking every parent who suspects their daughter fell victimto the suspect to contact the Computer Crimes Division at ( 08 ) 954-5389 .
I am researching the extraordinary history of the West 's relationship to Afghanistan over the past 200 years .
It is a very complex , and sometimes weird , story .
These are notes on some of the characters and episodes involved .
Part One - 1971
There are many individuals and fragmentary events that have led to the present situation in Afghanistan .
But there was a moment in 1971 when four separate things happened in and around Kabul that in their different ways reached back into the past and forward into the future .
That year the BBC sent a film crew to Kabul to recreate the first great military disaster of the British Empire - the retreat from Kabul in 1841 .
The BBC began by gathering Afghan tribesmen together to be extras .
They acted out being taught cricket by the British .
The Afghans then pretended to be fierce rebels storming out of the Kabul Bazaar to attack the British camp outside the city .

The BBC 's adviser was Louis Dupree .
He was an American who had lived in Kabul since 1955 .
He will appear in many different ways in this story .
But for the moment all you need to know is that he had once walked the route of the British retreat alone in winter , and also that he knew everyone in power in Kabul .
Dupree had noticed that the demonstrations by the students at Kabul University were increasing , and often degenerating into fights .
At the end of 1970 he took a photograph of one .
It is grainy and indistinct , but he had caught a moment which was to have immense consequences for everyone in Afghanistan , and around the world .
Kabul university had been created by the West , in particular by America and West Germany .
Then the Soviet Union decided they had to pour money in too .
So they built the enormous Kabul Polytechnic .
Both were seedbeds for western ideas , Foreign students and teachers from the west had flooded in and with them came the modern revolutionary ideas from the campuses in Europe and America .
And very quickly the Kabul students set up a wide range of Leninist and Maoist groups .
Dupree had captured the moment when those groups had begun to confront a new group of revolutionaries on campus .
They were the Islamists .
The Islamists too had taken revolutionary ideas from the West but they had fused them with Islam .
One of the Islamist groups had found a poem written by a Leninist student that praised Lenin using a term reserved only for the prophet Mohammed .
They sneakily showed it to a group of conservative mullahs in Kabul and all hell broke loose .
All sorts of people were in and around the demonstrations and battles that followed and many of them will appear later in this story .
Kabul was trying to imitate the West in other ways .
Abdul Habib Aziz had recently opened the only supermarket in Afghanistan .
Then in the spring of 1971 one of Italy 's leading conceptual artists turned up in Kabul and decided to buy the building above Mr Aziz 's supermarket and turn it into a hotel .
The artist was called Alighiero e Boetti .
Boetti is a fascinating and mysterious figure .
He was part of the artistic avant - garde that emerged from 1960s radicalism in Italy .
Boetti was fascinated by chance and randomness .
He would post letters to other artists he knew with the wrong address and then show the ones that were returned .
His works often had secret codes built into them .
Some of the codes have been cracked , others remain mysterious .
No -one knows if the hotel was a conceptual art - work in itself or just somewhere for him and his friends to stay .
But what is certain is that Boetti saw in Afghanistan a way of solving what he saw as the central crisis in the West , the overwhelming belief in the individual as an inspired creator .
Boetti had started as a member of the Arte Povera group .
Like many avant - garde groups at that time they wanted to challenge the ' system ' , and to do that they attacked the notion of self - expression and the creation of things and objects - which they believed was central to consumer capitalism .
Boetti said that what he saw in Afghanistan was the opposite .
It was a country empty of created things .
" Afghan homes , for example , are empty : no furniture therefore no objects commonly placed on furniture .
There are only a few carpets and mattresses on which people lie down , drink , smoke and eat .
I also like the fact that Afghans wear the same clothes at day and at night .
Nothing has been added to the landscape .
Rocks are moved and used to build cube houses .
The resistance with which Afghans oppose our civilisation has always amazed me . "
Following his principles Boetti found Abib and Fatima .
They were embroiderers , and he gave them maps of the world as it was then in 1971 with all its borders .
It was , he said , a given diagram of power in the world .
He asked the two women to create a series of embroidered maps where each country would be coloured by its own flag .
After that Boetti said , I did nothing .
And 500 women started making the maps overseen by Abib and Fatima .
Just as the Afghan student revolutionaries had strange dreams of the west which they were going to try and impose on Afghanistan , so Boetti was trying to use a strange fantasy version of Afghanistan to free himself from the conventions of the west .
Meanwhile the BBC crew had moved location along the road to Jalalabad .
They were retracing the terrible retreat of British soldiers when out of 16,000 only one man made it the 115 miles .
Again the BBC used local tribesmen to act out the massacre - showing how their ancestors had poured fire down on the terrified British soldiers .

The tone of the BBC programme is of its time .
It is determined also to show the dark side of the British Empire , the horrific acts of cruelty ordered by the British high command .
It is saying - we may have lost an empire but we have become better people , and such horrors will never happen again .
At the end of the film is a scene showing how the British would tie Indian rebels to cannon muzzles and blow them to pieces .
But a few years ago that section was edited out and you have to get special permission to show it .
Things had changed again .
It is very horrific and absolutely not for the squeamish , but if you want to have a look at it - here it is .

As the BBC were filming a group of students from Nottingham University drove past .
They were a group of mountaineers who were on their way to their first expedition outside Europe .
They were going to climb a peak in the Hindu Kush called Koh - i- Khaaik .
Their leader was called Peter Boardman .
He would become one of the world 's most famous climbers , but this particular trip was going to go terribly wrong .
In 1977 Boardman recorded a description to camera of what happened both literally , and inside his own mind during his terrifying ordeal .
And how Afghanistan had haunted him ever since .
