Building on prior work by Matt Simmons and Kenneth Deffeyes , I have written a number of articles on Net Oil Exports , often with my frequent co-author , “ Khebab , ” most recently , “ Net Oil Exports and the Iron Triangle . ”
We are going to present a quantitative assessment of future net exports by the top net exporters at the ASPO - USA ( Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas ) conference in October , in Houston , Texas , and we will be doing a preview of the paper in late September .
You can also check out Jason Bradford 's recent interview with Jeff for The Reality Report over at Global Public Media here .
This is a guest post by Friend of TOD Jeffrey J. Brown , an independent petroleum geologist in the Dallas , Texas area .
His e-mail address is westexas@aol.com .
Above the fold was a graph of the Export Land Model ( ELM ) , for a hypothetical net exporter , showed peak exports to net importer status in nine years .
( For a better explanation of the meaning of that chart , check out this post . )
It ’s interesting that the UK and Indonesia showed even sharper net export declines , going from peak recent net exports to net importer status in seven years and eight years respectively .
The ELM and the UK and Indonesia case histories showed that net export declines tend to accelerate with time .
Note that the early data for Saudi Arabia are showing a similar pattern .
The 2005 to 2006 numbers for Saudi Arabia are as follows ( exponential increase / decrease per year , EIA , Total Liquids ) :
Production : - 3.7%/ year
Consumption : +5.7%/ year
Net Exports : - 5.5%/ year
Extrapolating from year to date numbers , my estimates for 2006 to 2007 Saudi numbers are as follows ( I am adding in some increased liquids consumption , because of their ongoing natural gas shortfall ) :
Production : - 5.6%/ year
Consumption : +10 %/ year
Net Exports : - 9.5%/ year
In addition , EIA data show an overall decline in net world exports from 2005 to 2006 that appears to be continuing into 2007 .
Given this decline in net exports ,
It ’s interesting that we have “ near record high ” crude oil inventories in the US , based on the five year range of crude oil inventories .
In my opinion , the five year range for US crude oil inventories , as an indication of what is going on in oil markets , is highly misleading .
First , the industry has clearly gone to a Just In Time inventory system .
In the Eighties , the industry maintained much higher crude oil inventories , especially in terms of Days of Supply , which have fallen to about 21 Days of Supply currently , from about 29 Days of Supply in September , 1982 .
Second , we need to evaluate crude oil inventories based on Days of Supply in excess of Minimum Operating Level ( MOL ) .
In the US , the MOL for crude oil is probably about 270 million barrels ( mb ) .
At about 322 mb , US crude oil inventories are probably best characterized by Hours of Supply in excess of MOL ( about 80 hours ) .
In my opinion , recent fluctuations in US crude oil inventories merely reflect minor changes in a thin margin of supply in excess of MOL .
Refiners are unlikely to let their inventories drop below certain critical levels , and given the expectation of declining world oil exports , refiners will have two choices : ( 1 ) Bid the price up enough to keep their inventories up and / or ( 2 ) Reduce their crude oil input , thus reducing product output .
My contention is that instead of focusing on crude oil inventories , we need to focus on world net exports , crude oil prices , refinery utilization , product prices and product inventories .
I expect to see crude oil exports trending down , crude oil prices trending up , refinery utilization trending down , product prices trending up , and product inventories trending down .
DAVENPORT , Iowa —
At a town hall meeting here last night , Rudolph W. Giuliani expanded upon his views of torture .
Here is a transcript of the exchange .
Linda Gustitus , who is the president of a group called the National Religious Campaign Against Torture , began her question by saying that President Bush ’s nominee for attorney general , Michael B. Mukasey ( who happens to be an old friend of Mr. Giuliani ’s ) had “ fudged ” on the question of whether waterboarding is toture .
Video
“ I wanted to ask you two questions , ’’ she said .
“ One , do you think waterboarding is torture ?
And two , do you think the president can order something like waterboarding even though it ’s against U.S. and international law ? ’’
Mr. Giuliani responded : “ O.K . First of all , I do n’t believe the attorney general designate in any way was unclear on torture .
I think Democrats said that ; I do n’t think he was . ’’
Ms. Gustitus said : “ He said he did n’t know if waterboarding is torture . ”
Mr. Giuliani said : “ Well , I ’m not sure it is either .
I ’m not sure it is either .
It depends on how it ’s done .
It depends on the circumstances .
It depends on who does it .
I think the way it ’s been defined in the media , it should n’t be done .
The way in which they have described it , particularly in the liberal media .
So I would say , if that ’s the description of it , then I can agree , that it should n’t be done .
But I have to see what the real description of it is .
Because I ’ve learned something being in public life as long as I have .
And I hate to shock anybody with this , but the newspapers do n’t always describe it accurately . ”
( Applause )
“ If I ca n’t figure out that there ’s been a significant media bias against this war , then I should n’t be running for president of the United States . ”
( Applause )
“ Sometimes they describe it accurately .
Sometimes they exaggerate it .
So I ’d have to see what they really are doing , not the way some of these liberal newspapers have exaggerated it . ”
“ Now , on the question of torture .
We should not torture .
America should not stand for torture , America should not allow torture .
But America should engage in aggressive questioning of Islamic terrorists who are arrested or who are apprehended .
Because if we do n’t we leave ourselves open to significant attack . ”
“ And the line between the two is very delicate and very difficult .
But we ca n’t abandon aggressive questioning of people who are intent on coming here to kill us .
Or killing us overseas .
I think that that ’s the point that the attorney general designate was trying to make . ”
“ And the powers of the president are pretty significant in protecting the national security of the United States .
They always have been .
So I think what he was also trying to do was protect the powers of the United States to deal with unforeseen circumstances like the hypothetical we were asked during one debate – I ’ve forgotten which one :
If there was a terrorist attack on an American city , and it was clear that there were all going to be additional attacks , some of them were going to be nuclear , and they were planned for the next couple of days and one of the people involved in it was arrested , and the head of the C.I.A. came to you and said we have to do certain things to get the information from him , would you authorize it ?
And I think most of us answered it , yes we would , we would authorize doing whatever we thought was the most effective to get that information . ”
“ The president has to have that kind of leeway .
We ’ve got to trust our president well enough to allow that .
If we surround this so much with procedure , we ’re going to have some unforeseen circumstance in which a president ’s not going to feel comfortable making the right decision , particularly if you have the wrong person there . “
“ So I think America should never be for torture .
America should be against torture .
It violates the Geneva Convention .
Certainly when we ’re dealing with armed combatants , we should n’t get near anything like that .
There is a distinction , sometimes , when you ’re dealing with terrorists .
You may have to use means that are a little tougher . ”
“ And I see , when the Democrats are talking about torture , they ’re not just talking about even this definition of waterboarding , which again , if you look at the liberal media and you look at the way they describe it , you could say it was torture and you should n’t do it .
But they talk about sleep deprivation .
I mean , on that theory , I ’m getting tortured running for president of the United States .
That ’s plain silly .
That ’s silly . ’’
“ That comes from people who have never investigated a real criminal case , never investigated organized crime .
You know how I put hundreds of Mafia people in jail ?
And I helped to put thousands in Italy in jail ?
You know how I did it ?
I did it by electronic surveillance and aggressive questioning .
None of them wanted to give me the information .
They did n’t walk into my office and say , ‘ I want to tell you about all of those Mafia murders … ”
“ They got ‘em because we arrested them , we got very significant charges on them , and we questioned them for long , long periods of time .
With very aggressive techniques .
Never ever tortured anybody .
I can tell you that .
Would never allow it .
Do n’t know of any situation in which the F.B.I. did it . ’’
“ And then , please have a better view of the men and women who serve you in law enforcement and in the intelligence services . ’’
( Applause )
‘’I know the liberal media paints them like , you know – These are the good guys , not the bad guys .
They really are .
I mean these are the people who put their lives at risk to protect you and me .
These are people of scruples , honor , decency .
They do n’t want to torture anybody .
They have no desire to harm anybody .
What they are dealing with sometimes are these enormously difficult life and death situations , in which there is a possibility of getting information about a group of troops that are going to be killed , and they ’re going to have to go tell their mothers and fathers that they were killed and there ’s a chance maybe of stopping it .
Or there are these – I mean , suppose some of the people who were going to do Sept. 11 had been captured beforehand .
We sure as heck would want some very aggressive questioning to find out what they knew . ’’
“ So let ’s be careful on how we define this .
And , sure we should be against torture .
But we should not be against aggressive questioning .
And the line between the two is going to require some really difficult decisions about drawing it and kind of trusting each other with the discretion for the president to make decisions about what has to be done in the interests of the American people . ’’
“ I have known every American president since Gerald Ford .
I knew Richard Nixon , but before he was president .
I met him , I did n’t know him .
I ca n’t say I knew Richard Nixon .
But I ’ve known every American president since Gerald Ford .
Some Republicans , some Democrats .
I ca n’t think of a one that would ever want to see somebody tortured .
Also ca n’t think of a one that would n’t have the courage to make some tough decisions to protect the lives of the American people .
And that ’s the kind of person you have to have as president of the United States . ’’

I can't put it any better than they do at The Gavel :
President Bush , moments ago : I ’m joined by veterans and military families here to express support to our troops and their mission in Iraq .
I want to thank you all for being here today .
We ’ve just finished a reay good meeting .
In our discussions , these folks had a message that all of us in Washington need to hear .
It is time to rise above partisanship , stand behind our troops in the field , and give them everything they need to succeed .
In February I submitted to Congress a Defense Department spending bill for the upcoming fiscal year that will provide funds to upgrade our equipment for our troops in Iraq and provides a pay raise for our military - a comprehensive spending request - that Congress has failed to act on .
President Bush , May 16 , 2007 : Military Pay : The Administration strongly opposes sections 601 and 606 .
The additional 0.5 percent increase above the President ’s proposed 3.0 percent across - the - board pay increase is unnecessary .
Republicans and their " fiscal responsibility . "
Record breaking deficits , but all in the name of " national security . "
Unless you 're actually taking bullets for that " national security , " that is .
If so , then George W. Bush says screw you .
These are hard times in America .
There 's broad agreement our nation has lost its way and the U.S. is no longer " the shining light on the hill . "
We do n't trust our leaders or believe national politicians care about the common good .
Americans are uncertain and depressed .
Depression has become a persistent feature of our national character .
One in four Americans suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder .
It 's usually clinical depression characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in favorite activities .
Depression 's symptoms include anxiety , change in eating habits - over - or under-eating , insomnia , fatigue , irritability , helplessness , pessimism , difficulty making decisions , morbid thoughts , loss of interest in pleasurable activities , and persistent physical complaints that do not respond to treatment .
Depression is now the leading cause of disability in North America .
The depression epidemic explains why Americans have been so passive in the face of the continuing outrages of the Bush Administration :
It 's the reason why our fellow citizens did n't protest the stolen election of 2000 ; or the invasion of Iraq ; or Bush 's subversion of the constitution - to name only three misdeeds .
In his October 14th Op - Ed , The ' Good Germans ' Among Us , New York Times columnist Frank Rich discussed our national passivity .
Rich attributed it to the duplicity of the Bush Administration : " It was always the White House 's plan to coax us into a blissful ignorance about the war ...
[ They ] invited our passive complicity by requiring no shared sacrifice .
A country that knows there 's no such thing as a free lunch was all too easily persuaded there could be a free war . "
Perhaps Frank Rich is right and Americans were lulled into lethargy by a sinister plan hatched by George Bush and Dick Cheney .
It 's plausible their well - oiled propaganda machine convinced us " war is peace , freedom is slavery , and ignorance is strength . "
Perhaps .
But I find it hard to accept Rich 's explanation because I do n't believe the Bush - Cheney gang is that smart or their propaganda that compelling .
It 's also tempting to explain national apathy as a consequence of the declining intelligence of the American people .
Observing the amount of media attention lavished on flea wits such as Paris Hilton and Brittany Spears , it 's easy to conclude that between watching hours of television and sucking up mega - doses of corn syrup , our fellow citizens have deep - fried their brains .
This explanation suggests the Bush Administration has gotten away with their shenanigans because the majority of the American public either does n't understand what the White House is doing or does n't care - we 've become self - centered dolts .
Nonetheless , while there 's certainly compelling evidence we 've become a nation of sheep , I continue to believe the majority of our people are smart enough to see the big picture : we get it , we just do n't do anything about it .
That leaves depression as the logical explanation for our passivity :
We 've been immobilized by our depression .
The question is what caused this .
It was n't all that long ago - the sixties - when Americans were hopeful ; when we believed : " Tomorrow will be a better day .
We can build a peaceful world . "
Then came an enervating message that bred helplessness and despair .
Since the Reagan era , conservatives have broadcast a grim homily : " You 're on your own .
No matter how dire your circumstances , no matter how unfairly life treats you , do n't count on government to help you . "
This conservative ideology reached its nadir after 9/11 when President Bush told traumatized Americans there was nothing they could do to ease their fear and anxiety except to go shopping .
As the plight of the average citizen worsened , so did the national mood : in the sixties most of us believed the future would be better for our children , now we do n't .
Over this same period we became a nation of depressives .
It 's not only that one in four of us has a diagnosed mental disorder , but also that millions of Americans self medicate : we take prescription drugs for depression - antidepressants are now the most frequently prescribed drugs -- or use daily palliatives such as alcohol or marijuana .
There are millions more who suffer from the symptoms of depression - chronic anxiety or fatigue , eating disorders , or irritability - and never seek help , who stagger through each day in a funk .
And there are millions of Americans who feel chronic helplessness in the face of an Administration that does n't listen to the cries of the average person and seems determined to implement their evil agenda regardless of the consequences .
These are hard times .
There 's a rogue President in the White House and the good ship USA is heading into increasingly treacherous waters .
There 's good reason to be discouraged but not to be defeated .
After all , U.S. history teaches us that Americans have lived through hard times before : the civil war , great depression , and World War II - to mention only three perilous periods .
We can take solace in the knowledge that during historic hard times , Americans have always come together and worked for the common good .
That 's what we need to do now .
The next President must preach a message of hope and invite us to make a shared sacrifice for the good of the country .
And , to help cure our national depression .

Special Report
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosure filings have nearly doubled from a year ago and more people could lose their homes in 2008 , according to a report released Thursday .
In October , 224,451 foreclosure filings were reported nationwide , up 94 percent from October 2006 and up 2 percent from September , according to RealtyTrac .
In the month , 53,609 U.S. homeowners were forced out of homes repossessed by banks , up from 20,768 a year ago , the firm said .
Through October , a total of 309,557 homes have been repossessed by banks leading to forced evictions .
" Some people are in over their heads , owing more than what they can sell their house for , " said Realty Trac spokesman Daren Blomquist .
For the full year , Realty Trac expects 2 million homes to have entered the foreclosure process - including bank repossessions , default notices and auction sale notices .
Foreclosures could hit homeowners even harder in the beginning of 2008 , Blomquist said .
Homeowners experiencing trouble in the fall may not see a foreclosure notice until the January or later , he said .
On top of that , adjustable - rate mortgages are scheduled to reset in greater numbers through 2008 , sending homeowners ' monthly mortgage payments higher , possibly to unmanageable levels .
" The other side of the vise pressing on these people is that it 's harder to refinance because lenders ' standards are tighter , " Blomquist added .
In October , Nevada saw the highest foreclosure rate in the nation for the tenth straight month , with one foreclosure for every 154 households , according to the report .
The national foreclosure rate for the month was one filing for every 555 households .
While California foreclosure activity decreased nearly 2 percent from the previous month , the state 's foreclosure rate still ranked second highest , with one foreclosure filing for every 258 households .
And while October foreclosure activity was down more than 9 percent from the previous month in Florida , the state saw one foreclosure filing for every 273 households .
It ranked No. 3 nationwide .
Among city foreclosure rates , California cities took six out of the top 10 spots in October , with Merced topping the list .
Stockton , Modesto , Riverside - San Bernardino , Vallejo - Fairfield and Sacramento also were in the top 10 .
Las Vegas , Detroit , Cape Coral - Fort Myers , Fla. , and Cleveland were also among the cities with the highest foreclosure rates .

For a decade , the legislative push for " abstinence only " sex education has suggested that nonmarital sex negatively affects a teen 's mental health .
But a new study shows that the negative mental side effects of a teen 's loss of virginity are confined to a small proportion of those who have sex -- specifically , young girls and both boys and girls who have sex earlier than their peers and whose relationships are uncommitted and ultimately fall apart .
Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , Ann Meier , University of Minnesota assistant professor of sociology , studied 8,563 seventh - through 12th - graders over an 18 - month period , measuring for depression and low self - esteem .
Meier compared the mental health of teens who did n't have sex to teens who were virgins at the beginning of the study , but who lost their virginity during the 18 - month period .
She found that while the majority of teens did not experience depression as a result of first - time sex , some did -- those being the youngest teens ( girls who had sex before age 15 and boys who had sex before 14 ) and whose relationship was not emotionally close and dissolved after sex .
Girls in this group were particularly vulnerable to depression .
Meier believes it 's the combination of these factors that make young teens most vulnerable to depression or low self - esteem after first - time sex .
" Being female or younger than the average age at first - time sex among your peers increases the chance of depression , as does a lack of commitment or intimacy within the relationship and what happens to the relationship after first - time sex , " said Meier .
" For girls in uncommitted relationships , ending a relationship with sex has more of an impact on mental health than ending that same relationship if it did not involve sex . "
The risk of suffering mental health problems from having sex as a teen is relatively low , but Meier said low risk still represents a large group of teens affected , as half the teen population is having sex .
She cautioned that the study does not suggest that positive effects result from first - time sex among teens and said she hopes it will help policy - makers focus help on those most vulnerable rather than promoting a one - size - fits - all approach .
Meier 's study , " Adolescent First Sex and Subsequent Mental Health , " will be published in the May issue of the American Journal of Sociology .
Claim : A jocular Pepsi “ offer ” obligated them to provide a $ 33.8 million Harrier jet to a consumer who claimed it for $ 700,000 .
FALSE
Origins :
In 1996 PepsiCo ran a promotion through which consumers who collected empty Pepsi containers could earn “ Pepsi Points ” that could be redeemed for hats , jackets , bikes and other such merchandise .
( To gain a
“ Pepsi Points ” T - shirt , for instance , took 80 points , or the equivalent of 40 two - liter Pepsi bottles . )
Kicking off the “ Buy Pepsi , Get Stuff ” campaign was a playful television commercial showcasing a number of the items being offered .
This controversial ad showed a suburban teen preparing for school and wearing a number of Pepsi items , such as a T - shirt , a leather jacket , and sunglasses .
As the items were depicted , words at the bottom of the screen revealed how many “ Pepsi Points ” they cost .
The commercial concluded with the teen landing a Harrier jet near a bike rack at his school and the plane ’s searing jet stream stripping a teacher to his underwear .
The smug teen says , “ Sure beats the bus , ” before the words “ Harrier Fighter : 7,000,000 Pepsi Points ” appeared on the screen .
Enter John Leonard , then a 21 - year - old business student .
Upon seeing that commercial and discovering he could purchase individual Pepsi points from the company for 10 ¢ each , he set about to get himself a Harrier at an unbelievable bargain
rate .
On 28 March 1996 , Leonard forked over 15 original points plus a check for $ 700,008.50 raised from five investors for the remaining 6,999,985 points “ plus shipping and handling ” and demanded his jet .
Pepsi laughed off the claim , pointing out the Harrier had never been offered in the Pepsi Points catalogue and was just in the commercial to provide a humorous completion to the piece .
“ If we have to put disclaimers on spots that are obviously farces , where does it end ? ” Pepsi spokesman Jon Harris said .
Well , it did n’t end there .
Leonard filed suit in Miami against Pepsi for breach of contract , fraud , deceptive and unfair trade practices , and misleading advertising .
The issue then landed in federal court in Manhattan with Pepsi responding by asking the court for a declaratory judgment saying it did not have to give Leonard a Harrier .
In August 1999 , the New York judge upheld Pepsi ’s case .
“ No objective person could reasonably have concluded that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier jet , ” U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said .
Not that Leonard would have ended up with the full jet anyway if things had gone his way .
The Pentagon quashed the promotion in September 1997 when it announced that these $ 33.8 million jets are not for sale in flyable shape .
The Pentagon said any of the Marine aircraft would have to be “ demilitarized ” before being offered to the public ( including disabling the Harriers ’ ability to take off and land vertically ) , which in this case would have meant both stripping them of their armaments and rendering them unable to fly .

The executive branch ignores the law .
That 's the unvarnished way of summing up the results of a new study by Congress 's nonpartisan Government Accountability Office , which took a look at 19 legal provisions formally challenged by the Bush administration but signed into law as elements of larger bills .
In six cases , federal agencies disobeyed the law , the GAO revealed .
President Bush has made it a practice to formally protest sections of bills that he signs into law through the use of " signing statements , " orders that invoke presidential authority in implementing a statute .
In a mega-exertion of executive power , Bush has challenged over 1,100 sections of various bills , more than all presidential administrations combined .
Some of the more noted provisions that Bush did n't like are :
A federal ban on torture .
A request for more information about the use of the USA
Patriot Act .
A requirement that authorities obtain judicial warrants to open U.S. mail .
The GAO did n't look at the more controversial signing statements the president has used .
Instead , one example from the study involved a Congressional directive that U.S. Customs and Border Protection move its Tuscon checkpoints every week in an attempt to stop illegal immigration .
But the agency interpreted the law differently .
Almost like it was n't a law .
CBP merely shut down its checkpoints for periods of time , rather than move them .
Vacation , anyone ?
Here 's more from the Boston Globe which has a good story on the matter :
" Of the other five laws that the study found were disobeyed , two provisions required agencies to get permission from a congressional committee before taking certain actions .
In both cases , the agencies notified the committee but acted without their permission – just as
Bush 's signing statements instructed them .
The other three provisions involved the executive branch giving information to congressional oversight committees , including plans for emergency housing following a disaster ; budget documents related to certain military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan ; and a proposal to fix a problem related to funding for military medical services .
In all three cases , the administration did not obey the laws as written . "

A New Inflation Measure : The Grateful Dead Inflation Index ( September 22 , 2007 )
Astute reader Michael M. recently wrote :
" I would love to see you dedicate an essay to core inflation .
how is it calculated ?
who calculates it ?
what are the relationships between who calculates it or determines the how and the people who use it for their own economic purposes and even a history of the number . "
Inflation is a key element in the pervasive campaign to confuse and mislead the U.S. citizenry about the realities of their economy , so it remains a topic worth revisiting .
The first stop in understanding " real inflation " should be John Williams ' Shadow Government Statistics Analysis Behind and Beyond Government Economic Reporting .
To find out more about the government 's statistics , a good first step is the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Before we dig into bogus government - measured inflation , I would like to launch a new inflation index .
In honor of longtime reader / contributor and musician / instrument - maker Bill Murath , I hereby constitute The Grateful Dead Inflation Index .
My research led me to vintage concert posters , circa the late 60s .
I found that 40 years ago in 1967 , you could attend a Grateful Dead concert in San Francisco ( with several other bands playing as well ) for $ 3 on Friday night , and $ 2 on Sunday evening .
Tickets could be purchases at Rexall Drug Store in Marin , Macy 's department store in San Francisco or a record / music store in Berkeley .
According to the BLS inflation calculator ( found on the BLS page above ) , that $ 3 ticket equals $ 18.70 in today 's ( debased ) dollars , and the $ 2 ticket works out to be $ 12.50 .
Here is the question : can you go to a Phil Lesh and Friends concert , ot indeed , any top - name rock / pop / hip - hop band for $ 12.50 or $ 18.70 ?
Last time I checked , $ 12.50 was roughly what Ticketmaster charges for handling the purchase and delivery of your ticket .
Phil Lesh 's band is currently touring , and the tickets are reasonable by today 's standards : $ 55 each .
Add the rip - off Ticketmaster fee and parking , and you 're up around $ 75 each : a far cry from the price " official inflation " should dictate : less than $ 20 .
OK , so you say the GD is not a good measure .
Fine , let 's move on the Strolling Bones , a.k.a .
The Rolling Stones , rock - n - roll 's most enduring stadium - rock franchise .
At the top of their game in 1969 , it cost $ 4.50 for a regular seat in the stadium and $ 6.50 for the best seats in the house to see The Stones live .
The best seat in the house in today 's money : $ 36.89 .
Can you go to a Stones concert nowadays for less than $ 100 ?
Dream on .
OK , so the shows today have more props and pizzazz .
Fine -- but does all that staging triple the cost ?
If so , why ?
And you can be sure that Rexall Drugs in Marin did n't charge you the equivalent of $ 12.50 to issue you a ticket , either .
The point is : official inflation calculations are woefully inadequate in assessing " real life " declines in the dollar 's purchasing power .
By the Grateful Dead Inflation Index , our purchasing power has dropped by 2/3 more than " official " inflation suggests .
Apologists like to point out that jeans and athletic shoes are now much cheaper than they were in 1969 , and that PCs were n't even invented , etc .
True .
So the $ 50 I spend on jeans and shoes a year used to cost , say $ 150 .
Whoopie .
But the GDII ( Grateful Dead Inflation Index ) cuts through the malarky and double - speak canards to reach the ugly truth : most things cost more now - - a lot more .
The key bit of double - speak is the " core rate of inflation , " i.e. inflation minus the essentials of food and energy .
This blatant manipulation dates from the Nixon era , when government officials were desperate to hide the rising inflation of the early 70s .
They hit upon the card - trick of " core inflation " to distract people from the realities hitting them in the face at the gas pump and supermarket .
Incredibly , the American media and public bought the lie hook , line and sinker , and continue to do so today .
I explained some of the current legerdemaine / slight of hand in previous entries :
Why Inflation Appears Low ( June 2005 )
Inflation and Housing : Calculating the Bust ( May 25 , 2006 )
The Housing - Inflation Connection ( April 25 , 2006 )
Here is an excerpt from the last entry :
One little - understood result of the housing bubble is its massive distortion of the Consumer Price Index , i.e. the rate of inflation .
Why is this important ?
Let 's start with an example .
Let 's say Joe and Suzie Citizen bought a house in 2004 which they 'd previously rented for $ 1,500 a month .
Their monthly mortgage , insurance and property taxes total $ 2,500 .
The effect on the CPI of the extra $ 1,000 a month ? $ 0
Let 's say Suzie 's folks ' house just got re-appraised , and thanks to the housing bubble , their property tax bill is 40 % higher - - about a $ 1,000 more a year .
( If you think this sounds high , think again ) .
The effect of this higher property tax payment on the CPI ? $ 0 .
Let 's say Joe and Suzie 's neighbor was one of the 25 % of buyers who bought their house with an exotic " interest - only , " low - interest rate mortgage back in 2003 .
His annual mortgage rate has just been reset from 4.5 % to 7.5 % , causing his mortgage payment to rise by over $ 1,000 a month .
The effect on the CPI of the extra $ 1,000 a month ? $ 0
Wait a minute .
You mean these huge rises in housing expenses have zero effect on inflation ?
How is that possible ?
As Alan Abelson explained in a May 30 , 2005 Barron 's column : Shelter , you see , which accounts for about 30 % of the core CPI is measured not by the dictates of the marketplace , how much houses actually fetch when they 're sold , but by a strange -- make that perverse -- yardstick called owners ' equivalent rent .
Homeowners are asked how much they think they could get were they to rent their abodes .
The result , as Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist for Miller Tabak , deftly puts it , is that " surging housing is suppressing the CPI . "
Rental income , he reports , has fallen to $ 147.8 billion , from the peak of $ 186.6 billion back in April 2002 .
" This weak pricing pressure in the rental market , " he comments , " is weighing upon the owners ' equivalent rent portion of the CPI " and , we might add , providing a distinctly distorted picture of what 's happening in housing and inflation as a whole .
In one important sense , money is a commodity like any other .
The cost of money -- that is , the cost of borrowing money -- rises and falls , just like the costs of other commodities .
When the cost drops -- when interest rates fall -- then that has a deflationary effect on the CPI .
You get the same good or service for less money .
Conversely , when interest rates rise -- as they are now -- then they have an inflationary effect .
You 're paying more for the exact same service / good -- in this case , your house .
But in the current CPI calculation , the actual costs for 70 % of the population - - homeowners -- is completely ignored in favor of " market rate " rents .
Here are the numbers used to figure the CPI ( taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics abstract titled why inflation as stated in CPI does n't match your reality : )
Expenditure category
---------------------------------
Food and beverages 15.7
Housing 40.9
Apparel 4.4
Transportation 17.1
Medical care 5.8
Recreation 6.0
Education / communication 5.8
Other goods & services 4.3
---------------------------------
Total , all items 100.0
The BLS website provides this detailed explanation of the housing component of CPI : rent and owner 's equivalent rent .
Basically , the BLS says that rents are far more stable a measure than mortgage rates , which rise and fall to a much greater degree than rents .
While this makes sense , it ignores the fact that only 30 % of the citizenry rent , and that most of those renters are in the lower income brackets .
Most renters simply cannot afford to buy a house ; as a consequence , rents can only rise as fast as renters ' incomes -- and as noted here and elsewhere , income for American workers has been flat for the past 5 years .
For more on the 34 million renters in the U.S. , please read this report by Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University : America 's Rental Housing .
( Note : this is a large PDF file which may take some time to load if you have a dialup Internet connection . )
The report notes that 3 million units of rental housing were constructed from 1993 - 2003 , even as the number of renters held steady at 34 million .
In other words , homeownership increased , and the supply of rental housing exceeds the demand -- the classic formula for keeping rents low .
As you can see , Abelson underestimated the role of housing in the CPI - - it 's actually over 40 % .
( To find the official rate of inflation for any year or series of years , go to the BLS website and select the " inflation calculator " in the upper left heading . )
So what does all this mean in the real world ?
Just this : the official inflation rate of about 2.5 % per year has grossly miscalculated the true costs of the nation 's housing .
As house values leapt above their historic ratio to rents , as property taxes have skyrocketed , as mortgage rates are rising , as mortgage resets dramatically raise millions of household 's expenses -- the CPI reflects nothing but rents which are depressed by massive overbuilding .
Here is an CNN / Money article on the issue : Double jeopardy for landlords ;
" Slowing housing prices and a stagnant rental market have landlords squeezed from both sides . "
But despite this gross mis-reporting of actual housing expenses , inflation is beginning to rise -- with enormous consequences for the U.S. economy and the housing market .
Why ?
Because we depend on foreigners to buy our Treasury bonds and the trillions of dollars of mortgage - backed securities which have enabled low mortgage rates .
Once inflation is perceived as being 5 % ( never mind it 's probably 6 - 7 % ) , who in their right mind would buy a mortgage - backed security paying 6 % ?
And we all know what 's been propping up the bubble - - low interest rates .
Though most home buyers are unaware of it , their mortgage rate is n't set by the Federal Reserve - - it 's set by the bond market .
And once the bond market grasps that the actual rate of inflation far exceeds the official rate , then mortgage rates will rise .
How high ?
Historically , bond buyers expect at least 2 % above inflation , though 3 or 4 % is typical .
If inflation is actually running at 6 % , then a mortgage rate of 10 % would be well within historical norms .

There are lots of other distortions in the inflation calculation ; are your medical expenses only 5 % of your expenses ?
If so , then you 're not self - employed , uninsured or ill .
The list of other distortions is long enough to fill a book .
The question we should ask is : why is the calculation so blatantly distorted to reduce actual inflation to a much lower number ?
Who benefits from such manipulation ?
Who suffers ?
The answers reveal much about the political and financial realities which are so deviously and purposefully masked by " offical " statistics .

For the citizens of the United States and several Latin American countries , the " coin of the realm " is the US dollar , which is , in simple terms , created by the Federal Reserve , a.k.a. , the Fed .
But who created the Federal Reserve , and why ?
The subjects of banking in general , and the Federal Reserve in particular , would be considered by most Americans to be dry , boring , and of little importance to their day - to - day life .
But those same people are endlessly fascinated by how to make more money ( with minimal effort , such as the lottery ) , how to spend as little of it as possible ( coupons never go out of style ) , and how to maximize one 's investment returns .
Why this disconnect ?
Why do Americans care so little about the origins of that which they spend a third of their time pursuing , and seemingly another third spending ?
Some of these " salary slaves " may understand that their money serves as a store of wealth and a medium of commercial exchange , which makes possible their daily financial transactions without the need for bartering .
But , for the most part , they do not understand the critical importance of what is backing that money , if anything ; how that money comes into existence , and what debt offsets it ; what entities control the supply and distribution of that money ; and how those changes can be used to legally steal purchasing power from victims who may not be entirely unsuspecting , but do not truly comprehend how they are getting ripped off .
The typical American , if he or she has given any thought to the matter , would consider the following statements to be true :
The Federal Reserve is federal , i.e. , a part of the US government .
The Federal Reserve is a reserve , i.e. , it has monetary savings of real value .
The Federal Reserve serves the public , and is not a cartel of private banks serving itself .
The US dollar has real value , i.e. , it represents tangible wealth , such as gold securely stored at Fort Knox .
Inflation is an increase in prices .
Inflation is caused by greedy companies , not the US government or the Federal Reserve .
As G. Edward Griffin makes clear in his book , none of these beliefs are true — regardless of how well entrenched they are in our conventional " wisdom . "
He also explains why the US government and the Federal Reserve have their own reasons for being in no hurry to eliminate this ignorance .
Yet these topics are just a small portion of what is covered in his far - ranging discussion of the theory and history of money and banking , particularly within the United States .
Spanning 624 pages , the material is organized into 26 chapters , which are grouped into six sections : " What Creature Is This ? " ( the Federal Reserve 's shameful birth , and the shenanigans of the Fed , S&Ls , the IMF , and the World Bank ) , " A Crash Course on Money " ( money , gold , debasement , fiat money , fractional - reserve banking , and money creation ) , " The New Alchemy " ( the Rothschilds , J.P. Morgan , and banker financing of wars and revolutions ) , " A Tale of Three Banks " ( America 's failed experiments with central banking , and the American Civil War ) , " The Harvest " ( the unconstitutional creation of the Federal Reserve , and its dreadful effects , including the Crash of 1929 ) , " Time Travel into the Future " ( current crises caused by central banking , how they can be reversed , future scenarios , and what the individual can do regardless ) .
Every one of the six sections begins with a brief summary , as does every chapter , with every chapter wrapped up with a more extensive summary .
The section summaries also appear in the table of contents , which precedes a preface and the author 's acknowledgments .
These are followed by a delightful introduction — a piece from the British humor magazine Punch , comprising a rather telling exchange between an unusually honest banker and a soon - to - be - disillusioned bank customer .
The book contains three appendices : a summary of the structure and function of the Federal Reserve system ; natural laws of human behavior in economics ; and whether the M - 1 measure of money is subtractive or accumulative .
The author also provides an index , as well as an impressive bibliography , reflecting his extensive research on the topics .
In addition , the author invites readers to join , an organization dedicated to increasing liberty in the United States , curbing federal totalitarianism , and abolishing the Federal Reserve — all through peaceful participation in government , and the shaping of public policy starting at the grassroots level .is published by American Media , under the ISBNs 0912986212 and 978-0912986210 .
It first came out in July 1994 , and is now in its fourth edition , and its 19th printing .
It also has Japanese and German editions , published in February 2005 and August 2006 , respectively .
On the book 's Web page , visitors will find testimonials and comments from readers , updates to the book , a review of the book by Jane H. Ingraham of , and G. Edward Griffin 's response to a critique of his book by Edward Flaherty , who holds a Ph.D. in Economics .
On that Web page , interested readers can order audio cassettes or CDs of the author 's lecture , based upon this book , and produced in 1998 .
My only criticisms of the book concern not the material itself , but its production — more specifically , the printing and layout , presumably chosen and thus fixable in the future by the publisher .
The generous font size used throughout the volume , makes it easy to read ; but the bold text , such as the subheads found in every chapter , is a bit rough - edged — on some pages worse than others .
The subheads , already bolded , do not need to be in all uppercase ; the publisher should choose one or the other .
In addition , the inside margin length is a bit too small , forcing the reader to crack open the book more than should be needed , in order to comfortably read the text closest to the binding .
In future editions , some of the space in the outer margin could be used to solve the problem , without any change to the words on each page , and thus the length of the book .
But aside from these minor flaws , this book is to be highly recommended .
is a remarkably thorough , detailed , and challenging critique of central banking and America 's latest incarnation of it , the Federal Reserve .
G. Edward Griffin's precision of language , and his interweaving of the major players and their motives , makes for a most compelling historical study .

Writing Funny
Today I will teach you how to write funny .
I will be referring to my earlier post about the world ’s tallest man .
Read that one first , two posts below , if you have n’t already .
Picking a Topic
-------------------
The topic does half of your work .
I look for topics that have at least one of the essential elements of humor :
Clever
Cute
Bizarre
Cruel
Naughty
Recognizable
In order for something to be funny , it has to have at least two of the six elements of humor .
A story about a 7 - foot 9 - inch Mongolian herdsman marrying a smallish woman is bizarre all by itself .
In the humor context , bizarre simply means two things you would n’t normally find together .
Notice how many of the humor elements I worked into my post about the tall herdsman :
Clever : Retrieving an iPod in a clever way , and the salmon in a canoe analogy
Cruel : Shish Kabob accident with his wife
Bizarre : Conjoined twins with two heads and one vagina , huge man with smallish wife , and a Mongolian herdsman with an iPod .
Naughty :
The entire post
The story of the world ’s tallest man was n’t “ recognizable ” in any meaningful way , so it lacked that element .
For many people , that element is the only important one , and the other dimensions are just flavor .
If you leave out the “ recognizable ” element , many people wo n’t relate to the situation .
I took that chance because the other elements were so strong .
I also left out the “ cute ” element , but that one is never essential .
It mixes best with the “ cruel ” and “ bizarre ” elements , e.g. a bunny with a bazooka .
Simple Sentences
---------------------
Keep your writing simple , as if you were sending a witty e-mail to a friend .
Be smart , but not academic .
Prune words that do n’t make a difference .
Write About People
------------------------
It ’s impossible to find humor in inanimate things .
If you must write about an object or a concept , focus on how someone ( usually you ) thinks or feels or experiences those things .
Humor is about people , period .
Write Visually
-----------------
Paint a funny picture with your words , but leave out any details that do n’t serve the humor .
Notice how many images I packed into my post about the tall guy .
It ’s hugely visual , and yet I never describe what he looks like , other than being tall .
Leave Room for Imagination
-----------------------------------
When I described how the tall guy could retrieve an iPod from a storm drain , I only mentioned the gum , his “ python , ” and a Victoria Secrets catalog .
Every reader formed a slightly different mental picture of the specifics .
Leaving out details allows readers to fill them in with whatever image strikes them as funniest .
In effect , you let readers direct their own funny movie .
Funny Words
-----------------
Use “ funny ” words when you can .
Here are some I used :
Mongolian
Herdsman
Vagina
Trouser
Shish Kabob
Storm drain
Johnson
Slap
Canoe
You can read that list of funny words totally out of context and it almost makes you laugh .
Funny words are the ones that are familiar yet rarely used in conversation .
It ’s a bonus when those words have funny sounds to them , as do most of the ones in my list .
Pop Culture References
-----------------------------
References to popular culture often add humor .
It ’s funny that the world ’s tallest man is retrieving a lost iPod , and not something generic such as a wallet .
And it ’s funny that his manhood is compared to Ryan Seacrest as opposed to something generic , such as an oak tree .
Someone could write a thesis on why pop culture references are funny , but just accept it .
Animal analogies
---------------------
Animal references are funny .
If you ca n’t think of anything funny , make some sort of animal / creature analogy .
It ’s easy , and it almost always works .
I made these creature analogies in my post …
King salmon
Python
Exaggerate , then Exaggerate Some More
-------------------------------------------------
Figure out what ’s the worst that could happen with your topic , then multiple it by ten or more .
Do n’t say a mole is as big as a grapefruit .
Say that mole is opening its own Starbucks .
( Notice the pop culture reference of Starbucks . )
The bigger the exaggeration , the funnier it is .
Near Logic
-------------
Humor is about creating logic that a - a - a - lmost makes sense but does n’t .
No one in the real world could put gum on his penis and retrieve an iPod from a storm drain .
But your brain allows you to imagine that working , while simultaneously knowing it can’t .
That incongruity launches the laugh reflex .
Callback
-----------
A callback is when you end with a funny reference that already got a laugh .
In my post , I knew the Ganbaatar gag would get a laugh , so I used it again in a different sense for the closing line .
It puts a nice period on your humor writing .
Genetic Abnormality
-------------------------
Humor is like any other human capacity ; some people are born with more of it than others .
No amount of advice will help if you do n’t have the humor gene .
Here ’s a link to a newish comic called F Minus , by Tony Carrillo .
He has the humor gene .
I ’m picking him to be the next big comic .
( Read a few weeks of his archive before forming an opinion . )

A researcher at the University of Missouri - Columbia has found that girls who talk very extensively about their problems with friends are likely to become more anxious and depressed .
The research was conducted by Amanda Rose , associate professor of psychological sciences in the College of Arts and Science .
The six - month study , which included boys and girls , examined the effects of co-rumination - excessively talking with friends about problems and concerns .
Rose discovered that girls co-ruminate more than boys , especially in adolescence , and that girls who co-ruminated the most in the fall of the school year were most likely to be more depressed and anxious by the spring .
" When girls co-ruminate , they 're spending such a high percentage of their time dwelling on problems and concerns that it probably makes them feel sad and more hopeless about the problems because those problems are in the forefront of their minds .
Those are symptoms of depression , " Rose said .
" In terms of anxiety , co-ruminating likely makes them feel more worried about the problems , including about their consequences .
Co-rumination also may lead to depression and anxiety because it takes so much time - time that could be used to engage in other , more positive activities that could help distract youth from their problems .
This is especially true for problems that girls can't control , such as whether a particular boy likes them , or whether they get invited to a party that all of the popular kids are attending . "
The study involved 813 third , fifth , seventh and ninth grade students .
The participants answered questionnaires that assessed co-rumination , depression , anxiety and the quality of their best friendship in the fall and spring of the school year .
Ironically , although co-rumination was related to increased depression and anxiety , Rose also found that co-rumination was associated with positive friendship quality , including feelings of closeness between friends .
Boys who co-ruminated also developed closer friendships across the school year but did not develop greater depressive and anxiety symptoms over time .
" For years , we have encouraged kids to find friends who they can talk to about their problems , and with whom they can give and receive social support , " Rose said .
" In general , talking about problems and getting social support is linked with being healthy .
What 's intriguing about theses findings is that co-rumination likely represents too much of a good thing .
Some kids , especially girls , are taking talking about problems to an extreme .
When that happens , the balance tips , and talking about problems with friends can become emotionally unhealthy . "
Rose said adolescents should be encouraged to talk about their problems , but only in moderation and without co-ruminating .
" They also should engage in other activities , like sports , which can help them take their minds off their problems , especially problems that they can't control , " she said .
The study , " Prospective Associations of Co-Rumination With Friendship and Emotional Adjustment : Considering the Socioemotional Trade - Offs of Co-rumination , " will be published in the July issue of Development Psychology .

WASHINGTON , June 13  A pair of charcoal - colored pants at the center of a $ 54 million lawsuit was unfurled in a courtroom here on Wednesday , introduced into evidence by a defense lawyer who called the lawsuit a “ nightmare ” for his clients .
“ It ’s a story of how one man has ruthlessly abused the legal system and one statute and caused a great deal of suffering for what was essentially a hardworking mom-and - pop business , ” the lawyer , Christopher Manning , said , referring to Roy L. Pearson Jr. , a District of Columbia administrative law judge who is suing the owners of a neighborhood dry- cleaning shop here .
Mr. Pearson is alleging that the shop , Custom Dry Cleaners , returned the wrong pair of pants to him , and along the way broke promises made in signs saying “ Same Day Service ” and “ Satisfaction Guaranteed . ”
Judge Judith Bartnoff is hearing the case and is expected to make a ruling by the end of next week .
In emotional testimony , Soo Chung , one of the business ’s owners , said the case had created an ordeal for her and her family , who sat in the front rows of the courtroom .

Introduction
In preparation for the redesigns and overhauls we implemented in Wufoo , I took some time to revisit a few HCI ( Human - Computer Interaction ) fundamentals with the hopes of gleaning something new out of the decades of research dedicated to making interfaces easier to use .
One thing that surprised me was how most of the material was pretty dense , heavily geared towards mathematicians it seemed and written in the impenetrable language of the academic elite .
You ’d think that if they ’d really wanted to make an impact ( especially on designers ) , they ’d create documents that were a bit easier to digest .
Back in school , I remember that it was n’t until I started taking classes in physics that calculus made any kind of real sense to me .
I just need diagrams to function .
In that spirit , I thought it would be nice to go over Fitts ’s Law , a staple in the HCI diet , with a few visuals to explain both the concept and why it ’s ideas are a bit more complicated than most would have you believe .
Math of the Obvious
Published in 1954 , Fitts ’s Law is an effective method of modeling the relationship of a very specific , yet common situation in interface design .
That situation involves a human - powered appendage at rest ( whether it ’s physical like your finger or virtual like a mouse cursor ) and a target area that ’s located somewhere else .
Here ’s diagram the first :
Mathematically , Fitts ’s law is stated as follows :
MT = a + b log2 ( 2A / W)
Basically , that means that the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target .
It seems like a no brainer .
The farther you are and the smaller the target , the longer it takes to move the cursor and point at said target .
However , Tom Stafford said it best :
“ Although the basic message is obvious ( big things are easier to select ) it is the precise mathematical characterization that is exciting , and that this characterization includes a logarithmic function - which means that the shape of the relationship between size and reaction time is curved so that small increases in size for small objects make it much easier to select them ( whereas small increases in size for big objects do n’t make that much difference ) .
And the same applies for changes in target distance . ”
Size and selection times : Fitts ’s Law
Just to bring it into the real world , this makes sense since a penny is a lot easier to point at than a freckle and a house is just as easy to point at as an apartment complex .
So the next time you optimize your web site based on Fitts ’s Law , remember that if your link is already huge , making it “ huger ” will not significantly increase the speed at which one can access it .
However , making tiny links a little bigger does make a difference .
Fitts ’s Law is Made of Lines !
Wanting to find practical lessons from Fitts ’s equation , interface designers have derived a few rules of best practice to take advantage of one of the very few laws of human interaction .
One rule , The Rule of Target Size , combines ideas behind Fitts ’s Law and Hick ’s Law ( a law I ’ll talk about on a later date ) to state that the size of a button should be proportional to its expected frequency of use .
Bruce “ Tog ” Tognazzini of Apple interface fame even developed an excellent quiz to explain how Fitts ’s Law can be used to develop rules to drastically improve operating system interfaces .
Before you go and follow these rules blindly in your applications , I want to remind you that Fitts ’s Law describes a very specific situation .
There is an assumption that the movement from the starting position is rapid and aimed , which means it ’s always in a straight line and confident ( starts with high initial velocity as if there were no other targets and you knew exactly where you needed to go ) .
Also , I ’ve seen a lot of people think Fitts ’s Law describes the following situation :
However , in the equation shown above , there ’s no variable for height of the target area , only width .
And so one of the most talked about limitations of Fitts ’s law in HCI circles is that it predicts movement in only one dimension .
In Fitts ’s original experiments , he actually only tested human performance in making horizontal moves toward a target .
Both the amplitude of the move and the width of the terminating region were measured along the same axis , which means the model it describe looks more like this :
Now , if we were to base link size optimizations solely on Fitts ’s Law and we assume that vertical and diagonal movements can be described using the same equation , then the ease at which you can point to a specific target actually depends on where your starting position is in relation to your target .
In the example above , the cursor on the right will technically have an easier time selecting the target than the cursor on the left since it will have more “ target width ” to work with .
Notice that Fitt ’s Law would work fine for circular targets since the width to the center of the object would be the same from all angles .
However , it becomes less accurate for rectangular targets and even more so for irregular objects .
In the next example , we ’ll look at two attempts to optimize the target area of a link by increasing rectangular dimensions .
The second figure increases the width of the target box and the third increases the height .
As you can see , based on where the mouse cursor starts , not all size increases on a rectangular target result in an easier target acquisition , which could be significant for web designers considering all CSS designs are based on the Box Model .
Physical vs Virtual Pointing
Hundreds of derivative experiments have been performed since the publication of Fitts ’s findings .
One interesting paper from 1996 by Evan Graham and Christine MacKenzine , analyzed differences between how well we pointed at objects in real space versus objects on the computer screen .
They show that the movement from the starting point to the target area could be divided into two parts : the initial high velocity phase and a deceleration phase .
In their study , they discovered that the first phase was only affected by the distance away from the target .
The scale of the display nor the size of an object did n’t make you approach it more quickly from the start ( bigger links do n’t make you more eager ) .
The phase that actually affects the time to select a smaller object at the same distance , is in the deceleration phase .
Now , here ’s the “ interesting ” part :
“ The difference between the virtual and physical display is apparent only in the second movement phase , where visual control of deceleration to the smaller targets in the virtual task took more time than in the physical task . ”
Basically , links and buttons on a screen are harder to point out with your mouse than with your finger .
And the problem with mice apparently is not in their ability to get to the target , but in our ability to decelerate accurately with them .
Apple , I eagerly wait for the release of some multi- touch monitor goodness .
Rule of the Infinite Edge
It turns out that computer monitors add a very interesting twist to Fitts ’s model of target selection , because they have something called “ edges . ”
Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror actually explained this rather excellently last year in an article on Fitts ’s Law and Infinite Width .
Because a pointing device can only go so far in any direction , targets at the edge of the screen technically have infinite target widths as illustrated below .
For an operating system and on any full screen application , these edges are usually considered the most valuable real estate since they are technically the most accessible .
Not only do they have infinite widths , they also do n’t require the user to have a deceleration phase when they approach these targets , since the edge of the screen will just stop them .
This is also why it ’s incredibly fast and intuitive to assign actions like Expose and Dashboard to the corners of a screen .
Unfortunately , web applications do not get to benefit from the Rule of Infinite Edges .
Having the limitation of needing to run in a browser window with borders , it ’s of little value according to Fitts ’s Law for web designers to place buttons and links at the edges and corners unless the browser is running at full screen , which seems to only happen for kiosk applications .
This also might explain why the interfaces of Web Operating Systems will never be as good as those that can take advantage of the entire real estate of your monitor .
Fitts Still Rules !
The few limitations of Fitts ’s Law that I ’ve presented here are not an attempt to have you throw its lessons out the window .
My hope is that by illustrating some of the debates , it ’ll show you how something as simple as pointing at something is just as relevant and debatable now as it was over 50 years ago .
And while it ’s technically not an accurate description of most interface situations — humans do n’t always move confidently to a target , we do n’t move in only straight lines , there are usually several targets that can confuse us and target areas are almost always two dimensional — research that has created a more accurate mathematical model that compensates for 2 and even 3 dimensions , hardware noise , human error and a host of other factors does n’t seem to change the fundamental truths behind Fitts ’s rather versatile equation :
“ Fitts ’s law has been shown to apply under a variety of conditions , with many different limbs ( hands , feet , head - mounted sights , eye gaze ) , manipulanda ( input devices ) , physical environments ( including underwater ! ) , and user populations ( young , old , mentally retarded , and drugged participants ) . ”
In the end , the big idea I ’d like designers to take away from this article is that the challenge of software application design is so complex and filled with so many variables , that blanket solutions derived from Fitts ’s Law should be used cautiously .
With the increasing size of monitors , the rising popularity of variables that increase mouse acceleration and technologies that alter how we scroll through large screens , it ’ll be interesting see how software designers will take advantage of tools that let us augment our ability to close large distances quickly .
The Liberation of Realism
The reality / thought distinction lies at the precise center of human existence .
The problem is that thought ( including religious and scientific thought ) keeps abstracting theoretical realities " behind the scenes " of raw living , but ultimate realness is where we already are .
Spontaneous , immediacy is itself reality process and the sublime self activity of that which is already the case forever transcends the thinking about point of view .
Thus , mystery groundedness is all . . .
Oct. 7 , 2007  --
October is the month of baseball 's World Series , so it is an appropriate time to consider " 56 * , " an article just published in the Canadian magazine Walrus .
In it author David Robbeson asks , " Was Joe DiMaggio 's fifty - six - game hitting streak the greatest feat in all of sports or merely a product of its time ? "
The article strongly suggests that DiMaggio 's legendary record might deserve an asterisk similar to that many have attached to Barry Bonds ' recent breaking of Henry Aaron 's home run record .
Robbeson's Argument
Robbeson 's argument , which has been made before but never , I think , so thoroughly , revolves around one Dan Daniel .
Daniel was a baseball writer who had covered the Yankees for a long time , was a personal friend of many of the players , traveled with the team and submitted his expenses to it .
He was also the official home - game scorer for the Yankees .
He decided , among other things , whether any at - bat should be adjudged a hit by the batter or an error by the fielder , yet he was , in Robbeson 's words , " as much a PR man as a reporter . "
Specifically , Robbeson cites two games in the middle of the streak , the 30th and 31st , when DiMaggio managed just one hit .
In each of these games , the hit was suspect and could well have , and perhaps should have , been deemed an error .
The first involved a bad bounce that hit off the shoulder of shortstop Luke Appling after he reached for it .
Hits and errors were not immediately recorded on the scoreboard so , Robbeson writes , some spectators believed the streak had come to an end .
Daniel , however , called it a hit .
The 31st game of the streak involved a fielding play that was also arguably an error on the part of Appling , who got his glove on the ball , but dropped it .
Again Daniel scored it a hit .
How could this have happened without arousing more controversy ?
Robbeson argues that despite the present Olympian status of the streak , at the time American involvement in World War II was looming and attention to the then - 29 - game streak and its fluky extension was not intense and baseball attendance was quite low .
Amazingly , the attendance in 22 of the games during the streak was less than 10,000 .
In short , the streak was n't that big a deal then .
Gould 's Counter
There is no clip of the fabled streak by the Yankee Clipper on YouTube to decide the matter , so it will never be conclusively settled .
There is , however , a counterargument , well stated by Steven Jay Gould .
Gould argues that these two , at best , weak hits as well as a couple of others seem out of place in a record set by a mythical hitter like DiMaggio .
The reason is that people tend to believe that streaks are a causal consequence of courage and competence and that their lucky extension is somehow an affront to our conception of them .
DiMaggio is too great a figure , people unconsciously think , to have his streak depend on such thin threads .
As psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman demonstrated years ago , however , people fervently mistakenly believe in hot hands , in clutch hitters , in coming through under pressure , and do n't want to think of streaks as simply matters of luck .
But luck is sometimes just that , and good hitters benefit more from it than do bad hitters .
They will generally hit in longer streaks than will bad hitters just as heads - biased coins will result in longer strings of consecutive heads than tails - biased coins will .
In other words , DiMaggio 's streak remained intact because of these calls by Daniel , but so what ?
Some lucky breaks and a dubious call or two are to be expected in a long streak .
Streak Probabilities
Whether the streak was tainted by a biased scorer operating in a different historical context and under much less fierce media scrutiny can't be cleanly judged now .
We can , however , understand something of the improbability of DiMaggio 's feat by doing a few little calculations .
( This is the time for mathphobes to check out . )
His lifetime batting average was .325 .
If , therefore , we assume as a first approximation that he generally got a hit 32.5 percent of the time he came to bat and hence made an out 67.5 percent of the time and that he came to bat four times per game , then the chances of his not getting a hit in any given game were approximately , assuming independence , ( .675 ) ^4 =.2076 .
Remember independence means he got hits in the same way a coin that lands heads 32.5 percent of the time gets heads .
So the probability DiMaggio would get at least one hit in any given game were 1 - .2076 = .7924 .
Thus the chances of his getting a hit in any given sequence of 56 consecutive games was ( .7924 ) ^56 = .000 002 192 , a minuscule probability indeed .
The number of times in a season that a hitter with a .325 batting average might expect to hit successfully in exactly 56 consecutive games is still tiny - .000 010 .
This number is determined by adding up the ways in which he might hit safely in some string of exactly 56 consecutive games .
The probability and expected number of streaks of length at least 56 straight games is about five times higher , but DiMaggio hit in only 139 games so his chances were somewhat less than this multiple of 5 .
The conclusion is that such an extraordinary achievement " should not , " probabilistically speaking , have yet occurred in the history of baseball .
There are many differences and a few similarities between Bonds ' record and DiMaggio's .
I leave them for readers to ponder .

Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
Okay , class , it 's time for a review .
A " fnord " , in case you 've forgotten ( or never knew ) is a special symbol that , as Discordian teachings would have it , gets inserted in magazine or newspaper articles , or in radio or television programs , by our Secret Rulers ( you know who they are ) , to alarm and terrify the population at an unconscious level , setting off a very carefully preconditioned urge to hurry to government authority for safety and comfort .
Discordian ?
A belief system , a comparatively new one , introduced by Greg Hill , Kerry Thornley , Robert Anton Wilson , and Robert Shea , with a surprising number of adherents , based on worship of or at least a healthy respect for Discordia , the ancient Roman goddess of confusion .
Known even better by her Greek name , Eris ( her devotees also call themselves Erisians ) , she is , at least to me , the deity I 'd venerate if I were inclined to venerate deities .
Symbolically , Eris embodies an idea I find highly worthy of contemplating , that in chaos , there might just be room for a little freedom .
Discordians tend to be anarchists at heart .
The most dedicated among their number do n't even care for the idea of natural law , because they feel that it cramps their style .
Then there 's the deal about the Golden Apple marked with but I digress .
The fnords were first described in Principia Discordia , the " Bible " of the Discordian movement , but most of us became acquainted with them in Illuminatus ! , by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson , and its various sequels .
According to the story , the preconditioning begins when we enter the public school system .
Whenever we remember afterward a visit to our Kindergarten or Third Grade class by the music or the art teacher , what actually happened is that someone came and hypnotized an entire room full of little kiddies , showed them the fnords , and then set off some horribly frightening stimulus : the sight of blood , a loud noise , a bright flash , an electric shock , or a bad smell and then drilled into us that only the government could save us , and we must forget the whole classroom experience at a conscious level .
The next time we saw the fnords ( in the Weekly Reader , in the Sunday funnies , or on Sesame Street ) we would n't be aware that we 'd actually seen them , but we 'd experience a sense of vague disquiet and disconnected fear and look to the government to make it stop .
The achievement of enlightenment , in these terms , means learning to see the fnords consciously again , and shake free of their influence over us .
Not many individuals have achieved this kind of enlightenment a great many fewer , as it turns out , than I would have believed before the airliners hit the towers .
Literally overnight , decent , rational Democrats , Republicans , and even a handful of weaker Libertarians became rabid warmongers and racists , based only on the lies being told them by authorities none of them had regarded as credible the day before .
Somewhere back along the way , somebody maybe it was ol '
Ben Mussolini , maybe it was Joe Goebbels discovered that the Big Scare is an even more effective technique than the Big Lie .
Not to be outdone by foreigners , throughout American history , we 've always had our Little Scare of the Year : demon rum , comic books , smoking in bed , video arcades , skateboards , pit bulls , computer games , Internet chat rooms .
Likewise , we 've always had our Big Scare of the Decade : the Yellow Peril , White Slavery , the Huns , the Red Scare , the Nips , Communism , the Cold War , and most recently , Global Terrorism .
Sometimes Americansas Ben Wattenburg once observed of liberals seem to be afraid of " every known phenomenon " .
It is n't hard and never has been to stampede most of them in any direction you want , with a big enough explosion .
The explosion , in this case , was the attack on the World Trade Center .
Back in 1898 , it was the explosion of the Maine .
Later , it was the sinking of the Lusitania , or the air attack on Pearl Harbor .
In each case , it conveniently came just in time to save the careers of countless politicians and bureaucrats , gave them unprecedented money and power , and cost us and our forebears a slice of their individual freedom .
Of course there had to be a villain in all of this , the brutal and decadent Spaniards , leering , crippled Kaiser Bill and his hordes of orcish minions , the goofy Emperor of Japan and his subjects , with their protruding teeth and Coke - bottle spectacles .
But the good old - fashioned epithets camel jockeys , sand - n - words for our enemy du jour are no longer enough .
Muslims first became " Islamists " and when that did n't prove sufficiently insulting and dehumanizing , they became " Islamofascists " , an old neoconservative mind - trick that works only on those who have n't ever known any Muslims on a close and personal basis .
Would it surprise you to discover that the reason the Egyptians threw the Russians out in the 1950s , despite all the technical aid and assistance the latter had given the former by way of dams , electric plants , and so on , is that under communism , the state takes from the individual on the basis of his ability , and redistributes this stolen wealth on the basis of somebody else 's need ?
Such a political doctrine was anathema to Muslims because it deprives the individual of the moral choice to obey the Prophet and the Koran in the matter of charity .
I am not an individual of particularly tender sensibilities , but I find myself increasingly disgusted by those who see this conflict as a god - given opportunity to talk about Arabs and Muslims the same way that their fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers used to talk about black , Chinese , Irish , Italian , and Polish people .
To be certain , there is plenty to dislike about Islamall religions being , to my mind , equally evil , crazy , and stupid but the cruelty and other ugly traits being attributed to its believers by neocons who 've finally found a group it 's safe to hate out loud is not among them .
A much better word for it the mind - trick , not the people is " Islamofnordism " .
What actually frightens the neocons is n't the content of Islamic belief , but the devotion to them that allows a Muslim to die to kill himself for his faith .
Neocons , for all of their religious blithering , do not possess courage and conviction like that .
Most of them avoided the draft in the 1960s , one way or another , and have been content to let other mothers ' sons do their killing and dying for them .
( Before anybody else says it , I avoided the Vietnam era draft , because I detested a war being waged for no reason against a people who should have been our friends .
Because , in every one of America 's too many wars , the man who might have found the cure for cancer or diabetes was killed with a bullet , a bomb , or a bayonet , and never got around to his life 's real work .
And because every cell in my being hates , loathes , and despises slavery of any kind , especially military slavery .
On the other hand , I have never sent anybody else off to die , and it would be an extremely serious error to mistake my opposition to the government 's wars for an unwillingness or inability to defend myself . )
But I digress once again .
What 's the point to all this , then ?
I suppose it's that some of the warmest , kindliest , most generous people I 've ever known were Muslims ( and Arab Christians ) , and , on the other hand , some of them were Newfoundlanders , Catholics and Anglicans who come from an equally unforgiving environment and are just as warm , kindly , and generous .
Neither people is especially gentle , but , left to themselves , most of them , and practically everybody else I 've ever known , love their wives or husbands ( or want to be able to ) , treasure their children , and only want peace , freedom , and prosperity for themselves and for everybody else .
Maybe it is n't the people , after all .
Maybe Roddenberry and all those other socialist science fiction writers have been wrong all along .
Maybe Mankind is n't warlike to its genetic corepeople do n't start wars , after all , governments do ; it 's the people who are forced to fight them .
Maybe war is the biological byproduct of putrescently corrupt politicians , the media pimps and prostitutes who service them , and a few well - chosen " useful idiots " for man - in - the - street interviews and Congressional committee testimony .
They 're the " insane barbers " who are responsible for the horrible , dangerous mess the world 's in today .
What can we do about it ?
Start by learning to see the damn fnords .
Whenever you feel like somebody 's trying to stampede you , it 's most likely because somebody 's trying to stampede you .
Refuse to be stampeded by the politicians , by the academics , and by the empty hairsprayed heads of the round - heeled mass media .
Ask yourself what they might have to gain by making you hate people in faraway lands whom you do n't know , and who do n't know you .
And then , as the old picante sauce commerical advised us , " Get a rope " .
' America 's Doomed ' : Free Speech or Unlawful Hate Mongering ?
A jury says fringe church 's hateful protests not protected by First Amendment .
Nov. 2 , 2007  --
Are there limits to free speech ?
Is some speech so hateful that it should be punished ?
This week a jury said yes , saying a fringe church must pay nearly $ 11 million in damages for disturbing a funeral .
Members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , often picket the funerals of soldiers .
As family members arrive to grieve the loss of their loved one , the picketers confront them with screaming , cruel songs and signs saying things like " America Is Doomed . "
Shirley Phelps - Roper and her brother Tim Phelps carry on the campaign their father Fred , founding pastor of the church , began decades ago .
" Repent , dummies !
The wrath of God is upon you .
It 's abiding upon you , " said Shirley Phelps - Roper at one protest .
" America 's doomed .
Your destruction is upon you . "
They do this , they say , because those who die are receiving punishment from God .
" [ Punishment ] for sin , unrepentant sins , idolatry , fornication , " said Tim Phelps .
" That 's the religion of this nation : My God is me .
I serve myself . "
" 20/20 interviewed Fred Phelps 14 years ago , when his picketing had become the talk of Topeka .
Phelps focused mostly on homosexuality and denied that his protests were " cruel harrassment . "
" Desperate times require desperate measures , " he said .
And it was clear that he delighted in his cause , telling " 20/20 " that " this is so much fun " while faxing messages of hate , and laughing about those who die from AIDS .
' We All Deserve Death in Hell '
Today , nine of Fred Phelps ' 13 children carry on his work -- almost all of the 70 or so members of the church are members of his family .
Shirley and Tim helped move the Phelps ' message to the Internet .
They also created music videos , for songs like " God Hates the World and All Her People . "
A documentary on the Phelps , called " Fall from Grace , " will air on Showtime next month .
The clan now travels the country , picketing disasters everywhere and saying that all catastrophes are caused by the sins of a nation that supports homosexuals .
" Thank God for 9/11 , " said Shirley .
" Thank him , because we all deserve death in hell , and he has mercifully spared us and it's time for repentance . "
Tim and Shirley say they get their message " from the Bible " and believe that biblical scholars who say otherwise " are frauds . "
" They tell you what you want to hear because you pay them , " according to Shirley .
Often their hateful rants bring angry reactions from passersby .
Police are called to the scene to prevent violence , but they are not always successful .
Still , Shirley and Tim do n't consider their message to be " hateful . "
" Hateful message ?
It 's a kind message .
It 's the only kindness of this hour , " she said .
" And we do it on our own time and we do it from a pure heart and kindness . "
" You do n't get to define the word ' hate , ' " said Tim .
" When we start talking about matters of Scripture , the Bible defines what 's hate . "
Funeral Protests Lead to Court
Shirley said that parents mourning their children who died in war " did not do their duty to their child . "
" Those people that are sitting around there with their crocodile tears … the Lord , God entrusted them with that tiny baby , " she said .
" They raised the child .
There 's only two ways to raise your child .
You either raise them by the standards of God or you do , in fact , raise them for the devil . "
The First Amendment gives Americans the right to speak even hateful things , but because of demonstrations like these , 40 states have now placed restrictions on picketing funerals .
" You 're whacking away at that First Amendment , " said Shirley .
" You do n't get to put people on trial in doomed America for their sincerely held religious beliefs . "
Shirley feels confident in her knowledge of the law , as she is a practicing attorney .
In fact , 10 of her siblings are lawyers .
But this week they lost .
A Baltimore jury said the Westboro Baptist Church was too vulgar and offensive to be covered by the First Amendment .
The church must pay nearly $ 11 million to Albert Snyder , who brought a suit after the Phelps clan picketed the funeral of his 20 - year - old son Matthew , who died while serving in Iraq .
" I hope this is enough to deter them from doing this to other families , " said Snyder .
" All I kept thinking about was my son Matt and all the other parents who went through it -- this will set a precedence . "
The Phelps do n't have $ 11 million , and they say they will appeal the decision .
" They do all these radical things , pass laws , arrest us , sue , and all it does is create a new platform , " said Tim .
' Never Too Young '
The extra publicity is the main reason why Shirley did n't mind when she was arrested after her son trampled a flag at a serviceman 's funeral in Nebraska .
The Phelpses routinely bring their children to protests .
" They just want to kill us pretty much , " said 8 - year - old Noah Phelps - Roper , one of Shirley 's 11 children .
" Because we 're preaching the message .
…
Because they do n't like our message . "
Are n't they a little young for all this preaching ?
" No , they 're not young , " said Shirley .
" They 're never too young to hear words . "
Ten - year - old Jonah Phelps - Roper says his favorite flag is one that says " Fags Doom Nations . "
" I like that sign , " he said .
When asked what the word " fag " means , Jonah replied " A fag is someone … who … I can't really explain . "
" A fag is someone who does not obey the word of God , " said Noah .
The Phelpses are proud that their children have learned their lessons well , and that they all , regardless of lawsuits , will keep the message alive .
" We 'll keep preaching , " said Tim .
" We do n't give a rat 's backside of what anyone does in this nation .
We 'll keep preaching . "
" We have to preach to the whole world -- that 's our job , " said Shirley .
And , they say , their children will continue to do the preaching for them .

The new budget does not set a timetable for US troop withdrawal
The president 's approval came hours after the House of Representatives and Senate voted in favour of the bill .
The bill is a compromise measure between Republicans and Democrats , after the Democrats dropped demands for a timetable for a US troop withdrawal .
Hours later , the US military reported the deaths of five soldiers in Iraq .
Correspondents say the death toll for US troops in May - currently at least 85 - looks like being one of the highest since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The Senate voted to send the legislation to the president by 80 votes to 14 , after the House gave its approval by a margin of 280 to 142 .
The deal ended months of wrangling over demands by Democrats , who control Congress , for checks on Iraq funding .
Democrats had wanted timetables for withdrawal built into any funding bill , but those conditions prompted Mr Bush to veto earlier legislation .
The days of blank cheques and green lights ... are over
Harry Reid
Senate majority leader
Democrats face war dilemma
" This is like a fig leaf , this is a token , this is a small step forward , instead we should have a giant step forward into a new direction , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Democrats did manage to secure cash for domestic issues , including a $ 2.10 rise in the minimum wage , and insisted the new budget was not a victory for the White House .
" The days of blank cheques and green lights for his failed policy are over , " Senate majority leader Harry Reid said .
' Critical ' summer
Speaking at the White House ahead of the vote , Mr Bush praised the negotiated compromise , saying the bill reflected " a consensus " .
Among the terms of the new deal are requirements that the Iraqi government demonstrate progress on specific issues to be assured of continuing US support .
Those " benchmarks " were included after pressure from Democrats , but can be over - ruled by the president .
We are going to expect heavy fighting in the next weeks and months and we can expect American and Iraqi casualties
US President George W Bush
" By voting for this bill , members of both parties can show our troops and the Iraqis and the enemy that our country will support our servicemen and women in harm 's way , " the president said .
He also told reporters that the coming weeks and months in Iraq would be vital for the new US security strategy in Iraq .
The last of the 30,000 US troop reinforcements would arrive in Baghdad by the middle of June , Mr Bush predicted .
" We are going to expect heavy fighting in the next weeks and months and we can expect American and Iraqi casualties , " he said , pledging to stay on the offensive .
Meanwhile , a CBS News / New York Times opinion poll suggests that a record number of Americans are pessimistic about the outcome of the war in Iraq and now believe it was a mistake .
Of those polled , 76 % said they thought the war was going badly , up 10 points in one month , while 61 % of those polled said the US should have stayed out of Iraq .
And six in 10 wanted a timetable for US troops to withdraw from Iraq - an issue that was dropped from the bill passed by Congress .
“ And that ’s just little bitty me , ” he said .
Mr. Haupt is one of thousands of Americans who jumped into the raging housing market of the last decade , which was heralded in stories of neighbors ’ windfalls and reality television shows like “ Flip That House , ” “ Flip This House ” and “ Flipping Out . ”
Driving past his empty house recently , Mr. Haupt considered how things had crashed so fast .
“ I feel like , yes , I overextended myself , ” he said .
“ But when do you know not to overextend yourself ?
If I had a crystal ball , I never would have built my house .
But when do you know ?
That ’s why we ’re speculators . ”
He added , “ If the banks had a crystal ball , they might not be in this mess either . ”
St. Charles County , an affluent , fast - growing neighbor of St. Louis , was a natural incubator for speculators like Mr. Haupt , with a construction boom that doubled the population from 1980 to 2001 .
Subdivisions with names like Crimson Meadows , Spring Mill and Barton Creek , pushed the suburban frontier ever farther from St. Louis .
For a young builder , the low price of credit drove down the costs of building and drove up the homes ’ sale prices .
As long as the market kept going , Mr. Haupt felt he could not lose .
His million - dollar house now sits forlorn and unattended , a dead spot in an expensive subdivision that was once all cornfields .
Asked to identify the architectural style , he said , “ I call it ‘ Bank Repossession ’ now . ”
The use of alcohol and drugs in war zones appears to reflect a broader trend toward heavier and more frequent drinking among all military personnel , but especially in the Army and Marine Corps , the two services doing most of the fighting , Pentagon officials and military health experts said .
A Pentagon health study released in January , for instance , found that the rate of binge drinking in the Army shot up by 30 percent from 2002 to 2005 , and “ may signal an increasing pattern of heavy alcohol use in the Army . ”
While average rates of alcohol consumption in the Navy and Air Force have steadily declined since 1980 , the year the military ’s health survey began , they have significantly increased in the Army and Marine Corps and exceed civilian rates , the Pentagon study showed .
For the first time since 1985 , more than a quarter of all Army members surveyed said they regularly drink heavily , defined as having five or more drinks at one sitting .
The rate of illicit drug use also increased among military members in 2005 , to an estimated 5 percent , nearly double the rate measured in 1998 , a trend that the study called “ cause for concern . ”
The study also found other health problems in the military , from the growing popularity of chewing tobacco to a 20 percent increase during the past decade in service members who are considered overweight .
Lynn Pahland , a director in the Pentagon ’s Health Affairs office , said the rising rates of heavy drinking and illegal drug use among active - duty military personnel are particularly troubling inside the Defense Department .
“ It is very serious , ” Ms. Pahland said in an interview .
“ It is a huge concern . ”
In the military , seeking help for psychological problems , including alcohol and drug abuse , is considered a taboo , especially among officers competing for promotions .
Several officers interviewed for this article said the Pentagon was not doing enough to reduce that stigma .
Signs
You 're a Crappy Programmer ( and do n't know it )
You know those crappy programmers who do n’t know they are crappy ?
You know , they think they 're pretty good , they spout off the same catch phrase rhetoric they 've heard some guru say and they know lots of rules about the " correct " way to do things ?
Yet their own work seems seriously lacking given all the expertise they supposedly have ?
You do n’t know any programmers like that ?
Come one , you know , the guys who are big on dogma but short on understanding .
No , does n’t sound familiar ?
Then here are some signs you 're a crappy programmer and do n't know it :
Java is all you 'll ever need .
You do n't see the need for other languages , why can't everything be in Java ?
It does n't bother you at all to see Python or Ruby code that accomplishes in 10 lines what takes several pages in Java .
Besides , you 're convinced new language features in the next release will fix all that anyway .
( BTW , this can be almost any language , but right now the Java community seems most afflicted with this thinking )
" Enterprisey " is n't a punchline to you .
This is serious stuff dammit .
" Enterprise " is not just a word , it 's a philosophy , a way of life , a path to enlightenment .
Anything that can be written , deployed or upgraded with minimal fuss is dismissed as a toy that wo n't " scale " for future needs .
Meanwhile most of the real work in your office is getting done by people sending around Excel spreadsheets as they wait for your grand enterprise visions to be built .
You are adamantly opposed to function / methods over 20 lines of code .
( or 30 or 10 or whatever number of lines )
Sorry , sometimes a really long function is just what 's needed for the problem at hand .
Usually shorter functions are easier to understand , but sometimes things are most simply expressed in one long function .
Code should not be made more complex to meet some arbitrary standard .
" OMG ! PATTERNS ! "
Developers who actively seek to apply patterns to every coding problem are adding unnecessary complexity .
Far from being something you look to add to your code , you should feel bad every time you are forced to code up another design pattern , it means you are doing busy work that makes things more complex and is of dubious benefit .
But hey , your code has design patterns , and no one can take that from you .
CPU cycles are a precious commodity and your programming style and language reflects that belief .
There are plenty of problem domains where you have to worry a lot about CPU cycles ( modeling / simulation , signal processing , OS kernels , etc ) , but you do n't work in them .
Like nearly every software developer , your biggest performance problems are all database and I /O related .
The only effect of optimizing your code for CPU is to shave 2 milliseconds off the time to get to the next multi-second database query .
Meanwhile your development has slowed to a crawl , you can't keep up with the rapidly evolving requirements and there are serious quality issues .
But at least you ’ll be saving lots of CPU cycles ... eventually .
You think no function / method should have multiple return points .
I 've hear this from time to time , and usually the reason given is because the code is easier analyze .
According to whom ?
I find simple code easy to analyze , and it often simplifies the code to have multiple returns .
Your users are stupid .
Really stupid .
You can't believe how stupid they are , they constantly forget how to do simplest things and often make dumb mistakes with your applications .
You never consider maybe it 's your application that ’s stupid because you 're incapable of writing decent software .
You take great pride in the high volume of code you write .
Being productive is good , unfortunately producing lots of lines of code is n't quite the same as being productive .
Users never remark " Wow , this software may be buggy and hard to use , but at least there is a lot of code underneath . "
Far from being productive , spewing out tons of crap code slows down other devs and creates a huge maintenance burden for the future .
Copy and paste is great , it helps you write decoupled code !
You defend your use of copy and paste coding with odd arguments about decoupling and removing dependencies , while ignoring the maintenance drag and bugs code duplication causes .
This is called " rationalizing your actions " .
You think error handling means catching every exception , logging it and continuing on .
That ’s not error handling , that ’s error ignoring and is the semantically equivalent to “ on error next ” in VB .
Just because it got logged away somewhere does n’t mean you ’ve handled anything .
Error handling is hard .
If you do n’t know exactly what to do in the face of a particular error , then let the exception bubble up to a higher level exception handler .
You model all your code in UML before you write it .
Enthusiastic UML modeling is typically done by those who are n’t strong coders , but consider themselves software architects anyway .
Modeling tools appeal most to those who think coding can be done in conference room by manipulating little charts .
The charts are n’t the design , and will never be the design , that ’s what the code is for .
Your code wipes out important data .
You wrote some code that ’s supposed to overwrite application files with new files , but it goes haywire and deletes a bunch of the user 's important data files .
That last one , I did that .
Just last year .
Honest mistake and it never showed up in QE ’s testing .
Sometimes I ’m crappy .
Sometimes we all are .
I have been guilty of most of the items on the list and still struggle with a few ( especially premature optimization ) .
So try not to take anything on the list too personally , but feel free to flame me anyway if it makes you feel better .
Posted May 8 , 2006 11:36 AM
THE weather may be cold and wet , but in the rich world 's financial markets it is beginning to feel like August all over again .
Credit spreads have widened and shares are pitching from gloom to elation as investors look to the Federal Reserve for solace .
The anxiety is unmistakable .
But this time the scare is about more than bad mortgage loans and their baleful effect on the credit markets .
America may be falling into recession .
And a new fear now stalks the markets : that the dollar 's slide could spin out of control ( see article ) .
A full - blown dollar crisis on top of a credit crunch and a weakening economy would be frightening .
It would send financial markets reeling and tie the hands of the Fed , perhaps forcing it to raise interest rates even as recession looms .
The sky - high euro would soar further , choking off Europe 's growth .
Political tensions would also rise .
Already Airbus has called the dollar 's decline “ life - threatening ” and France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , has given warning of “ economic war ” .
At worst , the shadows could darken further .
For half a century the dollar has been the hegemonic currency .
A large slice of global trade is counted in dollars .
Central banks hold most of their foreign - exchange reserves in dollars , a boon for America that has allowed it to issue debt more cheaply .
That dominance has survived dollar slides before , as in the late 1970s and mid-1980s .
But now , with the euro as an alternative , the fear is of a sudden shift in the global monetary system , with investors switching quickly from one currency to the other .
So far , this remains only a fear .
Although the dollar has been falling at quite a lick — down 6 % against a trade - weighted basket of currencies since August — it has seen no chaotic slump , but a slide interspersed , as this week , with brief rallies .
Americans ' expectations of future inflation have not yet risen much .
Yields on government bonds have fallen : clearly , investors do not yet expect higher premiums for safe American assets .
Whether disaster strikes depends on what exactly is driving the dollar down and on how policymakers react .
Headwinds and tailwinds
Much of the dollar 's weakness is driven by economic fundamentals .
Since peaking in 2002 , it has fallen by 24 % against a trade - weighted basket of currencies .
Given America 's need to borrow from abroad to finance its consumption , that is neither surprising nor sinister .
By inducing Americans to import less and export more , a weaker dollar helps cut the current - account deficit .
For America , the medicine has been working — the deficit is down to 5.5 % of GDP from a peak of almost 7 % .
If the dollar 's decline has accelerated of late , that is largely because of the cyclical divergence between America 's economy and the rest of the world .
America fears recession ; the Fed has already cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points and financial markets are convinced that it will cut another quarter point on December 11th , when it next meets .
When America 's growth prospects and interest rates fall relative to those elsewhere , a cheaper currency is inevitable .
But economic fundamentals are not all that is hurting the dollar .
The currency is also suffering because the credit mess is concentrated in dollar assets .
Investors ' conviction that transparent markets and vigilant regulators make America a safe place to store money has taken a battering from the revelations of recent weeks .
Net private capital inflows into America seem to have evaporated since the credit turmoil began .
The subprime crisis has tarred the dollar as a subprime currency .
In recent years a fall in private inflows has usually been offset by central banks in emerging economies that link their currencies to the dollar .
This system ( often known as Bretton Woods II ) has thus propped up the dollar .
But this time these central banks have been less willing to take up the slack .
Right on cue , the cracks in Bretton Woods are becoming clear .
China is routinely attacked in America and Europe for linking its currency to the dollar .
Squeezed between rising oil prices and the falling dollar , the Gulf states face rising inflation : speculation is rife that one or more of them will modify their currency pegs at a regional meeting on December 3rd .
Handle with care
There you have it : the ingredients of a nasty crash .
But self - interest and sensible policy can cut the odds of trouble .
The first step is for American policymakers to pay more heed to their currency .
For all their talk about a strong dollar , American officials have behaved as if they cared little about its worth .
A reserve currency is supposed to be a store of value ; by running a huge current - account deficit America has left the dollar vulnerable .
At such a tricky time , benign neglect will no longer do .
For the moment , this need mean little more than some carefully chosen words .
If the slide becomes chaotic , it could demand currency - market intervention and a willingness to hold back interest - rate cuts for the sake of the dollar .
The other part of the solution lies elsewhere , particularly with those countries with dollar - pegging currencies .
These economies need to allow their currencies to rise , both to curb inflation and encourage the rebalancing of the global economy .
Appreciation would mean that these countries accumulated new dollar reserves at a slower pace .
That in turn would lead to a loss of the dollar 's pre-eminence and the emergence of other reserve currencies : there is no rule to say you can have only one reserve currency .
But this need not — and in today 's febrile environment must not — mean dumping existing dollar reserves .
That would impose a far higher cost on everyone , including the dumpers .
The history of international co-operation on currencies is patchy .
But China and the oil - rich Gulf states have ample reason to play their part in an orderly decline of the dollar 's dominance .
Despite the opprobrium heaped on them , the Chinese do not want to see the Fed 's hands tied by a dollar crisis ; nor do they want to see the euro zone , one of their best markets , slow sharply ; and they have little interest in the external value of their existing dollar reserves plunging .
Beyond all that , China 's leaders want to be taken seriously as responsible actors in the international system .
Now is their chance .
The Australian Communications Authority ( ACA ) alleges Wayne Mansfield and his companies Clarity1 and Business Seminars sent out the emails for 12 months after the Spam Act came into effect in April 2004 .
The court action follows a raid in April on the company 's offices in Perth where computer hard disks and other materials were seized .
The raid involved the Australian Government Solicitor 's Office and computer forensic experts .
Acting ACA chairman Dr Bob Horton said the authority was seeking an interim injunction against Clarity1 because of the scale of the alleged breaches .
The injunction , if granted , would be in force until the court hearing .
The ACA said the man was in anti-spam watchdog Spamhaus 's list of the world 's top 200 spammers .
If found guilty , Mansfield would be fined AUS $ 220,000 for each day of breaking the law .
Mansfield told Australian media that he is eager to clear his name .

Frans Bouma wrote an interesting response to my last post , Writing Testable Code Is About Managing Complexity entitled Correctness Provability should be the goal , not Testability .
He states in his post :
When focusing on testability , one can fall into the trap of believing that the tests prove that your code is correct .
God I hope not .
Perhaps someone in theory could fall into that trap , but a person could also fall into the trap and buy a modestly priced bridge I have to sell to them in the bay area ?
This seems like a straw man fallacy to me .
Certainly no major TDD proponent has ever stated that testing provides proof that your code is correct .
That would be outlandish .
Instead , what you often hear testing proponents talk about is confidence .
For example , in my post Unit Tests cost More To Write I make the following point ( emphasis added ) :
They reduce the true cost of software development by promoting cleaner code with less bugs .
They reduce the TCO by documenting how code works and by serving as regression tests , giving maintainers more confidence to make changes to the system .
Frans goes on to say ( emphasis mine ) …
Proving code to be correct is n’t easy , but it should be your main focus when writing solid software .
Your first step should be to prove that your algorithms are correct .
If an algorithm fails to be correct , you can save yourself the trouble typing the executable form of it ( the code representing the algorithm ) as it will never result in solid correct software .
Before I address this , let me tell you a short story from my past .
I promise it ’ll be brief .
When I was a young bright eyed bushy tailed math major in college , I took a fantastic class called Differential Equations that covered equations which describe continuous phenomena in one or more dimension .
During the section on partial differential equations , we wracked our brains going through crazy mental gymnastics in order to find an explicit formula that solved a set of equations with multiple independent variables .
With these techniques , it seemed like we could solve anything .
Until of course , near the end of the semester when the cruel joke was finally revealed .
The sets of equations we solved were heavily contrived examples .
As difficult as they were to solve , it turns out that only the most trivial sets of differential equations can be solved by an explicit formula .
All that mental gymnastics we were doing up until that point was essentially just mental masturbation .
Real world phenomena is hardly ever described by sets of equations that lined up so nicely .
Instead , mathematicians use techniques like Numerical Analysis ( the Monte Carlo Method is one classic example ) to attempt to find approximate solutions with reasonable error bounds .
Disillusioned , I never ended up taking Numerical Analysis ( the next class in the series ) , choosing to try my hand at studying stochastic processes as well as number theory at that point .
The point of this story is that trying to prove the correctness of computer programs is a lot like trying to solve a set of partial differential equations .
It works great on small trivial programs , but is incredibly hard and costly on anything resembling a real world software system .
Not only that , what exactly are you trying to prove ?
In mathematics , a mathematician will take a set of axioms , a postulate , and then spend years converting caffeine into a long beard ( whether you are male or female ) and little scribbles on paper ( which mathematicians call equations ) that hopefully result in a proof that the postulate is true .
At that point , the postulate becomes a theorem .
The key here is that the postulate is an unambiguous specification of a truth you wish to prove .
To prove the correctness of code , you need to know exactly what correct behavior is for the code , i.e. a complete and unambiguous specification for what the code should do .
So tell me dear reader , when was the last time you received an unambiguous fully detailed specification of an application ?
If I ever received such a thing , I would simply execute that sucker , because the only unambiguous complete spec for what an application does is code .
Even then , you have to ask , how do you prove that the specification does what the customers want ?
This is why proving code should not be your main focus , unless , maybe , you write code for the Space Shuttle .
Like differential equations , it ’s too costly to explicitly prove code in all but the most trivial cases .
If you are an algorithms developer writing the next sort algorithm , perhaps it is worth your time to prove your code because that cost is amortized over the life of such a small reusable unit of code .
You have to look at your situation and see if the cost is worth it .
For large real world data driven applications , proving code correctness is just not reasonable because it calls for an extremely costly specification process , whereas tests are very easy to specify and cheap to write and maintain .
This is somewhat more obvious with an example .
Suppose I asked you to write a program that could break a CAPTCHA .
Writing the program is very time consuming and difficult .
But first , before you write the program , what if I asked you to write some tests for the program you will write .
That ’s trivially easy , is n’t it ?
You just feed in some CAPTCHA images and then check that the program spits out the correct value .
How do you know your tests are correct ?
You apply the red - green - refactor cycle along with the principle of triangulation . ;)
As we see , testing is easy .
So how do you prove its correctness ?
Is it as easy as testing it ?
As I said before , testing does n’t give you a proof of correctness , but like the approaches of numerical analysis , it can give you an approximate proof with reasonable error bounds , aka , a confidence factor .
The more tests , the smaller the error bounds and the better your confidence .
This is a way better use of your time than trying to prove everything you write .
CARLSBAD , Calif . —
On a marquee outside and on a banner inside , Pilgrim United Church of Christ proclaims , “ All are welcome . ”
Sustained by the belief that embracing all comers is a living example of Christ ’s love , Pilgrim now faces a profound test of faith .
In late January , Mark Pliska , 53 , told the congregation here that he had been in prison for molesting children but that he sought a place to worship and liked the atmosphere at Pilgrim .
Mr. Pliska ’s request has plunged the close - knit congregation into a painful discussion about applying faith in a difficult real - world situation .
Congregants now wonder , are all truly welcome ?
If they are , how do you ensure the safety of children and the healing of adult survivors of sexual abuse ?
Can an offender who accepts Christ truly change ?
“ I think what we have been through is a loss of innocence , ” said the Rev. Madison Shockley , Pilgrim ’s minister .
“ People think of church as an idyllic paradise , and I think that is a great part of that loss . ”
So how does this argument work ?
Better executive decisions create more economic value .
If the number of big companies is greater than the number of good chief executives , competitive bidding will push up pay to reflect the value of the talent .
As Professors Gabaix and Landier predict , chief executives ' salaries in different sectors are higher when the capitalization of that sector is higher .
A stronger sector means more bidders for a chief executive of a particular kind ; an executive who has run one car company can go run another .
Chief executives in large industries , therefore , receive more , even after adjusting for the size of their current companies .
Business services , computers and banking turn up as exceptions for this comparison ; their top executives are overpaid relative to what market capitalization alone would imply .
Perhaps chief executives can add more value in more dynamic sectors .
The authors are still working on their international comparisons ; it is difficult to compare compensation across countries .
But the preliminary results suggest that the total value of the companies in the sector helps predict how chief executives ' salaries vary from country to country .
Executives of large companies in France have fewer outside opportunities in comparable companies than their American counterparts and they thus receive less compensation , in this case by a factor of 2.4 to 1 .
The approach of Professors Gabaix and Landier to executive compensation is influenced by their French background .
In the United States , the popular debate turns on merit  whether chief executives are worth the money .
In Europe , where inequality is less socially acceptable , the popular debate concerns whether anyone could possibly deserve so much money .
This perspective led Professors Gabaix and Landier to focus on explaining the overall level of executive compensation , opening up a new approach to the problem .
The two also find that the best chief executives do not seem to have much more talent than other chief executives in what they define as the top 250 .
By their calculations , replacing the No. 250 chief executive with the No. 1 will increase the value of the company by only 0.014 percent .
The No. 1 chief executive receives much more compensation , but that is mostly because he manages a larger company and thus his talent has a longer reach .
That is another way of thinking about why the same chief executive will make more money in a larger marketplace or in a larger country .
Recently , Brent Simmons posted a catalog of some ineffective approaches customers take when lobbying to get their requested changes into his software .
One that stands out for me is “ surely it must be easy for a developer like you . ”
Yes , this is a funny one !
The customer uses this incredibly loaded language that in one fell swoop expresses ass - kissing and the threat of dismissive contempt should you refuse .
Bastards !
But that got me thinking .
Surely it must be easy for developers like us , at least most of the time .
If it was n’t , we ’d find other work or go nuts under all the pressure .
Easy and hard are powerful words in the software world , and convey a lot of meaning – some desirable and some not .
Who on your team is management ’s favorite programmer ?
The one who replies “ Oh , that ’ll be easy , ” to every marketing requirement they ’re presented with .
It does n’t have to be true .
If management thinks that Sarah has an easy time turning all of the company ’s ideas into pure profit , then she ’s the favorite .
So what if she ’s working her ass off until 3 in the morning every night to “ make it so . ”
If you ’re honest and admit how difficult something might be , you risk being labeled by management as a can ’t - do individual .
Some people are pathologically negative about the outlook of a task ’s difficulty .
Just as Sarah masks the difficulty of the task to make herself look good , her coworker Jenny masks the easiness of the task … to make herself look good .
How could this be ?
Sarah knows she ’ll look good because she gets things done .
Jenny knows she ’ll look good because nobody will be able to understand what it is exactly that she does .
If she ’s lucky she ’ll last many years as the team ’s misunderstood genius , until one day management realizes she has n’t done anything at all .
Meanwhile Sarah has been asked to work on every hot project that comes down the line .
Surely there must be a compromise between running yourself ragged to maintain the illusion of effortlessness , and pessimistically shooting down every opportunity that presents itself to you .
My proposal ?
Consider your work and any future work that is offered to you as a “ series of time - consuming yet easy tasks . ”
This strategy allows you to estimate with some accuracy the realistic amount a time a project will take , while still offering management the comforting sense of “ easiness ” that seals your reputation as a “ can - do ” person .
This series of easy tasks also works as a beautiful motivational and planning tool .
It turns out Brent ’s nightmare customer is right .
Surely it must be easy .
In fact , that ’s my new mantra .
From here on out I shall let that phrase serve as a reminder to me that my office is an “ ease - enabled ” environment .
I ’ve reviewed many of the trendy programming philosophies : extreme programming , pair programming , agile development , etc .
They all offer interesting advice , and none of them particularly prescribes taking the whole kit and caboodle .
I ’ve picked and chosen from the advice that appeals most to me .
So I ca n’t say I ’m an “ extreme programmer ” or that I follow the “ agile development process . ”
I guess I ’ll just admit that I ’m easy .
Below are a few guidelines that help me maintain an easy programming lifestyle .
I hope these resonate with you .
Feel free to pick and choose !
The Simplest Correct Solution
Planning for the “ inevitable ” is almost always a waste of time .
If you are building functionality into your product , it better satisfy a current customer requirement , or you ’ve got some explaining to do .
You ’re gambling with your own time , and doing so with terrible odds .
The payoff for such squandering needs to be huge ; it needs to be a proportional avalanche to the investment you make today .
Should you invest 10 hours now on a feature that has a 50 % chance of saving you 1000 hours in a year ?
Maybe .
Should you invest 10 hours now on a feature that will be interesting to a niche customer base if they happen to take a spark to your product ’s 1.0 release ?
Absofrickinlutely not .
Why does the payoff have to be so huge ?
Because it ’s probably not going to happen .
Planning for the inevitable in software is like planning to win the lottery .
Whatever you think your customers or clients will want in the future is wrong .
Big companies pay thousands of dollars on focus groups and user testing just to figure out what users want and need right now .
How are you going to find out what they ’ll want next year ?
This fact of life is only depressing until you look at it from the point of view that it gives you virtual carte blanche to do the minimum amount of work required to satisfy today ’s requirements .
It ’s not even laziness .
It ’s efficiency .
Enjoy the extra time .
Go for a bike ride .
Read a book .
Write a blog entry .
Take a nap .
It ’s easy .
I can hear the steam coming out of your ears from halfway around the world .
Damnit !
You hate it when pinko commies like me tell you it ’s foolish to plan for the future .
Relax .
Of course you should plan .
Only , plan for the future that will actually happen !
It ’s all right ( even imperative ) that you write code for cases that do n’t exist , but be extremely rational in your decisions .
Let ’s say you ’re writing software that manages vehicles and roadways .
You ’ve got special cases for commercial trucks , passenger vehicles , etc .
A good programmer will argue that “ vehicle ” should be abstracted such that future or overlooked classes of vehicle can be easily adapted to the existing system .
Fine – this leads to a good design .
But the bad programmer will argue that “ vehicle ” needs to be suitably abstracted such that it covers hovercraft and spaceships .
Then they will argue with you endlessly about the series of eventualities that the software will be unprepared for , if by some chance they should happen .
I know – I ’ve been the bad programmer .
Not on this project , buddy !
Only Work on Easy Tasks
In easy programming , you have permission to be selective in choosing which requirement to tackle next .
I suggest you turn your nose up at hard problems , and instead only work on easy ones .
Obviously , this is a trick , right ?
Sort of .
You ’ll end up with hard tasks on your list , and you have to make those lists disappear from the list .
One way is to barrel ahead and complete the hard task , as painful as it may be .
The other way is to turn the hard task into a series of easy tasks .
Now you ’ve got a “ lot more TODO items , ” but the good news is they ’re all easy .
For anybody familiar with the Getting Things Done methodology , working on only easy tasks should be familiar .
I developed this approach after reading about the “ next actions ” strategy of GTD .
Basically , tasks that are singular are “ actions ” while multi-step processes are “ projects . ”
Most of us make the mistake of listing projects on our TODO lists , and projects are overwhelming .
The challenge here is to look at your hard tasks and think , “ what is the simplest possible task that needs to get done before this project can proceed ” ?
Often you ’ll find it comes down to something like “ send an email to mailing list asking for help , ” or “ print out Apple ’s documentation on NSProxy . ”
These are tasks a trained monkey could do – almost .
When I ’m at my least motivated , sometimes my “ next action ” on a particularly hard project is something as simple as “ create empty template source files . ”
Once that ’s out of the way , I ’m free to move on to the next easy task on my list .
Never Fix a Bug Twice
Lots of programmers make their jobs harder than they need to be by fixing the same problems again and again .
They also confuse this ability to fix the bug as a laudable skill , when it ’s really a symptom of stupidity .
If you find yourself fixing the same kinds of bugs so often that you get good at it , then you ’re probably getting more practice than you should be .
Why is this bug , or a bug very much like it , coming up again and again ?
I used to suffer from the common problem of my shoelaces coming untied .
Every day , at least once , I would find myself kneeling down to retie my shoes .
I figured this was just the way things went .
You walk , your laces come untied , you retie , you walk .
Although I had a problem – a recurring problem – I was adept at solving the problem in seconds flat .
Then at WWDC in 1998 or so an Apple compiler engineer taught me how to tie my shoes .
A very minor variation on the regular shoe - tying knot produces a knot that does n’t slip and wo n’t come untied until requested to do so .
For the past 8 years I have tied my shoes once per wearing .
I changed my process and it eliminated the bug - fixing .
The bug fix was the process change .
When bugs come back , it sometimes means the bug was n’t really fixed correctly the first time .
You can do a lot to prevent bug recurrences ( shoes untying ) by thinking carefully about what it means to fix the bug .
Let ’s say you get a customer report that your application crashes when an extremely long an nonsensical phrase is entered into the “ City ” field .
You dutifully type or paste the long phrase into your app and , sure enough , it crashes .
Using the debugger , you see problem almost immediately .
The open source library you use to process text is obviously not too careful about the length or character encoding of its inputs .
You see an easy fix and , having the project ’s source code , you ’re able to fix it in just a few minutes .
Months later , a similar but different report comes in .
Again , it comes down to this damned open source project !
Another assumption made wrong .
How many times are you going to go through this process before you treat the problem at the source ?
The open source library ca n’t be trusted with unbounded text , and you ’re not in a position to review the entire source base correcting problems .
You have to adjust your contract with the library .
Instead of assuming that it was programmed by people with your same attention to detail and crash prevention , you need to accept its shortcomings and massage the data you feed it .
By adding one “ sanitizer ” function , you can ensure that your data meets the library ’s foolish assumptions .
Instead of relying on the library to be bug free , you rely on your code to be provocation - free .
Now this bug , and others like it , are permanently fixed .
Test Your own Strength
Even after you ’ve made a wise choice in permanently fixing a defect , it ’s liable to sneak back up on you – often when you ’d least expect it to .
Unit testing and test - driven development are concepts which I agree with in concept but which have not completely taken over my development process .
If you pick just one aspect of your work to apply programmatic testing to , however , it should be in the bug fixing department .
By writing a test that first detects your bugs presence , and then ( after you fix it ) correctly detects its absence , you ’ve bought yourself permanent piece of mind .
Bugs may come and bugs may go , but you ’ll be first to know when your unit test sets off the alarm .
I ’ve found that test - driven development can also help a lot when spinning wheels in the “ make all tasks easy ” phase .
Often the easiest possible task that you can do on a project is the one that satisfies your next test .
You have to write a complex natural language parsing algorithm encapsulated by an Objective - C object that takes an NSData object containing English paragraphs and returns a tree structure representing the grammatical constructs contained in the text .
The first test ? “ [ [ MyParser alloc ] initWithData : myText ] should not be nil ” .
Phew !
That was easy .
Did n’t even need a PhD !
Next test , please !
Do Hard Things Once
If you hate doing hard things as much as me , then you better make sure that when you ’re done grumbling your way through the seemingly endless list of hard tasks made into easy actions , you have something you can reuse .
The very fear of having to do this again someday should be enough to encourage a modular design that can be repurposed as needed down the road .
Wait !
Does n’t this conflict with my “ do n’t bet on the future , sucker ” advice ?
Not at all .
Writing modular code that can be reused when needed is nothing like the crystal - ball peering I was so dismissive of .
This is planning for the expected , while the other plans for the unexpected .
You will probably be asked to do something very similar to this hard task in the future , and if you ca n’t reuse your existing code , then you ’re going to feel like a real fool .
Notice that planning for reuse does n’t require planning for future requirements , it just means leaving a set of tools on your belt that will be useful regardless of future requirements .
By always focusing on how much you really , really , really do n’t want to have to do this tedious task again , you are subliminally programming yourself to write a reusable solution that will protect you from such a cruel fate .
Just Say No to Features
Some programmers assume that the way to improve software is to add features .
This is true to some extent , but without further clarification , it ’s a useless concept .
Suppose a Martian lands on Earth and , needing some ground transportation , decides to steal a car .
Before doing so he carefully examines the behavior of people and their cars .
Turn the wheel to steer .
Press the pedals to speed up and slow down .
Extend middle finger as appropriate .
Periodically add clear and brown liquids .
He thinks he ’s got it down so he steals a car and speeds off down the road .
Things are going great : the wind in his hair , Tom Petty on the radio , not a care in the world when the car putters to a stop .
“ Aha ! ” he observes shrewdly , “ it ’s time for the clear liquid . ”
Spotting a lake nearby he siphons a full tank ’s worth into the car and gears up to speed off again .
Putting “ features ” into your application is like putting “ liquid ” into your car .
It ’s absolutely essential , but picking the wrong kind will prove disastrous .
Instead of asking which features should be added , consider asking which should be taken away .
There should be a “ feature brainstorm ” for the high level requirements .
These are the “ what your product does ” features .
Then you trim away everything you can from even those features , say no to absolutely everything else , and ship .
Apple took over the portable mp3 player market by producing a device with markedly fewer features than the competion .
What does my iPod do ?
It plays songs and syncs with iTunes .
Those are the high level features and everything else is up for negotiation .
Brent ’s advice , while useful for customers who want to sweet - talk their way into a personalized fix or feature , also serves as a list of warning signs for developers .
When these schemes show up in your inbox , respond cordially but do not be tempted to add useless features .
It ’s you who will pay for it eventually .
Consumers love easy products !
And easy products are , it should come as no surprise , easy to program and support .
Fewer features + more sales = retirement .
Then you can work on hard stuff if you really want to .
The Mental Tie -Breaker
A lot of the time when I ’m stuck or unmotivated it ’s not because of a particularly hard problem , it ’s because I ’ve reduced a hard problem to two equally appealing series of easy steps , but I ca n’t decide which to choose .
The classic dilemma , which path to follow ?
Sadly , in computer programming the path less traveled is liable to lead to disaster .
Except for rare , innovative departures from the norm , succeeding in software is about taking the road most traveled .
Design patterns are one example of a method aimed at helping you do this , but they only work if you recognize the synopsis of the pattern in your problem .
When I ’m stuck and do n’t know how to design some piece of my application , I take comfort in “ mental tie - breakers . ”
The problem of indecision often stems from an underlying statistical tie .
Basically , you can see the good and bad in both of your choices , and are worried that there ’s more bad in one than you can currently observe .
The mental tie - breaker can help you tip the scales in one direction or the other , usually with the weight of some valuable truism that you respect implicitly .
To be really effective , I think you have to develop your own mental tie - breakers .
These are personal .
They work because they represent your values , and you ’ve been stunned to see their value proven in real life .
Here are two examples of mine , which can be phrased in the context of that magical “ easiness ” :
Would a scripter have an easy time writing to this model ?
This question often reveals the inherent flaws in your MVC design .
If your scripter ca n’t easily identify the items in your model , then they ’re probably being modeled in the wrong way .
This trick is amazing because it often reveals surprising flaws like “ I ca n’t believe I stuck all that model behavior in the view . ”
If you identify design flaws using this tie - breaker , you will have an insanely easy time adding scriptability to your app , and you will be in excellent position to take advantage of the many benefits a separated MVC hierarchy brings .
Which of these approaches yields an easier API ?
By thinking of your code as “ API code ” even if it ’s only ever going to be used by your application , you will probably choose better and more robust designs .
This question or a variant on it is also useful when iterating over your task list .
When deciding how to approach a “ hard ” problem on your list , it can be helpful to ask “ What kind of API would make this problem easy ? ”
Once you answer the question , you no longer have a problem , you have an API ( a separate project ) to write .
Wrapping Up
I ’m sure this is the tip of the iceberg with easy programming .
If you ’re of a similar mind and have other tips for making our job the laziest , happiest job on earth , please share them in the comments below .
Update ( and incidentally , appropriate to wrapping up ) : I should have known that I could n’t mention the miracle shoelace method without at least trying to explain how it works .
Well , I really do n’t look forward to trying to draw it or even explain it , but fortunately there are sites out there that talk about this kind of stuff , and I was lucky enough to find the knot .
This site contains a catalog of shoelacing knots .
The one I ’m referring to is called the better bow on the site , but will always for me be remembered as the Ira Ruben Miracle Knot , in honor of the person who showed it to me .
The knot diagrams make it look really hard , but it ’s easy if you do a “ standard knot ” already .
If your current technique involves making a bow and wrapping the other lace around before “ tucking through ” to make the second bow , then that ’s the “ standard knot . ”
All you have to do for the Ira Ruben Miracle Knot is wrap around twice before tucking .
You probably already use your thumb or another finger as the placeholder for the tucked bow .
Just wrap around it twice instead of once .
It produces a sort of double - cinch that keeps the knot tied all day ( or forever ) .
If you know me or if you ever meet me , be sure to make me show you in person the next time we meet .
In honor of Ira Ruben I will be happy to pass this life - changing trick on to anybody who asks .
A side - effect of using this knot is that you end up with just about the tidiest looking knots possible .
At least , in my humble opinion :)

It ’s good !
Just saw Stephen Hawking over at Berkeley .
It was one of the most amazing talks I ’ve ever seen — for reasons that had nothing to do with the talk itself .
I mean , it was good stuff : “ The Origin of the Universe . ”
But my mind has been blown that way a few times already and Hawking did n’t say anything I had n’t already heard .
But it was n’t what he said .
It was the scene .
Imagine the stage : huge , wide , dark — Zellerbach Hall at Berkeley .
There ’s
Hawking in the middle : a crumple of brown suit in his wheelchair , in a pool of light .
There ’s a humongous projection screen behind him and a microphone stand set up in front of him .
In the beginning there ’s a long pause .
Really long .
The applause dies down ( as an aside , I ’ve never seen an audience as warm towards somebody as this one was towards him ) and then… crickets .
For thirty seconds … a minute … two minutes .
Then suddenly , Hawking ’s synthesized voice :
“ Can you hear me ? ”
The climactic scenes of blockbuster movies are not as thrilling .
There is a gasp , and laughs , and claps , and murmurs “ yes . ”
His voice still sounds pretty much like that original Macintosh synthesizer — you ’d recognize it as , like , “ generic computer voice ” — except here in Zellerbach it ’s loud , amplified , everywhere at once .
He barrels into his talk , accompanied by a line of white text along the bottom of the projection screen and a set of awesomely dorky slides .
Yes :
To describe the very shape and duration of the universe , Stephen Hawking uses PowerPoint clip art .
But of course the entire time , he ’s motionless .
For all we know Hawking could be a dummy , a cunningly detailed prop .
The text has all been composed ahead of time , obviously .
The screen is the only thing on stage that moves .
Well , almost .
Hawking controls his world via a sensor that watches his eye — I think he blinks , or at least flexes the blink - muscle , to trigger it .
And when it triggers , it makes a whispery beep .
So throughout his talk , you can hear a background rhythm of these beeps : faint , just on the edge of perception even with the microphone so close , but distinctly there .
Like a pulse .
I wish I could really capture how his synthesized voice felt .
Booming out in that hall , in odd computery cadences , the tonal modulations almost musical sometimes , and a crisp digital sibilance … the guy I went with said “ it sounded kinda like the voice of god ” and he was totally right .
There ’s a funky little spider in Brazil .
Its venom gives male victims hours - long erections .
How cool is that ?
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,269455,00.html
Apparently the spider ’s venom does n’t kill .
It just causes pain and gives guys major erections .
In other words : best . . . practical . . . joke . . . ever .
I wonder if you can order a jar of those spiders over the Internet .
I do n’t know anything about spider venom , but let ’s say for the sake of this blog that you can squeeze a spider with a pair of pliers and get some venom for your evil purposes .
Then slip that venom into an unsuspecting victim ’s drink .
The key to this prank is picking the right victim at the right time .
Some examples spring to mind :
- Groom before the ceremony
- Presidential candidate before a debate
- Teacher before sex education class
- Major league pitcher in game seven of the World Series
- Ballet star before a performance
- Priest before communion
- Host before a toddler beauty pageant
- Olympic wrestler before a match
If you owned a sheep farm , this would be an excellent prank to play on job applicants .
“ We had to fire that last guy because he liked the sheep too much , if you know what I mean .
Anyway , have a beverage and let me show you the herd . ”
Do you have any more prank suggestions ?
The adorable Boston Dynamics RHex robot uses a combo of legs , wheels and paddles to cover pretty much any terrain , water included .
It looks like some sort of frantic animal as it thrashes around in the grass and the sand , but it manages to make it through every time .
Lil ' RHex is remote controllable from up to half a kilometer away using onboard front and rear cameras , and it 's even available for sale now .
The bad news is that you need to get in touch for a price quote , so you know what that means : you can't afford one .
Pity .

A site 's PageRank impacts not only its ranking in Google search results but also the price it can charge advertisers .
A drop in ranking can have serious financial consequences , especially for smaller operators .
The search giant , through its dominant search engine and AdWords / AdSense network , is relied on by millions of websites not only for traffic referrals but for monetisation as well .
Many websites small and large receive over half of their visitors from Google search referrals .
And without a sales team to sign advertising deals , most become AdSense affiliates , automatically connecting them with millions of advertisers worldwide .
Ironically , in the ultimate democracy that is the internet , Google reigns as virtual dictator .
By changing the way it ranks sites in search results , it has the power to effortlessly shape the digital economy and manipulate the incomes of millions of web businesses around the world .
Yaro Starak , an Australian entrepreneur whose website , entrepreneurs - journey.com , provides tips on starting an internet business , recently announced he had earned $ 842 from AdSense in September alone .
His total advertising revenue from the blog that month was over $ 10,000 , but Starak 's ability to continue charging so much is contingent on him maintaining high site traffic , half of which is referred by Google .
" Google controls the income source for a lot of people online , and we 're not talking just search traffic we 're talking pay - per- click [ AdSense ] traffic as well , " Starak said in an interview .
" Google has both sides of the fence - they 've got the publishers , they 've got the advertisers and they 've got the search traffic , so that 's why they 're making so many billions of dollars in money each year . "
Indeed , a whole industry has spawned with the aim of helping website operators obtain the highest rankings for certain keywords in search engines , and milk the most out of their AdSense accounts .
But small changes to Google 's algorithm that determines how high up in search results a site appears can foil any attempts to game the system in a heartbeat .
The worst offenders who are caught trying to artificially boost their search ranking are given the " Google death penalty " , whereby they 're delisted from search results altogether .
But it 's not just illegitimate webmasters who are affected - even websites who do their best to abide by Google 's rules can be impacted by changes to its algorithms .
Darren Rowse , a full - time blogger from Melbourne who also runs the b5media blog network , noticed the PageRank of a number of his sites drop significantly .
He said it was too early to tell whether it will affect his site traffic or revenue , but he was more worried about the impact on his reputation .
" It [ the PageRank ] does say something about my credibility and reputation - in a similar way to anyone ranking anything , " he said .
Rowse has been hit several times over the past few years by changes in Google algorithms .
One led to an overnight drop in his traffic by 80 per cent , which caused a corresponding 80 per cent drop in revenue .
He said it typically took up to six weeks to build the site back up to its usual traffic levels .
" For some bloggers it lasts forever and [ the traffic ] never comes back , " he said .
Google is tight - lipped about changes to its algorithms , but bloggers have speculated it made the most recent change to crack down on the buying and selling of text links outside the Google AdSense network .
Many website operators pay higher ranked sites to link to them , in order to trick Google 's computers into thinking the site is more authoritative and thus securing it a higher ranking in search results .
A Google spokesman said in a statement : " Values in the Google Toolbar can fluctuate for a number of normal reasons , including changes in how we crawl or index the web , or changes in the link structure of the web itself . "
The PageRank could be updated by Google to " to incorporate not only our view on the backlinks to a page or site , but also to incorporate our opinion of the forward links for a site " .
Both Rowse and Starak advise website operators to become less reliant on Google for both traffic and revenue .
" AdSense is very easy to implement so everyone does that - it takes a bit more effort to go and find an advertiser and set up a campaign with them ... but it does make you more stable , " Starak said .
While Starak diversified his revenue sources by selling text and banner advertisements directly to advertisers , he said if Google forced him to stop selling text links and delisted his page from search results he could lose as much as 50 per cent of his income .
" It 's been said that Google owns the internet - it's not a permanent grasp but as long as everyone 's using their search engine it 's very hard for anyone to get in and compete with them . "

LIKE the birds or the beasts , musicians can sometimes be seers of tumultuous change .
Lucky Dube , the best - loved and biggest - selling reggae star in South Africa , looked much like a prophet , with thick dreadlocks falling to his chest and a craggy , bearded face .
His singing , too , as he leapt around the stage , was high , light and oracular , simple words set to drums , bass and two keyboards , which nevertheless detected fault - lines the authorities often could not see .
This made him dangerous — though the danger was hidden in the lilting rhythms and Mr Dube 's dazzling smile .
In the 1990s he performed once , because of a booking mix - up , in a military camp run by the South African Defence Force , and enjoyed watching the white soldiers dance while he sang , catchily and sunnily , “ I am a prisoner in my own country ” , and hummed Zulu insults at them .
He was already a thorn under the hide of the apartheid regime , singing things that were forbidden .
He had started as a mbaqanga singer , making traditional Zulu “ tourist music ” , as he called it , and selling plenty of records .
But from his teenage years he was in thrall to the music of Bob Marley and the chief guitarist of the Wailers , Peter Tosh , envying the drive and edge of Jamaican reggae .
At his own concerts he would dive off into that music , with its undertow of social and political subversion couched in blatant English , and find that the crowd loved it .
In 1984 he dared to make a mini-album , “ Rastas Never Die ” .
Though he had drifted into Rastafarianism out of schoolboy curiosity , believing only parts of it and smoking no ganja , the South African Broadcasting Corporation ( SABC ) saw the album as a challenge , and banned it from the airwaves .
It sold a mere 4,000 copies .
But he made another ( “ Think about the Children ” , 1985 ) , then another ( “ Slave ” , 1987 ) , all the time notching up more sales and ratcheting up the menace in the music .
“ Slave ” was ostensibly about alcoholism , which had broken up his own family before he was born .
But it included the phrase “ I 'm just a slave , a legal slave ” , which was not to do with drinking .
To make the message clearer , Mr Dube renamed his backing band “ The Slaves ” .
The record , though unplayed by the SABC , went to triple gold in three months .
The next year Mr Dube got bolder still .
At a recording session he sang gently , on to the tape ,
Too many people
Hate apartheid
Why do you like it ?
His recording engineer stopped the tape , telling him he could n't say that .
But Mr Dube not only said it ; he also persuaded the SABC to air it , the first anti-apartheid song to be played on a white station .
The album , “ Together as One ” , sold 100,000 copies in its first five days , becoming the soundtrack of the anti-apartheid movement .
In that week , too — as if Mr Dube had sensed the first ripples of the coming wave of change — eight of South Africa 's long - term political prisoners were suddenly released from jail .
Down Highway 54
None of this seemed to be in Mr Dube 's future when he was born , the sickly first son of a single mother on a run-down farm in East Transvaal .
He began to work , as a child , trimming gardens in white suburbs .
His first drums were “ borrowed ” from a school cupboard , his first guitar bought with the proceeds of a little play he had written .
He might have sung Zulu township jive all his life , if he had not felt compelled to give “ a message ” to the world for which reggae was his ideal language .
The message was peace , unity , love and respect .
It was much bound up with the clean - living Rastafarianism he had plucked out of the encyclopedia , but it was also drawn from his own South African experience .
His songs , he said , were about life , not politics .
Nor was his music just a borrowing from Jamaica : it was rooted in Africa , especially in the ancient drums that were used to communicate hope , fear or joy between one village and another .
With the end of apartheid in 1994 Mr Dube became a world star , signed by Motown .
But there was still plenty to sing against at home .
He took on drugs ( “ You go sniffling them glue / No good for you ” ) ; promiscuity and AIDS ( “ Do n't you think it 's time / to be a little more responsible ” ) and racial quotas ( “ We are tired of people who / think that affirmative action is the way out / and is another way of putting puppets / where they do n't belong . ” )
He also sang against South Africa 's appalling crime wave , apparently unstoppable by bodyguards , police or high walls .
Do you ever worry
About your house being broke into
Do you ever worry
About your car being taken away from you
In broad daylight
Down Highway 54
It was not down Highway 54 , but in Rosettenville , a suburb of Johannesburg ; and it was not in broad daylight , but at 8.20 at night , that Lucky Dube 's vehicle was carjacked by five men .
He was shot to death in front of two of his seven children .
But for his legions of fans throughout Africa and beyond it , mourning the senseless loss of a musician they also considered a liberator , his prophecy had come close enough .
Ron Kall , through Oped News requested a list of reasons for opposing organizing for impeachment .
Obviously more people oppose impeachment , than think it 's a good idea to post on a basically pro-impeachment site .
I hope it 's not too late to comment .
A lot of thought went into this essay .
President Clinton testified under oath " I never had sex with that woman . "
But today Cheney definitely , and Bush probably , will refuse to testify .
This could be the beginning rather than the end of the story .
However , John Conyers can't even muster the votes to hold White House officials who refuse to testify in contempt of Congress .
Many people testified during Watergate before Nixon was implicated .
Without the threat of jail for at first lower officials for refusing to testify , or for later discovery of testifying falsely , impeachment efforts can go nowhere .
How about rallies to back Conyers 's and Waxman 's efforts to force administration officials to testify .
Harassing Conyers and Waxman demanding instant impeachment proceeding shows them down , not helps them along .
However some unforseen news event ( ie smoking gun ) revelation involving Cheney is possible .
But it would most likely lead to Bush disavowing Cheney .
And the Vice President office would move across the street where it used to be , and the decision to impeach or not impeach Cheney would revolve only around the possibility of Cheney becoming President if Bush died .
If the impeachment efforts continue , suddenly we would hear more and more dirt , and alleged blemishes on Nancy Pelosi , who is third in line to become President .
Remember as soon as John Murtha in 2004 was about to become the majority whip , suddenly his pro-gun and mostly anti-abortion record hit the limelight , and that he brushed off a bribery attempt with " maybe later " .
Murtha was from stanchly pro-gun Western Pennsylvania , so the NRA was n't enthused with his lukewarm support , and Hogan loved to make strong solidarity statement and votes in favor of choice and Gay rights , but his slightly weak stance on guns did n't fit in , so the gun lobby did n't come to Murtha 's defense .
Likewise as soon as impeachment came close , Pelosi not Bush would suddenly become the central story .
If Cheney is impeached or even only thoroughly discredited , President Bush will try to be a new President whether or not circumstance will consider that enough .
Bush has already changed policy toward North Korea .
Events and both critics and supporters keep pushing Bush in a both more conservative and incompetent direction .
Bush wants immigration reform , and while Governor of Texas , supported Mexican - Americans , but relentless conservative pressure and lack of vocal support for his immigration policies among progressives is pushing him toward a round up of undocumented workers .
Bush wants limited Federal stem cell research with a lot of moral over sight .
But people against stem cell research pretends that he supports them , while critics pretend he opposes all research preferring to wait , rather than have the precedent of moral oversight .
The timing of the resolution opposing Armenian genocide , right while Turkish relations with the Kurds in Iran was at the boiling point , may have been an attempt to screw Bush up .
In October 2004 , there was a cease - fire in Fuluja after an Iraqi go - between arranged for the insurgents to accept nominal Bagdad authority .
US troops pulled back , and Iraqi 's cheered what they thought was the end of the war .
But the US peace movement a month before the election , wanted Bush out , not a peace agreement right before the election .
A Kerry ad complained of terrorists hiding in Fuluja .
Bush demanded that Fuluja turn over Al Sadr for arrest .
By election day US troops were back in .
For three years if not six , the US has been in suspended animation instead of trying to work together to solve our problems .
We are at war with two Muslim countries but Hillary Guiliani or Romney could get us into war with many more .
If it is possible to call for impeachment , while working with Conyers to enforce Congressional subpoenas , and if one could try to impeach Cheney and dream of impeaching Bush , while at the same time working with the President on immigration reform , than working for impeachment might have a positive political effect .
Otherwise working toward impeachment just prevents problems from being solved .
What can cause more harm than a impeachment movement preventing people from solving problems is the idea that impeachment and digging for hidden facts around 9/11 is subversive and dangerous .
If all I can do is prevent Oped news from being declared a terrorist publication by encouraging vigorous two sided debate , I would have accomplished a lot .

DVB .no has posted news ( in Burmese ) about soldiers from # 33 battalion allowing the monks to continue the protests in Mandalay , the second largest city in Myanmar .
27th Sept DVB news : Battalion # 33 stands down in Mandalay .
Soldiers from # 33 Battalion knelt down and requested the protesting monks to stop the protest .
Monks from Mandalay monasteries including those from “ ThaTaNa ” monk college marched for protest and were blocked at 42nd street by soldiers of # 33 battalion .
Many of the monks replied , “ You may shoot but we will still march ” , and carried on with their marches .
The soldiers knelt down , shed tears and finally they stepped down to let the monks go , reported the witnesses from Mandalay .
Kaduang has posted an eyewitness account of yesterdays happening in capital Yangoon .
While they are trying to stop us , another military truck appeared from the Myanmar Archers Association Ward and shot gun fires .
Some people were hit .
I had to jump over the brick wall and ran into the school .
I met other fellows who came and hid in the school .
They said two people were shot while they were jumping over the wall .
There were lots of gun fires either aiming at protestors or on the sky .
During that time , the school was n’t over yet .
There were parents who came and picked their children up .
They even shot gunfires during that time .
How bad were they !

Nay Nay Naing – Bloody Day 27 Sept 2007
Everyone has been saying today as bloody 27 Sept and yesterday as bloody Full Moon Day .
Today situation is one of the worst .
26th midnight , many of monks from “ NweKyarYan ” monastery and many innocent citizen blood shed to the ground .
According to CNN news , due to the shootings , more than 10 people died including a Japanese reporter .
As usual they will lie about shooting to the air while they shoot straight at people .
No matter how they lie about that in local news , nobody will believe as there are true evident in front of citizen eyes .
I respect those who risk their life to take photos , videos and report about the latest events to reach to international news media .
Looking at all those reported media news encourage us and make us brave ; at the same time we shed tears and felt tremendous pity and sadness toward those who were kill or injured and taken by the military .
Nevertheless , it 's very encouraging to hear that protestors are not feared by the situation and will continue their protest as best they can .
Many Wishes .

Some commenters have asked for more about Social Security ’s role in the long - run budget problem , and in particular an explanation of my assertion that the Beltway obsession with Social Security reflects ignorance .
So here ’s a quick , informal explanation .
Start with the current position .
Last year , federal spending on Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid was 8.5 percent of GDP , equally divided between Social Security and the health care programs .
Dismal long - run projections , like those of the GAO , have this total rising by 10 percentage points of GDP by mid-century .
So , how much of this is a Social Security problem ?
Pundits like Tim Russert love to point out that in its early days Social Security had 16 workers paying in for every retiree receiving benefits .
But this is irrelevant ; looking forward , we ’ll see the worker - beneficiary ratio fall from about 3 to 2 as the baby boomers retire .
This will raise the percentage of GDP spent on Social Security from about 4 to 6 — that is , a rise of about 2 percentage points of GDP , which is a small fraction of the entitlements problem .
See , for example , this chart from my NY Review of Books piece on the subject .
What ’s more , Social Security has already been strengthened to deal with this rise .
In 1983 the payroll tax was increased and adjustments made to the retirement age , so as to build up a trust fund .
According to the “ intermediate ” projection of the Social Security trustees , this trust fund will be exhausted in 2041 — but they also present a more optimistic scenario , based on economic assumptions that do n’t seem at all outlandish , in which the trust fund goes on forever .
This brings us to the claim that the trust fund does n’t exist , because it ’s invested in government bonds .
The full explanation of why this is sophistry is here .
The bottom line is that Social Security is just not the major problem .
Now , part of the projected rise in Medicare and Medicaid costs represents the effects of an aging population .
But as a new report from the CBO explains , demography is only a minor factor — mainly it ’s rising health care costs .
What ’s more , the proposed “ solutions ” for the Social Security problem have no relevance to the issue of rising Medicare costs — even if privatization were a good idea , which it is n’t , it would do nothing to solve the problem of rising medical bills .
The Beltway obsession with Social Security is a classic case of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing .
People have picked up a few facts about demography , and think they understand the long run budget problem .
They do n’t .
PS : OK , from some communications I see that 2017 — the projected date at which payroll taxes no longer cover benefit payments — has raised its ugly head .
But there is no interpretation under which 2017 matters .
Social Security legally has its own dedicated funding ; if you believe the government will honor the law , the surpluses the system is now running are building up a trust fund , which will finance the system for decades after 2017 , and maybe forever .
If you think the law will be ignored , then Social Security does n’t really have its own budget — the payroll tax is just one of many taxes , and SS benefits are just one of many government costs .
In that case the relationship between payroll taxes and benefits is irrelevant .
The only way to make 2017 matter is to change the rules midway : when SS runs surpluses they do n’t count , but when it runs deficits they do .
Several Banksy artworks are going on sale this week in London
Stencilled artwork from the guerrilla artist can be seen on walls across London , but Tower Hamlets is the first council to treat them as vandalism .
The plan comes as 11 pieces of the artist 's work go on sale on Wednesday .
Banksy , from Bristol , made his name with public art and subversive stunts .

Tower Hamlets councillor Abdal Ullah
A piece , commissioned by rock band Blur for their 2003 album Think Tank , recently sold in London for £ 300,000 , Gareth Williams of Bonhams said .
A spokeswoman for Tower Hamlets Council said it had not thought of selling the potentially valuable artwork to help raise money for council services , but did not rule out such action being considered in the future .
A statement said : " Tower Hamlets Council takes the cleanliness of the borough very seriously and is committed to removing all graffiti as soon as possible .
" Whilst some graffiti is considered to be art , we know that many of our residents think graffiti in areas where they live , such as local housing estates , is an eyesore . "
Tower Hamlets councillor Abdal Ullah said : " We need to be clear here , graffiti is a crime .
" It spoils the environment , makes our neighbourhoods feel less safe , and costs thousands of pounds each year to clean - money that could instead be paying for valuable local services . "
It is not yet known how many of the artist 's works would be affected .

9 Method And Device For Recognition of a Collision With a Pedestrian Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The days of plowing your car into things and not knowing whether or not it was a living person are finally over !
This patent , which uses sensors in the car 's bumper and engine hood , claims to be able to decide " with a high reliability " if that thing you hit was a pedestrian !
It also takes into consideration changes in acceleration and whether or not the brakes were used prior to impact to figure it out .
Sounds like a pretty smart system to us .
With that in mind , here 's a little suggestion for the inventors :
When you guys roll out the next version of this thing , maybe it'd be better if it actually PREVENTED the collision .
That would probably make it slightly more useful .
As it stands , all this really does is keep a tally of how many vehicular homicides you 've committed .

Bluetooth headsets - Cool vs Stupid and Pretentious
I remember when I had to walk to school with just flour bags on my ... wait wrong story .
I remember when people would give me dirty looks for walking down the street talking on my cellphone .

Now people give me dirty looks if I do n't !
I think headsets are still in that " new and strange " category and all wearers must be killed as they unclean gaijin .
Is it the headset or is it we sense the need to impress ?
I do n't know .
I do like the new bluetooth headphones , no one obsesses about headphones - can I use those and still maintain my dignity ?
Anyone ?

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Ever get mad trying to figure out why your version of “ Voodoo Child ” does n’t sound like Jimi Hendrix ?
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Help is at hand from what is described as the world ’s first robot guitar -- an electric guitar that not only keeps itself in tune even after string changes but also allows players to access six nonstandard tunings at the push of a button .
After 15 years of research , Gibson Guitar is launching a limited edition Les Paul Robot Guitar next month that has set players abuzz with both enthusiasm and skepticism .
“ It will not make you a better guitar player but it will allow the average player to access some very sophisticated tunings , ” Gibson Guitar Chief Executive Henry Juszkiewicz told Reuters on Tuesday .
The six nonstandard preset tunings were used on hits ranging from “ Honky Tonk Women ” by The Rolling Stones and Hendrix ’s “ Voodoo Child ” to Led Zeppelin ’s “ Going to California ” and Joni Mitchell ’s “ The Circle Game . ”
Gibson says the robot guitar is aimed at amateurs who have a hard time keeping their guitars in tune , as well as professionals who now use technicians during concerts to keep about 100 guitars tuned to different keys .
“ Professional guitar players use a lot of different tuning and people who listen to the stars wonder why they ca n’t reproduce the same sound themselves , ” Juszkiewicz said .
Temperature variations , changing strings and simply playing the instrument have long been tuning challenges for guitarists with even the best musical ear .
But some have already poured scorn on the robot guitar .
“ I ’m sorry , this is just lazy .
With stuff like this , tuning is going to be a lost skill , ” wrote LettheBassPlay on the www.ultimate-guitar.com
Web site forum .
Gibson said the robot guitar is the biggest advance in electric guitar design in more than 70 years .
“ It ’s very addictive , ” Juszkiewicz said .
Gibson will launch 4,000 limited edition , blue silverburst Les Gibson Robot Guitars around the world on December 7 at a price in the region of $ 2,500 .
It expects to roll out a standard robot edition starting in January 2008 .
The Bush Administration long ago secured a special place in history for the way in which it distorts , manipulates , or censors science for political ends .
But now the habit — and it does seem to be a habitual failing — has come to haunt President Bush himself .
As everyone knows , Mr. Bush has never taken the issue of climate change nearly as seriously as it should be taken .
Right off the bat , almost , he reneged on a campaign promise to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , and then he rejected the Kyoto agreement on climate change without consulting his allies — the first of many indignities that eventually persuaded Christy Whitman , his administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency , to leave Washington for less tumultuous latitudes in New Jersey ’s horse country .
Lately , though , Mr. Bush has been sounding more forthcoming about climate change .
At a recent two - day summit of the big emitting countries in Washington , a summit Mr. Bush convened , he promised a major effort to develop greener technologies .
“ Our guiding principle is clear , ” the President declared .
“ We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions . ”
This was hardly a full - throated endorsement of the kind of mandatory caps on emissions that many people feel are necessary .
But it was something .
Then , as if on cue , came yet another example of science - tinkering that seemed to undercut Mr. Bush ’s sincerity .
This was the revelation last week that White House editors had made deep cuts in written testimony given to a Senate committee this week by Dr. Julie L. Gerberding , the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Her original testimony described climate change as positing “ difficult challenges ” and as a “ serious public health concern . ”
It also said that the public health effects of climate change had gone “ largely unaddressed . ”
All this disappeared , leaving only wordy generalities like “ climate change is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of Americans and the nation ’s public health infrastructure . ”
Dr. Gerberding herself seemed only mildly perturbed ( “ a mountain out of a molehill , ” she said ) .
Even so , the episode could not help but remind observers of the administration ’s long history of muzzling people who disagree with it ( e.g. , James Hansen , the government ’s pre-eminent climate policy expert ) , or censoring inconvenient truths ( e.g , reports in 2003 and 2004 linking human activity to global warming , both of which were censored ) or being highly selective in what science it actually chooses to use ( e.g. a single , narrow economic analysis to justify Mr. Bush ’s assertion that the Kyoto Protocol would wreck the American economy . )
After all these years , we would like to believe Mr. Bush now that he is saying that global warming is a real problem and one worth taking seriously and honestly .
But we would feel a lot better if the editorial gremlins on the White House staff and in the Office of Management and Budget were on the same page .
We are constantly reminded -- or told or warned or yelled at -- that Iran should not get The Bomb .
" The world , " even the fashionably reactionary New York Times wrote on Oct. 29 , " should not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . "
Why not ?
The world should not allow the United States , Russia , China , Britain , France , India , Pakistan and Israel to have nuclear weapons .
But it does , not because the world wants a nuclear club , but because those nations never bothered asking permission to include mass destruction in their foreign - policy arsenal .
The United States ( which spent $ 7.2 trillion building and maintaining 7,000 nuclear weapons ) and the former Soviet Union ( ditto ) , two old hands at mass extermination abroad and at home , came close to wiping out the planet over a couple of mindless standoffs during the Cold War.
India and Pakistan came close to nuking each other a couple of times since 1998 .
France and Britain through brutal colonialism or China through totalitarian repression at home each have the blood of millions on their conscience , even if by conventional means only .
None of these nations has standing to play nuclear cop in the world .
" I often think back to the morning of May 12 , " wrote the Indian writer Amitav Gosh in 1998 , referring to the day India carried out its first series of nuclear tests since 1974 .
" I was in New York at the time .
I remember my astonishment both at the news of the tests and also at the response to them : the tone of chastisement , the finger - wagging by countries that still possessed tens of thousands of nuclear warheads .
Had they imagined that the technology to make a bomb had wound its way back into a genie 's lamp because the Cold War had ended ?
Did they think that it had escaped the world 's attention that the five peacekeepers of the United Nations ' Security Council all had nuclear arms ?
If so , then perhaps India 's nuclear tests served a worthwhile purpose by waking the world from its willed slumber . "
I 'm not justifying the possession of nuclear weapons -- by anyone .
I just do n't buy the presumptions that the nation with the greatest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction on the planet , a demonstrated history of using them offensively , an ongoing addiction to waging unnecessary , pre-emptive and mass - destructive conventional war , and the promise ( judging from all its presidential contenders ) of more of the same , has any say in Iran 's or any other country 's right to nuclear weapons .
Disarm first .
Then lecture .
Any nation that decides to acquire nuclear weapons will do so .
It 's no longer a matter of if or how but of when .
But opposition to Iran 's nukes reveals more than conventional hypocrisy or a refusal to concede that the chain reaction started by the Manhattan Project is unstoppable .
The opposition , at heart , is racist .
It 's an unveiled judgment that claims white Americans can be trusted with the bomb , Muslim Iranians cannot .
The mistranslated claim that Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wants Israel wiped off the face of the map is bandied about as proof -- as if Iran 's 70 million people would n't be wiped off the face of the map should so much as a nuclear firecracker graze Israel 's environs .
The only thing more obscene than Ahmadinejad 's posturing is the posturing it provokes in the United States and Israel .
This attempted long - distance colonialism explains why Arabs danced in the streets as far away as Cairo when Pakistan detonated the first " Muslim " bomb in 1998 , and why India 's ruling party handed out sweetmeats on the streets of Indian cities and planned a " shrine of strength " at the mouth of the crater from its own nuclear test .
Post - colonial nations are tired of white bullying , for good reason .
Their nuclear pageantry is fanatical and mad , but it differs from its Western equivalent only idiomatically , not substantially .
In these young nuclear powers ' minds -- the warped minds of the nuclear age birthed in the United States -- it restores the dignity and respect the whitish West still denies the browner East .
The bomb is an insurgent symbol of redress .
Insanity ?
No question .
But the insanity is a late flowering of colonial payback -- and in the case of America 's relationship with Iran , a very recent flowering .
Short of regaining a few isotopes of credibility by disarmament , there 's nothing the West can do about it , least of all these bombastic United States .

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick is pushing a bill that would open three resort casinos in the state at the same time that it imposes some of the toughest penalties in the nation for online gambling :
Even as Governor Deval Patrick seeks to license three resort casinos in Massachusetts , he hopes to clamp down on the explosion in Internet gambling by making it illegal for state residents to place a bet online .
He has proposed jail terms of up to two years and $ 25,000 fines for violators .
While online gambling that allows you to deposit by phone is only getting more and more popular worldwide , Patrick is looking to nullify its presence in the state , while also increasing the amount of physical gambling going on .
There is a strong argument for online gambling on sites like domino qq online , in that they are far more convenient than visiting real - life casinos , but it is obviously going to be a huge threat for casino owners .
The provision , buried deep in Patrick ’s bill to allow three casinos to the state , puts the governor at odds with a fellow Democrat : US Representative Barney Frank , the sponsor of federal legislation to license and regulate online gambling nationally .
Yesterday Frank strongly criticized the governor ’s plan to punish online gamers while inviting casino operators to set up shop .
“ Why is gambling in a casino OK and gambling on the Internet is not ? ” Frank said .
“ He ’s making a big mistake .
Whether someone decides to gamble on fantasy baseball games or visits a casino in Vegas , this is completely their own choice .
As long as this is legal in the country they are in , then this should n’t be seen as a problem .
He ’s giving opponents an argument against him . ”
Saying this though , there are some people who know when to stop when it comes to gambling .
For example , they can play a game of Kenoland and if they do n’t get the outcome they ’re after , they have the will to stop .
But there are some people out there who do n’t know their limits .

From FreeThoughtPedia
A logical fallacy is a statement that is made appearing or claiming to be truthful or accurate , but due to an error in the structure of the claim , is not necessarily truthful nor accurate .
Unfortunately , logical fallacies are rampant in mainstream media .
Being aware of the various types of fallacies and how they are structured , can help you identify misleading statements and recognize what is and is n't legitimate information .
Fallacies of Distraction
These fallacies depend upon distracting or confusing the person .
False Dilemma
two choices are given when in fact there are three or more options .
If you 're not with us , then you 're with the terrorists
From Ignorance
because something is not known to be true , it is assumed to be false
Have you ever seen a zombie ?
' There is no such thing as a black swan because none has ever been observed . '
Slippery Slope
a series of increasingly unacceptable consequences is drawn
If we allow cannabis to be decriminalized , they 'll be legalizing heroin next !
Complex Question
two unrelated points are conjoined as a single proposition
Appeals to Motives in Place of Support
These fallacies prey upon peoples ' emotions .
Appeal to Force
the reader is persuaded to agree by force
Appeal to Pity
the reader is persuaded to agree by sympathy
" How can you say that ball was out of bounds ?
It was so close , and I 'm down ten games to two "
" You always win these arguments .
Can you just let me win once ? "
Consequences
the reader is warned of unacceptable consequences .
This is pretty much a constant logical fallacy upon which most religion is based .
This can include concepts such as " they 'll move on to much bigger targets than just the twin towers at 9/11 if they 're not stopped " to persuade viewers .
Prejudicial Language
value or moral goodness is attached to believing the author
Popularity
a proposition is argued to be true because it is widely held to be true
If God was n't real , why would the vast majority of people believe in God ?
Changing the Subject
These fallacies also distract the person by bringing up something not necessarily related to the subject at hand .
Attacking the Person ( Ad Hominem )
the person 's character is attacked , the person 's circumstances are noted , the person does not practise what is preached
Appeal to Authority
the authority is not an expert in the field , experts in the field disagree , the authority was joking , drunk , or in some other way not being serious
Anonymous Authority
the authority in question is not named
Style Over Substance
the manner in which an argument ( or arguer ) is presented is felt to affect the truth of the conclusion
once a question has been answered or an argument made , the criteria for answering is suddenly changed
Inductive Fallacies
A claim is made that is not fully - justified .
Nanci Pelosi responsible for gas prices ?
False Analogy
Hasty Generalization
the sample is too small to support an inductive generalization about a population
Unrepresentative Sample
the sample is unrepresentative of the sample as a whole
the two objects or events being compared are relevantly dissimilar
Slothful Induction
the conclusion of a strong inductive argument is denied despite the evidence to the contrary
Hugo has had twelve car accidents in the last six months , yet he insists that it is just a coincidence and not his fault .
( Inductively , the evidence is overwhelming that it is his fault . )
Fallacy of Exclusion
evidence which would change the outcome of an inductive argument is excluded from consideration
Fallacies Involving Statistical Syllogisms
A Syllogism is a claim that is based on the combination of two prior claims .
Using statistics , one can easily manipulate data to make erroneous claims .
Accident
a generalization is applied when circumstances suggest that there should be an exception
Converse Accident
an exception is applied in circumstances where a generalization should apply
Causal Fallacies
A dubious / erroneous cause - and - effect relationship is claimed .
Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
because one thing follows another , it is held to be caused by the other
Joint effect
one thing is held to cause another when in fact they are both the joint effects of an underlying cause
Insignificant
one thing is held to cause another , and it does , but it is insignificant compared to other causes of the effect
Wrong Direction
the direction between cause and effect is reversed
Complex Cause
the cause identified is only a part of the entire cause of the effect
Missing the Point , Distraction
Someone goes off topic , partially as a distraction and partially to cover up the fact that they 're injecting something not directly related to the subject at hand , using it as phony " evidence . "
Begging the Question
the truth of the conclusion is assumed by the premises
Irrelevant Conclusion
an argument in defense of one conclusion instead proves a different conclusion
Red Herring
the introduction of additional , often unrelated information or commentary as a means of avoiding the principal argument
Straw Man
the author attacks an argument different from ( and weaker than ) the opposition 's best argument
Fallacies of Ambiguity
These are methods of presenting claims which , due to the nature of their delivery , are misleading or erroneous .
Equivocation
the same term is used with two different meanings
Amphiboly
the structure of a sentence allows two different interpretations
Accent
the emphasis on a word or phrase suggests a meaning contrary to what the sentence actually says
Category Errors
These are false claims .
Composition
because the attributes of the parts of a whole have a certain property , it is argued that the whole has that property
Division
because the whole has a certain property , it is argued that the parts have that property
Non Sequitur
These are unsupported and presumptuous conclusions .
Affirming the Consequent
any argument of the form : If A , then B. B ; therefore A All Italians eat spaghetti , so anyone who eats spaghetti is Italian .
Argument By Question
a false assumption is introduced in the form of an interrogative
Have you stopped beating your wife ?
( this assumption can't be denied by answering simply " yes " or " no " . )
Denying the Antecedent
any argument of the form :
If A then B , Not A , thus Not B
Inconsistency
asserting that contrary or contradictory statements are both true
Syllogistic Errors
Errors in deductive reasoning .
Improve use of major and minor premises when trying to make a conclusion .
Fallacy of Four Terms
a syllogism has four terms
Undistributed Middle
two separate categories are said to be connected because they share a common property
Illicit Major
the predicate of the conclusion talks about all of something , but the premises only mention some cases of the term in the predicate
Illicit Minor
the subject of the conclusion talks about all of something , but the premises only mention some cases of the term in the subject
Fallacy of Exclusive Premises
a syllogism has two negative premises
Fallacy of Drawing an Affirmative Conclusion From a Negative Premise
as the name implies
Existential Fallacy
a particular conclusion is drawn from universal premises
Fallacies of Explanation
These are clearly subjective and dubious methods of making claims .
Subverted Support
The phenomenon being explained does n't exist
Non-support
Evidence for the phenomenon being explained is biased
Untestability
The theory which explains cannot be tested
Limited Scope
The theory which explains can only explain one thing
Limited Depth
The theory which explains does not appeal to underlying causes
Fallacies of Definition
Using improper technique or evidence in justifying a claim .
Too Broad
The definition includes items which should not be included
Too Narrow
The definition does not include all the items which should be included
The definition is more difficult to understand than the word or concept being defined
Circular Definition
The definition includes the term being defined as a part of the definition
Conflicting Conditions
The definition is self - contradictory

Bufo alvarius :
The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert
by Albert Most
Gila , Arizona
Summer 1983
To Pat and Quanah
Specialized multi-cellular glands concentrated on the neck and limbs of B. alvarius produce a viscous milky - white venom that contains large amounts of the potent hallucinogen , 5 - MEO - DMT .
When vaporized by heat and taken into the lungs in the form of smoke , this indole - based alkaloid produces an incredibly intense psychedelic experience of incredibly short duration .
There is no hangover or harmful effect .
On the contrary , a pleasant psychedelic afterglow appears quite regularly after smoking the venom of B. alvarius , the Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert .
Part One
You wo n't have any trouble identifying B. alvarius .
It is the largest native North American species of toad .
In terms of snout - to - vent length , B. alvarius requires a minimum of three inches for sexual maturity , although breeding adults continue to grow up to seven inches in length .
This desert dweller is of stout build with a squat body and a flat broad head .
The skin is smooth and leathery , sparsely covered with pale orange warts , and can change considerably from a dark brown to olive or grayish green .
The belly is cream colored and usually unmarked .
There are one to four prominent round white warts at the corner of the mouth .
But , by far , the most identifying characteristic of B. alvarius is the presence of large granular glands on the neck and limbs .
The granular glands are specialized multi-cellular concentrations of tissue .
The most prominent of these is the pair of large kidney - shaped parotoid glands located one on each side of the neck , over and behind the tympanum .
Enlarged and elongated glands on the outside of each hind leg , between the knee and thigh , are called femorals .
Similarly , the tibeals are long glands , or a line of shorter ones , that run the full length between the knee and ankle .
An additional gland concentration can be found on each of the forearms .
Part Two
" A certain man had the good fortune to possess a goose that laid a golden egg every day .
But dissatisfied with so slow an income , and thinking to seize the whole treasure at once , he killed the goose ; and cutting her open , found her -- just what any other goose would be .
" The Goose with the Golden Eggs , by Aesop
Important Considerations
Every psychedelic experience is chiefly a function of set and setting , of preparation and environment .
The better prepared you are , the better the experience will be for you .
Consider the following instructions :
Smoke the venom fairly early in the day on an empty but not starving stomach .
Do not drink any alcohol or take any drugs or medication prior to smoking the venom .
Provide a comfortable setting which is as free as possible from unforeseen distractions and intrusions .
Make sure you will not be disturbed for at least thirty minutes .
Be comfortably seated or prone prior to inhaling the vapors .
Enjoy your trip !

The Handbook for the Serious Toad Collector , by Albert Most Everything you could possibly want to know about the " psychedelic toad " is covered in this illustrated guide to B. alvarius .
Beginning with the mating call and mounting clasp , the author details the metamorphosis of B. alvarius through egg and tadpole stages up to the mature adult .
A special section on induced ovulation and tadpole culturing describes how the serious toad collector can , at any time , induce spawning in pet toads and insure insemination of the 8000 eggs laid by the adult female .
Peganum harmala : The Hallucinogenic Herb of the American Southwest , by Albert Most
The psychoactive alkaloids present in P. harmala have such extraordinary effects that they have earned the name " telepathines . "
The author presents an illustrated guide to the history , botany , chemistry , cultivation , preparation , use , and effects of this most unusual hallucinogenic plant .
Eros and the Pineal , by Albert Most
This unusual do - it - yourself guide details the manipulation of normal biogenic amines in the human brain .
The author presents a safe and effective procedure for increasing the concentration of pineal serotonin , blocking its normal enzymatic inactivation , and shifting pineal catabolism towards the production of endogenous hallucinogens .
Fully illustrated and highly recommended .
NOTES :
The author is saying that 500mg of dried venom times 15 % equals 75 mg of 5 - MeO - DMT per toad .
However , the average yield of dried venom per toad , regardless of its size , is generally 250 mg when all the glands are milked twice .
Additionally , it 's a good possibility that as much as 25 % of the venom will contain 5 - MeO - DMT which would equate to 62.5 mg of 5 - MeO - DMT per average toad .
Please take additional note , however , that the amount of 5 - MeO - DMT in any one toad varies quite considerably and could possibly be less than 25 % or even 15 % .
Unfortunately , everyone agrees that The Handbook for the Serious Toad Collector was never published , despite having been listed in a couple of places as available .
However , the information it would have contained can be found here .
For those interested in the induction of breeding activity by experimental means and under laboratory conditions , outside of the normal breeding season , please see the information here .

Recently GameStop , the videogame retailer , added a new feature to its online storefront that permits filtering of its game catalog by the ratings assigned by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) .
Presumably , a savvy parent shopping for an 8 - year - old child can now browse for games rated E ( for " Everyone " ) and skip those rated E10 + which are appropriate for a slightly older audience .
I started looking at the number of games of each type per platform -- Nintendo DS , PlayStation Portable , Xbox 360 -- and it made me wonder what patterns I would see if I could visualize these distributions .
Fortunately , the ESRB has long provided a variety of means for searching its ratings database of rated games .
After I compiled the data for several platforms , I began making charts of the distributions on individual consoles and handhelds .
Those graphs revealed manufacturer - specific ratings distributions , and possibly even some evidence of how platforms have different strategies in different generations .
Handhelds
For our first comparison we 'll examine three handheld platforms : the Nintendo Game Boy Advance , the Nintendo DS , and the Sony PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) .
As an exercise in analyzing these rating distribution graphs , the platforms are not indicated initially , and the graphs are given in random order .
With a little bit of background knowledge and deduction each platform can be recognized just from its distribution .
Can you tell which is which ?
The PSP will probably stand out to most people , but the real trick is knowing which is the Nintendo DS and which is the Game Boy Advance .
The answers , and explanations , are shown on the next page .

How are America ’s birds doing after seven years of the antiGreens ?
Well , 178 species in the continental U.S. and 39 in Hawaii are in need of immediate conservation .
That according to the 2007 Audubon WatchList .
“ We call this a ‘ WatchList ’ but it is really a call to action , because the alternative is to watch these species slip ever closer to oblivion , ” said Audubon Bird Conservation Director and co-author , Greg Butcher .
“ How quickly and effectively we act to protect and support the species on this list will determine their future ; where we ’ve taken aggressive action , we ’ve seen improvement , ” says David Pashley , American Bird Conservancy ’s Director of Conservation Programs and co-author .
Could Step

Fast forward to 2008 & ditch the flightless leaders .
Among the most imperiled species on the list that regularly breed in the continental U.S. are :
Gunnison Sage - Grouse ( not on Endangered Species Act list ( ESA ) [ here ’s why , at least in part ] ) •
This species is restricted to Southwest …
Julia Whitty is Mother Jones ’ environmental correspondent .
You can read from her new book , The Fragile Edge , and other writings , here .
… Colorado and adjacent Utah .
Drought , which is predicted to get worse with increased global warming , is among the factors that have reduced the Gunnison Sage - Grouse population to fewer than 5,000 ; habitat loss and fragmentation and excessive grazing are other threats .
Protection and restoration of contiguous tracts of good habitat is critical .
Lesser Prairie - Chicken ( not on ESA list ) • Habitat loss and degradation have restricted this species to a number of isolated populations , many of which are on private lands in Kansas , Colorado , Oklahoma , New Mexico , and Texas .
Small population size , changing habitat resulting from drought , and climate change threaten continued survival .
California Condor •
Once reduced to nine individual wild birds , this raptor is slowly recovering , thanks to captive breeding and the release of individuals in California and Arizona .
There are now 305 individuals , including 148 free - flying birds .
Lead bullets are a critical threat to long - term survival , as fragments poison wild condors that eat the remains of hunters ’ kills .
Audubon California and American Bird Conservancy have spearheaded recent passage of legislation eliminating lead bullets in the range of the condor in that state .
Whooping Crane • Unregulated shooting and loss of habitat reduced this species to fewer than 20 individuals around the turn of the 20th Century .
Implementation of a recovery plan developed under the Endangered Species Act has resulted in more than a 1000 % increase in population to over 200 individuals , and has spawned efforts to establish additional wild breeding populations .
Piping Plover • Protection of this shorebird ’s beachfront nesting grounds is helping to improve the outlook for this species .
Human development along beaches , increased beach recreation , disturbance by pets , and increased predation require constant vigilance .
Intensive conservation efforts supported by the Endangered Species Act have helped stabilize populations and allowed populations to increase in some regions of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts .
Black - capped Vireo • Suburban development , agricultural conversion , and fire suppression in Texas and Oklahoma have decreased available breeding habitat , reducing both the range and population size of this species .
Increased predation near human development has further decreased populations , as has parasitism from Brown - headed Cowbirds , which lay their eggs in Black - capped Vireo nests , out - competing the vireo chicks .
Innovative conservation efforts on public and private lands seem to be helping some populations recover .
Florida Scrub - Jay • Suburban - exurban sprawl and agricultural development have reduced habitat dramatically and isolated many populations .
Maintaining natural wildfire regimes will be critical .
Although ESA status has increased conservation efforts for this species , it has not been enough to stop loss of habitat .
Golden - cheeked Warbler • Breeding is restricted to the Edwards Plateau in Texas , where suburban sprawl and habitat destruction has greatly reduced population size .
Winter habitat loss in southern Mexico and Central America may also be affecting populations .
Innovative conservation strategies that protect and restore habitat in both the breeding and wintering grounds are underway and needed .
Kirtland ’s Warbler • Dependent on jack pine habitat in northern Michigan , this warbler species has increased more than 600 % since the mid-1980s because of management plans implemented under the Endangered Species Act .
Singing male counts in the spring have increased from 200 to almost 1,400 ( and some singing males are now found in Wisconsin and Ontario ) .
Wild land fire management , control of the parasitic Brown - headed Cowbird , and protection of wintering habitat in the Bahamas remain essential to long - term survival .
Ashy Storm - Petrel ( not on ESA list ) • Breeding populations are restricted to islands off the west coast of North America .
Non-native nest predators and increased gull populations threaten breeding birds , and ocean pollution and overfishing threaten feeding birds .
Kittlitz ’s Murrelet ( not on ESA list ) • Breeding and feeding habitat seems to be linked to Alaska ’s tidewater glaciers , making this species very susceptible to climate change .
Oil spills , coastal pollution , and increased disturbance also threaten this species .
Red -cockaded Woodpecker • Habitat loss from logging in the Southeast ’s long - leaf pine forests and suburban and agricultural development have isolated populations and greatly reduced overall population size .
Protection strategies developed through the Endangered Species Act are helping populations in many places , but restoration of open long - leaf pine forest is desperately needed .
Spectacled Eider • Ingestion of lead shot is believed to be a major problem for this species , along with an increase in nest predation by foxes , mink , gulls , and jaegers in a warming Arctic .
In addition , changing sea conditions in winter are affecting the distribution of clams – a preferred winter food .
Proposed oil development poses an additional and very significant threat .
Reddish Egret ( not on ESA list ) •
This species forages along the Gulf Coast and is subject to human disturbance at beaches and at nesting sites .
It is dependent on high quality coastal habitat for its food .
Human coastal development and decreasing water quality are serious threats .
Black Rail ( not on ESA list ) •
This species makes its home in shallow , grassy wetlands along the Atlantic Coast , San Francisco Bay , southern Great Plains and the Lower Colorado River , habitat that is vulnerable to human conversion to other uses , including agriculture or other development .
A secretive bird , it needs further study to increase understanding of its natural history , ecological role and conservation needs .
Buff - breasted Sandpiper ( not on ESA list ) •
Traveling each fall from Alaska to Argentina , this species is one of our champion long - distance migrants .
Along the way , it faces a great variety of threats , from oil development on its Arctic breeding grounds to grassland conversion to soybean fields on its Argentinean wintering grounds .
It needs protected grassy stopover sites all along its migration route .
Saltmarsh Sharp - tailed Sparrow ( not on ESA list ) •
This tiny bird is restricted to a narrow band of saltmarsh along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts .
It is threatened on one side by human coastal developments and on the other by rising sea levels .
With even one foot of sea - level rise from global warming , this species will need a lot of help to maintain sufficient habitat for its survival .
Tricolored Blackbird ( not on ESA list ) • A highly social species , this bird is found in freshwater wetlands in the Pacific states , mainly California .
With loss of this habitat , this species increasingly relies on agricultural fields for nesting , leaving chicks vulnerable to the harvest of hay and other crops .
Audubon California and other conservationists are working with farmers to maintain agricultural nesting habitat long enough each season to allow the blackbirds to successfully raise their young – potentially spelling the difference between survival and extinction for this highly specialized bird .
Yellow Rail ( not on ESA list ) • Rails are small , secretive birds that winter in wetlands along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts .
This species prefers to breed in wet grasslands across Canada and the northern tier of states from Minnesota to Maine .
These grasslands are easily converted to other uses , so protection of high - quality habitat will be essential for this migratory bird ’s survival .
Xantus ’s Murrelet ( not on ESA list ) •
This tiny seabird nests on islands off southern California .
Conservationists are tackling the major threat on the nesting grounds – non-native predators like rats and mice .
Global warming seems to wreak havoc with the water circulation and availability of food sources in the ocean , causing shortages for this and other coastal seabirds .
Well , people can be dippy about all things digital and still read books , they can go to the opera and watch a cricket match and apply for Led Zeppelin tickets without splitting themselves asunder .
Very little is as mutually exclusive as we seem to find it convenient to imagine .
In our culture we are becoming more and more fixated with an " it 's one thing or the other " mentality .
You like Thai food ?
But what 's wrong with Italian ?
Woah , there ... calm down .
I like both .
Yes .
It can be done .
I can like rugby football and the musicals of Stephen Sondheim .
High Victorian Gothic and the installations of Damien Hirst .
Herb Alpert 's Tijuana Brass and the piano works of Hindemith .
English hymns and Richard Dawkins .
First editions of Norman Douglas and iPods .
Snooker , darts and ballet .
Such a list is n't a boast , it does n't make one an all - rounder to rival Michelangelo , it 's how humans are constructed .
Adaptable , varied , versatile .
So , believe me , a love of gizmos does n't make me averse to paper , leather and wood , old - fashioned Christmases , Preston Sturges films and country walks .
Nor does it automatically mean I read Terry Pratchett , breathe only through my mouth and bring my head slightly too close to the bowl when I eat soup .
( None of the above , I grant you , excuses a 50 - year - old for saying that anything " rocks his world " ; that 's just too horrid and must stop . )
I blogged on my website a few weeks ago explaining my long - standing passion for all kinds of gizmos .
I have never met a smartphone I have n't bought , I wrote .
And so now , all juiced up by that experience , I am to bring to you every week in this paper a technology column of sorts , in which I will attempt to share my passion for the new ; to review , rave over and ramble on about the latest arrivals in the field of digiware , and occasionally to stand back and survey the field .
When WH Auden produced his collection of critical writings , The Dyer 's Hand , he first laid out a list of his preferences and predispositions , believing it right that the reader should know what sort of person they were encountering and be able thereby to form a judgment of his opinions in the light of his prejudices .
I ought to do the same .
It is true that I have a great admiration , sometimes only just short of reverence , for the elegances and brilliances that have emerged from my favourite address in the world : 1 Infinite Loop , Cupertino , California , the home of Apple Computers .
I am lucky enough to count their chief designer , boy genius Jonathan Ive , as a friend .
I bought the second Macintosh sold in Europe back in 1984 ( Douglas Adams bought the first ) .
I currently have about 10 on the go .
But I also have more than one PC .
I could not pursue my love of the digital without those , too .
And it certainly would not be fair or right for me to expatiate on technology without a proper understanding of the operating system employed by more than 90 % of all users .
I run Windows XP and Vista .
Linux , too , in different distributions , including Mark Shuttleworth 's increasingly popular Ubuntu , although I also take Red Hat 's Fedora and Yellow Dog out for a run from time to time .
It is very important to me that you believe that I will be as impartial as I can be in the great schism that has riven computing since the mid-80s .
You might be amused by Umberto Eco 's writing on this subject if you do n't already know it : simongrant.org/web/eco.html .
What do I think is the point of a digital device ?
Is it all about function ?
Or am I a " style over substance " kind of a guy ?
Well , that last question will get my hackles up every time .
As if style and substance are at war !
As if a device can function if it has no style .
As if a device can be called stylish that does not function superbly .
Do n't get me started ...
I welcomed the Macintosh in 1984 because it functioned better than any personal computer around at the time .
It took Bill Gates an incredibly long time to come round to Windows , Icons , Mice and Pulldown menus , but come round he did .
Believe me , when we championed that WIMPs user interface back in the mid-80s , we were regularly accused of , yes , championing style over substance , of being pretentious and arty about machines that were just supposed to " function " .
So you can guess that I certainly do think design is important .
But it does n't have to come from Apple .
In fact , I wish to goodness it came from everywhere .
I hope you 'll believe I 'm not an unthinking slave to Cupertino .
Apple gets plenty of small things wrong , but one big thing it gets right : when you use a device every day , you cannot help , as a human being , but have an emotional relationship with it .
It 's true of cars and cookers , and it 's true of computers .
It 's true of office blocks and houses , and it 's true of mobiles and satnavs .
A grey box is not good enough , clunky and ugly is not good enough .
Sick building syndrome exists , and so does sick hand - held device syndrome .
Fiddly buttons , blocky icons , sickeningly stupid nested menus - these are the enemy .
They waste time , militate against function and lower the spirits .
They make the user feel frustrated and ( quite wrongly ) dense .
Mechanisms so devilishly , stunningly , jaw - dropping clever as the kind our world can now furnish us with are No Good Whatsoever if they do n't also bring a smile to our face , if they do n't make us want to stroke , touch , fondle , fiddle , gurgle , purr and coo .
Interacting with a digital device should be like interacting with a baby .
So , yes , beauty matters .
Boy , does it matter .
It is not surface , it is not an extra , it is the thing itself .
Le style , c'est le truc , as De Buffon would have written today .
If you are an IT or telecoms professional , you will probably find me lax , obvious and distressingly untechnical .
If you are new and nervous in the field , you may think the opposite : indeed , the talk of red hats and yellow dogs may already have you all of a doodah .
I want to reassure you on this head .
I have no intention of littering my copy with unexplained acronyms , references to protocols , coding language or other recondite arcana .
While I love jargon as much as any proud techie dweeb , I think it right to avoid that sort of talk when chatting to those who do n't share my passion .
None the less , I am going to assume that anyone reading my column has access to an online computer and can therefore , if so minded , check up on what I mean by " le style , c'est le truc " or " De Buffon " by undertaking a little search .
And there 's a subject I might write about one day .
How to use a search engine .
You'd be amazed ( well , you would n't , because you 're an intelligent Guardian reader , but some people would ) by how often friends of mine say they can't find something on the net , simply because they have n't stopped and thought about how to frame or phrase input search terms .
Hold that thought ...
Anyway , what kind of devices might I be discussing over the coming weeks ?
Including , but not confined to : mobile phones , smartphones , music players , media players , cameras , electronic books , satnavs , computers , peripherals , TVs , games machines and any digital device or grown - up toy that may take my fancy .
And not necessarily all that grown - up , either .
I wo n't be writing about hand - helds and hardware only , however .
I have to confess that while gaming as such is not my first interest , and I do n't spend much time in World of Warcraft , Halo or Manhunt , I do have a Second Life existence ( you 'll never find me , so do n't look .
Lord , there 's a thought : " celebrity avatars exposed " - fair chills the blood ) .
I have a secret presence on Facebook and a public one , too , which I do n't have the time to pay much attention to .
So , yes , I 'll undoubtedly have a look at Web 2.0 , social networking and other contentious and contemporary digital issues .
If I had a grain of rice for every minute I have spent watching a progress bar over the years , I would be able to make you all a bowl of kedgeree .
As it is , I shall cook you all up a weekly article instead .
I do hope you 'll be able to join me .
See you next Saturday .

Fighting for a New Homeland US Army Lures Foreigners with Promise of Citizenship
More than 30,000 foreign troops are enlisted in the US Army , many of them serving in Iraq .
Their reward for risking their lives for their adopted country is US citizenship .
According to the tour guide at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin , the belief that Guinness tastes better in Ireland is not just an urban myth .
He offered two explanations for the phenomenon .
1. Freshness
Because Guinness is so much more popular in Ireland than elsewhere , kegs do n’t last long .
So your pint is more likely to be fresh .
2. Cleanliness
If you ’re a pub owner in Ireland , you are affiliated with Guinness .
One of the terms of that relationship is that every three weeks you ’ll receive a visit from a Guinness representative who will flush the lines to your Guinness taps .
Pub owners are supposed to do that on their own , but some are lazy about it and Guinness does n’t want to take any chances .
If the lines are n’t flushed , the brew will be compromised .
What a savvy business practice !
On the way home , in the airport , I got to see it in action .
These taps have signs on them that say Line Cleaning In Progress .
And here ’s the Guinness rep flushing the lines .
I asked him how often he shows up to do this , and he confirmed the story .
“ Every twenty - one days . ”
The only problem is , knowing this , how can I ever again order a Guinness at home ?
The onset of the holiday shopping season is as inevitable as death and taxes .
However , unlike death and taxes , the stress associated with shopping can be minimized with a few nifty shopping hacks .
You just have to understand the marketing and pricing strategies employed by most online retailers .
Commercial retailers did n't really get the hang of online commerce until the late 1990s .
But they 've since caught their stride , amassing huge databases of information about customer behavior .
They use this information to tune their pricing , special offers and promotions accordingly – for instance , offering online promotions midweek , so consumers can shop at work .
The flip side : Savvy customers can take advantage of merchants ' strategies to score great deals .
With about six weeks left until the December solstice , Christmas and Kwanzaa , and 25 days to the first night of Hanukkah , here 's a collection of shopping tips to help you find the best deals online .
Start shopping early .
Thomas Harpointner , the CEO of e-commerce consultancy AIS Media believes that it 's better to start sizing up gift options and online retailers as soon as possible .
" The end of back - to - school really represents the beginning of the online shopping season , " says Harpointner .
" Once Labor Day ends , online retailers know that there is n't much on the calendar except Thanksgiving , so if consumers are n't already looking around they may actually end up behind . "
Sign up for newsletters .
According to Harpointner , one of the best ways to score early deals is by signing up for e-mail newsletters from retailers .
" Online merchants understand that people are spontaneous , " Harpointner explains .
" So if customers receive an e-mail with an offer or coupon that matches their shopping list , there 's a good chance they 'll make the purchase early . "
Use coupon codes .
In addition to e-mail blasts , cost - conscious online shoppers can also augment their savings with coupon codes , which they enter during the checkout process at specific merchants to get a discount .
Most merchants offer codes for free shipping , but with enough searching ( try entering the words " coupon code " plus the name of a product or merchant on any search engine ) diligent shoppers can drum up codes for merchandise discounts and even free accessories .
Or check a coupon code site : Currentcodes and RetailMeNot are two of the larger hubs on the web for sniffing out these codes .
" Coupon codes really are one of the internet 's hidden treasures , " Harpointner admits gleefully .
" Everyone uses shopping engines like Buy.com , but what most people do n't do is a separate search for coupon codes .
Flowers.com is famous for ( offering coupon codes ) .
It 's helpful and gives customers an additional incentive to shop online and beat the mall traffic . "
Get the jump on Black Friday .
Not everyone is organized enough to compile lists and sift through promotional e-mails week after week .
And let 's face it , some of us will always be doing our shopping at the last minute .
If that 's your style , there 's a whole separate set of online shopping tricks and a totally different timetable .
The key to this method is to tackle the day after Thanksgiving head - on .
This date , which is known as " Black Friday " in the retail trade ( and which falls this year on Nov. 23 , the earliest possible date ) , is one of the busiest shopping days of the year .
Many merchants offer special deals , online and offline , to help goose weekend sales even further .
The trick is getting advance information on the planned discounts , so you know where to shop and when .
Sites such as BFAds.net and TheBlackFriday.com provide details on major retailers ' Black Friday sales plans .
While retailers such as Wal - Mart have sought to shut down these sites , much information is still available .
If you spot something you want listed in one of these contraband ads , you can easily outflank other shoppers by hitting the retailer 's website early – say at 11:59 p.m. EST on Thanksgiving day .
Shop at work .
If Black Friday does n't produce the killer buy you 're searching for , there 's always the second brass ring of online retail – " Cyber Monday , " or the Monday after Thanksgiving ( Nov. 26 this year ) .
Retailers see this day as their first opportunity to target holiday shoppers trapped at their work computers , so a lot offer additional promotions .
The Black Friday trick of shopping in the wee hours can also help you snare Cyber Monday deals starting at 11:59 p.m. , Sunday , Nov. 25 .
Clean your cookies .
Retailers base a lot of their online promotions and price points on shoppers ' habits .
So , it 's not uncommon for shoppers to notice price fluctuations after repeated purchases on the same site .
Prices typically drop for these power shoppers as an incentive , but there have been documented occurrences of increases , too .
You can check to see if this is happening to you by logging out from the retail site , clearing your browser 's cookies , and then revisiting the product page .
If you find a lower price , buy it – re-registering with a new customer account if necessary .
Do n't miss out on free shipping .
Subsidized shipping has become the ultimate boon for holiday shoppers , but it comes with a catch .
Many retailers only offer free shipping as an incentive to early shoppers .
So , it 's crucial that any online orders are placed by the industry - benchmark date of Dec. 12 to take advantage of these offers .
After that date , be prepared to pay through the nose for shipping , especially if you want your purchases to arrive before Dec. 25 .
Buy refurbished .
Another dark horse when it comes to netting some of the best online promotions is finding an online retailer that specializes in factory - refurbished equipment .
Not only are the discounts deep , but the merchandise is often sold in virtually new or " like new " condition , and additional promotions may cut your costs even further .
Jennifer Canty , president of refurbishing retailer Dyscern , says that the real challenge is finding a retailer you 're comfortable with .
" You want to investigate the retailer , and make sure they have a good reputation , " Canty cautions .
" A lot of refurbished - equipment sellers are also sellers on eBay , so you can check out their ratings and get a feel for them . "
Also check for warranties and money - back guarantees , and make sure you read the fine print .
Sure , you 're just playing into the merchants ' hands when you take advantage of discounts , coupons or other shopping incentives .
Retailers ultimately want one thing : consumers to snap up their inventory and hand over the credit card authorizations .
But if you can intelligently navigate the maze of discounts and promotions , that can work to your advantage , too .
' They Destroyed Me ' : French Teen 's Rape Case Exposes Dubai's Dark Side Victim speaks out on his attackers and justice in the glittering city of Dubai .
Dec. 12 , 2007  -- Dubai -- with its world - famous luxury hotels and what will soon be the world 's tallest building -- is the Arab world 's most modern oasis .
But beyond the sandy beaches and tourist attractions , the western dress and the bustling buildings , Dubai is struggling to modernize one aspect of its conservative Muslim culture : the taboos and treatment of sexual violence .
16 - year - old French - Swiss Alexandre Robert and his mother Veronique were the perfect example of Dubai 's cosmopolitan makeup .
Alex was living in Dubai when he says he was gang raped at knifepoint , beginning an ordeal that has shed light on how Dubai 's justice system treats victims of violent sex crimes .
Today , two men were sentenced in a Dubai court to 15 years each in prison in the case .
Their names and the details of their convictions were not released by the court .
" Before , I felt like it was paradise , it was honestly paradise , " Alex told ABC News last month .
" Today I feel like they lied to me , they treated me like nothing , like a toy .
And they played with my life and I do n't know , they …they destroyed me . "
What happened to Alex has thrown a worldwide spotlight on the dark side of a city where a victim can be treated as a criminal , where homosexuality is outlawed and where AIDS is buried under a layer of shame .
" Homosexuality is taboo , rape is taboo , and AIDS is taboo , " said Veronique Robert .
Saturday July 14th of this year was just another summer day in paradise .
Then 15 - year - old Alex spent the day at the beach with his friend .
When it was time to go home , a local teenager they barely knew offered to give them a lift when they could n't find a cab .
He called two older friends who had a car .
Alex and his friend accepted the ride and got in the car .
Alex says the man behind the wheel drove past the turnoff to his house , beyond Dubai 's landmark Mall of the Emirates , and into a desolate stretch of desert .
" So we keep driving and I see him taking an exit to go in the desert and I told him ' Where are you going ? '
And this is where I started to think and realize that something was wrong , you know , and they told me to shut up , " Alex recalled .
First Alex says the driver secured the child locks on the doors , trapping the boys inside .
Then they stopped along a desert road on the outskirts of the city .
" They asked my friend to get out of the car , he said no , so they pulled him out with violence and they started hitting , hitting him and they hit me .
And after that -- I 'm sorry … "
Alex said , unable to continue .
" Alex started to scream , " his friend told ABC News , adding that Alex tried to grab his hand .
The friend spoke about the attack on the condition that his name be kept secret because he still lives in Dubai and fears retaliation .
" I was very afraid , " said the friend .
" I thought they wanted to kill me , me and Alex .
So it was like the last minute of my life I was living . "
Desperate for help ,
Alex says he tried to call 999 -- Dubai 's version of 911 -- on his cell phone .
The local teen who brought them to the car overheard the police respond to the call , Alex says , and grabbed for the phone .
" I had the phone in my hands , I was screaming and shouting for help , " said Alex .
" He took my phone and he was hitting me .
I started screaming and crying . "
' I'm Gonna Kill You '
" He was saying , ' I 'm gonna kill you , your mother , father .
I know where you live .
Do n't do that any more , ' " recalled his friend .
" He said to me right in the eyes , right in the eyes that if I , if I speak about this one day , he knows where I live , he 'll go to my house , he 'll burn my house , he 'll kill my parents , he 'll f*** them and he 'll burn them , " Alex said .
" And it was hard . "
" They will not touch us .
Do n't worry about that , it 's done , " said Veronique .
" They will pay for that , they will pay for that . "
As dusk settled in the desert , the friend says he was forced to walk behind a sand dune , where he could n't see or hear anything .
That 's when Alex says the 36 - year - old driver threatened his life .
" He took out a pool stick and a hunting knife .
He told me that he wanted to f*** me and I told him no way , I told him this , you can forget about it .
I wo n't let you touch me , I wo n't let you .
And after this , I had no choice . "
When he finished , the teenager who had first offered them the ride came back to the car , Alex says .
" I told them , ' Listen , if you 're going to kill us , just let me use my phone , just give me back my phone and let me , let me call my family , I wo n't tell them where I am , I 'll talk in English , I wo n't tell them what 's happening , but just … if you 're going to kill me , just let me call them , tell them that I love them or something , just let me do this , " said Alex . "
And they keep telling us to shut up . "
In the end their salvation may have turned on something as simple as sand .
Alex says the attackers ' car got stuck and they had to call a relative , who drove to the scene .
" I got my head up and I saw this plate number … I still remember it today , " said Alex .
" And I think this , this plate saved my life . "
' Homosexuality Is An Illegal Act '
Instead of killing them , Alex says their attackers brought them to one of Dubai 's luxurious hotels , where they were thrown out of the car .
" They pushed us like , like we were nothing , you know , like if we were bags , " he said .
Alex says he felt dizzy and passed out .
He had survived a violent rape that could happen anywhere in the world , but the legal nightmare ahead would turn out to be a second tragedy , he says .
After the attackers left them on the curb Alex and his friend went to the first safe place they could think of .
They took a taxi to a local shopping mall , hid in the bathroom , and called for help .
They immediately reported the crime , going in person to the local police station .
But Alex says the police doctor who examined him that night seemed intent on proving there was no rape , just a consensual sexual act between three men and a 15 year - old gay boy .
" He told me , admit it , you are a homosexual and everything , " said Alex .
" I got really angry , I told him , ' Listen , I just got raped by three guys . ' "
And perhaps more damaging to Alex 's case , the doctor asserts the examination " showed a history " of homosexual activity , according to the doctor 's report obtained by ABC News and translated from the original Arabic .
" In their minds if I admit that I am a homosexual , the crime would be over , everything would be over , " Alex believed .
Moreover , Veronique Robert says police and local authorities failed to tell Alex that one of the men was HIV positive for weeks after they learned of it .
Alex has so far tested negative for the AIDS virus .
However , he can't know for sure until January , since the virus needs six months for definitive test results .
" I have to wait until January , and in January I 'll know , so I cross fingers and I hope , " he said .
Veronique Robert says the Dubai authorities twice assured there was no threat of sexually transmitted disease , even though there was a report identifying one of the attackers as being HIV positive in government files for years .
" I 'm so furious , I can not tell you how I 'm furious , you know , and I said why they lie , they just play with the life of Alex , " said Veronique Robert .
The Case Against Alex
Homosexuality is against the law in the UAE , where anyone found guilty of sodomy faces years in jail .
The Dubai government denies that the doctor accused Alex of being gay or that he was ever at risk of being charged with homosexuality .
But Robert Jongeryck , the French consul , was so worried a case was being built against Alex as an illegal homosexual he advised the boy and his mother to flee Dubai before he was arrested .
" I think that if we had not reacted and asked the authorities to do something , probably Alexandre would have been charged , " said Jongeryck .
A Victorian Value System ?
Arab - American psychiatrist Dr. Raymond Hamden works in the Dubai courts and says it 's important for foreigners to remember that while everything looks modern there , it is a young , developing city .
" It 's no different than were we in America were a hundred years ago , right after or during the end of the Victorian era , " said Hamden .
" Even though we are seeing globalization , in the city that has defined globalization , were still seeing a value system that still looks like new Victorians . "
Dr. Habib al - Mulla , an attorney and government spokesman , defends the social conservatism that makes homosexuality a crime in Dubai .
" Every country and every culture has…its own values , its own morals , and the laws and legislations reflect the way every society looks at those morals , " Al - Mulla said .
" This is a conservative society .
Homosexuality , conducted homosexuality is an illegal act .
And we are not ashamed of that . "
" So , when you invite people to come [ to Dubai ] , are you inviting everyone but homosexuals ? "
ABC News ' Jim Avila asked the spokesman .
" Everyone is more than welcomed to come , " said al - Mulla .
" However , no one is welcome to commit any illegal activity . "
In an environment where homosexuality is a crime , can a victim of " forcible homosexuality , " as the law calls it , be treated fairly under the law ?
The trial is big news in Dubai .
The two adult defendants , both of whom faced the death penalty , have denied all charges .
Veronique Robert says she was in juvenile court -- closed to the press -- when the local boy who first led Alex and his friend into the car pled guilty to charges of kidnapping , threatening , and rape .
Because he is a minor he does not face execution .
" I 'm sure the court will deal with this [ verdict ] in a fair and reasonable manner , " said government spokesman Al - Mulla , leaving open the possibility that what happened to Alex would lead to some reforms in the handling of rape cases .
" We will look into the system , we 'll see if there was anything deficient .

Armed with the promise that he would not be prosecuted , Alex returned to Dubai to testify against his alleged attackers , a moment he will never forget .
" You could read it in their eyes , they were saying like , if we go out , if we find you , my God , poor kid , run for your life , run for your life , if we get you , you 're dead , " he said .
Veronique Robert relentlessly warns anyone who will listen not to go to Dubai expecting a world - class justice system .
She has even created a Web site called www.boycottdubai.com designed to hit the emirate where it hurts -- in the carefully cultivated image put forth to tourists and visitors .
" A part of me is really sad , " she said .
" I was loving Dubai , I was loving to come here to visit my child , [ to ] go to the beach with Alex … seven years of my life …it 's gone .
I think I will not come here … I will never see Dubai with the same eyes . "

[ Python - 3000 ] status ( preparing for first alpha )
Py3 k is progressing nicely .
We are planning the first alpha sometime this week .
The tests are mostly passing .
With all the churn over the last week , I 'm sure it 's about to change . :-)
AFAIK , nearly all the tests pass on Linux and Mac OS X .
There was a report that Windows / VC8 was able to build python but it crashed in test_builtin .
Can anyone confirm this ?
Here are the tasks that we need help with before the alpha is released : * Verify Windows build works with VC7 ( currently the default compiler for 2.5 ) * Verify Windows build passes all tests * Verify other Unix builds work and pass all tests *
Fix reference leaks probably related to IO * Fix problem with signal 32 on old gentoo box ( new IO related ? )
See below for more details about many of these .
The string / unicode merge is making good progress .
There are less than 400 references to PyString .
Most of the references are in about 5 - 10 modules .
Less than 50 modules in the core have any references to PyString .
We still need help converting over to use unicode .
If you are interested in helping out , the spreadsheet is the best place to look for tasks :
http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pBLWM8elhFAmKbrhhh0ApQA&hl=en_US&pli=1
Separate sheets exist for C , Python , Writing , and Reading tasks .
You can review the 3.0 docs at : http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/
They are updated every 12 hours .
There are many parts which need improvement .
There are 4 tests that report reference leaks : test_io leaked [ 62 , 62 ] references test_urllib leaked [ 122 , 122 ] references test_urllib2_localnet leaked [ 3 , 3 ] references test_xmlrpc leaked [ 26 , 26 ] references
On the gentoo machine that builds the docs , I would like to run the tests .
2.x is currently running python without a problem .
In 3.0 , there is a strange error about receiving an Unknown signal 32 .
I 'm guessing this is related to the new IO library , but that 's really a guess .
Does anyone have a clue about what 's happening here ?
I do n't think I can catch the signal ( I tried ) .
Part of the reason I suspect IO is that the problem seems to occur while running various tests that use sockets .
test_poplib is often the first one .
But even if that 's skipped many other tests can cause the problem , including : test_queue test_smtplib test_socket test_socket_ssl test_socketserver .
Perhaps there 's a test that triggers the problem and almost any other test seems to be causing the problem ?
There are some unexplained oddities .
The most recent issue I saw was this strange exception while running the tests : File " Lib/httplib.py " , line 1157 , in __init__ HTTPConnection.__init__( self , host , port , strict , timeout ) TypeError : unbound method __init__ ( ) must be called with FakeHTTPConnection instance as first argument ( got HTTPSConnection instance instead ) I 've seen this exactly once .
I do n't know what happened .
Completely unrelated , I also had a problem with using uninitialized memory from test_bytes .
That also only happened once .
It could have been a problem with an underlying library .

On ABC World News Tonight with Charles Gibson , Senator Obama discusses the hubris a person needs to believe that he or she can be president :
I think if you do n’t have enough self - awareness to see the element of megalomania involved in thinking you can be president then you probably should n’t be president .
. . There ’s a slight madness to thinking you should be the leader of the free world .
Watching this reminds me of half of the reason I support Barack Obama : the less important half which involves his personal appeal and charisma .
I ca n’t imagine another candidate in the present or past speaking like this , providing a genuine insight into the campaign process and himself on purpose .
Most of the time when the “ real ” candidates are revealed , it involves them making mistakes – either in front of a camera , or mistakes so serious the matter ends up in court .
The definition of a gaffe in Washington is when a politician is accidentally honest .
Obama talks in a way no other politician does .
Not because he is an inherently better person but because he is of a different generation .
The lessons of the past 20 years of cultural warfare do n’t seem to apply to Obama ; he transcends them because he lived through them .
Somewhere in this is the core of Obama ’s appeal .
The video is after the jump .
Here ’s the clip from ABC :

Inheriting two genetic mutations that can individually cause epilepsy might actually be “ seizure - protective , ” said Baylor College of Medicine researchers in a report that appears online today in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
“ In the genetics of the brain , two wrongs can make a right , ” said Dr. Jeffrey L. Noebels , professor of neurology , neuroscience and molecular and human genetics at BCM .
“ We believe these findings have great significance to clinicians as we move toward relying upon genes to predict neurological disease . ”
In addition , the finding might point the way to new ways of treating epilepsy using gene - directed therapy .
“ If you have a potassium channel defect , then a drug blocking certain calcium channels might also benefit you , ” said Noebels .
Noebels and his colleagues , who included first author Dr. Ed Glasscock , a post - doctoral researcher at BCM , tested this hypothesis by breeding mice with two defective genes that govern ion channels , tiny pores in cells that allow molecules such as potassium and calcium to flow in and out .
The genes were known to cause epilepsy when inherited singly within families .
They have also been found in a large - scale screen of people with non-familial seizure disorders being performed in collaboration with the Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Center .
One is a mutation in the Kcna1 gene involved in the channel that allows potassium to flow in and out of the cell .
It causes severe seizures affecting the brain ’s temporal lobe , an area of the brain involved in processing sight , sound , speech and forming memories .
It can also cause sudden death in young mice .
The other mutation is in a calcium channel gene ( Cacna1a ) that causes a specific type of seizure associated with absence epilepsy .
When people suffer these seizures , they may appear to be staring into space and do not exhibit the jerking or movements generally associated with epilepsy .
When both types of mutation occurred in the same young mouse , that animal had dramatically reduced seizures and did not suffer the sudden death associated with the potassium channel problem .
Noebels , who is also director of the Developmental Neurogenetics Laboratory funded by the National Institutes of Health and Blue Bird Circle Foundation , said , “ Rather than screening for ‘ bad ’ genes one at a time , it may be essential to create a complete profile of many or even all genes in order to accurately assess the true genetic risk of any single defect in many common disorders such as epilepsy .
Fortunately , this amount of background information will soon become routinely obtainable in individual patients thanks to rapid technological progress in the field of neurogenomics . ”
Many different genes can lead to seizure disorders .
In some cases , they encode ion channels that adjust the way neurons fire .
Previous work indicated that combinations of such genes could make epilepsy worse .
However , certain combinations may actually prevent the abnormal patterns of epilepsy , acting as “ circuit breakers , ” said Noebels .

Top 10 Wealth Building Ways Of Ordinary People
The many faces of wealth - building .
In Silicon Valley , a lot of people have been fortunate enough to do quite well financially .
And having worked as an engineer around here for almost two decades , I witnessed both some highs and lows in the technical and financial front .
As I ’ve mentioned in my profile , there have been people whose lives where literally rearranged because of the dot com era of the 1990s .
Some of them were people I had at one point worked with or known , who belonged to the 5 % or so who stumbled into a lucky startup that made it somewhere .
In reality , out of the myriad number of startups that littered this place then ( and even today ) , only around 5 % – 10 % may find some kind of success and only around 5 % or less will strike it quite big .
That ’s based on my own perspective and personal experience as someone on the bottom floor , so I ca n’t tell you if those numbers are accurate as per some econo - scan .
But returning to the subject of financial success , the good news is that a lot of people I ’ve been fortunate to have encountered ( mostly through past jobs ) have done well by employing various schemes and exploiting their skills in one area or another .
If there ’s anything I learned from meeting them , it ’s that opportunities abound everywhere and it ’s up to ourselves to make the most of what ’s handed us .
Profiles and Strategies Of Some Typical Wealth Builders
These are the stories and financial plans of ambitious , hard - working people I ’ve met .
# 1 The Real Estate Investor
There ’s this guy who took “ Kiyosaki ’s Rich Dad , Poor Dad ” series to heart and actually embarked on a real estate investing rampage starting in 2003 .
It was prompted by a family crisis involving his disabled child , during which he realized the worries of a parent who wondered how his child would be taken care of once he and his wife could no longer do so .
Being in California , it was easy for him to build up equity , take it out and apply it to real estate ventures all over the nation .
He now owns around 15 houses in various states and is somehow managing this “ empire ” on his off days from his engineering job .
Kudos to him .
By the way , there ’s also a way to fail at this too .
Main Asset : Hard Work
# 2 Stock Market Investor
Everyone ’s doing this as far as I know , simply by investing in their retirement plans .
With the huge number of plans available these days : 401Ks , 403Bs , IRAs , pension plans and such , there ’s no way you ’ve escaped building wealth in the last 20 years .
What I do find a little frustrating is that while people invest well in their retirement plans , they do n’t do so well with their disposable income .
Some of my acquaintances view their retirement accounts as their “ serious money ” while their disposable income is treated as “ play money ” .
From a casual poll I conducted among colleagues , I found that most were n’t sure what to do with their non-retirement funds which could be either stuck in cash and CDs or used to do wild , aggressive trades .
A read of these books could help : The Random Walk Down Wall Street or Asset Allocation : Balancing Financial Risk .
Main Asset : Persistence

# 3 Stock Market Trader
This other guy does stock trading part - time and seems to be quite successful at it .
Sure there was a time ( circa late 1990 ’s ) when lots of people tried their luck at day trading and eventually fizzled miserably .
But this guy is good .
But that ’s because he ’s some kind of software genius and mathematical whiz .
If I were a betting woman , I ’d back this guy on any trade he makes .
He says that 99 % of wannabe traders are going to lose out because people like him are there to scalp the noobs .
Is it arrogance ?
Perhaps .
But he ’s hard - working ( sleeps 3 hours a night so he can trade after work ) , is skilled and talented at technical analysis , and has done his homework on that Forex stuff .
He ’s also very low key but I can sense that “ Millionaire Next Door ” aura .
Main Asset : Genius
# 4 Serial Startup Hopper ( or Juggler )
Now here ’s the typical way people try to get rich around Silicon Valley and it was the norm in the 1990’s .
It actually worked for a few former colleagues .
I admit , I joined a startup myself but that did n’t pan out .
Instead , I lost out on $ 13,000 , the amount of money I spent to own my stock options on the penny in order to maximize potential return in case the startup I joined actually succeeded .
It did n’t work for me , but it did others , who amazingly went from one successful startup to another , raking in stock options that made them millions with every stint .
There was this regular engineer who managed to build a massive fortune by just being at the right places at the right time .
He then eventually bank rolled his money into a company he founded that netted him at least double his net worth in a span of 8 months .
Life flies around here I guess and some were born with a clover leaf tattooed on their bum .
Of course that is the exception , but you ca n’t help but find inspiration in that .
Main Asset : Luck
# 5 Consultant ( or Contractor )
This has worked well for those who ride any kind of job boom such as the tech wave in Silicon Valley in the previous decade .
Depending on the job market , this can be a lucrative strategy .
During a tougher job market , then your skills and knowledge will be responsible for getting you those higher consulting fees .
If you want a big income as a consultant , it ’s all a matter of being an expert in a competitive field .
Or being the only one offering such a service .
Main Asset : Skill
# 6 Web Site Creator / Internet Guru
We ’re saturated with web sites everywhere but the internet is something I ’ve always loved .
It ’s a source of great alternative income for those who care to stay committed to it .
It ’s also the new - fangled way that people are building their wealth .
Just check out the domain hoarders out there , some top bloggers or web site creators who ’ve found success .
Lots of small business owners are earning a good living this way .
Main Asset : Creativity
# 7 Traditional Business Owner
There was this guy who repaired our fence one time , and he told me how he now owned a bunch of real estate in some affluent areas in the Bay Area .
A couple of enterprising friends who graduated with landscaping degrees now own thriving businesses serving the wealthy .
There ’s a market to be tapped here — a lot of financially successful folks actually own businesses who service well - paying clientele .
With such businesses addressing this niche , it did n’t take long before the business owners began owning some pretty good real estate right by their customers !
Main Asset : Enterprise
# 8 Startup Founder
I ’ve already mentioned how regular people can try to launch a startup on their own , though success here is sporadic .
People who get into this somehow enjoy the journey regardless of how things turn out .
Here ’s a not very well kept secret .
My spouse is involved in an entrepreneurial scheme right now at a startup .
He ’s been at it for a year full - time and bootstrapping it through our savings .
Another secret was that he ’s done this before and is basically what you call some kind of “ serial entrepreneur ” .
Here ’s what I ’ve learned about this : it ’s far from a job and it ’s not just a business but a lifestyle .
It ’s something you ca n’t fight , which I learned the hard way .
Main Assets : Guts and Sacrifice
# 9 Frugalist / Coupon Clipper
You ca n’t go wrong with being frugal .
No matter how much you make , if you are n’t living within or below your means , you wo n’t be getting too far ahead .
We ’ve got teachers in our family who saved and scrimped all their lives .
It allowed them to buy real estate many decades ago when the Bay Area was still easily affordable .
Their ways allowed them to trade up with time and ride the real estate boom here .
With their teachers ’ salaries , it would n’t have been possible without their frugal saving habits to bank on .
Given the much tougher cost of living situation we have today , I ’d offer a suggestion ( not an original one by any means ) : find a cheaper , promising , developing part of the nation , move there , work a decent living and be frugal .
If we did this , we ’d probably have the same luck as my relatives enjoyed 30 years ago .
Main Asset : Frugality
# 10 The Careerist and Professional
This is your quintessential corporate guy .
Sometimes I get very annoyed by people like this , whom I ’ve had the fortune to meet several times throughout my career .
They are obviously very ambitious and are out there to climb that career ladder , and can they play office politics !
Blech !
But still , it ’s a way to success and if you ’re built with a lot of tolerance for this sort of “ game ” , and you see yourself rising up the corporate chain and making $ 7 million a year as a big company CEO , then my hats off to you .
Main Asset : Ambition
-ooOoo -
What is noticeable here is that nobody ’s trying to make it by winning the lottery ( hah ! ) , although that occasional office pool does n’t hurt .
Many have succeeded by having the right skills , education , information , risk management abilities , hard work and drive .
When I recall the stories of several co-workers who were children of immigrants who came here but a mere 25 years ago with * nothing * and who are now top engineers in their field , I ca n’t help but think there ’s no excuse for people * not* to be successful .
These families sacrificed greatly for their children to make it — with the parents taking jobs as fishmongers , assembly line workers , hotel housekeepers or short order cooks .
Many families are at this very moment bootstrapping themselves out of difficult financial circumstances while the rest of us are borrowing ourselves to serious debt .
I am awed by the juxtaposition I see everyday between people pursuing the American Dream and those I see squandering it .
Moral of these stories : wealth building is doable by everyone and marvelous when it actually changes the lives of families for generations to come .
Here are more thoughts I ’ve shared on wealth - building .

Peak Oil NPC Energy Report a Tad Optimistic By Ryan McGreal
Published July 18 , 2007
A saying often attributed to former US Vice President Dan Quayle goes like this :
It is n't pollution that 's harming the environment .
It 's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it .
He did n't actually say this , but it has entered the vernacular anyway , possibly because it so concisely lampoons the tortured semantics that politicians employ to avoid drawing unpleasant conclusions .
The most recent example of tortured semantics arrives in the latest report by the US National Petroleum Council ( which has a mandate to " represent the views of the oil and natural gas industries " ) to US Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman on what the future holds for global oil and natural gas supplies .
Their short answer : peak oil is not going to happen for decades because the oil supply will continue to increase - as long as we find major new sources of oil in the Middle East in areas we 've already explored extensively .
In fact , if you subtract their anticipated unknown reserves and what they call " enhanced oil recovery " from the projection in the report , it looks almost exactly like the Hubbert 's curve that the peak analysts are projecting .
In other words , it 's not peak oil that 's driving oil production , it 's the lack of new oil discoveries that are doing it .
Stuart Staniford over at The Oil Drum has an excellent , detailed analysis of the report .
Ryan McGreal , the editor of Raise the Hammer , lives in Hamilton with his family and works as a programmer , writer and consultant .
Ryan volunteers with Hamilton Light Rail , a citizen group dedicated to bringing light rail transit to Hamilton .
Ryan wrote a city affairs column in Hamilton Magazine , and several of his articles have been published in the Hamilton Spectator .
His articles have also been published in The Walrus , HuffPost and Behind the Numbers .
He maintains a personal website , has been known to share passing thoughts on Twitter and Facebook , and posts the occasional cat photo on Instagram .

The Extent of the Fires
A map of the wildfires and an update of the status of the firefighting efforts .
Some small fires may not appear on the map due to the limitations of satellite sensors .
The house , perched in a nice new development in an Interstate 495 belt town , looks like the home of any family of means with a little girl approaching age 3 .
The den is dominated by a giant , brightly colored sliding structure , the living room art consists of framed photographs of said little girl striking various poses , and the basement playroom is chock - full of stuffed animals , golden - haired dolls , and a squadron of ride - on toys lined up like a Toyota showroom .
The little girl , a cutie named Morgan , would blend in easily at any playground .
She has sparkling blue eyes , blond pigtails , a high - pitched , singsongy voice , and an obvious love of life .
At one point , she flits out of the family room as I am chatting with Gwendolyn Anderson , the girl 's at - home mom , who trained as a physician .
She returns a few minutes later holding two Disney Princess dolls .
" This is a princess , " Morgan says , plopping onto my lap the one with the sparkly blue dress .
" Who 's your favorite princess ? " I ask .
Morgan pauses for a few beats and then smiles .
" The pink one ! "
As the father of three young girls , the youngest exactly the same age as Morgan , I can distinguish among Disney royalty as effortlessly as a botanist can tell a pin oak from a red maple .
Not exactly knowledge I 'm eager to show off at the ballpark , but there 's no use in pretending it 's not there .
Yet it dawns on me that Morgan has no idea the doll she just handed me is named Cinderella , while the one clutched to her chest answers to Sleeping Beauty .
Normally , that would be no big deal , since Morgan is still young enough for her age to be tracked in months ( 34 ) , and there will be plenty of time for those diabolical Mouseketeer merchandisers to get their indoctrination to take .
It 's just that , minutes earlier , I had gone through a drill asking Morgan to identify flashcards with the following images : the Mona Lisa , Aristotle contemplating a bust of Homer , Marie de Medici , and Erasmus of Rotterdam .
She had correctly identified each one , pausing only once , when I clumsily mispronounced Erasmus 's name .
I could n't tell , then , if the frozen look on little Morgan 's face was the result of her not understanding what I had said , or her feeling sorry that a grown - up with gray in his hair evidently had trouble pronouncing something that came easily to her .
" She 's a big fan of cubism , which is very interesting , " Anderson explains .
" I do n't think most people realize their 2 - year - old 's favorite form of art . "
Do crayon scribbles count ?
Anderson , with the support of her husband , has been working hard to give their daughter a leg up since Morgan was in her womb , so she can be forgiven for having failed to cover the princess unit .
While other moms - to - be were dog-earing their copies of What to Expect When You 're Expecting , Anderson spent her pregnancy searching for the best approaches to help boost her baby 's brainpower .
Through a Web search , she stumbled onto the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential , a half - century - old operation outside Philadelphia more commonly known as the Better Baby Institute .
The place was founded by Glenn Doman , a physical therapist who took what he learned helping brain - injured children recover function and applied it to well infants and toddlers in the hopes of accelerating their development .
Anderson read about the Better Baby Institute 's regimen of intense intellectual and physical stimulation for babies .
She lingered over the organization 's message that time was of the essence , since the rate of brain growth drops off precipitously after a child reaches age 6 .
And she took to heart the well - honed refrain from the avuncular , white - goateed Doman : " We are persuaded that every child born has , at the instant of birth , a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci ever used . "
After Morgan was born , Anderson wasted no time in following Doman 's advice for cracking the da Vinci code .
She skipped the swaddling and the bassinet in favor of a " crawling track " that her husband built on the floor around their bed , allowing the baby to move about safely in the middle of the night .
When Morgan was 3 months old , Anderson began rapidly showing her reading and math flashcards every day .
When she was 6 months old , the family traveled to Philadelphia and stayed in a hotel for a week while Anderson attended the Institutes ' $ 1,200 " How to Multiply Your Baby 's Intelligence " course .
When Morgan was 10 months old , she began walking , and a few months later Santa left a pedometer in Anderson 's stocking so she could keep track of her daughter 's daily distances , with the goal of meeting the Institutes ' benchmark of having her baby walk half a mile in 18 minutes .
When she was 13 months old , Anderson had Morgan hang from a " brachiation bar " for longer and longer intervals , to prepare her for the " brachiation ladder , " a contraption you and I might call " monkey bars . "
Around the same time , Anderson was pushing her cart down the aisle in the supermarket when Morgan pointed to a box and said " Ball ! "
Anderson turned to see what her 1 - year - old daughter was pointing to .
The only evidence of the box 's contents was the word printed in red letters on the side .
Balls .
Anderson could hardly believe it .
She rewarded Morgan by buying her one .
When she got home , she told her husband , " It must be working ! " OK , by now , you 've no doubt made up your mind .
Some of you are convinced that this Better Baby model is bizarre to the point of being dangerous , evidence of a misguided parental pursuit of the perfect child .
But others of you are intrigued , wondering if there might be something to this approach , perhaps even worrying that you may have shortchanged your infants and allowed key brain cells to die while you passively let them fall in love with Elmo rather than Erasmus .
But the story gets more complex .
For instance , Anderson does not fit the stereotype of the zealously competitive stage mom willing to turn her toddler into some kind of sideshow genius .
She is loving and does n't ask Morgan to perform for family and friends ; instead , she periodically videotapes Morgan 's sessions to share with those who want to track her development .
She shows no interest in rigidly drilling her daughter ; it is bubbly Morgan who takes the lead in choosing which type of learning , from a variety of options her mom gives her , that she wants to do on any given day .
True , the idea of planting an infant on the floor and drilling her with flashcards seems absurd .
But it might actually be no more extreme than the increasing mania among professional parents to armor their youngsters with every educational enrichment program available - Baby Einstein DVDs at 3 months , Junior Kumon tutoring at 2 1/ 2 years , SAT summer camps at 15 - all at the expense of old - fashioned but vitally important unstructured play .
Within a few minutes ' drive from Anderson 's house , in an area of bedroom communities , there are now more than a dozen private tutoring centers , many that seem to cater less to children who have remedial needs than to children whose parents need them to be advanced .
Anderson 's explanation for her regimen sounds reasonable .
" I feel it 's a parent 's role to do everything they can for their child .
If I can provide something that would give her a leg up , even on my life , that would be great . "
Most of the parents toting their toddlers around to tutoring sessions would probably explain their motivation the same way .
Good intentions , for sure .
But is what they 're doing really helping ?
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN AMERICANS were suspicious of precociousness .
In the 1950s , the oft - repeated stories about baby geniuses were ones that seldom ended well .
There was the celebrated child prodigy William Sidis , who entered Harvard at age 11 only to become derided as a burnout who spent his adult days tending to his collection of streetcar transfer tickets from around the world .
Educators summed up the prevailing view with a gardening metaphor : Early ripe , early rot .
But then , says David Elkind , a longtime child development professor at Tufts University , came Sputnik and the startling Soviet successes in space in the late 1950s that spurred Americans to ratchet up their educational demands on the ground .
After that came Head Start , the 1960s federal program aimed at closing the achievement gap by better preparing poor children before they entered school .
Elkind says the choice of names for the program was unfortunate because it made many middle - class parents believe that , if there was some early - advancement special sauce that poor kids were getting , they wanted it for their kids as well .
" Parents began seeing it as a race , " he says .
In 1981 , Elkind wrote a book called The Hurried Child , lamenting the fallout from parents thrusting their children into adulthood prematurely .
His was a lonely voice back then , but his message gained traction and the book became a bestseller .
Still , when the book was published last year as a 25th - anniversary edition , Elkind surveyed the landscape and decided that , in many ways , things had gotten worse .
This desire on the part of many middle - class and affluent parents to help their kids get ahead is understandable .
We 've all heard the predictions about how , in the downsized and outsourced economy of tomorrow , our children may be the first generation of Americans to be worse off than their parents .
Into this vat of anxiety , two forces have been poured that are turning up the heat even more .
First , advances in brain research have offered tantalizing clues about the magic at work in our infants ' gray matter .
Second , market forces have exploited these tantalizing clues and used them to sell billions of dollars ' worth of educational toys and programs , often by making claims wildly beyond the conclusions drawn by the scientists who did the actual research .
Because of all the anxiety , and because of the patina of " hard " science that overlays the nascent brain - research field , many parents buy into claims that have the skimpiest of data to support them and ignore decades of solid , well - replicated but seemingly " soft " cognitive and behavioral research whose findings can often be more instructive .
Consider a University of Washington study released in August that evaluated the impact on language development of educational " brain science " baby DVDs such as the hugely successful Baby Einstein series .
The researchers found that among children ages 8 months to 16 months , each hour per day spent viewing these videos translated into a 17 percent decrease in vocabulary acquisition .
Yet millions of parents have put their infants in front of the TV to watch those numbing sequences of floating shapes and German sounds , all in the belief that they were expanding the brains of their precious offspring .
Also consider that , even in the area of brain research , one of the most intriguing new studies suggests that the brightest teenagers actually had their period of robust brain development much later than children of more average intelligence .
More on that below , but here 's the bumper - sticker summary : Academic late bloomers , rejoice !
At the end of August , the 76 - year - old Elkind , who has spiky white hair , walks the Tufts campus .
It is freshman orientation day , and the place is teeming with smiling parents helping their sons and daughters lug crates into dorm rooms .
The day is the culmination of what many of those parents had been dreaming of , and in some cases angling for , ever since their children were in preschool : admission to an elite college .
But Elkind 's mood is different .
After teaching at Tufts for 29 years , he had just retired .
He says he wanted to leave " while I still have all my marbles . "
But also , he says , " it just lost the fun . "
He was worn out from students who had adopted their parents ' angling , recoiling from criticism and lobbying him to goose their grades , sometimes enlisting their parents to intervene .
He argues that if parents could give themselves permission to stop worrying about college acceptance letters while their kids were still in booster seats , everyone would be a lot better off .
Even their justification for getting their children into the race so early - to improve their economic futures in an uncertain time - seems to him to be completely off - base .
Those most likely to succeed in tomorrow 's knowledge economy , he argues , wo n't be the weary souls who have been drilled since birth to master memorization , but rather the creative people who can solve problems and think independently .
Retirement is allowing Elkind more time to work in his garden .
He had been tending to it faithfully all summer , and as he walks the Tufts campus he has the crimson complexion to prove it .
But even in his tomato plants he finds echoes of the message he 's been pounding away at for most of his professional life : " A gardener can't hurry the ripening of tomatoes . "
SPEND ENOUGH TIME in suburban preschools these days , and you 're bound to hear one parent or another uttering a boast masquerading as a complaint about how they just can't keep the books coming fast enough for their precocious 3 - or 4 - year - old reader .
Odds are , there 's probably no reason to boast .
Researchers who 've been marinating in reading studies for years say a tiny percentage of children - maybe 3 percent , maybe a little more or less - can be classified as truly early readers .
These 3 - or 4 - year - olds understand phonics and context , and they will likely keep up their accelerated reading pace throughout their school years .
Bravo to those kids .
Reading is the gateway to so much of life 's important learning , so a few years more of it can't hurt them .
But most of the other early readers bringing smiles to their parents ' faces are n't really reading at all .
They 're demonstrating merely that they 've memorized lots of words by sight .
Instead of understanding the discrete sounds and segments that make up the word CAT , and understanding that each letter in the word has both its own name and its own sound or group of sounds , these children - like our early ancestors - see it as just a whole symbol for the furry feline .
Change the first letter to E , and they might still think feline , until they memorize the new word .
Studies have demonstrated that the early reading advances these kids show typically wash out a few years down the line .
If parents - or the professionals they hire - want to invest time drilling their child to read early , even if they see their child 's lead disappear by later grades , there 's no harm except wasted time , right ?
Well , actually , no .
For starters , let 's consider the impact of academic expectations on the preschool experience .
Temple University psychologist Kathy Hirsh - Pasek and two colleagues compared children in academically oriented preschools with those in socially oriented preschools .
At age 5 , those in the academic group knew more numbers and letters than their counterparts in the social group .
But those gains faded away by around the first grade .
And the kids from the academic preschools were observed to be less creative and less enthusiastic about learning .
When I went to kindergarten , I was expected to learn how to play with others and be exposed to the alphabet through inflatable letter characters .
( I still remember that Miss A said achoo all the time , and Mr. V had a violet velvet vest . )
But today 's typical concept of kindergarten preparedness is far more rigorous .
Part of that change in expectations has to do with external forces - federal and state standards and testing regimens .
Yet I have to think that some of it has to do with the expectations parents bring with them when they drop their children off at school .
If parents have spent time and money on tutoring for their little ones before formal schooling begins , are they going to be content to watch them be taught the same lessons in a kindergarten class ?
And what about the kids who did n't have this enrichment tutoring ?
In some communities , it has become relatively common to see parents " redshirt " their kids , particularly if they are boys , giving them an extra year in preschool so they are better able to handle the stiffer standards of kindergarten .
But you can see how , with more kids entering kindergarten a calendar year older than their peers , this trend might eventually just raise the bar of expectations even higher for everyone .
A classic study in the 1930s by noted researcher and Illinois educator Carleton Washburne compared the trajectories of children who had begun reading at several ages , up to 7 .
Washburne concluded that , in general , a child could best learn to read beginning around the age of 6 .
By middle school , he found no appreciable difference in reading levels between the kids who had started young versus the kids who had started later , except the earlier readers appeared to be less motivated and less excited about reading .
More recent research also raises doubt about the push for early readers .
A cross-cultural study of European children published in 2003 in the British Journal of Psychology found those taught to read at age 5 had more reading problems than those who were taught at age 7 .
The findings supported a 1997 report critical of Britain 's early - reading model .
What might explain this ?
In her fascinating new book Proust and the Squid : The Story and Science of the Reading Brain , Maryanne Wolf offers some answers .
True reading requires the integration of complicated functions from different regions of the brain - visual , auditory , linguistic , conceptual - a process that takes time .
The speed with which these regions can be integrated depends on something called myelination , in which the tails ( or axons ) of neurons in the brain are wrapped in a fatty sheathing that makes them perform better .
For these regions of the brain to interact efficiently , they need one neuron to talk to another neuron in rapid succession .
And to do that well , those neuron tails need lots of myelin .
Myelination rates can vary , but Wolf says generally these pivotal regions are n't fully myelinated until sometime between the ages of 5 and 7 , with boys probably being on the later side .
That 's why many kids can master some components of reading at an early age , such as the visual .
But other components , such as phonemic awareness - the idea that a word is made up of discrete sounds - typically take longer .
Wolf , a cognitive neuroscientist and child development professor at Tufts , relates how a colleague once asked a kindergartner what the first sound in the word " cat " was .
The child perked up and replied , " Meow . "
" There is a really good reason why , across the world , literacy training is not begun until 5 to 7 , " Wolf says .
" Some countries , such as Austria , do n't want children taught reading until 7 . "
For what it 's worth , that 's the same Austria with a per-capita Nobel - laureate rate many times higher than that of Japan , the land that spawned Junior Kumon .
After poring over the available research , Wolf concludes in her book , " Many efforts to teach a child to read before 4 or 5 years of age are biologically precipitate and potentially counterproductive for many children . "
The danger in pushing reading too early , Wolf says , is that , for many children , we may be asking them to do something for which their brains are not ready .
" You run the risk of making a child feel like a failure before they 've even begun , " she says .
And while the gains from early reading may fade away , the damage from being tagged a slow kid at a young age has the potential to be permanent .
But wait a minute .
Have n't we all heard about the " critical periods " of birth to 3 , and 3 to 6 , where the human brain is growing the fastest , has the most plasticity , and is most able to learn new skills ?
When it comes to learning a foreign language , we all know that a 3 - year - old will outpace the 43 - year - old just about every time .
Does n't it follow that learning skills besides a foreign language will also be easier in the younger child ?
Again , not exactly .
There 's no question that if you want your child to be bilingual or trilingual , it 's better to start sooner .
But that may be because language - like mobility and vision - is a skill the species has historically depended on for survival .
As Wolf says , " We were never born to read . "
Or , for that matter , to play chess or do long division .
The latter are skills the species survived for a long time without having , and researchers have found that there typically is n't a critical period for learning them .
This does n't mean that early exposure to learning is n't important for kids .
It is vitally important .
It should just be the right kind of learning , and the right kind of exposure .
Study after study shows the best thing parents can do for their children is give them a nurturing , rich , vibrant environment , reading to them often and exposing them to lots of language in organic ways .
Reading books out loud is most effective when the parent uses the words on the page to help the child make connections to his or her own world .
" Pooh and Piglet got lost in the Hundred Acre Wood .
Do you remember a time when we got lost in the park ? "
The exposure to rhyming and wordplay that springs from Mother Goose and other nursery rhymes is particularly effective , according to Wolf , in helping prepare a child to read .
Wolf says the best predictor of how a child will do in school is not reading ability but rather the size and richness of the child 's vocabulary .
And , as with so much in life , the kids whose parents worry about this area the most tend to be the kids we need to worry about least .
Veteran early - childhood researchers Betty Hart and Todd Risley conducted a meticulous longitudinal study tracking the vocabulary growth in young children coming from three types of families : professional class , working class , and those who were on welfare .
The results were stunning , and depressing for anyone who is troubled by inequity .
They found that the children were very much a product of what they were exposed to by their parents : between 86 and 98 percent of the words in their vocabularies were also words their parents used .
Across four years , the average child from a professional family would have heard nearly 45 million words spoken to them , the average child from a working class family , 26 million , and the average child from a family on welfare , 13 million .
That means that compared with the affluent child , the poor child would be starting school with an astonishing deficit of 32 million words of language experience .
How can that child 's entire educational career not , on some level , become a demoralizing case of catchup ?
As long as parents are exposing their children to a nurturing , vibrant environment , reading to them regularly , and speaking with them intelligently , they should feel free to put the flash cards away .
I remember well the day our oldest daughter , then about three months shy of her sixth birthday , first realized she could read .
She put down one of the Dick and Jane books my wife and I had been reading with her for some time , the same series our parents had used to help us decode the printed word , and she shrieked with joy .
And pride .
Since then , encouraged by talented teachers , she has turned into a voracious , self - motivated reader who carries a book wherever she goes .
Still , I have no way of knowing if the stimulating but generally laissez - faire environment we 've tried to provide will ultimately prove to have been the right approach .
But I can tell you this much :
Her epiphany that day was a magical moment that we , and she , will always treasure .
And for me , if it had not unfolded naturally but rather been the byproduct of tutoring sessions and tedious benchmarks , it would have felt a whole lot less magical .
AFTER 20 MINUTES , THE DIGITAL STOPWATCH chirps , and the stocking - footed children are led out of science class to music class across the hall .
There , Kathy Myers , a round - faced woman with round glasses and curly blond hair , leads her class in a lesson on Impressionist composers .
She sits down on the carpeted platform at the front of the room and pulls out large flashcards featuring the names of composers from this category .
In eight seconds , she flips through seven cards for seven composers , from Frederick Delius to Maurice Ravel , before beginning a longer riff extolling the genius of Claude Debussy and his " Sunken Cathedral " masterpiece .
Her students , four boys and four girls wearing lavender overalls or jumpers and bearing familiar names like Isabel and Benjamin , listen attentively .
They range in age from 5 down to 2 1/2 .
It is a brilliant September day , and I am sitting in a second - floor room in the stately old mansion that houses the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential near Chestnut Hill , Pennsylvania .
I had heard passionate criticism of the Better Baby Institute model from several academics in the field , but I felt I needed to see the classes in action myself .
Several of the critics I spoke with complained that the Institutes did not let academic researchers in , but the staff could n't have been more welcoming to me .
The founder , Glenn Doman , who had turned 88 two weeks earlier , remains an active presence on campus , though his daughter , Janet Doman , has since 1980 served as the Institutes ' director .
Janet , an elegant 58 - year - old wearing a lavender blazer , her charcoal hair pulled back in a tight bun , leads me through the Institutes ' once - a - week program for preschoolers .
( The campus also features a small school for children in first through eighth grades as well as several programs for brain - injured children and their parents . )
Across the morning , as we advance through fast - paced 20 - minute blocks of science , music , Japanese , and gymnastics , I meet students and parents who seem uniformly friendly , bright and polite .
Indeed , there seems to be much to recommend about the place .
The Domans have sold millions of books , particularly How to Teach Your Baby to Read , and they bill their Gentle Revolution collection as the number - one best - selling parenting series .
Yet money hardly seems to motivate them .
The mansion , which the nonprofit Institutes had managed to buy decades earlier , was once splendid , but it is now tired , with faded paint and worn carpets .
Janet tells me the main reason they keep the demonstration school small is that they want parents of limited means to be able to send their children .
Accordingly , they do n't charge tuition for the school , and Janet Doman says that many of the parents are working class .
She also says she is appalled by the craven manner in which the marketplace has sought to cash in on the teachings about the importance of early , intense infant education so identified with her father .
In fact , even if Glenn Doman is n't as widely known as some parenting experts , all his preaching on early intervention has had a major influence on the infant education industry .
And even those who disagree with his message would have to agree that he is one heck of an engaging messenger .
I have no idea if there is intellectual rigor in his videotaped rant deconstructing children 's assumed love of pat - a - cake by using the example of American diplomats held hostage overseas , but I can say this :
It makes for riveting television .
( You can find it at iahp.org . )
And some of his ideas , such as his withering critique of the way we tend to confine newborns with swaddling and cell - like cribs , can't help but get you thinking .
When I read about his thought - provoking views on visual convergence - the ability to use two eyes together , harmoniously - and the linkage he finds between mobility and visual development , I had to wonder if my instinct as a lefthander to bat righty and my confusion over which hand to use when handling a bow and arrow or a golf club could somehow be traced back to an incomplete crawling period during infancy .
What most impressed me about the program was how so many parents told me it had helped them feel more effective .
There 's something to be said for anything that boosts confidence among today 's overly anxious parents .
Still , I have to say that , as pleasant as everyone was , I could n't get past how some parts of the Institutes ' regimen struck me as more than a little batty .
I observed a very nice mother of three putting her 3 - month - old son through the paces , earnestly showing him " Bits of Intelligence " flash cards containing facts about obscure insects like the two - spotted ladybird beetle and the periodical cicada , and doing nothing beyond cooing supportively as the baby bawled while struggling to inch his way down an elevated crawling track .
Watching this scene , I could n't help but wonder if embracing the program requires a giant leap of faith .
How else to view a program that advises you to bring your newborn into a darkened room and point a flashlight at his eyes for a minute , 10 times a day ?
Or to put him in a neck brace and do a series of balancing exercises twice a day that involve swinging your baby around and tossing him in the air ?
Then there is the issue of how decades of preaching on how to build better babies seem to have helped fuel our current contagion of competitiveness among parents .
Janet Doman tells me that their goal is only to help parents unlock their children 's potential , and not to turn child - rearing into a race .
She even includes an afterword in her most recent book , How Smart Is Your Baby ? , distancing herself from the book 's title .
" This book was never meant to be about some infantile competition , " she writes .
But it 's hard to argue convincingly that a program advising parents to keep scrupulous records of their child 's every movement and presenting them with elaborate milestone charts to be monitored compulsively cannot , in important ways , introduce competition and anxiety into their lives .
Yet the biggest problem with the Better Baby Institute model is that after decades , it has astonishingly little hard data to back up its claims .
( I 'm referring here to its work with well children , not the brain - injured . )
Glenn Doman points to some old studies that showed rats kept in deprived environments had small , undeveloped brains while those kept in stimulating environments had larger , higher - functioning brains .
But other scholars have pointed out that the kind of deprivation the first group of rats lived in thankfully has no equivalent among humans .
Also , the rats in the study who turned out to have the best brains came from a third group who were allowed to grow up in their natural environments .
When I ask Janet for evidence that the program works , she repeatedly invokes examples of now - grown alumni , particularly her nephews .
When I press her for evidence that transcends anecdote , she concedes , " For us , it 's all pretty much anecdotal . "
She says that because the Institutes plows whatever funds it has right back into its programs , it has never been able to afford rigorous scientific studies to document its performance .
That commitment to the program is admirable , but after 50 years , the Domans should be able to point to more than anecdotes .
I 'm sure there are teams of researchers who would love to study the program , and who could scare up the necessary funds to do it right .
I have a bold suggestion for a team they should consider .
Just a 15 - minute drive from the Institutes , on a satellite campus of Temple University in rural Ambler , Pennsylvania , is the university 's Infant Laboratory .
Kathy Hirsh - Pasek , the child psychologist who did the study comparing academic and social preschools , is co-director of the lab .
Hirsh - Pasek 's life 's work can be seen as a sort of rebuttal to the Domans .
A passionate advocate for the return of unstructured play into childhood , she is the coauthor of the highly readable Einstein Never Used Flash Cards .
Hirsh - Pasek managed to see the Better Baby Institute many years back , but says she doubts they 'd ever let her back in given her views .
" There is no data showing their kids are doing any better than other kids with highly motivated parents , " she says .
" And they 're not producing Olympic athletes or Nobel laureates , or you can be sure we'd be hearing about it . "
( If young Morgan is able to keep up her current lead and ends up making it to Harvard , it may have less to do with the " Bits of Intelligence " flashcards she saw as an infant than the fact that she was exposed to a stimulating , nurturing environment and comes from good academic stock - her mother , uncle , and grandfather all studied at Harvard . )
That 's why , for the Domans , it could be a public relations master stroke to open up their half - century - old books to one of their most persistent critics , in the search for rigorous research to test their claims .
Until then , Hirsh - Pasek and her students at the Temple lab soldier on with a host of more modest studies whose findings appear in general to support her view that play is the thing .
After a morning at the Better Baby Institute , I spent the afternoon in the brightly decorated , low - ceilinged Temple lab observing some of these studies in action .
One study , of a Sesame Workshop educational video designed to teach kids about verbs , suggests that 2 1/2 - to 3 - year - olds generally do n't understand what they are being taught on the screen .
But comprehension goes way up when a live adult introduces the video with a brief puppet show .
Along similar lines , a study comparing comprehension rates of traditional books read by a parent with the electronic " console " books shows how the battery - operated variety tends to shut out the parent and reduce the ability of the child to follow a linear story line .
Hirsh - Pasek urges parents to put away all the gadgets and encourage their preschoolers to play with blocks or , better yet , get down on the living room floor with them and build forts using blankets and chairs .
Somehow , though , parents have come to believe this kind of play is inconsequential compared with " educational " materials designed to maximize brain growth .
In fact , Hirsh - Pasek argues that this heightened push for early learning might even slow down normal brain development through a phenomenon known as neurological " crowding , " where information jams up the synapses in the brain that might best be reserved for more creative tasks in later years .
Remember that in his early years , Einstein was considered just an average student .
ALL OF THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THAT surprising brain study giving late bloomers cause for celebration .
Researchers from the National Institutes of Mental Health performed periodic MRI brain scans on children and teens ranging in age from 5 to 19 , tracking the relationship between the thickness of the brain 's outer mantle , or cortex , with the subject 's IQ .
They found that the people whose IQ scores put them in the " superior intelligence " category had cortexes that matured much later than those of average intelligence .
The cortexes of the smartest kids peaked by around age 11 or 12 , whereas the average kids ' peaked by around age 8 .
Jay Giedd , one of the lead researchers , says he and his colleagues were initially taken aback by the findings , but with more reflection they realized they made all kinds of sense .
" By having this peak period of plasticity later , " he says , " the brain is adapting to the 12 - year - old world , which is more complicated , more similar to the adult world , than the 8 - year - old world . "

“ Haskell Curry ?
Yes , I dated his daughter . ”
August 21 , 2007 at 4:44 pm
Last week I had the opportunity to talk with Alonzo Church , Jr. ( he prefers to be called “ Al ” ) , son of the Alonzo Church ( you know , the one who only invented the freaking lambda calculus ) .
We had a lovely conversation ; we talked about Alan Turing , Fortran , COBOL , the future of computer science , and all sorts of other interesting topics .
The highlight of our conversation , though , was this :
Me : “ So , I ’m learning a new - ish programming language named Haskell right now .
It ’s very strange . ”
Al : “ Did you say Pascal ? ”
Me : “ No , Haskell .
It ’s named after a logicial named Haskell Curry – ”
Al : “ Oh , Professor Curry !
Yes , I knew him !
My father worked with him ! ”
Me : “ No way !
That ’s awesome ! ”
Al : “ Yes !
In fact , I dated his daughter ! ”
Me : “ You DOG ! ”

Designing a great website and filling it with lots of unique and interesting content is only the first step in a continuous process known as Internet Marketing .
Web marketing strategies come and go .
Some prove effective over the long - term and others are viable only until Google decides that their search algorithm is being exploited in some way .
I ’ve tried quite a few different Internet advertising strategies for my own sites and those of my clients .
I ’ve found that the most consistent strategy to increase website traffic is a combination of search engine optimization and paid advertising with an email newsletter .
Effectively leveraging social media can also lead to big increases in traffic and revenue .
There are numerous social media networks ( Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , and Instagram being the biggies ) , applications and techniques that are helpful for becoming a strong authority in the social Internet world .
My goal here on Web Development Blog is to have an honest conversation about what works and what does n’t , where I ’ve achieved a reasonable return on my investment and the latest new ideas and strategies being explored by Internet marketeers .
Orangutans intentionally modified their gestures to get what they wanted
Researchers from St Andrews University have shown that the animals intentionally modify or repeat their signals to get their messages across .
The scientists said they believed all great apes could have this capability , suggesting that the skill may have evolved millions of years ago .
The study , which is published in the journal Current Biology , involved six orangutans living in two zoos .
Richard Byrne , an evolutionary psychologist and an author on the paper , said : " We were interested in the intentions behind communication .
" When humans communicate , we routinely use our knowledge of what our audience knows and what they do n't know automatically .
" We wanted to find out whether the great apes , that have so much flexibility with their communication , do the same thing . "
Bananas v leeks
To find this out , the researchers set up a situation where six captive orangutans from Durrell and Twycross zoos were presented with a keeper who had treats , such as bananas , and blander food , such as leeks or celery .
The animals gestured to attract the keeper 's attention so the tasty treat would be passed to them .
However , once the orangutans had done this , the keepers did one of three things : they either handed them the treat , handed them the bland food or handed them half the treat .
The scientists then recorded their reactions .
" When the keeper gave the orangutan the really nice food , understandably , that was the end of it , " explained Professor Byrne .
" But when the keeper pretended to fail to understand the original gesture and gave the wrong food , the orangutans stopped using the gestures they had used before and started using some different gestures , " he explained .
" And when the keeper half understood and gave the orangutan part of the treat , the orangutans started to repeat the same gestures that they had used , but they would repeat them even more enthusiastically . "
Professor Byrne likened it to a game of charades .
He said : " Part of the skill is to do the miming and the gesturing in the cleverest way - but also you are paying attention to what your team is guessing , and you tailor what you do next to what they are doing . "
Effectively , the orangutans were able to take into account the states of knowledge , ignorance and partial knowledge of the keeper and react , said Professor Byrne .
Given that orangutans are the most distantly related great ape to humans , the scientists believe that all great apes would prove to have this skill .
" This ability to take into account how much individuals have understood you , and to modify what you do next , is probably quite an ancient one in the human lineage , " explained Professor Byrne .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House withdrew the nomination of John Rizzo to be the CIA ’s top attorney on Tuesday after months of controversy over his role in the agency ’s interrogation policy .

Rizzo , a career CIA lawyer , had drawn fire from Democrats and human rights groups because of his support for Bush administration legal doctrines permitting “ enhanced interrogation ” of terrorism detainees in CIA custody .
Rizzo sent a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday withdrawing his nomination to be general counsel of the CIA , White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore said .
“ The president accepted his decision , ” Lawrimore said .
“ He believes Mr. Rizzo would have done a wonderful job in this position . ”
A senior U.S. official said Rizzo told Bush he had decided to withdraw after concluding that the nomination would not succeed and that drawing out the process would not be helpful .
Rizzo remains the senior attorney at the CIA , the official said .
The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the panel ’s senior Republican both said Rizzo did not have enough support and was unlikely to be confirmed .
“ The president and Mr. Rizzo made the correct decision in withdrawing this nomination , ” committee chairman Jay Rockefeller said in a statement .
“ The confirmation process highlighted Mr. Rizzo ’s 31 years of dedicated service , but it also raised serious questions about whether he was the right person for this job . ”
During his confirmation hearing in June , Rizzo told the Senate committee he issued a legal opinion in 2002 stipulating that CIA detainee practices were lawful under international treaties against torture , including the Geneva Conventions .
But Rizzo also said he did not oppose an August 2002 Justice Department memo that said torture would not occur unless the detainee experienced pain serious enough to accompany organ failure or death .
“ I did not certainly object to the memo , ” Rizzo said at the hearing .
“ My reaction was that it was an aggressive , expansive reading . ”
A coalition of human rights organizations wrote to the Senate intelligence committee this month urging members to reject Rizzo ’s nomination for CIA general counsel , citing his testimony .
They said confirming Rizzo would send “ an extraordinarily negative message to the world . ”
How To Look Good On A Budget : The Business of Beauty
For some people , it ’s not enough to keep fit and stay in shape through natural methods .
But there are ways to look good on a budget !
Not too long ago , I tackled the subject of the price of beauty , and I liked the topic so much that I thought I ’d talk about it again , and this time , supplement it with some equal opportunity coverage .
Continuing where I left off then , I wanted to check into how far people would go to actually look better .
In fact , what ’s interesting is how some people have truly invested quite heavily in their appearance , so much so that the amount spent actually reaches six figures .
Ask yourself the question : if you had several hundred thousand dollars , what would you spend it on ?
For some , they ’d spend it on themselves .
Literally .
I do n’t know if you ’ve ever heard of the real life Ken and Barbie couple before , but here ’s a bit about them .
According to some news coverage :
Cindy Jackson and Miles Kendall have spent about $ 300,000 transforming themselves into copies of the best - selling dolls , undergoing 89 operations – ranging from jaw implants and chemical peels to liposuction .
Before anything else , I ’d like to say that while pursuing this story , I corresponded with Cindy Jackson to ask her permission to capture her amazing photographs here .
Unfortunately , my request was declined so a reference to her site should suffice .
May I also add that she ’s a very nice lady who is doing quite well working in the business of cosmetics and beauty … but of course !
On this note , there was once a show I watched with immense uneasiness , but which I was attracted to nonetheless , mostly out of sheer curiosity .
It was called “ The Swan ” and it was about how regular , even homely women were transformed , through expensive medical procedures , into outwardly stunning knockouts .
Following is a tiny sample of what the show offered .
What Money Can Do For Your Physique
BEFORE AFTER
If you participated in the show , you got the benefits of the procedures for free .
But to replicate such work in real life , you ’d need to fork out some serious dough .
Here ’s a little cheat sheet of the surgical costs that face aspiring bombshells :
Plastic Surgery Procedures and Fees
In court documents , she 's known as " Jane Doe . "
Innocuous enough , but the woman behind that pseudonym pushes one of the nation 's hottest political buttons : guns and school safety .
What Ms. Doe wants to do is take her Glock 9 - mm pistol to the high school in Medford , Ore. , where she teaches .
She 's licensed to carry a concealed weapon and she has what many supporters say is a legitimate reason for being armed : a restraining order against her ex-husband based on threats he 's allegedly made against her and her children .
But district policy prohibits anyone except a law - enforcement officer from bringing a weapon onto campus .
When word got out that she had a concealed - carry permit , administrators reminded her of that policy .
There 's the political rub :
According to state law , " any element relating to firearms and components thereof , including ammunition , is vested solely in the Legislative Assembly . "
Backed by gun-rights groups ,
Doe intends to challenge the school district in state court this week .
Meanwhile throughout the country , lawmakers are filing bills that would make it legal for adult school employees to carry firearms , in some cases providing special weapons safety training for those who want to be part of their school 's security force in addition to their classroom teaching duties .
Gun-rights groups and school boards around the country are paying close attention to the Oregon case .
" There 's a specific state statute that prohibits local governments , including school districts , from passing laws or policies prohibiting people from owning or possessing firearms , " says James Leuenberger , the Portland , Ore. , lawyer representing the teacher .
" Jane Doe , " who agreed to be interviewed by phone on condition of anonymity , says she does not want to be viewed as an " Annie Oakley . "
Trying to extricate herself from an abusive relationship led her to buy her first gun just a few years ago , she says .
Prior to that she had not been an activist in defense of the US Constitution 's Second Amendment provision regarding " the right to keep and bear arms . "
But as a veteran teacher , she has come to believe strongly that having responsible armed adults on campus could have prevented tragedies such as those at Columbine High School in Colorado , Thurston High School in Oregon , and Virginia Tech University last April .
" I have no doubt at all that any time a criminal has gone into a school intending to commit violence they did so knowing nobody was going to be able to stop them , " she says .
" We 've seen what happens when teachers do nothing or can do nothing , and that 's not acceptable to me . "
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , 37 states have laws specifically banning guns at schools .
In general , administrators , teachers ' organizations , and law - enforcement agencies favor such laws .
In the confusion of a school shooting , police officials have said , adding guns to the situation just makes the predicament more dangerous .
The state panel investigating the April 16 shootings by a mentally disturbed student who killed 33 people at Virginia Tech University ( the nation 's deadliest school shooting ) agrees .
" If numerous people had been rushing around with handguns … the possibility of accidental or mistaken shootings would have increased significantly , " the panel wrote .
But that has not stopped a push by the NRA and other gun advocates to allow guns on school property as a safety measure .
In Michigan last week , 16 state lawmakers sponsored legislation allowing teachers , administrators , and other school employees to carry concealed weapons on school property .
Ohio has a similar bill pending .
South Carolina , Alabama , and Virginia are among several other states that have considered lifting school campus gun bans this year , according to Stateline.org , which tracks state issues .
Louisiana lawmakers refused to pass a bill that would have outlawed guns in college dormitories , and legislators in Maine similarly killed a bill that would have given colleges the authority to prohibit guns on campuses .
Anthony Stavros , a member of the Nevada State Board of Regents governing higher education and a Las Vegas police captain , has proposed deputizing university employees as reserve officers , trained and qualified to carry weapons .
The Iowa Board of Regents is close to allowing campus police to be armed .
But efforts to allow guns in grade schools and high schools tend not to get very far in state legislatures .
The South Carolina measure failed .
Administrators and the state teachers ' union in Michigan have voiced strong opposition to the proposal there .
So far , just one state - Utah - allows concealed weapons on campus .
Utah 's law applies to public colleges and universities .
The University of Utah opposed the 2004 legislation that allows weapons on campus ( including those owned by students with concealed carry permits ) , but lost in the state supreme court .
For high school teacher " Jane Doe , " who takes her case to court this week , the issue is very personal .
" I have two children in school , " she says , " and I would like to think that if something like that ever happened , there would be somebody there to do the right thing to protect my kids . "
The United States provided Israel with strategic information about the Syrian air defense systems prior to the Israeli Air Force strike on a suspected nuclear site in Syria , the US based Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine reported Thursday .
According to aerospace industry officials quoted in the report , the US was monitoring the electronic emissions coming from Syria during the IAF strike .
Tensions ' IDF aircraft did n't attack '
Ronny Sofer Syrian minister admits it 's unclear whether Israeli planes did anything more than intervene in Syrian airspace ; nonethless , another minister warns of ' response to Israeli aggression ' ' IDF aircraft did n't attack '
The Israeli fighter jets , reported the magazine , flew over Syria without alerting Syrian air defenses .
The radar site was apparently hit with both precision bombs and an electronic signal , which allowed IAF jets to fly through Syrian airspace undetected
The report stressed that there was " no active US engagement other than consulting on potential target vulnerabilities . "
The analysts quoted in the magazine said they did n't believe that any part of Syria 's electrical grid was shut down , but did contend that network penetration involved both remote air - to - ground electronic attack as well as penetration through computer - to - computer links .
" Offensive and defensive network warfare is one of the most interesting new areas , " said Pinchas Buchris , director - general of the Israeli Defense Ministry .
" I can only say we 're following this technology closely .
I doubted this field five years ago , but we did it .
Now everything 's changed .
" You need this kind of capability , " added Buchris .
" You 're not being responsible if you 're not dealing with it ; and if you can have this kind of capability , than the sky 's the limit . "
" This environment is certainly not getting better , " he said .
" Something tomorrow could turn it around , but this is a first step in series of steps we 're going to take . "
Bank of America announced late Wednesday it would invest $ 2 billion in Countrywide Financial , helping shore up the company 's finances as it has struggled with a liquidity crunch this month .
The nation 's second - largest bank said it would buy non-voting preferred stock that yields 7.25 % and can be converted into Countrywide common stock at $ 18 per share , 17.5 % below Countrywide 's closing price Wednesday .
" For a long - term shareholder , this is the best deal that they can have , " Mozilo said in the interview .
" To put Countrywide back on a strong footing so we can move forward .
Both companies win here in a very big way . "
Mozilo said Bank of America contacted him and and " said they would like to help " the company he founded in 1969 with the help of a $ 75,000 Bank of America loan .
Bank of America announced its investment just six days after Countrywide stunned investors by tapping an entire $ 11.5 billion credit line due to difficulties selling short - term debt .
Bankruptcy Speculation ' Baseless '
This raised concerns about whether the Calabasas , Calif . - based company might survive the mortgage and credit crisis afflicting a wide range of U.S. lenders .
Mozilo criticized a Merrill Lynch analyst report published earlier this month , which said Countrywide could face possible bankruptcy if market conditions worsen .
" It was totally irresponsible and baseless and affected the lives of 61,000 lives here at Countrywide and it was all caused by that individual at Merrill Lynch , " Mozilo said .
The company is no closer to bankruptcy now , he said , than it was six months or six years ago .
" What does n't kill you makes you stronger and we 're a much stronger company today than we were a couple of weeks ago , " he said .
" A lot of what is driving this is a lack of confidence , it 's panic .
This is one of the greatest panics I 've seen in 55 years financial services .
Something has to be done to restore the confidence the market . "
Housing Woes Could Lead to Economic Recession ?
Mozilo said he continues to believe the housing downturn will take the U.S. economy into a recession .
" I still think so , I 've been proven wrong so far , " he said .
" But I can't believe when you 're having the level of delinquencies , foreclosures … that this does n't have a material effect on the psyche of American people and eventually on their wallet . "
" It seems to me , I do n't see a light here at the moment , " Mozilo added .
" Something could happen that could change that overnight , but it appears to me we 've got a way to go to work our way through . "
Shares of Countrywide surged at the start of trading , opening with a gain of 10 % , but pared gains by about 1.5 % following Mozilo 's comments regarding the housing industry .
Bank of America shares traded slightly higher .
Citigroup research analyst Bradley Ball said the deal was a " win-win situation " and reiterated a " buy " rating on Countrywide Financial .

Remember those heady days of spring 2005 , when the price of a barrel of light crude busted $ 50 ?
Petrol prices are rising in the US - but there have been no riots yet
It seemed like a historic milestone to somewhere unpleasant , but no - one was quite sure where .
Doomsayers with strong stomachs dared to look into a future .
" What would happen if there was all out war with Iran ? " they were asked .
Well , for one , oil could top $ 100 a barrel .
Just imagine .
" Do n't be absurd ! " " Never !
Not in your worst dreams ! "
That was the chorus of rebuttal from a phalanx of realists grounded in sound economics .
The doomsayers were indeed wrong .
On Monday , oil rose to $ 93 a barrel , only seven bucks short of its cataclysmic , futuristic high , and the world is still standing , we are not at war with Iran ( yet ) and there are no riots at my local petrol station .
Sanctions
What we do know is that every time President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran gets into a scrum with the US and Europe , he becomes more popular in Moscow and makes more money from oil .
The real shock about today 's oil shock is that it is n't a shock
Send us your comments
The sanctions announced by the US last week may indeed hurt Iran 's Revolutionary Guard force and its real estate business but they have also helped to push the price of oil higher .
For now Iran is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the crisis it is helping to fuel , so to speak .
It is too early to tell when the pain of sanctions trumps the gain of higher oil prices .
And even then , it is hard to say whether sanctions will have the desired political effect .
Swagger of wealth
Oil is the poison in the diplomatic mix .
The need to buy it means that energy - hungry giants like China will find another reason not to side with the US at the UN Security Council .
Russia and Iran have more sway because of their big oil reserves
We are addicted to oil and so are they .
The addict and the pusher are equally doomed .
Would President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela really refer to President George W Bush as " the devil " if he had n't been the world 's sixth largest exporter of oil last year ?
Would Vladimir Putin describe the Bush administration as " running around like a madman with a razor blade " if he were n't making a mint from crude ?
Would he enjoy a 75 % popularity rating at home ?
Towards the abyss
Last year Tom Friedman , the New York Times columnist , said he welcomed the doomsday scenario of $ 100 a barrel , because only this would provide the necessary shock treatment .
Venezuela 's position as a big oil exporter helps Hugo Chavez
It would force us to develop alternative sources of fuel , which in turn would force the unelected Princes of Arabia to change their ways .
It would encourage us to change our lavish life styles , say goodbye to the Hummer once and for all and diminish our carbon footprint .
I hate to say it , Tom , but we 're only a fistful of dollars short and the world continues to slide , even glide towards the abyss .
California burns , Georgia is dying of thirst , the Dominican Republic is drowning and I 'm driving around in my beaten - up convertible with the roof down at the end of October in Washington DC .
Mother Nature is acting weird and virtually every scientist you speak to says it 's not just a cyclical phase or a freakish fit but a fact of science , which should give us sleepless nights .
The Weather Channel is no longer just for climate geeks and it costs more and more to fill my car with petrol - and yet , the real shock about today 's oil shock is that it is n't a shock .
Yet .

とある大手 SI の方の話。会社で 2ch へのアクセスを禁止したところ、開発の速度が目に見えて低下したので、何が起こったのかと現場にヒヤリングしたところ、今までは困ったときに2ch で聞いて問題を解決していたが、2ch にアクセスできなくなって、はまってしまったときにどうにもならなくなってしまったとのこと。これは
Messenger / Skype を禁止している会社にも同様のことが言えるだろう。プロが 2ch で聞くというのはどうなのかという意見もあるとは思うが、会社の枠を超えた横のつながりでのコミュニケーションが遮断されることは、それ自体が大きなリスクにつながるという話。某大手ハードウェアベンダーでの話。優秀な人材を集めたプロジェクトを立ち上げたが、うまくいかなかった。その理由は、メンバー全員がモチベーションも高く、アウトプットも評価できるものだったが、人事面でプロジェクトメンバーの平均評価をBにしなければならなかったので、何人かには最低のC評価を出さなければならなかった。C評価を受けたメンバーからは不満が続出。しばらくしてそのプロジェクトは成果も出なくなり、プロジェクトは解散した。すると、別の参加者が言う。「うちはその問題を解決してるマネージャが結構多いですよ。わざと優秀でない人を雇って、他のメンバーの平均評価を上げるんです。」この話にはかなりぐったりした。こちらはまた別の大手
SI の方の話。自社でパッケージ製品として開発しているグループウェアがあるが、社内では自社のパッケージはあまり使われず、他社のパッケージが使われている。理由は自社のパッケージが使いにくいから。それならパッケージ改善プロジェクトでも立ち上げればよいのにと思うわけだが、部門が違うので言いにくかったり、他社製品の調査のためにという言い訳がまかり通ったりしているので、多分このまま状況は変わらないのだろうとのこと。保守の問題があるから簡単には捨てることはできないかもしれないが、そんな状況なら少なくとも新規の販売は差し止めた方がよいのではないかと思う。自社でも使いたくない製品を買わされる側はたまったものではない。もちろん、問題点がわかっているのだから、パッケージを改善していくのが一番良いと思う。外資系大手ベンダーを渡り歩いてきたベテランの方の話。曰く、日本でパッケージが発展しないのは、一つの業種の中での競合が多すぎるからである。ある会社にパッケージを提案すると、競合他社に販売しないことを条件に出され、それは飲めませんと答えると採用を見送られる。アメリカでは業種ごとの
No.1 がはっきりしていて、同業種内での日本のような競争はない。日本では「うちの会社だけの特権」という形でこの業種では御社にしか販売しないという約束をしないと大型の商談は成立しなかったのだと言う。もちろん、今では状況はかなり変わってきているとは思う。ただ、パッケージが普及しない歴史的背景としてそのようなことがあったのだということは印象に残った。こちらは特定業種に特化した中堅
IT ベンダーでの話。中堅とは言っても社員は500人以上でそれなりの規模。社内で進めていたプロジェクトがIPAからの助成金を受けることになったが、金銭的支援は得られたものの、報告やチェックの類が非常に細かく、また求められるドキュメントも分量を増やすことを求められ、資金的には援助が得られたものの、間接業務の割合が増大し、プロジェクトが減速したという話。例えば交通費の清算で言うと、最安値のルートかどうかを一つ一つチェックされ、最安値になっていないものがあると指摘を受けるので、移動の際に少し時間がかかっても最安値での移動を余儀なくされた等々。ただ、IPA
のプロジェクトの中には未踏ソフトのように手続きよりも結果を重視するものもあるので、一概に
IPA = 細かなチェックとドキュメントの山 ということではないと思う。上記のような話は大きな会社では当たり前のことなのかもしれないが、日本の

Movies such as Spiderman 2 and Speed generate excitement among audiences with their cool special effects .
But they also defy the laws of physics , contributing to students ’ ignorance about science .
Two University of Central Florida professors show just how poorly Hollywood writers and directors understand science in an article published in the German journal “ Praxis der Naturwissenschaften Physik . ”
Common sense may indicate that people should know the stunts in movies are just make believe , but the professors say that ’s not necessarily true .
Some people really do believe a bus traveling 70 mph can clear a 50 - foot gap in a freeway , as depicted in the movie Speed .
And , if that were realistic , a ramp would be needed to adjust the direction of motion to even try to make the leap , said UCF professor Costas J. Efthimiou , who co-authored the article .
“ Students come here , and they do n’t have any basic understanding of science , ” he said .
“ Sure , people say everyone knows the movies are not real , but my experience is many of the students believe what they see on the screen . ”
And that ’s not just a UCF problem .
Efthimiou said students across the United States seem to have the same challenge with science .
It starts young .
The Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 report seems to support his observations .
The report shows that the average science scores among 12th graders in the U.S. dropped from the previous year .
The scores remained stagnant in the fourth and eighth grades .
Worse , only about one - third of all students tested were proficient , meaning they had a solid understanding of what they should know .
If youngsters are n’t getting the basics at the elementary level , it becomes very difficult for them to continue to study the subjects in college and virtually impossible for them to make significant contributions to the scientific community , Efthimiou said .
Efthimiou began teaching a basic physics course at UCF in 2000 .
He described the experience as “ horrible . ”
The students feared the subject matter and complained his class was too hard .
Instead of continuing with the standard fare , he approached former UCF physics chair R.A. Llewellyn .
Together , they came up with the movie approach now known as “ Physics in Film . ”
They launched the course in the summer of 2002 , and today it is among the most popular on campus .
“ I needed a hook to get the students interested in science , ” Efthimiou said .
“ I needed something to get them beyond this fear .
Now it is one of the most popular classes . ”
Efthimiou spends hours watching hundreds of films to find scenes that illustrate the physics concepts he needs to teach .
For example , he uses a scene from Superman when the hero flies around the earth an in effort to reverse time and save Lois Lane from death .
When students show up to class , they dissect the scenes and learn the real laws of physics .
In the Superman example , he explains the real way angular momentum works .
“ It ’s a lot of work , but it is worth it , ” he said .
“ It ’s a way to get them science literate . ”
Why would a veteran professor go through all of that trouble "
Because he , like many scientists across the United States , is worried that if science and math education does n’t improve , society will pay the price .
“ All the luxuries we have today , the modern conveniences , are a result of the science research that went on in the ’60s during the space race , ” Efthimiou said .
“ It did n’t just happen .
It took people doing hard science to do it . ”
The paper , “ Hollywood Blockbusters : Unlimited Fun but Limited Science Literary , ” is a direct product of the class he ’s been teaching for five years .
It ’s loaded with physics , algebra and humor .
But the message is clear .
It ’s time to get serious about science education .
Efthimiou , who has a doctorate from Cornell University , enjoys a good movie .
But he said we should be as eager to get a good science education as we are to see the next big blockbuster .

If you ’re a programmer , you know the difference between a beginner and a master is the ability to write succinct code that does a great deal with very little work .
If you can do this , you can easily raise your productivity and the quality of your work by an order of magnitude .
Much more importantly , you can have a lot more fun writing code .
Read on to learn how .
Imagine writing a program with a tenth the code you currently use , ending up with ten times the features , getting fewer bugs , improving performance , and lowering maintenance costs .
And imagine taking the tedious , repetitive work out , leaving you more time for inspiration and insight .
I ’ve spent my career doing that in many languages , more and more effectively with each new language I learn .
I ’m going to use Perl to demonstrate some techniques to accomplish these goals .
Perl is both my first language , and the language in which I ’ve most recently gained some proficiency .
It lends itself well to these types of discussions .
Trick 1 : map and grep
The map built - in function is one of the most useful tools in your toolkit .
map takes a list and applies a code block to every element , returning the list .
You can think of it as stream processing : you push the list in one side and get it back on the other side with some transformation applied .
Inside the code block , you refer to the current element with the traditional $ _ variable .
Here ’s a really simple example : uppercase every element in a list .
my @lamps = qw( perl php python ) ; my @uc_lamps = map { uc ( $_ ) } @lamps ; # Result : PERL PHP PYTHON
I just shoved the list in the right side , and it travelled right to left until finally it popped out on the left side and got assigned into @uc_lamps .
You can do a lot more with map , though .
In fact , it ’s pretty much infinitely powerful when it comes to transforming lists .
It ’s really just a glorified loop , but if you think of it as a transformation from input to output , you can really make some elegant code with it .
Here ’s another example — make a key - value hash out of a delimited string :
my $ input = " a: 1 , b:2, d:3 " ; my % output = map { split ( /:/ , $ _ ) } split ( / , / , $ input ) ;
Do you see how that works ?
As before , start at the right .
The split function splits the incoming string on the , character , and outputs a list .
This list goes into the map block , which splits each element into key and value .
This gets assigned to the hash .
That ’s a heck of a lot easier than writing loops , and once you are familiar with it , much easier to read , too .
It ’s also unsafe code .
Here ’s why : it does n’t check for an odd number of elements in the resulting list , which could happen with input that ’s not delimited as expected , like this :
my $ input = " a1 , b:2 , d:3,e: f:g " ; my % output = map { split ( /:/ , $ _ ) } split ( / , / , $ input ) ;
Assigning an odd number of list elements to a hash breaks the association between keys and values .
You should always be saying “ use warnings FATAL => ‘ all ’ ” to catch this , but it ’s better to fix the broken code than to make it throw an error .
This is a perfect opportunity for another list - oriented construct , grep , which takes a list on the right - hand - side and outputs every element that passes a certain test .
Let ’s add a test for splittability , split only into two elements , and re-align the code for readability :
my $ input = " a1 , b:2, d:3 " ; my % output = map { split ( /:/ , $ _ , 2 ) } grep { m/:/ } split ( / , / , $ input ) ;
Now only the valid elements make it into the hash .
Trick 2 : implement defaults with ||=
One of the most annoying and tedious things you have to do as a programmer is check your inputs .
Let ’s just say you ’re doing really basic checking to make sure you even have the input you ’re expecting , and if you do n’t , you ’re going to fill it in with defaults .
How do you do this ?
In most languages , you do it with the equivalent of this Perl code :
sub some_func { my ( $ a , $b , $ c ) = @_ ; if ( ! $ a ) { $ a = 5 ; } # Real code here }
Any experienced programmer knows these one - line if statements tend to take up a lot of code .
In fact , they are veritable screen hogs , with a lower substance - to - lines ratio than most other programming constructs .
Your screen fills with code that does nothing much functional , leaving you less space to see the real code , and less brain - power to think about it too .
What can you do to fix this ?
In Perl , you can use the ||= operator .
Its precedence rules are such that it ’ll only do an assignment if the value is false ( ‘ false ’ generally means zero , undefined , or the empty string ) :
$ a ||= 5 ;
“ But wait just a dang minute ! ” you say .
There are a bunch of other ways to do this , such as these :
$ a = $ a || 5 ; $ a = 5 unless $ a ;
( Rhetorical question : how many other languages even have these alternatives ? )
So what ’s so great about the ||= stuff , if there are so many other good ways to do things ?
Well , I ’ve only shown you one place you can put ||= to work .
There are a million .
Like map , once you start using it , you ca n’t stop .
You can use it for caches , for example :
my % cache ; sub expensive_operation { my ( $ key ) = @_ ; $ cache{$key} ||= get_from_database ( $key ) ; return $ cache{$key} ; }
In this example , getting something from the database is really expensive , so you want to cache it for future calls .
The function uses ||= to check the cache and fetch from the database only if the desired value is n’t already cached .
This is so idiomatic in Perl , it ’s actually called “ the Orcish maneuver ” ( for or cache ) .
But as I said , it ’s not the only thing you can do .
You can use ||= for sorting on multiple keys , changing light bulbs , and generally achieving world peace .
( Another rhetorical question : why is Visual Basic code so slow to write , so hard to understand , and so verbose ?
Hint : think about the lack of early termination in If statements .
||= is analogous to early termination . )
Trick 3 : hash and array slices
Have you ever passed around hashes and arrays and wanted to extract only certain elements from them ?
Let ’s say you have a subroutine that accepts a hash reference .
Its job is to reverse the query - string parsing I showed you above .
In many languages , you ’d have to loop through the hash ’s keys , concatenating the key and value with & , then concatenating these together with = .
You can use map ( ) and join ( ) to do this much more simply in Perl , like so :
sub make_query_string { my ( $ vals ) = @_ ; return join ( " & " , map { " $ _=$vals - > { $ _} " } keys % $vals ) ; } my %query_params = ( a => 1 , b => 2 , c => 3 , d => 4 , ) ; my $ query_string = make_query_string (\%query_params ) ;
That ’s already a great improvement over looping , especially since doing it with loops requires keeping track of whether you ’re at the first or the last iteration , so you know whether to insert a separator between elements .
But what happens when you have a hash that has more keys and values than you want in the query string ?
This happens a lot .
Coincidentally , my boss and I were pair programming today and needed to do this exact thing ( maybe that ’s why it ’s so fresh in my mind ) .
The most obvious thing to do is build a new hash with only the keys you want , and send that hash to the subroutine :
my @desired = qw(a c ) ; my % new_params ; foreach my $ key ( @desired ) { $ new_params { $ key} = $ query_params { $key} ; } my $ query_string = make_query_string (\%new_params ) ;
Ooooh , that ’s ugly .
We can at least use map to get rid of the loop while building the new hash :
my %new_params = map { $ _ => $ query_params {$_} } @desired ;
A hash slice is still better , though .
It essentially does what that map does , but it ’s easier and clearer :
my %new_params ; @new_params{@desired} = @query_params{@desired} ;
I just read a slice of the values from % query_params on the right , and assigned them into another slice with the same keys on the left .
Here ’s the whole thing , rewritten :
sub make_query_string { my ( $ vals ) = @_ ; return join ( " & " , map { " $ _=$vals - > { $ _} " } keys % $vals ) ; } my %query_params = ( a => 1 , b => 2 , c => 3 , d => 4 , ) ; my @desired = qw(a c ) ; my %new_params ; @new_params{@desired} = @query_params{@desired} ; my $ query_string = make_query_string (\%new_params ) ; print " $query_string
" ;
Though this is a somewhat contrived example in this article , in real life it ’s the furthest thing from contrived .
When you write code at a high level of abstraction , many of your subroutines will just receive a hash of this and a list of that , and be expected to “ do the right thing ” without a lot of fuss .
Hash slices make this a lot easier .
Array slices are a related concept .
You access a subset of the array elements as an entire list by simply defining the indexes you want :
my @letters = qw( a b c d e f ) ; my @slice = @letters [ 1 , 4 , 3 ] ; # @slice is now b , e , d @slice = @letters [ 0..3 , 4 ] ; # @slice is now a , b , c , d , f
Trick 4 : executable regular expressions
If you ’ve programmed in Perl , you ’ve used regular expressions .
Perl ’s regular expressions are so powerful , Perl really redefined what it means to process text with a programming language , and regular expressions in most other languages owe a lot to Perl .
But even other languages that implement Perl - compatible regular expressions may not implement some of Perl ’s features , because in Perl , regular expressions are an integral part of the language .
One example is the ability to execute the result of a match as code , with the /e modifier at the end of a substitution .
Here ’s a real - world example .
Let ’s search a MySQL foreign key definition for column names and reorder them alphabetically , all in place :
my $ fk = " FOREIGN KEY ( `seq` , `name` ) REFERENCES `tbl` ( `seq` , `name` ) " ; $ fk =~ s# ( ? <=\ ( ) ( [ ^\ ) ] + ) ( ?=\ ) ) # join ( ' , ' , sort ( split ( / , / , $ 1 ) ) ) #ge ; # $ fk is now " FOREIGN KEY ( `name` , `seq` ) REFERENCES `tbl` ( `name` , `seq` ) " ;
If you want to know how that works , read my earlier post about a duplicate index and foreign key checker for MySQL .
If you ’re like me five years ago , you might think that ’s scary as hell at first .
“ Execute arbitrary text as though it ’s Perl code !?!?
What moron thought up that security exploit waiting to happen and made it part of the language ?!?!? ”
Wait a minute , though .
Is it really insecure to match some text and execute it ?
No , it ’s not .
In fact , text you ’ve matched with a regular expression is likely to be far better checked , just by the fact that you ’ve specified what it has to look like , than most other input to your program .
This is much more true than you think .
In fact , one of the very safest ways to check any input to your program is by pattern matching .
This is such a powerful way to validate input , it ’s the main way to untaint data when you ’re running in taint mode .
This is from the perlsec man page :
Values may be untainted by using them as keys in a hash ; otherwise the only way to bypass the tainting mechanism is by referencing subpatterns from a regular expression match .
Perl presumes that if you reference a substring using $ 1 , $ 2 , etc. , that you knew what you were doing when you wrote the pattern .
I wo n’t go any further into why it ’s inherently safe to use the executable - regular - expression feature , but if you ’re not convinced , talk to an experienced programmer about it .
I do want to convince you this is incredibly powerful .
My example above implements this pseudo - code :
search text for a string of column names for each string , split it around the delimiters sort it join it back together around the delimiters substitute it back into the original string done
You can write any valid Perl code on the right - hand side .
Probably the clearest thing to do is just call a subroutine with the captured text , and do the work there , instead of inlining it all .
Here ’s my example rewritten with a subroutine , and reformatted with the /x modifier :
sub split_sort_join { my ( $ text ) = @_ ; return join ( ' , ' , sort ( split ( / , / , $ text ) ) ) ; } $ fk =~ s/ (?<=\( ) #
Find an opening paren ( [ ^\ ) ] + ) #
Find everything inside parens ( ?=\ ) ) # Find a closing paren / split_sort_join ( $1 ) # Call split_sort_join on the match / gex ;
You can imagine how useful this is if your desired substition is not hard - coded into the right - hand - side of the substitution , too .
For example , you could pass a callback function to a subroutine , and use that instead :
sub process_column_names { my ( $ fk , $ callback ) = @_ ; $ fk =~ s/ (?<=\( ) #
Find an opening paren ( [ ^\ ) ] + ) #
Find everything inside parens ( ?=\ ) ) #
Find a closing paren / $ callback ->( $ 1 ) # Call $ callback on the match / gex ; return $ fk ; } print process_column_names ( " FOREIGN KEY ( `seq` , `name` ) REFERENCES `tbl` ( `seq` , `name` ) " , \&split_sort_join ) , "
" ;
If you ’re not a Perl wizard , your head is probably spinning at this point , so I ’ll ease off , even though I ’m thinking of several other things I want to write about this .
Here ’s the take - away : it ’s safe .
It ’s powerful .
Use it .
Once you learn it , you ’ll be a much more capable programmer .
Trick 5 : dispatch tables of coderefs
Newcomers to Perl often wonder where the switch statement is .
If you really , really want to write something that looks like a case or switch block , you ’re a lost soul , but okay , man perlfaq7 .
And before you go there , since I know you ’re a lost soul , I ’ll give you this ticket to get a slightly cooler room in you - know - where : basically anything you ’ll ever want to do is explained in the Perl manual pages .
Start with man perlfaq and go from there .
Even if I ca n’t convert you away from switch , perhaps I ’ve made a difference by pointing you towards these man pages .
Fare thee well !
I hardly knew ye , gentle reader …
If you ’re still reading , you ’re one of the ones walking the narrow path that leads to victory .
Good !
Let ’s talk about how to execute some code branch depending on the value of a variable .
My favorite technique for this is to use a dispatch table of coderefs — references to subroutines .
This is a succinct way to dispatch execution to somewhere or other in your program , without the mess and tedious coding you get with switch statements .
Believe me , if you ’ve ever tried to maintain someone else ’s switch of any size , you ’re going to appreciate this .
Let ’s say we have a hypothetical interactive program that waits for you to press a key and then does some function .
Okay , I lied .
It ’s not hypothetical .
I use this technique extensively in innotop .
Innotop has many dozens of key mappings , and they are mapped to different things depending on what mode you ’re in .
“ You pressed c ?
Oh wait , let me scroll through my big honkin ’ switch statement and see what that does … hang on , I ’m getting there … ca n’t find it … oh , you were in that mode !
No wonder .
Well , let me look at the switch statement for that mode , then … ”
Can you imagine ?
There ’s no way I ’d have added so many features to innotop if it were this much of a pain to write , debug and understand .
It does n’t really matter that I wrote it — six months from now , I wo n’t have a clue what all that code is doing .
But I will be able to figure out what a keypress does , because I used a dispatch table .
What exactly is a dispatch table ?
It ’s a hash of references to executable code .
Let ’s make a simple example : a program that has just two modes , display_a and display_b .
Each of these is handled by a subroutine of the same name .
Here is a complete program that ’ll loop forever until you press ' q ' :
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings FATAL => ' all ' ; use Term : : ReadKey ; sub display_a { print " I am in display_a
" ; } sub display_b { print " I am in display_b
" ; } my $ dispatch_for = { a => \&display_a , b => \&display_b , q => sub { ReadMode ( ' normal ' ) ; exit( 0 ) } , } ; while ( 1 ) { print " Press a key !
" ; ReadMode ( ' cbreak ' ) ; my $ char = ReadKey ( 10 ) ; defined $ dispatch_for ->{$ char} && $ dispatch_for ->{$char} - >( ) ; }
Innotop has tons of such dispatch tables .
They ’re so simple to use ; you just look to see if there ’s an entry for whatever your input is , and if so , you call that to do the work .
It can be an anonymous subroutine , such as the anonymous ‘ quit ’ subroutine in the example , or it can be a reference to a named subroutine .
If you want a ‘ default ’ entry , you can do that easily , too :
my $ dispatch_for = { a => \&display_a , b => \&display_b , q => sub { ReadMode ( ' normal ' ) ; exit(0 ) } , DEFAULT => sub { print " That key does nothing
" ; } , } ; # Later my $ func = $ dispatch_for ->{$ char} || $ dispatch_for ->{DEFAULT} ; $ func ->( ) ;
This is much , much simpler than writing switch statements , nested if / else / else if statements , or many other common programming constructs .
What am I getting at ?
There is something common to all five of the tricks I listed .
It ’s somewhat arbitrary that I listed five ( I wanted to keep the article small enough to digest ) , and it ’s a bit arbitrary which five I chose , because I have many more ideas , but can you see the thread running through them ?
It ’s elimination of repetition .
Whether it ’s repetitive typing , or coding constructs that obviously iterate over something , I ’m trying to show you ways to a ) avoid writing the same code over and over b ) avoid reading code that does the same thing over and over .
Why ?
Because repetition kills brain cells .
When you ’re typing nearly the same loop or copy - pasting nearly the same code , your brain is not engaged and productive .
You had a moment of insight about how to do something .
In a flash , you saw the way to the end product .
Now you have to write the code to implement it .
Let ’s just pretend that takes an hour ( on a good day ) , and you follow it with another insight , and so on , and so on .
You only had eight interested , stimulated , excited moments in the whole work day ?
Shoot yourself now and get it over with !
By the same token , when you ’re reading code , you have to follow the program ’s logic to understand it .
When most programmers study a for loop , I ’d bet money they mentally “ execute the loop , ” starting at the beginning and ending at the end , to understand the start , middle and end of the loop .
Every careful coder I ’ve known does this , at least sometimes , because it ’s how you understand what the computer is doing .
Mentally executing loops is incredibly draining .
It ’s just as bad as typing loops !
The reality is probably even worse , because you ’re doing both at the same time .
As soon as you type a loop , you ’re immediately reading it .
Reading it .
Reading it .
As soon as you type — Reading it .
As — Reading it .
As soon as you — as soon as you type — type — Reading it .
I ’m not making this up .
Studies show this is how people read any type of written material , on screen or off .
In fact , one of the most important and difficult techniques to master in speed reading is to stop re-reading things you ’ve just read .
I ’m doing it right now as I write this , backtracking and editing my writing ( sometimes I type with my eyes closed so I can escape this trap more easily ) .
The combination of writing and reading iterative code is tedious and boring , and if you ’re like me , you have a curious and lively mind , and you hate “ tedious and boring . ”
That ’s why I love writing code that does n’t force me to circle like a tiger pacing a cage .
There ’s another common thread to everything I wrote , too .
I ’m showing you ways to code in a more declarative style .
This is subtle , but after you code in this style for a little while , you ’ll come to understand it : it ’s not a procedural programming style .
It ’s declarative , where you say what to do instead of how .
It feels much more like writing a specification of the program ’s desired behavior , instead of writing how to accomplish that behavior .
And when you go back to the code later and read it , or maintain someone else ’s code , you appreciate that even more .
The program really does become a spec instead of just an implementation .
It ’s not that obvious at first , or with small programs , but take my word for it , it ’s true .
Back to that moment of insight : what if , at the point of inspiration , you could just say “ okay computer , do what I want , and you figure out how to do it . ”
That ’s declarative .
Really , once you had the inspiration that showed you the way to solve the problem , you did n’t need to write down the code , did you ?
You understood everything in that moment , and the rest was just tedium .
Writing declaratively helps you get through the tedium that much faster .
The map function is declarative because you specify a transformation and let Perl map it onto each element of a list .
function is declarative because you specify a transformation and let Perl map it onto each element of a list .
Hash and array slices are declarative because you specify what elements you want to read or assign , and let Perl figure out how .
||= is declarative because you let Perl figure out whether the value exists , and whether to fetch a new one if it does n’t .
is declarative because you let Perl figure out whether the value exists , and whether to fetch a new one if it does n’t .
Executable regular expressions are declarative because you just write a specification ( pattern ) of what you want to transform , and provide the transformation , and let Perl figure out how to do it .
Dispatch tables are declarative because you specify a mapping between some input and some code , and let Perl do the lookup and dispatch .
You can apply these techniques , one way or another , to any programming language .
Another great example is the Behaviour JavaScript library , and the techniques it encourages .
Or my own JavaScript date formatting and parsing library , which are not only clearer and simpler to use than their alternatives , but much more powerful and waaaay more efficient .
Historically JavaScript compatibility has been a major problem for web developers .
Variations between the official spec , the de-facto standard , and the various implementations have kept many a developer up all night .
The end result is that many web pages do n't work equally well , or at all , across browsers .
Microsoft 's JScript team , keenly aware that they are part of the problem , write :
The point is that JavaScript developers should n’t have to detect and workaround such issues .
JavaScript should work the same across all implementations .
We believe this is the first step in making JavaScript better .
To make it possible to achieve such implementation conformance , the first step is knowing where the divergences are .
We in the JScript team are looking into where various browser based implementations diverge , where our engine is incorrect in its interpretation of the specification , what if any de facto compatibility conventions have been reached , and the value of codifying such conventions into the standard .
We ’ve published the first draft of JScript Deviations from ES3 as a starting point .
The document 's title , " JScript Deviations from ES3 " , is a bit of a misnomer .
This document covers not only IE , but also the JavaScript implementations found in Firefox , Opera , and Safari .
This is an in - depth study of the spec with a point by point comparison between what is suppose to happen and what actually does , for all four browsers .
Yes .
That is what they call him in Pakistan .
And after these latest statements from the President I 'd have to say they are completely justified .
President Bush yesterday offered his strongest support of embattled Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf , saying the general " has n't crossed the line " and " truly is somebody who believes in democracy . "
Up until now , the Administration 's position has been weak and uncertain .
But these latest statements represent a new low and a dramatic turn .
Essentially signaling that the United States will stand behind Musharraf and against democracy .
This sends a terrible signal to the people of Pakistan , the Muslim world and pretty much the entire international community .
All for a guy , who has n't actually helped the United States achieve any of its strategic goals in Pakistan or the region .
I have to agree with Senator Biden :
" What exactly would it take for the president to conclude Musharraf has crossed the line ?
Suspend the constitution ?
Impose emergency law ?
Beat and jail his political opponents and human rights activists ? " asked Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a presidential candidate .
" He 's already done all that .
If the president sees Musharraf as a democrat , he must be wearing the same glasses he had on when he looked in Vladimir Putin 's soul . "
I 'm sure Shadi will have much more to say on this issue .
Từ gương mặt , kiểu tóc cho tới phong cách ăn mặc , nhiều ngôi sao Hollywood lại giống nhau đến khó tin và thậm chí , có người còn được ví von là bản sao của người kia .
I noticed a long time ago that I get in a funky mood when I do n't have time to exercise for a few days in a row .
For me , there seemed to be a direct correlation between exercise and mood .
Now the science supports that : http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/depression-and-exercise/MH00043
Over the years , I have also noticed my mood turns down in the autumn and winter when there ’s less sun .
Now there ’s evidence to support the link between sunlight ( and its impact on your vitamin D production ) and mood :
http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20040803/vitamin-d-ease-depression
Lately I ’ve been experimenting with carbs and their impact on my mood .
Try eating a bowl of white rice in the middle of the afternoon and see what it does to you .
You ’ll want a nap .
It drains the energy right out of you .
Protein does n’t have that effect .
So now I stay away from the carbs that sap my energy .
That helps my mood too .
I have found that many bad moods are caused by a feeling of not having control .
People can put up with extreme hardship , climbing a mountain for example , if they have the illusion of choosing to do it .
But even a little aggravation can make you nuts if you feel you ca n’t avoid it .
I have a fix for that loss of control problem .
I call it the “ curious robot maneuver . ”
When things are not going your way , sit back and change your frame of mind to one of curiosity .
Imagine you have no free will , and you are just a moist robot .
Everything you have done and will do is programmed .
So there ’s no reason to stress over your lack of control in certain situations because you have the same degree of control in ALL situations : none .
What you do have is the capacity to watch the show , and marvel as it unfolds .
You have front row seats , right behind your own eyeballs , and the theater is surround - sense .
You can actually FEEL the action !
You can take almost any upcoming event in your life , from a vacation to the next day at work , to a relationship , and ask yourself “ What happens next ? ”
It ’s like watching a fascinating TV show that happens to involve your own life .
Curiosity is a huge motivator .
It 's what makes you turn the page in a good book , and sit through a three - hour movie .
You can use it to your advantage in your real life .
I ’d be surprised if this method works for most people , but it might work for some .
It ’s a good way to take you out of your feeling of a loss of control and just imagine reality as something different until you can get some protein and sun and exercise .
I know my readers , and a number of you are already planning to leave a comment saying it is absurd to try and do this curious robot maneuver if you have no free will , because you have no choice whether you do it or not .
But now that I created this post , and you just read it , your programming will be influenced .
For some of you , that might be enough .
Are n't you a little curious whether you will try this technique in the future ?

shave em dry
Posted by dogpossum on July 10 , 2006 5:05 PM in the category music
You are here : Home > shave em dry
This weekend when I was out dancing at a late night party after a big competition night I heard a new version of a song called Shave 'em Dry 2 , a song recorded by a woman called Lucille Bogan in 1935 .
I have a version of the song on a CD I recently purchased called Raunchy Business : Hot Nuts and Lollypops , which is quite poor quality .
But not so poor as to make it impossible to make out these lyrics :
( NB : these are fairly explicit )
I got nipples on my titties , big as the end of my thumb ,
I got somethin ' between my legs'll make a dead man come ,
Oh daddy , baby wo n't you shave 'em dry ?
Aside : Now , draw it out !
Want you to grind me baby , grind me until I cry .
( Roland : Uh , huh . )
Say I fucked all night , and all the night before baby ,
And I feel just like I wanna , fuck some more ,
Oh great God daddy ,
( Roland : Say you gonna get it .
You need it . )
Grind me honey and shave me dry ,
And when you hear me holler baby , want you to shave it dry .
I got nipples on my titties , big as the end of my thumb ,
Daddy you say that 's the kind of 'em you want , and you can make 'em come ,
Oh , daddy shave me dry ,
( Roland : She ai n't gonna work for it . )
And I 'll give you somethin ' baby , swear it 'll make you cry .
I 'm gon ' turn back my mattress , and let you oil my springs ,
I want you to grind me daddy , ' til the bell do ring ,
Oh daddy , want you to shave 'em dry ,
Oh great God daddy , if you can't shave 'em baby wo n't you try ?
Now if fuckin ' was the thing , that would take me to heaven ,
I 'd be fuckin ' in the studio , till the clock strike eleven ,
Oh daddy , daddy shave 'em dry ,
I would fuck you baby , honey I 'd make you cry .
Now your nuts hang down like a damn bell sapper ,
And your dick stands up like a steeple ,
Your goddam ass - hole stands open like a church door ,
And the crabs walks in like people .
Aside : Ow , shit !
( Roland : Aah , sure enough , shave 'em dry ? )
Aside : Ooh !
Baby , wo n't you shave 'em dry
A big sow gets fat from eatin ' corn ,
And a pig gets fat from suckin' ,
Reason you see this whore , fat like I am ,
Great God , I got fat from fuckin' .
Aside : Eeeeh !
Shave 'em dry
( Roland : Aah , shake it , do n't break it )
My back is made of whalebone ,
And my cock is made of brass ,
And my fuckin ' is made for workin ' men's two dollars ,
Great God , round to kiss my ass .
Aside : Oh !
Whoo , daddy , shave 'em dry
As you can see , there are no punches pulled here .
Any lindy hopper who pays attention knows that a fairly large proportion of jazz from the 20s and 30s in particular is decidedly saucy .
Yet most of the sauce is veiled in innuendo or so reworked by the delivery it 's largely unrecognisable .
As an example , the song ' Hold Tight ' begins " I want some seafood , mamma ... " later continues with the lyric " when I come home from work at night , I get my favourite dish - fish ! " and has the chorus " hold tight , hold tight ... I want some seafood mamma ! "
When Fats Waller sings the song , you 're well aware that this is not a song about culinary preferences .
When the Andrews Sisters sang it , though , the song became a little more ambiguous .
I 'm a fan of this sort of blues and jazz , more for the playfulness and irreverence than any naughty pleasure .
I like the way sexuality and sensuality are satired , and we 're encouraged to laugh along .
When it comes to blues dancing , which is frequently explicitly sensual , I like the edge a little humour lends to the dance , resolving the sexaul tension with humour .
Yet when I heard the new version of Bogan 's song was played at the party the other night , my response was a little different .
To begin with , it 's worth pointing out the recording is live ( or apparently so ) , to an enthusiastic audience who cheer along .
The singer is a woman , and the lyrics are very clear .
I 've heard this song played a few times before , first by a woman DJ , and always in Melbourne .
The crowd 's response was initially surprise and a little shock .
By the time it was played at this late night party , however , many dancers were familiar with the song , and both the uninitiated and familiar ears responded with enthusiastic cheering and laughing .
It 's also worth pointing out that late night parties are frequently more casual , more relaxed and social than more formal dances or competition events .
Despite the enthusiastic response for the song this weekend , I was left wondering if it was entirely appropriate to play the song at that moment .
I think I would have left it a little later , when the room had thinned a little , and only the hardcore dancers were left .
I saw a few people clearly offended by the lyrics .
Particularly since the partner dancing encourages dancers to share their interpretation of the song in that moment , on the dance floor .
My own response , however , was to giggle and take more than a little delight in the obvious pleasure the vocalist takes in the lyric , melody and shouted chorus .
I have n't the time here , but I would like to write a little about the way contemporary swing dancers use archival music and dance for self expression in social contexts .
And to perhaps comment on the way race and ethnicity are played out in these settings .
So perhaps this post is really just to pose the question : how are swing dancers using seventy or eighty year old dances and songs for self expression , social commentary and communal creative work ?
And why

Adil Najam
As I wrote yesterday , the emergency declared by Gen. Musharraf is deeply disturbing , but not really surprising .
The horrendous political situation that Gen. Musharraf described in his ‘ Emergency ’ speech is , in fact , true .
Extremism and violence has gone out of hand .
Society is deeply divided .
Religion has been high - jacked and is now routinely used to incite violence .
The writ of the government is being trampled .
Politicians have failed and people do seek recourse in the judiciary .
People are frustrated and deeply disturbed .
We have been writing and discussing all of this and more on this blog repeatedly .
We cannot , therefore , deny what is obvious .
However , none of this is a justification for a suspension of the Constitution and for the declaration of emergency .
In fact , all this is damning evidence of government failure .
A suspension of the constitution will not and cannot resolve any of these issues .
It is more likely to – and has already – made each of these situations even worse .
We had written recently that Gen. Musharraf is now operating on a ‘ Karr lo jo karna hai ‘ philosophy … “ do whatever you will , I am here to stay and will do whatever it takes . ”
Right now he seems to believe that an Emergency is what “ it will take . ”
Maybe so .
Maybe it will buy him a little more time to hold on to power .
But , for how long ?
And , at what cost ?
We have also written before that Pakistan is a democratic society trapped inside an undemocratic state and that we are living through Pakistan ’s moment of democratic struggle .
Perversely , the events of the last days have again proved this thesis .
The reason that Gen. Musharraf has to apply increasingly more draconian measures to hold on to power is precisely because society is progressively unprepared to maintain a patently undemocratic order .
This is precisely why the targets of this current action are the two forces that have emerged as the most vibrant and important custodians of the nation ’s democratic spirit : the judiciary and the media .
With politicians , who seem far less interested in real democracy , you can always cut deals ; less so , it seems , with the spirit of justice and free speech !
What will happen in the next few weeks ?
Probably , they will get worse .
Just how much worse things might become , and how , will depend on what happens in the next few hours .
Benazir Bhutto is back in Pakistan , but seems mysteriously silent ; or at least cautious .
Word is that she will speak to the Presidency soon .
What comes out of this will be important .
Whether the gag on the media will be permanent or not will also matter .
And if it is lifted , how will the media ‘ behave ’ ?
The street reaction today ( Monday ) , especially of the legal fraternity will be another key indicator .
As always in this beloved client state of ours , the reactions from Europe and Washington – including on aid continuation – will also have an effect .
But ultimately , it is really about whether the democratic spirit of the Pakistani populace will be broken or not .
I suspect – I hope – it will not .
To go back to the beginning of this post .
The events of the last two days are disturbing , but not surprising .
A review of some of the posts on this blog posted over the last year or so , shows why .
The depiction below not only provides one blogs - view of a chronology of a political meltdown , it also highlights the various dimensions of the downward spiral that Pakistani politics has been slipping down on .
Without any further commentary , let me just list a few of these posts .

Ecstasy approved for medical study
Dr. Michael Mithoefer
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A South Carolina psychiatrist said Wednesday he will immediately start recruiting patients after winning approval to conduct the first study testing MDMA -- better known as ecstasy -- as a therapeutic tool .
Dr. Michael Mithoefer plans to conduct psychotherapy sessions with 20 women who suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder due to sexual assaults or other violence , and who have n't been helped by other treatment .
Twelve of the women will receive MDMA prior to the sessions while eight will be given a placebo .
The Food and Drug Administration approved Mithoefer 's protocol in 2001 , but it took another two years to find an institutional review board willing to sanction the study , which is a required step when dealing with human research subjects .
Mithoefer 's research required approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration because MDMA is a Schedule I drug .
It 's grouped with drugs like heroin , cocaine and LSD , all considered to have no medical use .
Bill Grant , a spokesman for the DEA , said the final approval came Tuesday night .
Mithoefer says he works with post - traumatic stress disorder patients all the time and he 's excited about the possibility of finding a better treatment for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffer from the sometimes debilitating disorder .
" We owe it to them , " he said .
" It would be irresponsible for the medical community not to investigate something like this . "
At the same time , he warns that using MDMA in an uncontrolled setting can be very dangerous .
" It 's really important for people to realize the fact that we have permission to do this study and we can do it safely in this setting , " he said .
Also , the fact that he 's received permission for the study , he said , " does not mean that you can use ecstasy safely and anywhere . "
MDMA was first invented in 1912 but largely ignored until young people made it a recreational drug starting in the late 1970s .
Psychiatrists quickly became aware of its unusual properties , and several dozen experimented by giving MDMA to patients -- including people suffering post - traumatic stress disorder -- and others with intense anxiety after receiving diagnoses of terminal cancer .
One of those patients from the early 1980s is an artist now living in the western United States , who spoke with CNN .
She did not want her name used .
After being raped and beaten at age 17 , the woman suffered severe panic attacks for eight years , leading to three hospitalizations before being treated with MDMA .
Before those sessions , she said her trauma was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia , severe depression and bipolar disorder .
" MDMA allowed me , for the first time , to sit with the details of the event , and separate them from what was happening in the present , " she told CNN .
" I was able to relax my body .
I was able to say , ' this is not happening to you right now . ' "
Suicidal at the time , she said the treatment may have saved her life .
" There might have been another way , but the way that I see it is that I probably would have died , " she said .
" When someone is traumatized , walls form around trauma -- like a scar -- and it's hard to get someone to open up and talk about it , " explains Dr. Julie Holland of New York University , author of " Ecstasy : A Complete Guide . "
" What 's unique about MDMA is that it 's actually stimulating but decreases anxiety , " Holland told CNN .
" It could help people feel calm and comfortable enough to explore painful things that are hard to talk about . "
" A good analogy is that it would give psychiatry something akin to anesthesia during therapy , " she said .
" And unlike anesthesia , your memory is completely intact , but even enhanced .
You remember the trauma very clearly , but are comfortable enough to talk about it . "
" Because it anesthetizes the patient to some extent , " Holland said , " you can get to that malignant core in one or two sessions instead of three or four years . "
But Dr. Scott Lillienfeld , a psychiatrist at Emory University who has studied post - traumatic stress disorder , said that hypothesis is " at the least , muddled . "
Lillienfeld said effective treatment actually requires the patient to face their trauma head - on .
" If you 're calm , you 're not getting at the root of the problem , " said Lillienfeld .
He also said Mithoefer 's study has methodological problems .
" There 's no real placebo , " he said .
" Everyone will know who 's on the drugs .
What I wonder is , instead of a placebo , why are n't they giving a drug that mimics the physical effects ? "
Mithoefer said all participants will have to undergo psychiatric screening and a physical exam to ensure they do n't have any physical risk factors .
Ecstasy , a strong stimulant , is thought to be particularly dangerous to people with high blood pressure .
It also has been known to cause dangerous overheating in people who take it and then exercise or dance for a long period of time .
Patients in this clinical trial will be given the drug only one or two times .
They will be under a doctor 's supervision for the entire time they are under the drug 's influence .
Mithoefer said he hopes to begin the actual therapy sessions next month .

This book helps the student complete the transition from purely manipulative to rigorous mathematics .
The clear exposition covers many topics that are assumed by later courses but are often not covered with any depth or organization : basic set theory , induction , quantifiers , functions and relations , equivalence relations , properties of the real numbers ( including consequences of the completeness axiom ) , fields , and basic properties of n-dimensional Euclidean spaces .
The many exercises and optional topics ( isomorphism of complete ordered fields , construction of the real numbers through Dedekind cuts , introduction to normed linear spaces , etc. ) allow the instructor to adapt this book to many environments and levels of students .
Extensive hypertextual cross-references and hyperlinked indexes of terms and notation add truly interactive elements to the text .

Spoon bending is a hot topic and a reader , Shannan Rohde , has written in the previous article about bending spoons ,
How to bend a spoon using your mind , about his spoon bending experience .
Many other readers asked him to provide the pictures and detailed instructions .
Below are his instructions plus some pictures of him and the bent spoon .
Everyone is encouraged to try .
If you succeed please send your mail and photos to me and I will post your success stories and photos on this website as well .
Your age should not have anything to do with it actually .
I will give you a step by step on how I did it and hopefully , you should be able too as well .
I am 36 years old , but I have been “ Sensitive since I can remember ” .
The steps to bend a spoon :
Updated :
All the crowd from Randi ’s site .
What ’s your reaction to the post about JREF ’s prize at About the James Randi Million dollar challenge
Update2 : There ’s now a video of Shannan doing the bending .
See it at Spoon bending video
Go to your drawer and pick out 10 or so spoons .
And lay them out on the table .
Use your feeling and let them tell you which spoon will bend .
( I know it sounds funny but this is what I did the first time ) .
When you feel you have the right spoon and mind you pick one that is fairly thin to start out with .
Hold the spoon vertical and look at it and ask it to bend .
Or say you will bend for me .
Really believe it .
Start your meditation .
Breathe in and breathe out .
Breathe in energy from the universe and imagine it as a golden ball above your head .
Breathe out negative feelings and put the recycled air into your solar plexus .
( The energy ) Keep doing this for about 15 breaths while massaging the spoon just below the bowl of it .
Make yourself lightheaded while really concentrating on your breathing and producing energy and thinking the spoon will bend .
Then at the point of when you feel you ’re ready with all thoughts clear except the spoon get ready
Look at the spoon for about 2 seconds and think you will bend for me , while still breathing , breathe faster and hype yourself up .
Look out the window or at something for about 1 second and start to bend the spoon , and say very loud BEND !
BEND !
BEND ! ( really get into it ) you will notice that the spoon becomes like rubber .
Your spoon will feel like rubber and it will bend for you .
After you have bent the spoon around two or three times , lay it down and wait about 1 min .
the spoon will harden again .
I have noticed that the more people that are around you the collective energy will help you get there more .
Make a lot of noise laugh I did this the other day and it was my fifth spoon and it felt like rubber .
Have them touch the spoon before bending it .
You have to believe the spoon will bend .
Tell yourself you have done this a million times already .
After you have a spoon bent , keep it around you and whenever you have doubt look at it and remember that you did this and you can do this again .
You will bend the spoon , I promise .
The photos I have enclosed it of my fourth spoon bending .
And yes there is a little physical force behind it , but not enough to bend it like the photos I send you .
You will do this .
I promise and it does take practice .
The secret is in the meditation .
You are transferring energy to the spoon and making it apart of you , like bending your finger .
None of these photos was photoshopped except to reduce the size to 640 by 480 .
Thank you ,
Shannan D. Rohde

“ Medium in Training ”
Shannan has also sent some photos and a description of them .
First , some photos of the bent spoon .
Notice how it is twisted three times .
Now , some photos of Shannan bending the spoons .
His wife has photographed them .
The photos have some anomalies in them .
Shannan has 2 possible cause for them :
That the camera had flaws in it That what you see is the energy ( psychic or Metaphysical )
Look closely at the this one and you can see the energy start to spark on the spoon , it is reddish .
Shannan believes this to be a 4d multi-dimension capture .
The photo of him on the right is not torquing the spoon but him intensely saying BEND !
BEND !
BEND !

THE RECORD companies , seeking to bully people who share music , have demanded that colleges identify students who share ( " Record firms crack down on campuses , " Business , March 8 ) .
They use smear terms such as " piracy " and " theft " that imply sharing is wrong .
Do n't believe it .
Sharing is friendship ; to attack sharing is to attack the basis of society .
Today 's legal music downloads are not an acceptable option , since they carry Digital Restrictions Management ( called Digital Rights Management by its proponents ) to restrict what people do with the files they have " bought . "
Therefore , as founder of the free software movement , I support the boycott of these products .
The real solution is to legalize sharing .
This wo n't affect the record companies much , but if they did go out of business , we could rejoice that they can no longer threaten anyone .
They pay zero cents of your CD purchase price to musicians ( except for superstars ) , so the absence of these companies would be no loss to society .
For the short term , colleges should make sure they do not collect information that could be used to identify students who share .

History of LOLCats
November 11 , 2007 at 1:00 am thinkingshift
Oh no …. just like some posts I did on aliens ( which I did largely to distract myself from fretting over the loss of personal liberties in contemporary society ) , I amused myself this week by delving into LOLCats .
Love those kitties .
A total waste of time , but there ’s no doubt that LOLCats have created an online subculture .
Good news is this subculture is all about cute , furry animals ; bad news is LOLCats will most certainly cause an infectious case of bad grammar .
So Thinking
Shift reader , Pippy H , has asked me to give a run-down of the history of LOLCats .
I started this post by uttering “ Oh no ” because ( as with the posts on aliens ) , I seem to have attracted a whole host of new readers who are LOLCat obsessed .
Oh well , I ’ll just add these new readers to all my other readers who are obsessed , like me , about privacy and surveillance issues ( along with aliens ) .
Back to LOLCats : I am no expert on the history of these cute kitties , so I needed to do a spot of research .
And I also decided to apply some knowledge management techniques to LOLCats by checking out some of the archetypes .
But first to the history and if you know of any further or different historical details – leave a comment .
It seems that LOLCats is a surprisingly new phenomenon starting in January 2007 .
And an out of work software developer from Hawaii , Eric Nakagawa , seems to be the culprit .
After reading about how LOLCats reached the proverbial tipping point of popularity , I suddenly became pretty jealous of Mr Nakagawa !
He found a photo of a chubby , smiling cat on the Internet .
The photo had the caption “ I can has cheezburger ? ” .
He thought it pretty funny .
I ’ve tracked the photo he found and here it is .
And this is why Mr Nakagawa is one clever dude because I would have thought “ stupid person ca n’t spell and cats do n’t eat cheeseburgers ” and I would have moved on .
Mr One Clever Dude did n’t do that .
Nope , he created a website with images of cute cats with silly captions written in baby - style talk , which is now known as kitty pidgin .
I guess when you ’re out of work , this sort of activity keeps your mind active .
He called the site I Can Has Cheezburger ( the lawyer in me asks : would n’t the dude with the original photo and caption be ready to sue Mr Nakagawa for using the caption and idea ??? ) .
Anyway , Mr Nakagawa runs the website with his partner , Tofuburger ( she refuses to reveal her name ) , and they found that by May 2007 , the site was getting 1.5 million hits during the month ( I can only dream of reaching this number of visitors … mmmm where ’s that cat photo I took the other day ??! ) .
The idea is pretty simple : you snap a digital image of kitty .
Add some excruciatingly bad grammar so it looks like the cat is uttering words of wisdom .
Submit to the site where images are screened for originality .
And hope that your image gets rated on a scale of one to five cheeseburgers ( yep , really ) .
So if like me , you ’re concerned about privacy issues , you can have kitty say :
So the time between launching the site to a critical mass of users seems to be pretty quick .
And just like a good community of practice , I Can Has Cheezburger is sustained and self - organised by its users who create content and add comments .
Now , if you are in the sorry state of having no cat of your own , do n’t despair you can still join in the fun .
Mr N has thoughtfully built a tool called LOLCat Builder and you can select a photo of a cute kitty and generate an appallingly bad caption , which is then submitted and approved ( at least I think this is how it works ) .
I decided to apply some serious KM techniques to my study of LOLCats .
What are the major archetypes ?
I believe I can break them down into the following :
Schrodinger ’s
Cat – just like the famed kitty of quantum mechanics , there seems to be a Schrodinger ’s Cat archetype popping up .
another feline archetype seems to be fat , grumpy kitty :
then we have the theatrical archetype :
That last image has me a bit worried about cat abuse – check out the legs and tail !
and then there seems to be something going on with computers and refrigerators – this could be a variation of the Schrodinger ’s Cat archetype :
That last image is a personal favourite !
We have the alien LOLCat archetype :
And finally , the Something is Invisible archetype :
But some serious research uncovered a little known video that may suggest that LOLCats have been around for a very long time , perhaps since Egyptian times .
Here is the video I discovered in a dusty old library – note the interview with an esteemed Egyptologist .
What I have n’t been able to work out yet is why a lot of LOLCats seem to start their sentences with “ Oh Hai ” – perhaps they ’re Scottish cats .
But I ’m guessing it ’s kitty pidgin for “ Oh hi ” .
Ca n’t wait for the first PhD analysing kitty pidgin !
It could be that Anil Dash might be busy analysing kitty pidgin already – check out his blog .
Now , if I was really technical , I ’d load up some images of cats onto a newly created website called : I Can has Knowledgz ?
And I ’d have LOLCats say things like : “ I wantz to shez mai knowledgz ” .
Or : “ Buzz awf , hai aint sharin . ”
Or : “ Oh hai .
Waz this cynefin framzwork aw about ?
I ’z think I ’z stuck in the shadoz of complexity .
” ( With apologies to all LOLCat lovers – I think I just mangled kitty pidgin ) .

A great horse rears amid the flash and boom of bombardment ; careers in terror from the path of an advancing tank ; struggles to free itself from treacherous swirls of barbed wire .
Here are images of man 's exploitation of animals carried to bloody extremity amid the horrors of World War I .
It was bold to set out to depict such scenes on a London stage .
But the National Theatre is enjoying a triumph with its production of Michael Morpurgo 's War Horse , the story of Joey , beloved mount of a Devon farmer 's son , translated into a beast of battle and burden in France .
This is a children 's story in the tradition of Black Beauty , which makes adults sob , too .
The actors play their parts well , but the stars are the horses , larger - than - life wicker creations , modelled with conviction by the Handspring Puppet Company .
The puppeteers and directors Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris have studied and captured every equine movement and gesture .
Each horse has its own personality , cavorting with balletic grace .
The performance , more pantomie than play , displays the spirit of one of the great tragedies of history .
We know that World War I killed some ten million fighting men , almost 800,000 of them British .
Much less known is the fate of a million hapless horses , sent to France between 1914 and 1918 .
Only 62,000 returned .
War Horse offers a glimpse of the experiences that befell them .
Man has been exploiting animals for centuries .
But there is a pathos about the plight of horses conscripted to suffer in conflicts which they , unlike their riders , lack any means of understanding .
Many paintings depict warriors charging into battle with swords held high , wild - eyed mounts stretching out their necks as they surge full - tilt towards the enemy .
Yet few pictures show the consequences : battlefields on which abandoned , maimed , eviscerated animals wander in agony and bewilderment , lacking even a kindly bullet to free them from their misery .
Generals list their losses in men and guns .
Few have ever troubled to mention the horses which perished in the service of their victories .
One of the few who did notice was 19th - century surgeon Sir Astley Cooper .
After Wellington 's triumph at Waterloo in 1815 , the wounded horses of the Household Cavalry were sold at auction in Belgium .
Sir Astley bought 12 of the worst cases and had them shipped to England .
There , he devoted months to their care , removing bullets and sewing up sword slashes .
Afterwards , at his country park , he loved to watch the great beasts form in line , charge and gallop at their own pleasure .
Few of the horses of World War I were so rewarded .
In their thousands , they were borne away to France and Flanders , cast into shells , wire and mud , where they suffered wounds and death alongside the men who rode and drove them .
In the first months of the war , cavalry sometimes attempted charges in the old fashion , which ended in catastrophe in the face of machine - guns .
Throughout the years of stalemate which followed on the Western Front , horses pulled guns , ration carts and ambulances by day and night , often in terrible conditions .
Captain Julian Grenfell , who died on the battlefield , wrote pityingly in the spring of 1915 of a soldier 's apprehension before " going over the top " : " In dreary , doubtful , waiting hours , Before the brazen frenzy starts ,
The horses show him nobler powers ; O patient eyes , courageous hearts ! "
Some cavalrymen in France , however , were much less sympathetic to their mounts .
" The horse " , complained Lt Alan Lascelles of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry , " though a noble animal , is a ... tiresome companion ... when you start touring the country with him .
" He debars you from spending the night anywhere in the neighbourhood of civilisation because he takes up so much room .
He is unable to clean or feed himself , and will leave you altogether unless firmly secured ; he drags you miles through mud that he has churned up with his feet and then refuses to drink at the end of it .
" He wears a mass of impedimenta with an unlimited capacity for getting dirty and unserviceable ; he will bite and kick you on the smallest provocation .
" Though he is all very well in peacetime , I am beginning to think that the day when he is declared obsolete for war purposes will be a bright one for the human race . "
Ungrateful man !
His horse never sought its role in the most terrible conflict in human history .
The British Army shipped nearly six-million tonnes of fodder across the Channel during the war - slightly more than the weight of ammunition dispatched - but there was never enough .
When corn ran short , animals suffered from emaciation .
Thousands were left lame by nails and blades on the battlefield .
Between the Somme in July 1916 and the Armistice in November 1918 , the British Army recorded 58,090 horses killed and 77,410 wounded by gunfire ; 211 were killed and 2,220 wounded by poison gas ; while several hundred were killed by aeroplane bombs .
As the carnage grew , British stables could no longer supply the Army 's needs , as many horses were needed at home for farms and transport .
Animals were bought in Canada and the U.S. , to be shipped across the Atlantic .
Many of the horses and ponies which served with Allenby 's army , fighting the Turks in Palestine , came from Australia .
Australian cavalry took part in some of the last traditional charges in history , during the advance on Jerusalem in 1917 .
Many soldiers who found themselves tending and riding horses lacked experience .
The great - grandfather of Tom Morris , co-director of the National Theatre 's War Horse , sent a long letter to his own son , off to war in 1914 , explaining the care of his mount :
" When campaigning , " wrote farm manager Matthew Parrington , " there are lots of little things you can do with horses which may save you a lot of trouble and a lot of danger .
" First , about food : you will have that all in your instructions , but [ you should give him ] 15 lb good oats and about ten to 12lb of clean hay or other bulky food per day .
" Also , when you get the chance , give a few beetroot or other roots cut up in their corn .
Carrots are the best .
" A horse should be fed three times a day but you must feed when you can , water as often as possible but never just before fast work .
" When you off - saddle at night let them drink as much as they like before food when they come in tired . "
Parrington , a Devon man , gave pages of advice on the care of horses , a lore he knew well .
Most wartime soldiers did not .
They overloaded their mounts , neglected saddle sores , lamed beasts by carelessness , caused them colic by misfeeding .
And all before they got to work , dispatching cavalry , artillery and supply columns into the path of shot and shell .
Here , now , is Morpurgo in his best - selling book from which the stage production of War Horse is adapted , describing the experience of battle by his horse - hero , Joey : " ' Wire ' , I heard Trooper Warren whisper .
' Oh God , Joey , they said the wire would be gone , they said the guns would deal with the wire .
Oh my God . '
" We were into a canter now and still there was no sound nor sight of any enemy .
The troopers were shouting at an invisible foe , leaning over their horses ' necks , sabres stretched out in front of them .
" I galvanised myself into a gallop to keep up with Topthorn , and as I did so , the first terrible shells fell among us , and the machine - guns opened up .
" All around me men cried and fell to the ground , horses reared and screamed in an agony of fear and pain .
The ground erupted on either side of me , throwing horses and riders clear into the air . "
I wo n't spoil the story by revealing its end .
Here , instead , is a real - life account of the 7th Dragoon Guards charging during the Battle of the Somme on 14 July 1916 , as seen by a British gunnery officer : ' An incredible sight , an unbelievable sight .
They galloped up with their lances and pennants flying .
" They were falling all the way , as the German guns played on the infantry .
They simply galloped on through all that , horses and men dropping with no hope against the machine - guns .
It was a magnificent sight .
Tragic . "
Amazingly , that morning a few horsemen reached the German lines , and impaled several of the enemy on their lances .
But then machine - guns got to work on the horses once more .
Soon , the few survivors of the 7th Dragoons were trickling back to the British lines .
It was madness that such things happened , during a 20th - century war in which every sensible soldier recognised that horsed cavalry were doomed .
But happen they did , creating the legend which has inspired War Horse .
When the war ended in November 1918 , few horses returned to Britain .
Most were sold , ending their careers on French dinner tables .
The same happened again in World War II .
In 1939 , the rural part - time soldiers of the Yeomanry regiments were shipped from Britain to the Middle East with their horses .
In 1942 , when the Yeomanry were put into tanks , the animals became redundant .
They were auctioned in Palestine and Egypt .
In 1945 , with British sentimentality a charity was established in Cairo named the Brooke Hospital , to save horses from the worst cruelties of local life .
The Brooke survives today , a tribute to our nation 's feelings about its animals , even after treating them so badly in the service of war .
War Horse is a worthy memorial to the animal victims of the 20th century 's great global cataclysms .
The horses are its stars , taking more curtain calls than the human actors .
If you see it , do n't be fooled by the fact it was written for children .
However old and cynical you think you are , be sure to take plenty of hankies .

Principles of Nuclear Weapons Security and Safety
Due to their extreme destructiveness , nuclear weapons require stringent measures to ensure that they are never detonated , either intentionally or by accident , except under properly authorized circumstances .
In addition , since most nuclear weapons contain strongly radiotoxic materials ( plutonium and tritium ) it is important to prevent accidental release of these materials in an accident .
The first line of defense against accident is to design into the weapon an " exclusion zone " that encloses the detonation system and physically prevents electrical energy from reaching it .
Access from the firing system is provided by a " strong link " .
This is a mechanism ( a motorized switch for example ) that maintains physical isolation unless it is closed by the arming system .
The strong link is thus the ' draw bridge ' across the exclusion zone ' moat ' .
Now it is possible for an accident of some kind ( a crash , fire , munition explosion , lightning strike , etc. ) to destroy the integrity of the exclusion zone or the strong link and theoretically open the possibility of the detonation system being activated .
To prevent this , there is one or more " weak links " is inserted into the detonation system inside the exclusion zone .
These weak links will fail , rendering the weapon inoperable , when exposed to abnormal stresses ( heat , acceleration forces , etc. ) that are below the level that could possibly disrupt exclusion zone integrity .
Result - any accident that could circumvent the exclusion zone / strong link protections will disable the weapon by breaking the weak links first .
The first line of defense against unauthorized activation is a lock on the weapon .
The earliest locks were mechanical combination locks , but since the early 1960s a more sophisticated system called a " permissive action link " ( PAL ) has been increasingly employed .
A PAL is an electronic ( originally electro - mechanical ) device that prevents arming the weapon unless the correct codes are inserted into it .
Two different codes must be inserted , simultaneously or close together .
This is the " two man rule " principle - which requires it to be impossible to arm any nuclear weapon through the actions of a single individual .
The codes are usually changed on a regular schedule .
PALs have been developed in several versions of increasing sophistication , designated A through F .
Via LGF , go take a look at this video that Yellow Pages produced to salute the contributions of Islam to the world .
The entire video is a whitewashing of the global war on the jihad , casting Islam as completely misunderstood and all of Islam ’s critics as filled with ignorance and hatred .
That ’s not so unusual among big corporations .
What is unusual is the video ’s outright lies .
In a section about prominent Muslims ’ contributions to modern life , it lists Frank Zappa , former NH Gov. John Sununu and former Secretary of HHS Donna Shalala .
Though he had Arab ancestry , Frank Zappa was an atheist .
Donna Shalala is a Roman Catholic .
John Sununu is also Catholic .
The video also claims former Sen. George Mitchell and Spencer Abraham as Muslims .
I have n’t been able to debunk that yet , but I doubt that it ’s true .
It claims several other prominent figures as Muslims that , to say the least , deserve some fact - checking .
The Yellow Pages video evidently conflates Arab ancestry with belief in Islam , which is ridiculous : Many Christians , Jews and members of other faiths have had to flee Islamic countries to escape persecution by Muslims .
Update : George Mitchell is a Maronite Christian , and Spencer Abraham is Christian as well .
Curiously , the video does n’t mention one prominent Muslim musician : Cat Stevens , now known as Yusuf Islam .
I wonder why ?
Update :
They pulled the video .
Too bad for them that I ’d already downloaded it .
If it ever comes out of processing limbo at YouTube , I ’ll post it here .
Update :
You always have to stay a step ahead of those devious minds at Yellow Pages .
They pulled the video but it lives on , with a little fact - checking added to the end .
Update : Robert Spencer finds two more “ Muslims ” who are actually Christians .
This paper was turned in by an Oakland high school student who received the highest honors at the school district ’s Ebonics translationcompetition .

One more chance ( remix )
Lyrics :
First things first , I poppa , freaks all the honeys
Dummies — playboy bunnies , those wantin’ money
Those the ones I like ’ cause they do n’t get nathan ’
But penetration , unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage , I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb , never , black and ugly as ever
However , I stay coochied down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
TRANSLATION :
As a general rule , I perform deviant sexual acts with women of all kinds , including but not limited to those with limited intellect , nude magazine models , and prostitutes .
I particularly enjoy sexual encounters with the latter group as they are generally disappointed in the fact that they only receive penile intercourse and nothing more , unless of course , they douche on a consistent basis .
Although I am extremely unattractive , I am able to engage in these types of sexual acts with some regularity .
Perhaps my sexuality is somehow related to my fancy and expensive jewelry .
Lyrics :
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me ,
Nava - hoes creep me in they tee pee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it — if you think your gonna make a profit
TRANSLATION :
I enjoy playing my music loudly on my car stereo .
Apparently , women enjoy this also because they become sexually aroused when they see me driving .
Oddly enough , when I visit the Native American reservations , some of the more sexually promiscuous Indian women attempt to seduce me in their homes .
Their intent is to divest me of my earnings .
Such actions are unacceptable .
Lyrics :
Do n’t see my ones , do n’t see my guns — get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior Mafia
I do n’t know what the hell ’s stoppin’ ya
I ’m clockin’ ya — Versace shades watchin’ ya
Once ya grin , I ’m in game , begin
TRANSLATION :
Understand this fact : you can have neither my money , nor my weapons .
I suggest that you inform your peers that we engaged in violent sexual acts .
Currently , I am rapping with my associates , the Junior Mafia .
I ’m having some difficulty understanding why you refuse to approach me .
I am attempting to make eye contact with you through my expensive glasses , and as soon as you respond with a smile , I will approach you .
Lyrics :
First I talk about how I dress and this
And diamond necklaces — stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper — help ya reach the
Climax that your man ca n’t make
Call and tell him you ’ll be home real late
Let ’s sing the break
TRANSLATION :
I prefer to open the conversation with light banter about my wardrobe and jewelry , then I like to discuss my collection of expensive cars .
This is more than enough to convince you to have sexual intercourse with me .
I am able to insert my penis further into you when I enter you from behind .
Furthermore , you will be able to reach orgasm .
I understand this to be a problem with your current sexual partner .
He need n’t be concerned about your whereabouts .
Please phone him and inform him that you wo n’t be home for a while .
By the way , please sing the chorus of the song for me also .
Lyrics :
She ’s sick of that song on how it ’s so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is — major pain like Damon Wayans
Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan
Schemin ’ — do n’t bring your girl ’ round me
True player for real , ask Puff Daddy
TRANSLATION :
Your current love interest no longer wishes to hear your fabrications about the length of your member .
After I had sexual intercourse with your woman , she became enlightened as to the proper way it is supposed to be performed ; violently and immorally .
It would be in your best interest to keep your woman away from me as my sexual prowess is very strong .
If you are unconvinced , ask Puff Daddy .
Lyrics :
You — ringin’ bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz , traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped , CD changer with the cell
She beeped me , meet me at twelve
TRANSLATION :
Despite the fact that you attempted to win her at her doorstep with bags full of expensive clothes and a car ( the lower end model Mercedes Benz which you financed by signing over your current vehicle ) containing an expensive stereo and a cellular phone , your woman has contacted me through my pager indicating that we should rendezvous at midnight .
Lyrics :
Where you at ?
Flippin ’ jobs , playin’ car notes ?
While I ’m swimmin ’ in ya women like the breast stroke
Right stroke , left stroke , what ’s the best stroke ?
Death stroke — tongue all down her throat
Nuthin ’ left to do but send her home to you
I ’m through — can ya sing the song for me , boo ?
TRANSLATION :
You , on the other hand , jump from job to job , barely able to maintain payments on the Mercedes Benz you purchased for your woman .
Meanwhile , I continue to engage in sexual intercourse and commit lewd osculatory acts with your women .
My only remaining option is to request that she leave my home and return to you because I have reached orgasm and no longer have a need for her presence .
Lyrics :
So , what ’s it gonna be ?
Him or me ?
We can cruise the world with pearls
Gator boots for girls
The envy of all women , crushed linen
Cartier wrist - wear with diamonds in ’em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man ’s a wimp , I give that ass a good thrashin ’
TRANSLATION :
The ultimate decision rests with you .
Whom do you choose as your sexual partner ?
I can take you on cruises around the world .
I will dress you in the finest jewelry and footwear .
You will be envied by women worldwide in your fine clothes and jewelry .
There is a special place in my heart for beautiful women .
I will defeat your man in an altercation because he is effeminate .
Lyrics :
High fashion — flyin ’ into all states .
Sexin ’ me while your man masturbates .
Is n’t this great ?
Your flight leaves at eight .
Her flight lands at nine , my game just rewinds .
Lyrically I ’m supposed to represent .
I ’m not only the client , I ’m the player president
TRANSLATION :
WASHINGTON , Oct. 3  North Korea has agreed to disable all of its nuclear facilities by the end of the year , in a move that the Bush administration hailed as a diplomatic victory that could serve as a model for how to deal with Iran , which has defied American efforts to rein in its nuclear ambitions .
The North Korea agreement , announced in Beijing on Wednesday , sets out the first specific timetable for the North to disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid .
The accord is the second stage of a six-nation pact reached in February , one that has continued to draw sharp criticism from conservatives who complain that the United States is rewarding North Korea for its test of a nuclear device last October .
The agreement has not yet resolved the contentious question of when North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons .
The agreement calls on the United States to “ begin the process of removing ” North Korea from a United States terrorism list “ in parallel ” with the North ’s actions .
Conservative critics said the United States should not take North Korea off the terrorism list until it gave up all its nuclear weapons , and argued that the pact was far too conciliatory toward a nuclear power with alleged ties to international terrorism .

Structure and hierarchy reduce complexity and improve readability .
The more organized your articles or web - sites are , the easier it is for users to follow your arguments and get the message you are trying to deliver .
On the Web this can be done in a variety of ways .

On the Web this can be done in a variety of ways .
In body copy headlines and enumerations are usually used to present the information as logically separated data chunks .
An alternative solution is pagination , a mechanism which provides users with additional navigation options for browsing through single parts of the given article .
Parts of the article are usually referred to by numbers , hints , arrows as well as “ previous ” and “ next ” - buttons .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Search engines almost always use pagination ; newspapers tend to make use of it for navigation through the parts of rather large articles .
And there are situations when pagination is also necessary for weblogs .
Additional navigation can simplify the access to some site pages — e.g. make it easier for users to browse through the archives of the site .
In most cases pagination is better than traditional “ previous - next ” navigation as it offers visitors a more quick and convenient navigation through the site .
It ’s not a must , but a useful nice - to - have - feature .
Let ’s take a look at the good practices of pagination design as well as some examples of when and how the pagination is usually implemented .
Good Practices Of Pagination Design
7 Aspects according to Faruk Ates
Provide large clickable areas
Do n’t use underlines Identify the current page Space out page links Provide Previous and Next links Use First and Last links ( where applicable ) Put First and Last links on the outside
Mistake # 1 : Navigation Options Are Invisible
Since pagination ’s primary purpose is to serve as an improved navigation , it is supposed to make it clear for the visitors where they are , where they ’ve already been and where they can go next .
These three facts give users a complete understanding of how the system works and how the navigation should be used .
Mistake # 2 : Pagination Is n’t Intuitive
If you have to decide between a quite complex ( but beautiful ) pagination and a simple one with necessary functionality always prefer the simple solution .
If users do n’t understand the mechanism behind navigation they wo n’t be able to use it and therefore wo n’t use your web - site .
Helium.com is a perfect example for this mistake .
Take a look at the screenshot below : what do the arrows stand for ?
For the page you ’ve already visited or for the page you are currently on ?
And why does the link to the second page have a white background color ?
Why do the arrows have different colors ?
This is unintuitive .
Unintuitive pagination design on Helium.com
Unintuitive designs result from the lack of structure , hierarchy and well thought - out design decisions .
“ Blank ” pagination is as unintuitive as overcrowded design solution .
Our favourite example : Helium.com
Not spaced out page links are harder to scan and to navigate through .
Make - Believe.org as an example .
The design is unintuitive .
Creative Solutions Can Be User - Friendly
The more frequently a design element is used , the harder it is for designers to introduce some creative approaches without risking to make the design less intuitive .
Consequently , pagination designs have rather a variety of different patterns — revolutionary approaches are used very rarely .
However , creative approaches can be user - friendly .
E.g. Dirty .ru uses a slider - based pagination menu ; users can drag it to get more available options , that means links to the older pages of the site .
A slider on Dirty.ru
Erweiterungen.de , the German version of the official Firefox extensions web - site , provides more navigation options once the visitor clicks on the “ … ” - button .
Further navigation options are displayed once the " ... " - button is clicked .
Erweiterungen.de .
Gallery - Screenshots taken in 2007
Although “ standard ” pagination — linked blue numbers following each other — is very common for most web interfaces , designers tend to experiment with colors , forms , backgrounds and shapes .
The pagination does n’t need to look nice aiming to captivate users ’ attention ; as a part of site navigation it offers users an important functionality and as such has to be used effectively .
Still , visual clues can be helpful .
In most designs blue and grey colors dominate — colors traditionally used by services .
Simple Enumeration
Colors and Shapes In Use
Often designers use colors to highlight the current page and separate it from the other pages .
The numbers of the pages are also given a shape : a rectangle , a circle or a button .
The current page is usually not linked .
A turd by any other name is still a turd , but there 's no harm in counting the ways .
• They stifle progress
Cellular giants know they 've hit on a winner and they do n't want the landscape moving underfoot .
Any change not under their own control is dangerous .
To witness Sprint's $ 5bn investment in WiMax is to witness a future planned so far in advance no - one should be comfortable with it .
Such futures can't be relied upon if innovation is permitted , so the carriers will do anything to crush it .
Verizon went as far as to sue the government to prevent it from auctioning the rights to radio spectra that are n't
( yet ) under carrier control .
Though that effort gutterballed , it 's a useful reminder of how these companies think the world should work .
• They 're a cartel
Policies , practices and , of course , prices , are startlingly uniform across the board .
By owning the framework of wireless telecommunications , the major carriers can deny market access to potential competitors , and few laws exist to effectively limit collaboration and trust .
A manufacturer of cellular technology told us recently that the carriers effectively control their access to the market : it 's as simple as that .
If you 're in the business of making phones , you develop what the carriers — not the customers — want .
Google 's big idea is , allegedly , to use its own software platform as a wedge to loosen carrier control of their own mobile networks .
Ads , ads and more ads will pay for everything , and the big G will rule the world .
If you think at least one of the bullet points in that implied sequence of events seems to be followed by " ?????? , " you would n't be alone .
• They 're going to make you pay for Tetris
To paraphrase Slate 's Justin Peters , " Why give you free Tetris when they can sell you $ 7 Tetris ? "
Seriously , screw those guys !
• They just can't behave themselves
The telecommunications industry has always loved the smell of fraud in the morning .
Why change the habit of a century ?
T - Mobile can't even sponsor a damned cycling team without it being riven by corruption .
When California enacted its Telecommunications Bill of Rights , the industry fought tooth and nail to be allowed to apply at - whim contract changes , to add services without asking the customer , and to not have to tell customers about price increases .
It 's not that they 're up to no good that 's so frustrating , it 's the fact they clearly do n't care if you know it : they consider themselves absolutely untouchable .
It 's relentless : AT&T would very much like to censor criticism of it , while Verizon would very much like to censor everything .
The U.S. is markedly behind international rivals — socialists as they often are — even though our local heroes say similar regulation will kill enterprise .
In 2004 , the Better Business Bureau identified billing errors , refusing to fix problems and lying as the three things which killed carriers ' reputations .
Nearly four years later , not a lot has changed .
• They illegally spy on you
O.K. , so just one of them got caught .
But it the biggest of them .
AT&T is set up to route everything its customers write and say directly to the spooks , and is desperate for congress to retroactively legalize its behavior now that it 's been caught .
Given the secretive nature of such programs , who knows what the others might be up to ?
AT&T even went as far as to develop a programming language to more efficiently sift through recorded conversations .
This is n't case of doing what it 's told to : this is the unbridled relish of enthusiastic fellow - travelers .
Irony time : when you call them with customer complains , the carriers typically warn you that you 're being recorded , but agents will hang up on you if you do the same .
Any company with a standing policy of refusing to speak to its customers , unless it 's the only one with a record of it , is obviously up to no good .
• They have annoying commercials
First , we have Verizon 's creepy , intense " Can you hear me now ? " spokesman and the Giant instruction manual for his clone army .
The best line ?
" Test Man will come across folks from various ethnicities in order to evoke VZWs sense of and respect for diversity . "
Then there 's Sprint 's lineup of sneering suits who love to make a show of sitting down next to people to show off their ultra-fast EVDO
cards .
Finally , we have Alltel 's smug boy - next - door , " Chad , "
contrasted against the ugly troglodytes with which the firm represents its competitors .
Why do we need to see someone pleasuring himself with a vibrating phone , Alltel ?
Why do you think that sells phones ?
It does n't .
• They hate you
If it is n't clear from everything else here , the carriers loathe their own customers .
This is a completely reasonable out - flowering of their business model .
By subsidizing handsets and locking customers into lengthy contracts , cellular providers are , in effect , offering a kind of loan .
Their relationship with you is the same as that of a payday shark or drug dealer : after the initial transaction , the only thing that matters is the fact that you owe something to them , a debt backed by obligation .
Does a debt collector give you tech support ?
Of course not .
So why should a company that gave you an expensive gadget at a huge discount ?
Correspondingly , as your contract comes close to expiration , " upgrade "
discount offers will be sent your way , as if the renewal option was some kind of gift .
The possibility of freedom is the only thing that attracts the affections of a cellular operator .
And if you do n't want an upgrade ?
Sometimes , they 'll try and charge you extra to continue using an " old " phone on its network , on pain of having your service quality ruined .
Talk about true love .
• Their contracts are nonsense
Even if you consider issues such as technological innovation and openness to be pointy - headed blather , it 's hard to downplay the lunacy of the one - sided " agreements " customers must sign to play ball in the status quo .
These are several pages long , packed with legal vagaries , and unilaterally editable at will ( but not , of course , by you ) .
It 's this legal legerdemain that matters for most victims , and it 's imperative that it be outlawed .
And if the Cell
Phone Consumer Empowerment
Act act , sponsored by Amy Klobuchar
( Democrat - Minnesota ) and Jay Rockefeller ( Democrat - West Virginia )
passes , it will be .
The likes of Ted " series of tubes " Stevens ( Republican — Alaska ) , a bought - and - paid - for shit if ever there was one , will be fighting it tooth and claw : it has little chance of becoming law .
But this is where you , the ultimate lobbyists , come in .
Tell your congresspersons to support it .
And what about the practices this regulation seeks to end ?
Moving swiftly on ...
• They charge crazy fees ( for services you did n't ask for )
Accurate coverage maps , a 30 - day test period for service and the right to unlock phones are among the demands present in
Klobuchar 's legislation , but the hottest issues regard fees .
They 're serious about that " you owe us " mindset : all of the major carriers except Verizon assess un - prorated early termination fees if you leave at any point before the end of the agreement .
Verizon pledged a few weeks ago to start pro-rating ETFs .
And that 's just the obvious target .
PC
World reported last year on undisclosed add - ons like " roadside assistance " services and " upgrade fees " charged for renewing contracts .
Such acts of deception make cellular carriers the most hated service industry in America , with the Better Business Bureau confirming them as the most complained - about firms on their rolls .
In Canada , the carriers even charge a recurring fee to allow you to access your own phone .
• They lock handsets
There 's no need to expand on this one : just ask an iPhone owner who upgraded to 1.1.1 after unlocking his handset .
He 'll tell you all about the evils of SIM locking .
It is now legal to unlock your phone , of course , but not illegal to make that a technological nightmare to accomplish .
• They cripple their products
When we covered the release of the RAZR 2 , we had to run a story explaining the differences between each carrier 's
" version " of Motorola 's new machine .
The internet is littered with forums where people complain about deliberately damaged handsets and hunt for unauthorized hacks to repair them .
This is an industry in which even Apple had to comply with another company 's demands : a compromise that certainly involved hardware and service features .
If Apple " bending " ( AT&T's own gloating terminology ) does n't shock you , nothing will .
• They charge double for data
You 'll notice that while your smartphone can access the internet just fine , if you want to hook up that access with your laptop or home computer , you 'll have to pay extra for the privilege .
This is often sold as a modem plan or broadband access plan .
Even though the data is
" already there " and there is no technical overhead — clever users can often figure out how to trick phones into providing it without further ado — the carriers are happy to eat their cake and have it too .
In essence , it 's another arbitrary and artificial limitation of a capability inherent to modern , digital phone service .
It is a limitation enacted solely to get you to pay extra to lift it .
• They own politicians
Sure , it 's just phones .
In a world where worse things happen all the time amid the muck and despair of human existence , having to pay for
premium text is hardly worth worrying about , is it ?
You can ( and should ) opt out , and not sign on the dotted line to begin with .
But today 's cell towers might be tomorrow 's Pony Express : they 're TV
stations , internet access , emergency 911 and news networks all rolled into one .
WWAN could well end up supplanting copper sooner than anyone expects : do you want these companies in charge of it ?
Nothing so close to government , and yet so far from the people , should be suffered to live .
• Their products suck
Yeah , you heard me .
All of them .
Even that one .
Steve Jobs played Beck 's " Cellphone 's Dead " when demonstrating the iPod Touch , and you know what ?
He was damn right .
Is that 10 ?
I think I might have overshot the mark .
Let 's make it 15 .
Add your own example or impassioned defense in the comments below .
Hi there all , just thought I 'd bring this article up for its own comment thread .
Have at it .

A world without oil
Scientists challenge major review of global reserves and warn that supplies will start to run out in four years ' time
By Daniel Howden
Published : 14 June 2007
Scientists have criticised a major review of the world 's remaining oil reserves , warning that the end of oil is coming sooner than governments and oil companies are prepared to admit .
BP 's Statistical Review of World Energy , published yesterday , appears to show that the world still has enough " proven " reserves to provide 40 years of consumption at current rates .
The assessment , based on officially reported figures , has once again pushed back the estimate of when the world will run dry .
However , scientists led by the London - based Oil Depletion Analysis Centre , say that global production of oil is set to peak in the next four years before entering a steepening decline which will have massive consequences for the world economy and the way that we live our lives .
According to " peak oil " theory our consumption of oil will catch , then outstrip our discovery of new reserves and we will begin to deplete known reserves .
The Recording Industry of America today won its first jury trial against an individual accused of illegally downloading music .
A federal jury fined Jammie Thomas , 30 , of Minnesota $ 220,000 in damages to the six record labels suing her for copyright violation .
Thomas will pay $ 9,250 for each of the 24 songs the prosecution focused on for the case .
The RIAA alleges she shared over 1,702 songs in all over the Kazaa peer - to - peer network .
Read more about the case here .
Thomas denied any wrongdoing over the course of the three day trial .
Her attorney , Brian Toder , argued that although the prosecution had fingered her screen name and IP address , they had little proof it was Thomas behind the keyboard — or that music was actually shared with anyone over the account .
Toder suggested Thomas may have been victim to a spoofer , cracker or other malicious intrusion of her home network .
US District Judge Michael Davis ruled the labels did not have to prove the songs were transfered for Thomas to be held liable .
The act of making the songs available is enough to constitute copyright infringement , he said .
Davis instructed the 12 - member jury the range of the fine was $ 750 to $ 150,000 per song .
Attorney for the record companies , Richard Gabriel , spoke with reporters outside of the courthouse after the verdict .
He said the RIAA will continue to aggressively pursue those it suspects of copyright violations .
" This is what can happen if you do n't settle , " Gabriel said . ®
Officials broke ground Saturday on a new residence hall that will provide 196 units of affordable housing near Los Angeles International Airport for low - income veterans .
With airplanes thundering overhead at close range — sometimes as often as one minute apart — U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Los Angeles ) , Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California , Victoria Reggie Kennedy ( wife of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy ) and veterans from each branch of the Armed Services celebrated the $ 34.9 - million project , which is expected to open in the fall of 2011 .
Funding for the project known as Westside Residence Hall II was raised from a variety of sources , including nearly $ 20 million from the Economic Recovery Act , $ 7.5 million from a state housing and development infrastructure fund and $ 7.4 million from the city of Inglewood ’s redevelopment agency .
The first Westside Residence Hall , which will be joined with the new complex , opened in 1993 on the adjacent lot , which had formerly been the site of a 500 - unit dormitory for Northrup University .

Tim Cantwell , who built the original Westside Residence Hall and owns the building , said the facility has housed 8,000 veterans since then .
Still , he said , “ there is a dearth of affordable options for veterans to exit into when they come out of the service or when they come out of other programs . ”
U.S. Vets , a nonprofit group , provides services at the site , which has a mental health clinic and career center .
“ Affordable housing for heroes is an objective that everyone supports , ” U.S. Vets President Dwight Radcliff said during the program .
“ Veterans are committing suicide at a rate of 18 deaths per day , according to VA reports , and we must realize that the VA alone ca n’t help and ca n’t be the sole answer to these veterans ’ needs . ”
“ This is serious work , ” Radcliff added .

Officials said rents in the units range from $ 375 to $ 650 , including meals .
The new building will add 148 studio apartments and 48 units with shared kitchen facilities to the complex .
Boxer , who is holding several fundraisers for her reelection campaign this weekend with Kennedy , praised the project as an example of what of the Economic Recovery Act has done .
“ When we all work together instead of fighting ... we can get a lot done , ” the California Democrat said .
Boxer ’s Republican opponent , Carly Fiorina , has repeatedly said that the stimulus program has failed , citing California ’s 12.3 % unemployment rate .

1 . As a result of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 , Congress established different mandatory penalties for cocaine and crack cocaine , with significantly higher punishments for crack cocaine offenses .
There is a 5 - year minimum prison penalty for a first - time trafficking offense involving 5 grams or more of crack cocaine or 500 grams or more of powder cocaine ( see top chart above ) and a 10 - year mandatory minimum penalty for a first - time trafficking offense involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine or 5,000 grams or more of powder cocaine .
2 . One gram of pure powder cocaine will convert to approximately 0.89 grams of crack cocaine ( see middle chart above ) .
3 . Historically , the majority of crack cocaine offenders are black ; powder cocaine offenders are now predominantly Hispanic .
In 2006 , African - Americans accounted for 82 percent of crack cocaine - related arrests , while white and Hispanic offenders accounted for 72 percent of powder cocaine - related arrests ( see bottom chart above ) .
Bottom Line :
1. Members of Congress might need some remedial math , especially on decimals ?
If 1 gram of powder cocaine = .89 grams of crack cocaine , why is the amount of crack cocaine for five years of jail time ( 5 grams ) 100X less than for powder cocaine ( 500 grams ) ?
2. Nobel economist Milton Friedman once called the minimum wage " the most anti-black law on the books . "
For once I have to disagree with Milton , I think the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 is now the most anti-black law on the books .
By far .
As Shakespeare once wrote , they have their exits and their entries .
Between about 1975 and 1990 , following the US defeat in Vietnam , military history was extremely popular among the US Armed Forces .
After 1991 , largely as a result of what many people considered the “ stellar ” performance of those Forces against Saddam Hussein , it went out of fashion ; after all , if we were able to do that well there was not much point in studying the mistakes our predecessors made .
Now that comparisons between Vietnam and Iraq have suddenly become very fashionable indeed , history is rushing right back at us .
Here , I wish to address the differences and the similarities between the two wars by describing Vietnam as it was experienced by one man , Moshe Dayan .
As of 2004 , Dayan is remembered , if he is remembered at all , mainly as the symbol of Israeli military power on the one hand and as one of the architects of the Israeli - Egyptian Peace Agreement on the other .
In 1966 he was fifty - one years old .
Having resigned his position as chief of staff in January 1958 , he spent the next two years studying Orientalism and political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
In 1959 he was elected to Parliament and spent five years as minister of agriculture ; serving first under his old mentor , David Ben Gurion , and then under Levi Eshkol .
In November 1964 he resigned and found himself a member of the opposition .
Long interested in literature , a superb speaker when he wanted to , in 1965 he published his first book , Sinai Diary , which proved that he could write as well as fight .
He was , however , developing an attitude of having seen it all , done it all ; a feeling that his twin hobbies , archaeology and an endless string of mistresses , could only relieve up to a point .
Hence , when the most important Israeli newspaper of the time , Maariv , proposed that he go to Vietnam as a war correspondent he jumped on the idea .
The articles he wrote were published in Maariv as well as the British and French press .
In 1977 , by which time he was serving as foreign minister under Menahem Begin and engaged in peace - talks with Egypt , the Hebrew - language articles were collected in book form and published .
In the preface Dayan explains they were too long to be included in the memoirs he had published a year before ; perhaps his real aim was to warn Israelis of the consequences that might ultimately follow if they did not get rid of what he called “ the blemish of conquest . ”
If so , unfortunately he did not succeed .
Dayan knew nothing about Vietnam , and prepared himself thoroughly .
His first visit was to France where he had many acquaintances from the time of the Israeli - French alliance of the mid-nineteen fifties ; some of these people had served in , and helped lose , the First Indo - China War .
His very first contact was a retired Air Force General by the name of Loission .
In Loission ’s view American public opinion was to blame for not putting its full support behind the War — to which should be added , in parentheses , that at the beginning of the War that support had been overwhelming .
He thought the War could easily be won if only American public opinion agreed to bomb North Vietnam back into the Stone Age .
As it was , a combination of Viet Cong terrorism and propaganda prevented the world , as well as the South Vietnamese themselves , from seeing how righteous the American cause was ; he even believed that , had free elections been held , the Vietnamese might have wanted the French back .
He ended the conversation by asking for his ideas to be kept secret .
Dayan , who did not think those ideas constituted “ a ray of light to an embarrassed world , ” readily agreed .
His other French contact , a General Niceault , was more enlightening .
For his role in the 1961 attempt to overthrow the Fifth Republic , Niceault had just spent five years in jail ; as so often happens , jail proved an opportunity to think and to learn .
Unlike Loission he had devoted a lot of thought to the matter and his mind was fresh and agile .
To Dayan he explained that the Americans were using the wrong forces against the wrong targets .
Their intelligence simply was not good enough , and most of their bombs hit nothing but empty stretches of jungle .
He suggested that the solution to the problem was to use small groups of five to seven men ; their task would be to shadow the Viet Cong and act as guides , calling in air power or artillery when contact was formed .
The American attempts to prevent the North Vietnamese from infiltrating into South Vietnam by way of the demilitarized zone were not working either , given that each time a path was blocked another one could be found to bypass it .
Perhaps the War could be won by sending in a million - man army and killing all male Vietnamese , but the days in which such things were possible had gone .
He ended by telling Dayan that there was no point in going to Vietnam , since he would see nothing anyhow .
Typically of him , Dayan answered that , if he would be unable to see the enemy or the war , at any rate he would see that he could not see ; and that , too , would be enlightening .
From France he went to Britain in order to see Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery of Alamein .
Montgomery at that time was in the midst of writing his History of Warfare ; Dayan , who had met him once before when he was studying at Camberley Staff College in 1951 , noted how “ relaxed and alert ” the old man looked .
Montgomery ’s ideas concerning Vietnam were very clear - cut .
The Americans ’ most important problem in running the War was that they did not have an unambiguous objective .
He himself had tried to get an answer on that subject from no less a person than former vice president Richard Nixon .
In response he had been treated to a twenty - minute lecture ; at the end of which he remained as much in the dark as he had been at the beginning .
To Montgomery , an exceptionally systematic commander who always planned his moves very carefully , that was the essence of the problem .
Not having a clear overall policy , the Americans were permitting the field commanders to call the shots .
They did what they knew best , screaming for more and more troops , locking up entire populations in what where euphemistically called “ strategic hamlets , ” and bombing and shelling without giving a thought to what , if anything , they were achieving .
At the end of their talk Montgomery told Dayan to tell the Americans , in his name , that they were “ insane . ”
Again Dayan did not disagree , though perhaps this time for different reasons .
From Britain he flew to the United States .
Eighteen years had passed since his first visit to that country .
Like many visitors , the dominant impression he received was that of towering power the like of which history had never seen .
Here was a society racing into the twenty - first century , with the rest of the world only barely keeping pace .
His first meeting was at the Pentagon where no fewer than three colonels had been appointed to brief him .
They pretended to be humble and called him “ the glorious General Dayan ” ; at the same time , as he noted , they appeared ready to provide him not only with the answers but also with the questions he was supposed to ask .
He left with the feeling that they , and those whom they represented , did not really have a handle on the War .
In particular , he wondered why , given the four to one superiority that the Americans and their South Vietnamese Allies enjoyed over the Viet Cong , General Westmoreland would not give the latter a chance to concentrate and attack so that he himself could smash them to pieces .
The answer he received , namely that Westmoreland thought doing so was too risky , he considered unconvincing .
During the next few days his feeling that the Americans did not really know where they were going was reinforced .
Everywhere he went he was received courteously enough .
Everywhere he went the people he encountered were committed and extremely hard working .
Intensely patriotic , they seemed proud of what they were doing and would not admit any errors .
At one point he asked whether they had changed their methods since they first went to Vietnam and was told that they did not have to do so since everything worked much better than expected .
Thereupon he noted that the US Military never made any mistakes ; however , that comment he kept to himself .
He was subjected to a flood of statistics — so and so many enemies killed , so and so many captured — meant to prove that the situation was well under control and that large parts of the territory of South Vietnam , as well as its population , were now safe against terrorist attack .
As he noted , however , even a few elementary questions revealed that things were far from simple .
Later he was to discover how right he had been in this ; in the whole of South Vietnam there was not a single road that was really safe against the Viet Cong .
Nor was there anything to prevent the enemy from returning even to those places that had been most thoroughly “ cleansed ” and “ pacified . ”
The three most important figures he met were the deputy head of the National Security Council , Walt Rostow , General Maxwell Taylor who was then acting as special adviser to President Johnson , and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara .
Rostow , a Harvard - based economist , had published a famous book in which he explained how the developing world would catch up with the developed one in four clear , well - defined , stages .
Now he told Dayan that the desire for economic growth would drive the peoples of Asia closer to the US .
Dayan , who had observed how determined Israel Arab ’s neighbors had been to get rid of their Western overlords even at heavy economic cost , doubted it ; had he been alive today , no doubt he would have expressed the same idea about the situation in Iraq .
Rostow also believed , or pretended to believe , that the forthcoming elections in South Vietnam would be free and democratic and thus strengthen the Government in waging the War .
Still he was the first American to whom Dayan spoke who was prepared to admit that the US objective was not just to help South Vietnam but to set up a permanent military political presence in South East Asia so as to counterbalance the growing power of China .
To that extent , the conversation with him was the most useful of those he had had so far .
Taylor , whom he met next , was the first American to present him with a comprehensive plan for winning the War .
It consisted of four elements , namely a. improving US Army operations on the ground ; b. making full use of the Air Force to bomb the North ; c. strengthening the economy of South Vietnam ; and d. reaching an “ honorable ” peace with Ho Chi Minh .
Asked whether he thought the US was making progress in those directions , however , he could not produce convincing indications that this was indeed the case .
As the Americans themselves admitted , in spite of the heavy casualties being inflicted on the VC — Taylor estimated them at 1,000 a week — the latter ’s operations kept growing more extensive and more dangerous .
Nor could Taylor point to any clear progress as a result of the air campaign .
He did , however , believe that the bombing formed “ a heavy burden ” on the North ; sooner or later , the enemy would break .
Dayan ’s last important contact , Robert McNamara , had a reputation of being hard to approach .
This turned out to be untrue and Dayan was pleasantly surprised ; at a small dinner party with Margot ( McNamara ’s wife ) , Walt Rostow and several journalists , the Secretary Defense did what he could to answer all the questions that were directed at him .
He admitted that many of the figures being floated by the Pentagon — particularly those pertaining to the percentage of the country and population “ secured ” — were meaningless at best and bogus at worst .
No more than anybody else could he explain to Dayan how the Americans intended to end the War .
What set him apart was the fact that he was prepared to admit it , albeit only in a half - hearted way ; as we now know , he already had his own doubts which led to his resignation in the next year .
He consoled himself by saying that the War was not hurting the US economy .
In other words , it could go on and on until one side or the other gave way .
Flying to Vietnam by way of Honolulu and Tokyo , Dayan summed up his impressions so far .
Almost all of the Americans he had met were pleasant enough .
None , however , could tell him how they were going to win the War .
Most could not even give a convincing reason why the US had to be in Vietnam in the first place ; at least one had said that , had President Johnson been presented with a way to get out , he would have jumped on it and withdrawn his troops .
What really infuriated them was any attempt to question their motives .
As far as they were concerned their cause was noble and just .
The fact that the Communist States did what they could to support the Viet Cong and North Vietnam was bad but understandable .
They were , however , puzzled by the attitude of their European allies .
Those Europeans supposedly shared America ’s liberal - democratic values .
Still many of them were strongly critical .
At a loss to explain the problem , the Americans attributed it to cowardice , envy , and the resentment that arose from Europe ’s own recent failure in waging “ Imperialist ” war .
He thought that , in ignoring the Europeans , the Americans were making a big mistake .
To make things stranger still , the determination of American decision - makers to ignore world public opinion was counterbalanced by their extreme sensitivity to the views of their own electorate .
At that moment , he noted , fully seventy five percent of those polled were in favor of bombing North Vietnam — just as , in April 2004 , a small majority of Americans still believed that the war in Iraq was worth - while .
Still permitting public opinion to decide on such issues seemed to him a strange way to run a war , and one he thought was likely to have grave consequences for the future .
He arrived in Vietnam on 25 July .
His first stop was Saigon where he spent two days being “ processed . ”
He was issued with an American uniform , rucksack , water bottles , and helmet ; as he wrote , had it depended on the soldiers in charge they would also have given him a weapon and hand - grenades .
He used his spare time to meet a Vietnamese professor of nuclear physics to whom he had been referred by an Israeli friend .
The professor told him — in strict confidence , since saying anything contrary to the official line was dangerous — that the Viet Cong were much stronger than the Americans knew or wanted to know .
Later during his visit he also had occasion to meet with the South Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and minister of defense , General Nguyen Van Thieu , as well the chief of the general staff of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam .
Both owed their positions to the Americans who had connived in Diem ’s assassination and both , he thought , were highly intelligent men .
Both , interestingly enough , reserved their greatest admiration not for some American commander but for the North - Vietnamese General Giap .
Giap had been the hero of the struggle against the French .
Now , they fondly hoped , he might force Hanoi to make peace .
On 27 July he joined a river patrol .
The patrol consisted of three fast boats , each one manned by four “ nice kids ” and commanded by an officer .
They were armed with heavy machine guns and light automatic cannon ; as he noted , it was the first time since the Civil War when the US Navy had embarked on river operations .
They raced along at 25 knots an hour , using visual navigation to find their way by day and infrared at night .
From time to time they would stop to search one of the thousands of South Vietnamese boats carrying provisions from the Delta to Saigon .
The searches woke up old memories .
They reminded him of the ones that the British used to conduct when trying to fight Jewish terrorists in Palestine ; offensive , but largely useless .
The US sailors checked papers , took a perfunctory look at the load of the boats they stopped , and proceeded on their mission .
While he did not think the boats they examined actually carried weapons , had they wanted to do so it would have been easy enough .
As to thoroughly checking each and every boat , it was clearly impossible .
On 28 July he went aboard the largest aircraft carrier then cruising off the Vietnamese coast , USS Constellation .
He was a professional military man and had often read and heard about such ships ; yet what he now saw made a “ breath - taking impression ” on him .
The vessel constituted five acres of sovereign American territory that could go anywhere without having to worry about troublesome allies .
Isolated at sea , the crew did not constitute a security problem and the lack of anything else to do made them work all the harder at their jobs .
The ship was protected “ from the air , the sea , the ground , outer space , and under water ” ; if Dayan was being ironic — after all , the enemy consisted of little men wearing straw hats — he did not say so .
The product of this floating factory was firepower .
Every ninety minutes , amidst a numbing outburst of fire and noise , flights of combat aircraft took off to strike at targets in Vietnam ; but when it came to specifying the precise nature of those targets his hosts refused to answer his questions .
As always , Dayan was impressed by the Americans ’ pride in themselves , their nation , and their mission .
He ended the day by noting that they were “ not fighting against infiltration to South [ Vietnam ] , or against guerrillas , or against North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh , but against the entire world .
Their real aim was to show everybody — including Britain , France , and the USSR — their power and determination so as to pass this message : wherever Americans go , they are irresistible . ”
The next month — he stayed until 27 August — was spent visiting various units throughout South Vietnam .
First he went to see the Marines , joining a company that was patrolling only about a mile south of the Demilitarized Zone in order to prevent infiltration from the North .
The company commander was a first lieutenant by the name of Charles Krulak .
For two nights and three days they humped up and down amidst the vegetation that covered the hills .
They waded through streams and sometimes almost drowned in them ; at one point Dayan himself lost his foothold and had to be pulled out .
Yet throughout all that time the only target at which they opened fire was some kind of unidentified animal .
Apparently it had been wounded , and the noise it made kept the entire unit awake for an entire night .
Thirty - five year later General ( ret. )
Krulak , ex-commandant of the Marine Corps , told me that , as they set up camp one evening , Dayan had asked them what they were doing there .
He gave it as his opinion that the American strategy was wrong .
They should be “ where the people are , ” not vainly trying to chase the Viet Cong in the mountains where they were not .
A few days later his wish to see the War “ where the people are ” was granted .
Near Da Nang , he visited another Marine unit that was engaged in pacification .
The Marines were responsible for security — he noted their excellent discipline — whereas most of the actual work was done by civilians .
Once again , he found the Americans on the spot committed and immensely proud of what they were doing to bring a ray of light into a troubled world .
Once again , he left the district clear in his own mind that much remained to be done ; so much so that it was doubtful whether the Americans were making any progress at all .
Nor was he impressed with the attempts to help the South Vietnamese peasants improve their standard of living by introducing new agricultural methods , better livestock , and so on .
One is reminded of the figures coming out of Iraq concerning schools and clinics reopened , doctors ’ pay raised , and the like .
Back in Paris Niceault had told him the “ battle for hearts and minds ” would not work , given that that the Vietnamese had their own cultural traditions — as well as “ immensely beautiful women ” — and that “ Californization ” was the last thing they wanted .
This , moreover , was a field where he had some experience .
With US financial backing , during his term as minister of agriculture ( 1959 –63 ) he had sent Israeli experts to carry out agrarian reforms in various Asian and African countries .
Some of those countries he had visited in person , only to find out how hard it was to make a long - established culture change its ways .
Clearly doing so in the midst of a war , when every achievement was under constant threat from Viet Cong terrorists , was much harder still .
Another extremely interesting visit was the one he paid to 1st Air Cavalry Division .
Organized only a few years previously , it was the most up - to - date fighting force in the entire world .
Not to mention the incredible economic , industrial , and logistic power that made such a unit possible in the first place ; and , having done so , supported it in battle thousands of miles away from home .
Operating under conditions of absolute air superiority — as was also to be the case in Iraq , in all South Vietnam there was not a single enemy aircraft — the division did exactly as it pleased .
It required no more than four hours ’ warning to land an entire battalion at any location within its helicopters ’ range .
As it turned out , though , often four hours were four hours too many .
Arriving at the selected spot , the troops would find that the enemy had gone .
It must have been during his stay with 1st Cavalry that the following incident took place .
As was his custom Dayan wanted to visit the front , which in the case of Vietnam meant going on patrol .
His hosts reluctantly agreed , but fearing lest something might happen to the celebrity for whom they were responsible selected a route that was supposedly free of the Viet Cong .
As often happened , their information proved wrong .
They came under fire and were “ pinned down , ” as the phrase went .
Looking around from where he was lying , the American captain in charge discovered that Dayan had disappeared .
In the end he located him ; the middle - aged visitor from Israel was sitting comfortably on top of a grassy knoll .
With great effort , the captain crawled to him and asked what he was doing .
“ What are you doing ? ” was the answer he got : “ get your — up here , and see what this battle is all about . ”
The way he saw it , the problem was intelligence .
“ According to Norton ’s ( commanding officer , 1st Air Cavalry ) information , there was a Viet Cong division in this highland area .
It was not concentrated in a single base but split into several battalions , each about 350 men strong .
It was Norton ’s plan to land a battalion … in the Vietcong divisional area and then , in accordance with the developments of the battle , to rush in additional ‘ reaction troops ’ to reinforce , seal off , and carry out flank attacks .
All this was fine , except for one small item missing in the plan : the exact location of the Viet Cong battalions was not known .
Air photos and air reconnaissance had failed to pick out their encampments , entrenched , bunkered and camouflaged with the jungle vegetation .
The US intelligence sources were largely technical — air photos and decoded radio intercepts , for Viet Cong units from battalion strength and up used transmitters .
Only scanty information could be gleaned from POWs .
Many of the latter spat in the Americans ’ face and swore to die rather than talk . ”
Contrary to what had been written about the enormous logistical requirements of the US troops — from iced beer to go - go girls — he was impressed by the Spartan nature of the arrangements .
The Americans were prepared to improvise at a moment ’s notice ; throw a flack jacket into the helicopter , hop in , and off you go hunting VC .
The entire Division was “ a huge force , fast and efficient .
It used its weapons — including artillery support and tactical and strategic air support — very effectively indeed ” ; in Dayan ’s view , it was as superior to other forces as the German tanks had been to their enemies at the beginning of World War II .
“ [ Its ] battle procedures operated like an assembly belt .
First came the shelling of the landing zones by ground artillery .
Then came aerial bombardment .
And the landings themselves were covered by ‘ gunships , ’ the accompanying , close - support , heli - borne , units firing their rockets and machine guns almost at our feet . ”
It was an amazing operation , “ but where was the war ?
It was like watching military maneuvers — with only one side . ”
“ Where were the Viet Cong ?
And where was the battle ?
The Viet Cong were there , a few hundred yards away .
And the battle came half an hour later when the company which had landed 300 yards to our south ran into an ambush after it had started moving off . ”
Within minutes the company was shot to pieces , suffering 25 dead and some 50 wounded including its commander .
Calling in their firepower , 1st Cavalry gave pursuit .
Meeting resistance they would radio for the B - 52s bombers ; to what effect , was not clear .
To recount each and every detail of Dayan ’s visit would be tedious .
Everywhere he was met with the greatest courtesy and was given a fairly free hand to see and ask what he wanted .
As he noted , American officers were committed , very hard working , and as frank as circumstances permitted ; many of them enjoyed the War which , at this time , was still in its “ forward ” phase .
General Westmoreland he found pleasant and informal .
It was true he seemed to lack the “ astute expression ” that Dayan had discerned with some other senior generals .
Still there could be no question of American officers being incompetent oafs who delighted in setting alight Vietnamese huts and were fragged by their own men ; that image only rose after the War and as a direct result of it .
One of their problems was the need to get their names mentioned by the media so as to advance their careers .
This , Dayan thought , did not turn them into better persons or , what was more important , better commanders .
He admired the American rank and file , particularly the Marines and the Green Berets .
They were physically fit , very well trained , and , this being 1966 , still did their job willingly .
They were , to use his own Hebrew phrase , “ golden guys ” ; the fact that they were being rotated in an out of the country too fast to learn its ways and become really effective in doing their work was scarcely their fault .
He was even more impressed by the tremendous military - industrial muscle that enabled 1,700 helicopters to be deployed in a single theater of war .
It also enabled a single operation by a single South Korean infantry company to be supported by no fewer than 21,000 artillery rounds .
As he noted , this was more than had been expended by all Israeli forces in the wars of 1948 and 1956 combined .
Still , nothing could make up for the lack of accurate and timely tactical intelligence .
Partly its absence was due to cultural obstacles ; wherever he went , translators were very much in demand and , of course , said exactly what they pleased .
Partly it was due to the physical conditions of the country , and partly to the nature of the War itself .
In Dayan ’s own words , the information available to the Americans was limited to : “ 1 . What they could photograph ; 2 .
What they could intercept ( SIGINT ) ; and 3 .
What they could glean from low - ranking prisoners . ”
As a result , most of the time they were using sledgehammers to knock holes in empty air .
So far they had not succeeded in inflicting unacceptable losses on the enemy who kept reinforcing .
Even if they did succeed , militarily , it was hard to see how the South Vietnamese would be able to set up a viable government in the shadow of the gigantic machine that “ protected ” them ; whether that machine would ever be withdrawn was anybody ’s guess .
As to what he was told of the war ’s objectives , such as defending democracy and helping the South Vietnamese people , he considered it “ childish ” propaganda ; if many of the Americans he met believed in them , clearly nobody else did .
Over a year before the Tet Offensive proved that something was very , very wrong , he left Vietnam with the definite impression that things were not going at all well .
In his own words , “ the Americans are winning everything — except the war . ”
Perhaps this was one reason why , instead of flying home by way of the United States as both Taylor and McNamara had asked him to do , he chose the other route .
When he wanted to he could be very tactful and rubbing salt into the Americans ’ wounds was the last thing he wanted .
The trip did , however , provide a welcome opportunity to keep his military knowledge up to date .
Some people claim that the US won the War in Vietnam , to which I can only say that I strongly disagree .
Others argue that Vietnam differed from Iraq , saying that it was essentially a conventional war that was lost because the American civilian leadership failed to provide its Armed Forces with proper strategic direction .
It is of course true that there are considerable differences between the two .
Still , recalling Dayan ’s observations , I think there are three main reasons why the similarities are more important .
First , according to Dayan , the most important operational problem the US Forces were facing was intelligence , in other words the inability to distinguish the enemy from either the physical surroundings or the civilian population .
Had intelligence been available then their enormous superiority in every kind of military hardware would have enabled them to win the War easily enough .
In its absence , most of the blows they delivered — including no fewer than six million tons of bombs dropped — hit empty air .
All they did was make the enemy disperse and merge into the civilian population , thus making it even harder to find him .
Worst of all , lack of accurate intelligence meant that the Americans kept hitting noncombatants by mistake .
They thus drove huge segments of the population straight into the arms of the Viet Cong ; nothing is more conducive to hatred than the sight of relatives and friends being killed .
Second , as Dayan saw clearly enough , the campaign for hearts and minds did not work .
Many of the figures being published about the progress it was making turned out to be bogus , designed to set the minds of the folks at home at rest .
In other cases any progress laboriously made over a period of months was undone in a matter of minutes as the Viet Cong attacked , destroying property and killing “ collaborators . ”
Above all , the idea that the Vietnamese people wanted to become Americanized was an illusion .
All the vast majority really wanted was to be left alone and get on with their lives .
The third and most important reason why I think Vietnam is relevant to the situation in Iraq is because the Americans found themselves in the unfortunate position where they were beating down on the weak .
To quote Dayan : “ any comparison between the two armies … was astonishing .
On the one hand there was the American Army , complete with helicopters , an air force , armor , electronic communications , artillery , and mind - boggling riches ; to say nothing of ammunition , fuel , spare parts , and equipment of all kinds .
On the other there were the [ North Vietnamese troops ] who had been walking on foot for four months , carrying some artillery rounds on their backs and using a tin spoon to eat a little ground rice from a tin plate . ”
That , of course , was precisely the problem .
In private life , an adult who keeps beating down on a five year old — even such a one as originally attacked him with a knife — will be perceived as committing a crime ; therefore he will lose the support of bystanders and end up by being arrested , tried and convicted .
In international life , an armed force that keeps beating down on a weaker opponent will be seen as committing a series of crimes ; therefore it will end up by losing the support of its allies , its own people , and its own troops .
Depending on the quality of the forces — whether they are draftees or professionals , the effectiveness of the propaganda machine , the nature of the political process , and so on — things may happen quickly or take a long time to mature .
However , the outcome is always the same .
He ( or she ) who does not understand this does not understand anything about war ; or , indeed , human nature .
In other words , he who fights against the weak — and the rag - tag Iraqi militias are very weak indeed — and loses , loses .
He who fights against the weak and wins also loses .
To kill an opponent who is much weaker than yourself is unnecessary and therefore cruel ; to let that opponent kill you is unnecessary and therefore foolish .
As Vietnam and countless other cases prove , no armed force however rich , however powerful , however , advanced , and however well motivated is immune to this dilemma .
The end result is always disintegration and defeat ; if U.S troops in Iraq have not yet started fragging their officers , the suicide rate among them is already exceptionally high .
That is why the present adventure will almost certainly end as the previous one did .
Namely , with the last US troops fleeing the country while hanging on to their helicopters ’ skids .

Ideas Opinion / Ideas Fixing Iraq , without us
The key to the crisis may lie in Northern Ireland and South Africa
Padraig O'Malley thinks Iraqi can learn from other divided societies .
( Globe Photo / Eric Jacobs )
WHEN POLITICIANS AND policy makers talk about fixing Iraq , the problem is usually portrayed as an intractable religious conflict among people incapable of putting their sectarian or tribal allegiances aside .
And Americans widely assume that we will have to fix it - or simply skulk away and let the Iraqis fight on in perpetuity .
But a new approach to resolving conflicts developed by a small group of negotiators from South Africa and Northern Ireland suggests there is another way to think about Iraq 's civil conflict , one in which the United States does n't play a central role , and in which Iraqis simplify and take control of their own resolution process .
This approach is to see Iraq as a divided society , much like Northern Ireland - a country whose people are split by fundamental disagreement and mistrust , but not one irretrievably broken or destined for chaos .
Fixing a divided society requires a set of tools not associated with traditional diplomacy : starting small , bringing disparate groups to neutral territory , and not expecting answers to emerge from governments .
" Governments can't deal with divided societies , because they do n't understand them , " said Padraig O'Malley , a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who has been working on a negotiating strategy for Iraq .
" People from divided societies are in the best position to help others from divided societies . "
The process can be slow and incremental , and by its nature is devoid of political sound bites .
But if it works , it can pay off in a way that traditional diplomacy cannot : creating a lasting peace from within , rather than a truce imposed by larger powers from outside .
Toward this end , O'Malley recently helped fly a group of Iraqi politicians , both Sunni and Shi'ite , to meet with South African and Irish politicians and civic leaders in a remote Finnish resort for four days .
The conference , they hope , could be the first step in a new , simplified approach to resolving what is widely seen as the world 's most complicated conflict .
The roots of this approach stretch back to South Africa 's transition out of apartheid .
For years , that country 's ruling white minority had simply ignored the people in the black majority , refusing to recognize their democratic mandate and , more importantly , their humanity .
As the apartheid regime began to lose its grip on power , the situation had all the ingredients for a bitter civil war .
But when Cyril Ramaphosa , the African National Congress 's chief negotiator , and his white National Party counterpart Roelf Meyer started meeting regularly in low - key , unpublicized sessions , they discovered that they connected at a basic , human level .
The enormity of the gulf between their two sides narrowed when they started talking about what kind of country they wanted for their children .
The unexpectedly smooth transition away from apartheid had a profound effect on O'Malley .
A Dublin - born scholar who had spent much of the 1970s and 1980s in Northern Ireland , he began spending large chunks of time in South Africa .
In both countries , he went beyond just studying the conflicts , becoming involved in the resolution , trying to get the combatants who spoke to him to speak to one another as well .
In 1992 , O'Malley helped bring South Africans who had helped end apartheid to Boston to meet with representatives from the various warring factions in Northern Ireland .
They met at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum , ostensibly to discuss how a bill of rights might help resolve generations of conflict in both countries .
But , in O'Malley 's mind , it was as much about getting the Africans and the Irish to know one another .
In 1996 , with O'Malley 's help , Ramaphosa and Meyer went to Belfast for a second round of discussions with those in Northern Ireland .
The following year , at a follow - up conference in South Africa , Nelson Mandela , then the president of South Africa , spoke to two separate groups from Northern Ireland - Protestant unionists who wanted it to remain part of the United Kingdom , and Catholic nationalists and republicans who aspired to unity with the Irish Republic .
Mandela did not pull punches .
He said the Irish Republican Army had to call a cease - fire .
He said unionists had to engage with Irish republicans , even before the IRA gave up its weapons .
Officials from Sinn Féin , the IRA 's political wing , almost all of them former IRA members , were impressed by Mac Maharaj , the last militant leader in the African National Congress to put his gun down .
Maharaj , who was a hero to many IRA leaders , explained how Mandela , his former cellmate on Robben Island , convinced him that armed struggle had become counterproductive , that they had to negotiate with the Afrikaners .
" People who could n't be seen talking to each other in Belfast did talk to each other in Boston and Johannesburg , " O'Malley said .
" There were real , human connections . "
Last year , against most predictions , the IRA disbanded and gave up its weapons .
Last May , against all predictions , the fundamentalist Protestant preacher the Rev. Ian Paisley , leader of the biggest unionist party , put aside a lifetime of anti-Catholic and anti-republican rhetoric and went into a power - sharing government with Martin McGuinness , the former chief of staff of the IRA .
McGuinness said Mandela telling him " you make peace with your enemies , not your friends " had a profound effect on him .
" It sounds simple , I know , " McGuinness said .
" But when he said it , it meant something .
He was asking us to do something he had done himself . "
The experiences in South Africa and Northern Ireland gave O'Malley and the negotiators from those countries a few basic principles they believed were crucial to success , and they see Iraq as another case where it could work .
First , Iraq 's civil conflict must be seen not as a dizzying clash of civilizations , but one of a society that has been divided because of a particular set of historical circumstances .
Such conflicts are rooted in basic human emotions of fear , mistrust , and prejudice .
The Iraqi politicians O'Malley has spoken with complain that the Sunni-Shia divide is a simplistic paradigm used by outsiders to reduce a complex societal division to something that the West can understand .
The Iraqis insist the division is based not on religion , but on influence and power - who controls and distributes resources and jobs .
There was a similar paradigm in Northern Ireland :
The conflict was often described as being between Catholics and Protestants , when the combatants themselves insisted that it was really over national identity and power , and that religious affiliation was coincidental , not causal .
Second , these negotiators have found that individuals , not governments , hold the key to resolving conflict .
High - level diplomats seldom live in the midst of conflict , and are not condemned to live with the consequences of failure .
Those who have lived through violent conflict have considerably more credibility with those currently living in it .
" It 's like addiction , " says O'Malley .
" It 's only when you put addicts together that they relate to each other the way others can't .
They tell each other stories in which they recognize their own behavior . "
Self - determination and ownership of the process are also crucial .
During the Northern Ireland talks , Mandela insisted that facilitators from his country would only continue brokering talks if the parties there formally asked for their involvement .
That established a key principle in the new approach : Nothing would be imposed , and those still engaged in conflict had to make all the big decisions .
Third , it is OK , in fact probably necessary , for the opposing parties to confront each other outside their home turf .
O'Malley and the others found that political enemies or rivals could engage one another more openly and honestly if they got away from the fishbowl of domestic politics - and if they did n't give press conferences while negotiating , which can reduce the process to horse trading or , worse , demagoguery .
O'Malley said it 's crucial that negotiations take their natural course , over months or years , without being subject to partisan posturing .
Since their success in Northern Ireland , individual negotiators from both South Africa and Northern Ireland have traveled to other places of deep - seated civil conflict - to the Basques , the Palestinians , the Bosnians , among others .
The results have been mixed .
After some promising developments in talks between Basque separatists and the Spanish government , for instance , the negotiations stalled and violence recently resumed .
O'Malley believes their approach could bear fruit in the Middle East , where big , stage - managed , government - sponsored peace talks , such as the Oslo Accords , have gotten plenty of attention but failed to produce lasting settlements .
During the last week of August , O'Malley spirited a group of 16 Iraqis to a Finnish resort a few hours ' drive from Helsinki .
They were met there by a large group of African and Irish negotiators - the first time the group had gathered collectively and tried to replicate the success they had in ending the Troubles in Northern Ireland .
The conference was privately organized , and funded by Robert Bendetson , chief of the Cabot House furniture chain and a former student of O'Malley 's at Tufts University .
The Iraqi delegation was made up of Sunni and Shi'ite politicians , including those loyal to the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , and representatives close to various militia and insurgent groups .
It also included the minister for national reconciliation , Akram al - Hakim .
The Africans and the Irish began by explaining not how they succeeded , but where they had initially failed .
It was a deliberate strategy to not appear as preachy know - it - alls .
When the Northern Irish politicians explained the difficulty of trying to engage with enemies at the same time they were trying to reassure their individual constituencies they were not selling out , the Iraqis nodded in recognition .
One session was led jointly by McGuinness , the former IRA chief of staff and now deputy first minister of the power - sharing government in Northern Ireland , and Jeffrey Donaldson , a leading member of the Democratic Unionist Party , which represents most Protestants in Northern Ireland .
Ten years ago , Donaldson refused to be in the same room as McGuinness during a peace conference in South Africa , viewing him as a murderer .
Quintin Oliver , a political strategist from Northern Ireland , said the Iraqis reacted during the conference much as the Northern Irish did when they first met with South African facilitators in Boston and at follow - up conferences :
The first couple of days were devoted mainly to Iraqis asking questions of the Irish and the Africans , but then the Iraqis began talking to one another .
One of the Iraqis came up to O'Malley and said , " We have never talked this frankly to each other about our problems . "
The Iraqis sequestered themselves on the final day .
After five hours together , they came up with a 12 - point communique pledging themselves to democratic principles and reconciliation .
Much of it was based on the Mitchell Principles , the blueprint used in the Northern Ireland talks a decade ago by George Mitchell , the former US senator from Maine .
As news of the Finland conference spread , skeptics were quick to point out that few of those in attendance had real power in Iraq , either in mainstream politics or in the various armed groups .
O'Malley responds that this approach to conflict resolution is a progression , that there is an initial feeling - out process , and that follow - up sessions begin to draw a broader , more influential cast of characters .
" The way these things start is always the same , " he said .
" You begin with the step of bringing them together .
Then you get them used to being together , that there are valuable lessons to be learned from these other experiences , especially the formulation of power - sharing , and the reform of the security services .
If they accept these principles as a basis of how negotiations can happen , then we 'll see another round .
" But before they negotiate , they 've got to know who 's in , who 's out , what are the ground rules , and how does the collective treat people who remain outside the process , " he said .
" Negotiating the rules is the prelude to the real thing . "
Whether there will be another conference similar to the one in Finland is up to the Iraqis .
O'Malley plans to return to Iraq next month to assess the appetite for another round .
If there is , he predicts , there will be more senior and influential representatives of both mainstream Sunni and Shi'ite groups and the various insurgencies .
O'Malley also hopes to extend his peer - mentoring idea to other conflicted areas .
This week representatives from truth and reconciliation commissions in Guatemala , El Salvador , Chile , and South Africa will gather at UMass - Boston to share their experiences with those from Northern Ireland and Serbia , where such commissions are in the planning stages .
" You 've got to walk , " O'Malley said , " before you run . "

There 's a sinister reason why some journalists believe " the surge " is having a small effect in Iraq militarily .
It 's because we 're actually fighting against the government we helped create .
This is sick .

BLITZER : What did you think of what we heard from General Odierno , suggesting that some progress , in fact , is being achieved on the battlefield against Al Qaida in Iraq and other elements there ?
Because the critics , a lot of critics , are suggesting , yes , there may be some progress , but it wo n't make much difference in the long run , as long as that sectarian rift that exists between the Sunni , the Shia and the Kurds continues to exist .
WARE : Yes , well , General Ray Odierno very much has his finger on the pulse of this war , and his assessment is entirely correct .
Yes , there has been some stabilization , some spectacular examples , like in al - Anbar province .
Yes , it 's forced changes in the type of violence that we 're seeing here .
But Iraqi innocents are still dying in their hundreds and thousands every month .
And what we 're failing to address is how we achieving these successes in bringing down the violence is by cutting a deal with the tribes , the Baathists and the Sunni insurgents .
It 's by creating Sunni militias to counteract the government 's own militias and the Iranian - backed militias .
That 's bound to have long - term consequences .
In many ways , part of what 's being achieved is because America is turning somewhat , despite its rhetoric , against this government , fostering Sunni militias , questioning the role of this government , questioning whether it can actually perform .
And we Ambassador Crocker , just the other day , say that if Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki does not deliver , then American support is not at the end of a blank check .
So he 's threatening the prime minister .
Police picked Osbourne because he was in North Dakota for a gig
A party supposedly involving the star was organised in Fargo , North Dakota - but it was actually a scam by officers to round up missing criminal suspects .
Five hundred people with outstanding arrest warrants were sent invitations , and more than 30 suspects turned up .
Osbourne said it was " insulting " that his name was used but police argued it was a " creative " way to fight crime .
The star was selected because he was due to play a gig in a nearby arena , which was used to explain why he would supposedly be attending the event .
' Lazy policework '
Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said he " meant no disrespect toward Mr Osbourne or his show " .
" What we did was a very creative law enforcement technique to lure individuals who had active criminal warrants to come to us . "
All of those who attended were detained , he added .
But this did not impress the former Black Sabbath singer .
" Instead of holding a press conference to pat himself on the back , Sheriff Laney should be apologising to me for using my name in connection with these arrests , " Osbourne said .
" It is insulting to me and to my audience and it shows how lazy this particular sheriff is when it comes to doing his job . "
My understanding of mortgage banking is minimal .
There are a few others here ( and here ) and around the blogosphere who understand this much better than I do .
But this I get : the mortgage industry lobby is winning in its fight to turn around strong legislation that would have prohibited the payment of " yield spread premiums " to mortgage brokers .
That would have saved a lot of you a lot of money .
What 's a yield spread premium ?
Basically , if you go to a mortgage broker and ask him to get you a good mortgage deal , he takes your financial information and goes out on the market to see what he can get for you .
You go merrily along , thinking your broker is working for you , trying to get you the best deal he can .
Meanwhile , he talks to lenders and gets you the best rate he can get based on what you qualify for , only get this : he 's under no obligation to actually tell you what the best deal he can get really is .
Instead , he can tack on some extra points to your mortgage rate and just tell you that was the deal instead .
And if you agree to take it , guess who gets paid the extra money ?
That 's right .
The mortgage broker you thought was working to get you the best rate available .
If a lender says you qualify for a loan at 5 % , but your mortgage broker thinks you 'll accept 5.25 % and he turns out to be right , part of that extra .25 % goes to him , and you 're none the wiser .
Sound fair to you ?
Well , the House Financial Services Committee , in its consideration of H.R. 3915 , is under tremendous pressure to let it slide .
What do you think about that ?
Want to tell 'em ?

Everyone knows , do n't they , that most untoward events generally have banal explanations such as muddle , incompetence or sheer blind chance .
To believe otherwise is to run the risk of being branded a ' conspiracy theorist ' , a small step away from being lumped together with the kind of people who think that crop circles are designed by visitors from Mars or that Princess Diana was murdered by MI6 .
The death of the weapons inspector Dr David Kelly in 2003 triggered a political firestorm of the highest order .
His apparent suicide put the Government under enormous pressure following his unmasking as the source of the BBC 's claim that the Government had ' sexed up ' the case for war in Iraq .
All attention focused on the epic battle between Alastair Campbell and the BBC over this claim , and the treatment the Government meted out to Dr Kelly .
Even though the inquiry into the affair by Lord Hutton exonerated ministers and officials of virtually all charges , merely rebuking them for not having warned Dr Kelly that his name was about to be made public , the Government was still widely blamed for driving him to his death .
Suspicions
Right from the start , however , there were many who were not convinced Dr Kelly had taken his own life at all .
Many aspects of the story just did n't seem to add up .
First was the character of the man and his demeanour on the day he died .
Although he was under intense pressure , he was known to be a strong character and belonged to the Baha'i faith , which prohibits suicide .
Those closest to him ( such as his sister ) , and even neighbours he met on his last walk , said that on the day he died he had shown no signs of depression .
The Hutton inquiry , and the experts it called , dismissed out of hand any idea that Dr Kelly had not killed himself .
But the suspicions would n't go away , and developed a life of their own on the internet .
Claims were made that Dr Kelly 's body had been moved from its original prone position on the ground , and propped up against a tree .
Items said to have been found near his body had not been seen by the paramedics who first found him .
And so on .
Such claims were given considerably more authority in 2004 when three medical specialists wrote in a letter to the Press that they did not believe the official finding that Dr Kelly died either from haemorrhaging from a severed ulnar artery in his wrist , or from an overdose of coproxamol tablets , or a combination of the two .
Such an artery , they said , was of matchstick thickness and severing it would not lead to the kind of blood loss that would kill someone .
They also pointed out that , according to the ambulance team at the scene , the quantity of blood around the body was minimal — hardly what one would expect if someone has just haemorrhaged to death .
Even stranger , although Dr Kelly was said to have swallowed 29 coproxamol tablets , only one - fifth of one tablet was found in his stomach , and the level found in his blood was far less than a fatal dose .
Despite the expertise of these sceptics , their claims went largely unnoticed .
The implications seemed too far - fetched to be taken seriously .
After all , if Dr Kelly did not commit suicide , and clearly did n't just drop dead of natural causes , he must have been killed .
Who could have done such a deed ?
The Iraqi secret service ?
Our own ?
Shadowy terrorists lying in wait in the Oxfordshire woods armed with undetectable poisons and an array of evidence to lay a false trail and bamboozle everyone ?
No , this kind of thinking properly belonged in the pages of John Le Carre 's fiction .
But now , it has not only been taken up within Parliament , but the original charges of inconsistency have been embellished with much more evidence which can no longer be ignored .
Discrepancies
The tenacious Lib Dem MP Norman Baker gave up his front - bench job to investigate these claims .
What he has uncovered is remarkable and poses questions which demand to be answered .
Mr Baker has not only found experts who confirm the analysis of the three doctors about the discrepancies and scientific improbabilities in the official account .
He has also discovered that only one person in the UK was said to have killed himself by slitting his ulnar artery that year — and that was Dr Kelly .
This is hardly surprising since this is just about the most improbable way to commit suicide , made even more difficult by the inappropriate knife that Dr Kelly is said to have used .
More explosively still , however , are Mr Baker 's discoveries ( published in yesterday 's Mail on Sunday ) about the behaviour of the police and the coroner .
The normal practice in such circumstances
would be for the coroner to issue a temporary death certificate pending the official inquiry into such a death .
But in this case , the coroner issued an unprecedented full death certificate , just one week after the inquiry started into the circumstances of Dr Kelly 's demise — and after the coroner had held a meeting with Home Office officials .
What on earth could have been the point of such a meeting at such a sensitive time , except for the Government to direct the coroner in some unspecified and possibly improper way ?
As for the police , their behaviour appears to have been even more bizarre .
According to Mr Baker , their operation to investigate Dr Kelly 's death started around nine hours before the weapons expert was reported missing .
What astounding prescience !
With such psychic powers among the police , one wonders there is any crime at all .
Many of these curiosities surfaced in evidence to the Hutton inquiry , only to be batted away .
Lord Hutton 's brief was simply to inquire into ' the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly ' .
Clearly , he could have investigated the manner of his death , but he chose not to do so .
Inexperienced
Instead , he took it as a given that Dr Kelly had taken his own life — and stated that he was satisfied by claims which we are now told were scientifically impossible , that Dr Kelly killed himself by slitting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by the number of coproxamol tablets he had taken .
Mr Baker claims that Lord Hutton was chosen at speed by a cabal around the Prime Minister because he was inexperienced and could be relied upon to toe the line .
When his report exonerated the Government , he was rounded upon as a patsy by those who were certain that it had Dr Kelly 's blood on its hands .
But maybe , just like Lord Hutton himself , such critics missed the fact that he had asked the wrong questions altogether .
Now , it has taken just one terrier - like MP to unearth all this information .
Why has no official body asked the same questions about all these obvious peculiarities ?
Why has no one given a straight answer to those who have raised them ?
What is the point of going to the expense and public performance of a high - profile official inquiry , only to find that the most basic of questions about evidence that is either contradictory or does n't stand up to scrutiny have n't even been asked ?
In the light of all this , the coroner 's decision not to resume the inquest into Dr Kelly 's death because there were ' no exceptional circumstances ' appears totally unsustainable .
A full inquest is now imperative to get to the bottom of this disturbing mystery once and for all .

SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) --
The " Mona Lisa " has long been shrouded in mystery , including one long - standing question about the famous lady :
What happened to her eyebrows and eyelashes ?
A French engineer and inventor examined the famous painting with a camera of his own design .
Now , a French engineer and inventor says he 's uncovered part of the enigma .
Pascal Cotte announced at a press conference Wednesday that he has found definitive proof that when Leonardo da Vinci painted the original portrait he included " Mona Lisa 's " lashes and brows .
Cotte examined the world 's most famous painting using a high - definition camera of his own design .
The device scanned a 240 - million pixel image using 13 light spectrums , including ultra-violet and infrared .
The resulting ultra-high resolution photograph of 150,000 dots per inch yielded a reproduction of the " Mona Lisa 's " face magnified 24 times .
And there Cotte found the evidence he sought -- a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left brow .
Watch as expert announces findings on " Mona Lisa " »
" One day I say , if I can find only one hair , only one hair of the eyebrow , I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow , " said Cotte .
So , if she once had lashes , where did they go ?
Possibly faded pigment , Cotte suggested , or possibly a poor attempt to clean the painting .
" And if you look closely at the eye of ' Mona Lisa ' you can clearly see that the cracks around the eye have slightly disappeared , and that may be explained that one day a curator or restorer cleaned the eye , and cleaning the eye , removed , probably removed the eyelashes and eyebrow , " he said .
Cotte 's high resolution camera led him to numerous additional discoveries about the enigmatic artwork .
The infrared layer of the image shows that the fingers of the " Mona Lisa 's " left hand were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait .
Cotte said the change in position was the result of a lap blanket held by Leonardo 's model .
In today 's faded image the blanket is all but obscured , but the highly detailed camera detected the faded pigment .
" It was really the first time that we have this kind of position of the arm , " Cotte said , " and after Leonardo da Vinci , thousands of painters have made a copy of this position but without understanding why we have this position .
The real justification of the position of the wrist is to hold the blanket on her stomach .
It 's really a great , for me , it 's really a great discovery . "
One of the results of Cotte 's work is a " virtual " restoration of the painting , an exact replica showing the original colors as they would have looked when the painting was new .
The skin tones of Leonardo 's model appear as a warm pink and the sky behind her is a glowing blue , far different from the gray - green tint that covers the artwork today .
That dark patina is the result of 500 years of aging , according to Cotte .
Cotte presented numerous other findings within the infrared layer he photographed .
The researcher said the " Mona Lisa 's " smile was originally slightly wider than it appears today , and , in fact , so was her entire face .
Leonardo kept this painting with him for more than a decade , and is said to have worked on it up until his death .
The Renaissance artist once said , " Art is never finished , only abandoned . "
The results of Cotte 's study are on display at the Metreon in San Francisco , as part of the exhibit " Da Vinci : An Exhibition of Genius . "

I 've been reading through Richard Dawkins ' books and am currently half way through The Blind Watchmaker ( 2006 paperback edition ) and on page 119 he writes :
Of course , this piqued my curiosity .
Did Dawkins just make that up , or is this really the contents of a specific bit of memory on a specific computer ?
The book was first published in 1986 , so I just had to figure out what it was .
Starting with the instructions and converting to hex we have AD 30 C0 .
Now , considering the main processors around at the time there are three possible interpretations of these three bytes :
XOR L ; JR NC C0 : LDA C030 : JSR 30C0
The first did n't look at all plausible , but both the other two do .
The 6809 looks like it could be calling a sub-routine at location 30C0 and the 6502 would work if C030 were actually memory - mapped I/O and a read was necessary to cause the blip .
I could n't find any machine with a meaningful interpretation of the 30C0 location on a 6809 machine , but 6502 turned out to be a different story .
On an Apple ] [ memory in the range C000 - C0 FF is mapped to various bits of I/O : Poking around further I discovered that a read from C030 ( known as SPKR ) will blip the speaker on an Apple ] [ .
So Dawkins is telling the truth and he 's using an Apple ] [ .
So returning to the memory locations what program is he talking about ?
The three memory locations are FBE9 , FBEA and FBEB .
That turns out to be inside the Monitor ROM on an Apple ] [ ( the stuff that Woz wrote ) and happily a complete ROM listing was provided with the Apple ] [ .
So looking in a scanned Apple ] [ manual we find that those locations are inside the BELL2 routine .
Specifically on page 163 of the manual we find the following :
The line in bold is exactly the code that Dawkins is referrring to .
So , while writing this famous text on evolution , Dawkins had time to poke around inside the Apple ] [ ROM and write about it in his book .

NEW YORK - Scientists at Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc. say they have created a drug that mimics the ingredient in red wine linked to longevity and the cell structures that power endurance athletes like cycling champion Lance Armstrong .
The new molecule is 1,000 times more potent than the wine derivative , resveratrol , and could lead to solutions for diseases of aging , including cancer and diabetes , according to authors of a study in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
Researchers tested about 500,000 molecules for abilities to activate the immune - system booster SIRT1 , the enzyme credited with resveratrol 's ability to extend lifespans 30 to 70 percent in organisms from yeast and worms to flies and mice .
Human testing on the most promising ones will begin next year , said David Sinclair , an author of the study .
" These are real drugs .
This is not something out of red wine anymore , " said Sinclair , a professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of Cambridge - based Sirtris .
The study is " proof of a principle that you can put something into the food supply that will ward off and treat the diseases of aging in a single pill . "
Sirtris 's stock rose 7.8 percent to $ 18.38 yesterday .
The company , which went public in May , had seen its share price climb 71 percent through Tuesday .
Mice and rats given three of the molecules responded like those in other experiments testing extreme calorie - restricting diets , even though the rodents continued to eat and weigh the same .
They showed increased insulin sensitivity , lower blood - sugar levels , and more powerful mitochondria , the " power packs of the cell " that diminish with age .
" That 's where it gets interesting , " Sinclair said .
If you give resveratrol to a normal mouse , it can run twice as far because it has many more mitochondria , he said .
Seven - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has extra mitochondria that power his endurance abilities , Sinclair said .
" The goal is not to make Lance Armstrongs of everyone , but you can imagine that it would boost the energy of someone who is frail and weak , " Sinclair said .
Sirtris has about 140 patents and patent applications related to the so - called aging gene , and some of the most effective treatments for boosting SIRT1 were discovered after the Nature study was submitted for publication a year ago , Sinclair said .
Results from animal studies of those drugs will be released next year , he said .
Sirtris was founded by Sinclair , chairman of its scientific board , and Christoph Westphal , the chief executive , to study activators of SIRT1 and its related class of enzymes .
Other treatments for diseases of aging rely on complicated technology that may take years to develop , Westphal said .
The sirtuin gene was first reported by Leonard Guarente , a biology professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose lab also discovered the aging benefits of restricted diets in mice .
Sinclair , his post - doctoral student at the time , moved to Harvard in 1999 to develop drugs that could act in the same way .
He discovered resveratrol in 2003 .

Researchers in Colorado are reporting the first successful “ wiring up ” of hydrogenase enzymes .
Those much - heralded proteins are envisioned as stars in a future hydrogen economy where they may serve as catalysts for hydrogen production and oxidation in fuel cells .
Their report , describing a successful electrical connection between a carbon nanotube and hydrogenase , is scheduled for the Nov. issue of Nano Letters .
In the new study , Michael J. Heben , Paul W. King , and colleagues explain that bacterial enzymes called hydrogenases show promise as powerful catalysts for using hydrogen in fuel cells , which can produce electricity with virtually no pollution for motor vehicles , portable electronics , and other devices .
However , scientists report difficulty incorporating these enzymes into electrical devices because the enzymes do not form good electrical connections with fuel cell components .
Currently , precious metals , such as platinum , are typically needed to perform this catalysis .
The researchers combined hydrogenase enzymes with carbon nanotubes , submicroscopic strands of pure carbon that are excellent electrical conductors .
In laboratory studies , the researchers demonstrated that a good electrical connection was established using photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements .
These new “ biohybrid ” conjugates could reduce the cost of fuel cells by reducing or eliminating the need for platinum and other costly metal components , they say .

Brian Davey was a respected music teacher and author A victim of a paedophile teacher has asked for his music textbooks for children to be banned .
Does the work , or the art , of someone who has committed such a crime have to be condemned ?
To some within the music fraternity , there are two Brian Daveys .
One a devious paedophile jailed last year for sexually abusing girls as young as four .
The other was a respected music teacher who wrote books on the recorder that many tutors regard as among the best textbooks for children .
To his step - daughter Antoinette Lyons , now 33 , the two are inseparable .
She has waived the anonymity accorded to victims of sexual abuse to call for his books to be withdrawn : " In my opinion they were written with one aim - to get to children . "
This echoes an age - old conundrum from the world of art .
Can you value work produced by someone whose private life and acts you find appalling ?
Do the proclivities of those responsible for artistic or intellectual works have to be taken into account in their appreciation ?
Fiona MacCarthy wrote a biography of the sculptor and typographer Eric Gill in 1989 that dropped a small bomb on the art world .
Gill was one of the most respected artists of the 20th Century .
His statue Prospero and Ariel adorns the BBC's Broadcasting House and the Creation of Adam is in the lobby of the Palais des Nations , now the European HQ of the United Nations in Geneva .
But MacCarthy 's book revealed that he regularly had sex with two of his daughters , his sisters and even the family dog .
These encounters he recorded in his diary .
Piece of work
For some of Gill 's fans , even looking at his work became impossible .
Most problematically , he was a Catholic convert who created some of the most popular devotional art of his era , such as the Stations of the Cross in Westminster Cathedral , where worshippers pray at each panel depicting the suffering of Jesus .
Gill 's work remains popular
In 1998 , spurred on by a cardinal 's praise for Gill , Margaret Kennedy , who campaigns for Ministers and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors , called for the works to be removed .
" Survivors could n't pray at the Stations of the Cross .
They were done by a paedophile .
The very hands that carved the stations were the hands that abused .
" He abused his maids , his prostitutes , animals , he was having sex with everything that moved - a very deranged man sexually . "
But the Catholic Church would not budge an inch .
The former Westminster Cathedral administrator , Bishop George Stack , retains an unequivocal view .
" There was no consideration given to taking these down .
A work of art stands in its own right .
Once it has been created it takes on a life of its own . "
It might be easier to make this argument for the Stations of the Cross than for nude sketches of Gill 's teenage daughter .
Thoughts and deeds
Gill is not the first artist to have committed terrible misdeeds .
Travel back a few hundred years and you have the moral conundrums of the work of Caravaggio [ painter , killer , supposed homoerotic depiction of boys ] or Gesualdo [ composer and double killer ] .
Do we turn our eyes away from his wonderful works of art or do we try to explore further and see how they were arrived at
Fiona MacCarthy
And if attitudes count as well as deeds then there are Wagner [ composer , raging anti-Semite ] and Larkin [ poet , supposed racist and sexist ] .
" If you actually stop looking or listening to people whose moral conduct you disapprove of , you are not left with all that much , " MacCarthy says .
" Gill 's behaviour was obviously reprehensible .
He was a child abuser and he did completely renege on his Catholic principles .
" But what do we do ?
Do we turn our eyes away from his wonderful works of art or do we , as I think we should , try to explore further and see how they were arrived at . "
Censor or celebrate
There are those who would defend Davey 's books .
Teachers who value the texts explain their position on internet forums .
Essentially , the books are useful and contain nothing untoward - it's only the association with Davey that casts a shadow over the content .
And perhaps it could be argued that there is an important distinction between an intellectual work like this and art .
A manual does not demand a sense of allegiance .
It does not provoke exalted feelings in the user or a sense of celebration as some art does .
But to Davey 's step - daughter the issue is simple .
The books are used with children , despite it being known that he used teaching - and by extension his books - to get close to his victims .
Ms Kennedy says the feelings of the victims are as important as any philosophising - and to them a ban is a " marker of his abuse , a tangible , public statement that we find what he has done horrendous " .
Artists questioned the Nazi experiments in this Berlin show Philosopher Mark Sheehan , of Oxford University 's James Martin 21st Century School , says moral complexities do arise because of the relationship between the artist and the art in the mind of the audience .
But in Davey 's case , and whether an intellectual work can be intrinsically immoral , there are echoes of a debate on the ethics of scientific data .
Ethicist Baruch Cohen once wrote that using data from Nazi experiments that involved cruelty and torture was like washing with a bar of soap made from concentration camp dead .
But Sheehan says it 's possible to make a distinction between the quality of a piece of science and the ethics of how it was obtained .
This might apply to Davey 's work .
More is known about the private lives of artists - not least because many draw on their experiences for their work - so moral dilemmas will continue to arise .
In Gill 's case the outrage has not significantly undermined his status .
The BBC uses Gill Sans typefaces in corporate branding and Westminster Cathedral retains its Stations of the Cross .
" There are people who said I destroyed the work for them because of what we now know .
The feeling that what they knew had made those abhorrent as works of art , " MacCarthy says .
" Since the book was published in 1989 his reputation has in fact increased .
The [ campaigners ' ] attitude was probably in the minority . "
But for every viewer who can separate the art and the artist , there will be another who can't .
For every dispassionate critic , there is another who can't ignore the crimes of the artist .
For every philosophical purist , another with a gut feeling that the work of paedophiles should be shunned .
Send us your comments using the form below .
The books should continue to be published and used for what they are .
By the law of averages there are nasty people working in banks for example , but there is no suggestion that we should close our accounts .
Why not use the royalties to help a charity working in this area - Childline for example .
Jeremy Rawlings , Milton Keynes According to Freud , Leonardo da vinci abused the young students in his care , as a means of satisfying his narcissistic homosexuality .
Has anybody refused to look at his work on this basis ?
Jeremy , London
As someone who carries out investigations of computers belonging to suspected paedophiles with a view to gathering evidence where it is available , I would challenge Alext , Ian B and any others like them to continue holding the view they do after having been forced to actually see with their own eyes the utterly revolting acts that these kind of filth perpetuate and get a thrill from viewing - I find it hard to believe that anyone , having seen this kind of material , could want anything less than complete erasure from existance of anything linked to individuals that commit such abhorrent acts .
As for bringing poets persecuted for their sexuality into the debate - sorry , how is this in any way relevant ?
Homosexual poets from ages gone by were persecuted due to the ignorance of the time - I pray that there will never be a time when sexually abusing defenceless children is deemed acceptable .
Comparing the two situations is a huge insult to all non heterosexuals accross the world is it not ?
Alex , London
Work of art , be it in any form , is a medium of expression and right of every artist .
Interestingly , not everyone will look at it and draw same meaning out of it .
If ten people are asked to review a painting without having any prior knowledge about the painter and his history , they will all have different perceptions about it .
I think there is no need to destroy any genius ' work ?
I agree that it may be disturbing for the victims yet how can one destroy a masterpiece for personal reasons ?
Secondly , I think an artist¿s personal and professional life should never be mixed up .
Meera , Karachi , Pakistan
There seem to be several arguments here on a number of different areas .
The reason that Davey wrote the books was to be able to get close to children .
This is very different to an artist who did terrible things but did n't produce their art to facilitate their crimes .
In these cases we can differentiate between the person and the art , but in the case of Davey , the person , the work and the crime are the same thing .
Maybe we should allow the books to continue being produced , but remove his authorship and give the proceeds to a charity related to the crime .
Anon Surely whilst a convicted paedophile is in prison he simply should not be allowed to make money on the open market to enjoy as his pension when released .
This is not a question about art , it is more complex than that .
We should not allow our rapists and murderers to enjoy market forces whatever their creations if they are convicted and serving a prison sentence .
The legal maxim stands that noone should profit from their criminal activity .
Drug dealers have their assets seized .
In Davey 's case his work is targeted at children so any profit made is too closely connected to the subject matter of his crimes .
He should not be allowed to have these books published and circulated to children .
As a society we have become too politically correct .
Sascha , Edinburgh I 'm undecided .
As a graphic designer who studied Eric Gill at college , I do n't even like using his typeface , Gill Sans , in my work .
Then again , I really used to enjoy Chris Langham 's comedy work .
I 'd hate never to listen to his radio series again .
David , London , UK I think the problem is that these works frighten people .
They are reminders of the complexity of human life .
We would much prefer it if our " monsters " could only do monstrous things as it helps us catagorise them .
If the monsters are instead capable of also doing good things then it makes us feel more uncomfortable as it makes us think of them as human with both human talents and human failings .
Richard , Chester Fullest sympathies and understanding to the victims of abusers but , if we judge all works by the worst points of their creators , we will have very little left .
If the school music book is useful then use it .
The fact that someone can produce a thing of meaning or beauty , but also carry out evil acts , shows us the true nature of humanity .
We must use our judgement , not our prejudice when considering what is worthy .
Alext , London
There must be millions of artists , musicians , writers etc who are questionable human beings despite their ability in their chosen field , and accordingly there must be millions more fans who have to decide between their admiration for the work and revulsion for the person .
The fact is , just because you like a certain painting , album or book does n't mean you condone the unrelated actions of the creator , and there should n't have to be a choice unless that creator is allowed to carry on illegal activity because of who they are .
Shona , Greenock , Scotland
No need for a high profile ban of Davey 's music textbooks - the publisher could quietly delete them & let the supply dwindle away .
Where the crimes & the readership are so closely linked , it 'd clearly be wrong to keep selling , and profiting from , them .
Hirsty , Surrey A very difficult one .
With knowledge , abhorrent ; in ignorance , lauded and accepted .
By the same token , should we destroy the Forth Bridge or the Bridge over the River Kwai , given that they cost so many lives , or buildings in London erected from slave labour money ?
A part of me says that the brain which was so depraved as to commit these sickening acts we rightly deride is the same brain that produced the creations we marvel at ; perhaps these faculties are n't mutually exclusive ...
Alex , Edinburgh Possibly the copyright of a seriously criminal artist should be stripped from him and the works officially attributed to a past artist of comparable merit .
Miland Joshi , Birmingham Miland , I almost agree with this , but the danger is we'd be headed to an Orwelllian nightmare of a society , where the authorities are able to rewrite history .
The best thing to do is let people decide for themselves .
If schools refuse to use this book , the publisher will probaby stop printing it .
Tony Enticknap , London
How can one contemplate even keeping it ?
This can not be celebrated even though it is an artistic gift .
What has happened to the moral duty to the victims who will be affected for the rest of their lives .
Society needs to do the right thing .
Zainah Zain , Cardiff
Maybe these works of art should be taken down and stored away until such a time as the people who have been abused or hurt by these artists have long since passed away .
Artwork done by similar artists of the past does not bother us now because there is no - one it can offend as they have long since gone .
Ben Rattigan , Hartlepool I would propose a contemporary author revises the books and Davey 's authorship is removed , as that may be more respectful to the survivors of his abuse , and means that the valuable work is not lost .
Chandra , London
If you destroy or proscribe art simply because you do not like its creator , then you run the risk of comparison with Nazi Germany where books were burned simply because they were written by Jews .
Many convicted criminals have produced great works .
Great poets were persecuted for their homosexuality in times past .
We should celebrate and cherish the creation of great art - whatever its source .
Ian B , Knutsford , Cheshire Ian , you simply can not compare sexually abusing children to homosexuality and being Jewish .
Homosexuality is not a crime and neither is being a Jew .
Neither harms anyone or destroy lives and neither of these things are illegal .
Sexually abusing children is illegal and does destroy lives .
It is not a matter of simply disliking the creator .
The creator and his works are inherently linked and while condoning one may not be directly condoning the other it is is incredibly dismissive of and insulting to abuse survivors to allow his work to be circulated , particularly in schools .

What are these ?
If you 're a regular visitor ( reader ) of my blog , you 'll probably know that I really like optical illusions .
Here 's another article about this phenomenon , now it 's all about optical illusions with words .
I 'll start off with a classic .
Check out the following image .
Say aloud the ink color of each word .
How quickly can you do it ?
Did you slow down ?
The next one is a really cool wedding card .
When the card is closed , you 'll see the name of the bride .
When opened , the name of the groom will appear .
Can you discover the names of the newly weds ?
This one is pretty strange .
Just look at the words below .
Does n't make any sense , does it ?
Now sit back and try to read the text .
The text will explain itself .
What do you read here ?
Most people will read evil , but some will see the good in life at the first time .
Somewhat simular to the previous illusion .
When you do n't see the womans reflection in the mirror , you 'll read hate .
But when you see her reflection , you 'll see her true self .
When looking at the following illusion , you 'll probably read the word Life .
But when you look closer , you 'll see the characters are pretty messed up .
Another double word illusion .
Most people will see the word " Me " in brown directly .
Only few will think about others the first time and see the other word .
The following illusion looks like a couple of blocks do n't doing anything .
Can you see the words within these blocks ?
Try closing your eyes just a little bit , looking through your eyelashes .
This is a double word illusion that fits exactly in this topic .
Which two words are spelled here ?
Read the text in the triangle below out lout .
Did you read I love Paris in the springtime ?
If so , you 're wrong .
Look again and check what is really spelled .
In this illusion you 'll read the word Teach and the reflection of it .
Can you read the second word ( the reflection ) too ?
The following four illusions show faces of people .
The faces are created with words , showed both sides of the person .
Can you see what person it is and which words they 're spelled in ?
Bonus : FFF
Count the " F's " that are in the following text .
FINISHED FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS .
How many " F's " did you find ?
Wrong .
There are 6 F's in the text above .
Read and try again .
How is this possible ?
Your brain is n't capable of processing the word OF .
Everyone that finds the six F's at once is a genius .
Three is normal , four is very rare .
Bonus 2 : Face
In addition to my article about the faces everywhere illusion , here is another face .
Or is it a face ?
Try tilting your head to the right to see the word .
It starts with an " L " .
Can you see the word ?
Thanks to the users in the comments , they placed a source where a couple of these images came from .
Interested in this topic ?

NOT to mention that the supply and the price of cocaine , about $ 25 to $ 30 on the street for a half - gram bag , have remained stable for several years , said John Galea , director of the street studies unit of the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services .
( In rare cases , a large bust can affect prices .
Chief James P. O’Neill , the commanding officer of the New York Police Department Narcotics Division , said the authorities seized a record 20 tons of cocaine off the coast of Panama in March , and wholesale prices rose in the last few weeks . )
A prevalence among young people is not entirely borne out by national statistics .
According to an annual survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , lifetime cocaine use remained stable between 2002 and 2005 among 18 - to 25 - year - olds .
( Data before 2002 are noncomparable . )
But the study — which estimates national rates based on a poll of 67,500 people — recorded a 20 percent increase in past - month use among that age group in 2005 from 2004 , the last period for which data were available , said Joe Gfroerer , the group ’s director of the division of population surveys .
( There was no change in usage rates among people over 26 . )
The Police Department has not recorded an increase in drug - related arrests at clubs recently , Chief O’Neill said .
But , he added , “ It does n’t mean if you ’re doing drugs in a club you wo n’t get caught . ”
But in interviews over the last five months with people in the night - life , entertainment , media and finance industries , all said that cocaine is a prominent part of a night out .
Teron Beal , 34 , a songwriter and aspiring actor , said he encountered cocaine regularly and does it occasionally — and not only in clubs and bars .
“ When you ’re in meetings and you ’re in the studio , it ’s offered like coffee , ” he said .
“ If you say yeah , they ’re cool with it and if you say no , they ’re like O.K. , and they just go and do it in front of you . ”
“ Coke is the new weed , ” he continued .
“ Everybody says that . ”
Tom Sykes , a former night - life reporter for The New York Post who chronicled his alcohol - and drug - fueled life in the memoir “ What Did I Do Last Night ? ” said that cocaine is more socially acceptable than smoking .
“ You could go into a swanky party in New York and do a line and nobody would notice , ” said Mr. Sykes , who is now sober .
“ Pull out a cigarette and people would think you ’d pulled out a gun . ”

And cocaine is not only popular in New York .
“ When I go to travel somewhere else , people think I do it and they ’re so eager to shove it up my nose , ” said Roxy Summers , a party promoter and D.J. who goes by the name Oxy Cottontail .

Blunders by a power company were blamed yesterday for the death of one of the country 's leading medical pioneers .
Professor Roland Levinsky , 63 , who performed the UK's first successful bone marrow transplant on a child , was electrocuted by an 11,000 - volt line which had been left hanging down beside a footpath .
The line , owned by Western Power , had come down in strong winds because a support post was rotten , a Plymouth inquest was told .
It had not been checked for nine years .
Two worried locals called the power company to report the loose line on the morning of New Year 's Day .
But the warnings were wrongly categorised by call centre workers as " miscellaneous " rather than given the top priority " danger " rating .
As a result , technicians thought the cables must be harmless phone lines .
An engineer who had been sent to the scene in Wembury , Devon , was diverted to a " more urgent " job when he was only five miles away .
Around an hour later , father - ofthree Professor Levinsky , who was 6ft 5in , was killed instantly when his head touched the cable as he walked his dog with his wife Beth and two friends .
In a statement read to the inquest , Mrs Levinsky said : " I saw a flash of light hit the top of Roland 's head and he let out a yell .
" He fell immediately to the floor .
" It was not until we all saw the sparks hitting his head that we noticed the cable which had fallen and was being supported by the hedge . "
Professor Levinsky , who lived nearby in a £ 1.5 million manor home , was Vice - Chancellor of Plymouth University and a world leader in the treatment of children with immunodeficiency diseases .
As well as the bone marrow breakthrough , he was a pioneer in gene therapy for children with fatal inherited diseases .
The inquest heard that the warning calls had been made at 10.12am
and 11.20 am .
Professor Levinsky died at 12.45 pm .
His widow said last night : " His death was entirely preventable because the power supply could and should have been switched off much earlier that morning , immediately following separate telephone reports made to Western Power by local residents .
" If either report had been actioned properly the electricity could have been switched off remotely within minutes .
" As it happened nothing at all was done to avert the obvious danger . "
She said the tragedy had been made harder for the family to bear because no one from the power firm had contacted them or passed on the results of an internal investigation .
Barbara Collopy , who lived in a bungalow near the scene of the accident , was asked to raise the alarm when the professor was electrocuted .
She said : " I told the electricity company I had called three hours earlier about the cable and that someone had now walked into it and been electrocuted . "
Philip Davies , service manager at Western Power , admitted the warning calls were wrongly classified and action should have been taken .
But he added : " It is rare for a pole to come down and even more rare for it to come down isolated in this way and remain isolated .
" If it had hit the ground or if the cables had touched each other , our protection systems would have come into effect and tripped and cut the power .
" I have no recollection in 43 years of a pole coming down and a cable remaining live . "
Coroner Ian Arrow gave a factual summary of Professor Levinsky 's death in recording a narrative verdict .
The Health and Safety Executive is considering whether to prosecute the power firm .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The bad news is that only 17 states require students take an economics class to graduate from high school and only seven states require a personal - finance course , according to a survey released Wednesday by the National Council on Economic Education .
The good news is that the number of states requiring students to take economics has increased from 14 in 2004 , and the number requiring a personal - finance class is up from six in 2004 , according to a prior NCEE study .
" We still have a long way to go to get to the point where we think we should be , " said Joseph Peri , chief operating officer of NCEE , a nonprofit that focuses on improving economic , financial , and entrepreneurship literacy .
" We obviously would like to see that number be a lot higher . "
Read the report ( PDF ) .
Peri noted the importance of young people understanding how basic economic decisions get made .
" It 's always been important for young people to understand basic economic decision making .
And it 's becoming more and more important as our society gets more complex , " he said .
As part of a two - pronged approach , economics should be taught throughout the kindergarten through 12th grade , with a stand - alone course at the high school level , Peri said .
Students should learn about topics such as globalization , and its affect on individuals , he added .
Meanwhile , personal - finance education is becoming increasingly relevant as individuals are called to take on greater responsibility for their own retirement , and are faced with sophisticated decisions about loans and even credit cards .
" All of these things have become much more complex , " Peri said .
He also noted the importance of making sure that teachers are prepared to instruct students on economics and related subjects .
Entrepreneurship classes also lacking
For the first time , NCEE 's survey also looked at entrepreneurship education .
" Basically , what we found is that entrepreneurship education is much less integrated into the curriculum , " Peri said .
Yet there 's a need for this sort of education as entrepreneurship becomes increasingly important in America , he said .
" Entrepreneurship has become such an important part of our country in terms of work , beyond people becoming entrepreneurs .
Going to work for big companies , there 's a premium placed on entrepreneurial skills , being able to think creatively , " Peri said .
In the past , global health officials have treated the epidemic as a cyclone spiraling ever upward with no end to new infections in sight .
But better surveys , particularly a household survey in India , have driven the figures down .
Until recently , most national estimates were made by giving anonymous blood tests to some young women who came into public health clinics because they were pregnant or feared they had a sexually transmitted disease ; those results were expanded with statistical models .
But epidemiologists have realized that such a method — usually applied in big urban clinics because it was more efficient — oversampled prostitutes , drug abusers and people with multiple partners , and ignored rural women .
Then the statistical extrapolations exaggerated those errors .
Recently , the United States Agency for International Development began financing surveys that chose thousands of households at random in both urban and rural areas and sent in health care workers to take detailed medical and lifestyle histories and blood samples ; though expensive , they produced results that are considered more accurate .
In July , India ’s estimated caseload was revised downward , to 2.5 million , from 5.7 million — a change that accounts for about half the drop in the new Unaids figures .
Officials said then that India ’s epidemic was not “ generalized ” — that is , it had not spread far from the original high - risk groups like brothel workers and clients , truckers , heroin users and gay men .
Also , rates among prostitutes appeared to have fallen as condoms gained acceptance .
Instead of being considered the world ’s worst - hit country , India fell to third place behind South Africa and Nigeria .
Also , some African countries have seen real drops in new cases .
It happened relatively early in Uganda , after an aggressive “ no grazing ” ( meaning no casual sex ) campaign started 20 years ago .
Similar declines appear to have happened in Zimbabwe and Kenya , especially since people saw many friends and relatives die .
Rather than embracing condoms , people decided to have sexual relations with fewer people , Dr. Halperin said .
“ You do n’t need a Ph.D. to figure out that if you reduce your number of partners , you reduce your risk , ” he added .
FRANKFURT , Aug. 2 — The European Central Bank signaled Thursday that it would raise interest rates in September to curb inflation amid an expanding economy .
Its president , Jean - Claude Trichet , also vowed to pay “ great attention ” to volatile developments in global financial markets .
Mr. Trichet , who does not usually speak to the news media in August , made an appearance after the bank voted Thursday to keep borrowing costs unchanged .
He said the bank would exercise “ strong vigilance ” to ensure that higher inflation does not appear .
The Bank of England also left its benchmark rate unchanged Thursday , at 5.75 percent .
Mr. Trichet ’s use of that phrase suggested the bank ’s benchmark interest rate would rise a quarter of a percentage point , to 4.25 percent , at the next policy meeting , in September — the ninth increase since the end of 2005 .
Inflation is now running slightly lower than the bank ’s target of below , but close to , 2 percent .
“ That they are willing to preannounce a rate increase means they are very confident of the fundamentals , ” said Erik Nielsen , chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London .
“ They could have gotten out of it if they wanted to , but the market reaction showed they do not need to . ”

Leaked Google Video Discusses Google Reader , Social Efforts
A video disclaimed to be “ Google - Confidential ” with the title “ Nooglers And The PDB : Reactor ( Ben Darnell , September 6 , 2007 ) ” made its way onto a public Google Video page .
A “ noogler ” is what people at Google call new employees ; “ Reactor ” is Google ’s codename for the back - end to Google Reader , the video says , and someone posting under the nickname “ Fanboy ” in this blog ’s forum provided us with a nutshell of the talk .
While the video has been removed by now , others – including Ionut Alex .
Chitu , who also blogged on this in the meantime – were able to see it , and I ’ve also got hold of a copy .
Now , I can confirm that projects by the name of “ Mustang ” and “ Mocha ” , as mentioned in the nutshell , exist within Google ; I can also confirm that a Ben Darnell works at Google .
This and other details make it look like the video is real indeed .
Following is Fanboy ’s nutshell ( my emphasis ) :
Google will work on a standard for feed publishers to tell aggegrators about changes in the feed ( ’ this post has been deleted ’ etc. ) .
Such a standard does n’t exist yet .
They will be working with blog tools like Blogger and MovableType .
2/3 of the content has only one subscriber .
Think about feeds for own - name - searches , own blogs and blog comments .
There are feeds with up to tens of millions of subscribers .
The crawl rate of feeds is prioritized when they ’ve got more subscribers .
They ’re updated within one hour when there ’s more than one subscriber , or else once in three hours .
The feed backend now contains 10 terabytes of raw data from 8 million feeds .
The index size grows with 4 % a week , but this number is probably not accurate .
Currently the standard distributed database called BigTable is mostly used .
For search Mustang is currently used , Google ’s library for creating search engines .
Mustang underlies the web search and most other search engines , except for Gmail ’s search feature as that requires instant updates and a specific index for each user .
Mustang currently handles 1 - 2 search queries per second , but is able to handle thousands .
The Reader team is going to integrate more social features .
Currently items can be sent to friends by email , and there are no plans for creating a Reader - inbox for that .
Google ’s recent big social effort is called Mocha - Mocha ( or Mocka - Mocka ? ) , and will become the infrastructure for all social stuff across all of their applications .
As a part of this , a new feature called Activity Streams will be introduced or at least implemented in Reader this quarter .
This will be comparable to Facebook ’s News Feed ( Minifeed ? ) feature , and integrate Gmail ’s addressbook and contact list .
Also there will be some other Gmail and Orkut integration , but this might just mean there will be links to Reader .
Google is interested in allowing users to comment on items they share , but this currently is n’t a priority .
Calling tags ’ labels ’ is called ’ kind of a historic accident and needlessly confusing ’.
When you press the ’ Mark all as read ’ button , Google remembers that you ’ve ’ read ’ all items between two timestamps .
You can never uncheck the ’ Mark as read ’ checkbox for those items .
Currently there is no plan to integrate Reader with Universal Search .
This is because Universal Search does n’t provide its backends with user IDs ( so Gmail results ca n’t be shown either ) , and because it requires a lookup time of less than 1/4 second , which Reader cannot provide yet .
When searching in Reader , you may also get results from before you are n’t subscribed to anymore , or from your friends ’ items .
This is intentional , but by some users considered as a bug .
Three people are working on Reader ’s backend , and three plus one intern are working on the frontend .
Very soon , Reader will recommend feeds to the user , based on previous subscriptions and other Google activity .
Next week , Reader will be released in several languages .
One month after that , it will be available in 40 languages .
According to FeedBurner statistics , Google Reader is the world ’s largest full - content reader .
My Yahoo is the largest headline reader , [ but ] also iGoogle is big .
As Google has grown into the market , the usage of Bloglines has n’t really decreased much .
Reader has a loyal user base ( based on pageviews per user ) , higher than any other product except for Gmail and Orkut .
70 % of the users use Firefox , so feed syndication is still mostly a geek thing .
Feeds are currently monetized by FeedBurner .
Reader might be more directly monetized in the future , but Google wants to watch out showing ads next to other people ’s content .
This is a problem with Google News too .
They might do something like they did with the non-free Opera : show the content owners ’ ads in the interface when they ’re AdSense publishers .
Google wants to make publishing full articles in feeds more interesting to webmasters by creating ways to monetize them .
[ Thanks Fanboy ! ]

Look , I 've heard the comparison between drugs and alcohol .
I think most experts would say that in moderation , one or two drinks of alcohol does not have an effect on one 's judgment , mental acuity , or their physical abilities .
I think most experts would say that the first ingestion of drugs leads to mind - altering and other experiences , other effects , and can lead over time to serious , serious problems .
When NH police officer and LEAP speaker Bradley Jardis confronted John McCain last week , demanding an explanation for the ongoing failure of the drug war , McCain 's response was just unbelievable : McCain acknowledges that too many first time offenders are serving time , but he otherwise delivers a defense of the drug war that is as banal and incoherent as any such discussion could ever be .
I wo n't bother to categorically refute the mountainous absurdities contained herein .
Instead , I 've transcribed McCain 's marvelous distinction between drugs and alcohol , which should be etched in stone as a timeless embodiment of the rank idiocy that defines the modern war on drugs :
This is what John McCain chose to lead with .
This , for McCain , was the strong central point that explains why the drug war is necessary .
And it is just so transparently stupid and wrong .
* When the curtain is pulled back , perfect cluelessness is revealed to be the single unifying principle that binds the drug war philosophy together .
That is why McCain nearly falls to pieces when confronted by someone with real firsthand experience waging the war he so clumsily defends .
Most drug war supporters are not qualified to discuss this topic even briefly .
If you ask them a smart question about the drug war , their answer will come out something like this :
John McCain ought to know that alcohol is a drug .
I think he just was n't prepared for the question and said the first thing that popped into his head .
It is typical for defenders of the drug war to begin their argument by issuing wildly false generalizations .

US sees sharp dropoff of foreign visitors , costing country estimated 200,000 in tourism - related jobs Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007

Print This Email This
The number of foreign visitors to the United States has plummeted since the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington because foreigners do n't feel welcome , tourism professionals said Thursday .
" Since September 11 , 2001 , the United States has experienced a 17 percent decline in overseas travel , costing America 94 billion dollars in lost visitor spending , nearly 200,000 jobs and 16 billion dollars in lost tax revenue , " the Discover America advocacy campaign said in a statement .
Chairman Stevan Porter lamented the " extraordinary decline " in the number of overseas visitors to the United States , while the advocacy group 's executive director , Geoff Freeman , blamed the slump on the shabby welcome many foreigners feel they get in the United States .
" It 's clear what 's keeping people away in the post - 9/11 environment : it is the perception around the world that travelers are n't welcome , " Freeman told AFP .
" Travelers around the world feel the US entry experience is among the world 's worst , " Freeman said , calling on the US government to work with the private sector to make visa acquisition more efficient , the entry process traveler - friendly , and to improve communication .
" We have put in place many reasonable security barriers but we have not communicated these barriers and we have not told travelers that we want their business , " he said .
" Six years after 9/11 , we need to take this more seriously , " Freeman said .
" The United States has to do what every other nation in the world does , and that is to promote itself to visitors , " he said .
" If you look at visitor numbers from the UK before 9/11 , we had 4.8 million visitors .
Last year , the number was 4.1 million .
" Looking to 2010 , the Department of Commerce is projecting an increase in those numbers , but only of one percent over the course of 10 years .
" If I ran a business that had one percent growth in 10 years , I 'd be fired , " Freeman said .

Getting older is one of those things that nobody welcomes but no one can avoid .
There is no alternative to getting older .
Therefore , we have to find a way to welcome our advancing years with a positive frame of mind .
Age is in the Heart
We can be in our 20s and have the attitude of an old person .
Similarly , we can be in our 70s and still have a childlike approach to life .
Age is very much a mental perspective .
To remain young at heart we need to retain an open mind and look for the good things in life .
Do n’t allow yourself to focus on the limitations of age .
Instead , think about what you can do .
Offer gratitude for small things that you perhaps did n’t have time to appreciate when young .
Newness
No matter how old you are , try to look for newness in life .
Avoid repeating the same routine , try learning new skills or visiting different places .
If we are constantly expanding our horizons , life will offer new challenges whatever our physical age .
Take inspiration from The Zimmers — a band of old age pensioners who hit the big time , despite an average age in the 80s .
Do n’t Complain
Forgive me , but I often find that certain old people become chronic complainers .
It seems in life , especially when we are older , there is no end of things to criticise and complain about .
In one way they are right — there are many imperfections in life .
But , if we only see the darker side of life , we focus excessively on negative things and this will be reflected in our unhappy state of mind .
It is important to be detached from the problems of the world .
Also , when our body slows down we have to work hard to focus on other things .
This helps us avoid focusing too much on the limitations and pains of our body .
Self Transcendence not Comparison
If we compare ourselves to other people and what we could do when we were young , we will always feel a sense of inadequacy .
This is the wrong approach to take , instead , we should focus on our self transcendence .
This means we seek to improve on our existing achievements as much as we can .
We start from where we are and seek to make progress in our own way .
The joy of self transcendence is in making an honest effort , it gives a sense of satisfaction that does n’t depend on outer results .
Live in the Here and Now
Do n’t live constantly thinking about : “ if only … ” .
There will be many things we might have done differently , but we have to feel the past is dust .
Focus on what you can do now to improve your life .
This does not mean we cannot cherish fond memories ; but , at the same time we need to give most importance to the present moment .
Keep Active
Getting old does not mean we have to vegetate in front of the TV , with the highlight of the week a trip to the Bingo hall .
It is important to keep our mind and , where possible , our body active .
If we do n’t exercise our mental faculties , it will not be a surprise if we lose our concentration and ability to engage in critical thought .
We should try to be a life long learner ; if we keep our mind permanently busy we will retain our mental faculties for longer .
We shall also gain a feeling of continuing self improvement right into old age .
Creativity
Both Tagore and Churchill started painting in the evening of their life .
There is no reason why old people cannot be creative .
When we are no longer so physically active it is an opportunity to discover new talents and activities .
Think bold and do n’t allow age to be a limiting factor .

Working in security tends to make people jumpy and nervous .
Most security coders do n't understand any of the the crypto internals of the tools they use , so they must rely on a handful of trusted experts like Schneier to tell them what 's safe .
Even so the algorithms last for about 10 - 15 years before they 're broken .
Kids poke hole in protocols that spent years peer - reviewing their way through the IETF .
Implementations are about as secure as swiss cheese , but it does n't matter since the commercial success of a security product has more to do with its channel marketing strategy than actual security .
Rumors surface that some Chinese mathematicians have wrecked part of the functional toolkit we 've used for the last decade in all of our products , and it 's time to pack up the tents and move , again .
So a culture of nit-picking and paranoia surrounds crypto stuff .
If you are using a security algorithm , so the thinking goes , it must be because there is a threat .
And if there is a threat , the algorithm must be made perfectly secure .
That may be an appropriate way to think for security products .
But it turns out that security techniques are often useful in general programming .
MD5 is a great checksum , much better than CRCs .
If you have 500 nodes in a cluster , each with some disks , yes I will guarantee you that read / write corruption can occur and get into your app .
TCP packets do arrive corrupted , even though they 're not supposed to .
Yes , Jenkins is faster .
But it 's only a 32 - bit hash , whereas MD5 is 128 .
Yes , Whirlpool is more secure .
But I do n't need a 512 bit checksum .
MD5 is a great compromise .
Salts and HMAC are great .
But you know what ?
The reality is that 9 out of 10 websites store your password in the clear .
It would be nice if we could get the run -of - the - mill programmer to at least understand how to hash a password before trying to scare them off with the the more advanced stuff .
Otherwise they 're going to throw up their hands and say their app does n't really need to be secure anyway .
You can't say MD5 without a geek chorus shouting " It 's broken , you must not use it for anything . "
When regular programmers do n't understand the basic utility of these fat hash functions they 're missing out though .
The fog of confusion hanging over the security space does't benefit Joe coder who could make practical use of these tools in general applications .
The message from security folks is that you should n't be using any of their algs for non-secure applications .
If you use their stuff , you have to go all the way .
But that 's bunk .
The engineering tolerances for crypto security are way beyond what the typical application needs for general purpose utility out of these functions .
MD5 is a great general - purpose hash .
There is useful stuff in between the extremes of a crappy CRC and and SHA - 512 .
So MD5 away to make your stateless GUIDs and be happy . :)
滑る？落ちる？ 沖縄市には８０度近くの勾配を持つ滑り台があるという。え、８０度？８０度というと、もうほとんど直角だ。滑り台とは、体と斜面との摩擦によって滑る速度を抑制し、安全に滑り降りることが出来る遊具ではないのか。なのに斜度が８０度。そんな急勾配の滑り台なんて、もう摩擦どうこうの問題ではないだろう。滑り降りられるわけがない。いくらなんでもそれはないだろう、とは思ったが、近所だったし、無駄足覚悟で行ってみた。 （安藤昌教）
青少年よ、はいかいするな ここ八重島公園は、沖縄市の中心から程近い場所に位置する、緑の多い非常に広い公園だ。筆者の行った時間が平日の夕方だったということもあってか、学校帰りの小学生の楽しそうに遊ぶ姿が見られた。こんなところに本当にそんなおそろしい滑り台があるのだろうか。
どれも楽しそうです 公園には大小様々な種類の滑り台があった。写真の滑り台なんて、本当に長い。ウォータースライダーみたいだ。だけどもちろんその勾配は普通に見える。せいぜい３０度くらいだろう。
滑り台の他にも、ブランコやジャングルジムなど、おなじみの遊具が広々と設置されていた。遊具のこんなに充実した公園も珍しいのではないだろうか。芝生や植木の手入れもきちんとされているし、ゴミもちらかっていない。駐車場だって完備。ちゃんと管理された公園という雰囲気が漂う。こんなにきちんとした公園に、そんな殺人遊具があるわけない。
え？ しばらくの間、広い公園の中を歩き回った。夕方とはいえ、真夏の日差しが肌に痛い。額からは大粒の汗が流れ落ちる。そんな急勾配の滑り台なんてどこにもないではないか。 それでも一応うわさがあるからには、その元となる物くらい見つかるかもしれない、と思い、公園の中をさらに深く歩き回ってみた。にもかかわらず、うわさの急勾配の滑り台はやはり見つからなかった。 ガセネタつかまされたのだろうか。というかそんなもの、もともとありえないと思ってはいたのだ。もういい、そろそろ帰ろう、と引き返し始めた矢先のことだった。 森の中に何かを発見した。遊具のように見えるが、なにかぴょこっと出っ張った部分が木々の間から見える。急勾配だ。 急勾配？まさか・・ どーん あった。 もう間違いなくこれのことだろう。近づくと確かに急勾配の滑り台がそこにはあった。 急勾配の斜面部分の高さは３、４メートル程だろうか。ほぼ直角に落下した後、まるでスキーのラージヒルみたいな緩衝部分が続く。落ちたとしても、ここで速度が緩むから大丈夫、ということか。
なんだこれは。あきらかに異色。こんな滑り台、今まで見たことが無い。
だけどせっかく見つけたのだ、実際に滑ってみなくては。 まじ怖いっす 滑り台のてっぺんまで続く階段を上ると、ぱっと視界が開けた。想像していた以上に高さを感じる。おずおずと斜面を覗き込んでみた。 怖い。 高々３メートルくらいの落下のはずなのに、なんだこの恐怖感。崖から下を見下ろしてるみたいだ。だけど僕は大人なのだ、こんな子供の遊び道具にびびってはいられない。意を決して滑ってみることに。
滑り台は手すりにつかまってスタンバイする。そこから体を伸ばして斜面にぶら下がり、その後文字通り、落ちる。注意書きにも書いてあった。「ポンと飛び降りるように滑ってください」、と。
斜面にぶら下がると、足が空中でぶらぶらしている。これって８０度というよりも、直角に近いんじゃないか。落ちた先にはスロープがあるはずなのだが、実際にぶら下がると、そんなもの見えない。目の前には何も無い。手を離したら、落ちるのみだ。
ポン、と注意書きに書かれていた通り、飛び降りた。落ちたのは一瞬だった。その後すぐに、背中とお尻が斜面と痛いほど擦れる。気が付くと、僕は半分放心状態でスロープの中央に座り果てていた。
公園に遊びに来ていた人に聞いてみたところ、この滑り台、近所では結構有名らしい。「だけど、誰がすべるのかねえ、一体」と近くにいたおじさんがつぶやいていた。その通り、この滑り台だけ、森の奥のほうにひっそりと設置されていて、周りに子供の姿はなかった。
うわさの急勾配の滑り台は確かにあった。何の目的なのやら見当もつかないが、たしかにそこにあったのだ。目的を達成したはずの僕は、何やらわけのわからない脱力感に打たれながら、てくてくと帰路に着いた。
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Calling it " a potential death sentence , " several hundred diplomats expressed their resentment Wednesday over a new State Department policy that could force them to serve in Iraq or risk losing their jobs .
Some diplomats may be forced to serve in the new U.S. embassy complex under construction in Baghdad , Iraq .
Some at the hourlong town hall - style meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly , learning about it instead from news organizations last week .
Others pointed out the risks of such a rule , considering the dangers of a war zone , lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel .
One State Department worker complained she was not provided medical treatment for her post - traumatic stress disorder after she voluntarily served in Iraq .
The session was marked by angry exchanges , according to an audio recording of the meeting held at the State Department .
The sharpest comments came from Jack Croddy , a 36 - year veteran of the Foreign Service .
To loud applause from his fellow workers , he asked how the State Department could protect people in Baghdad or the Iraq countryside when " incoming is coming in every day .
Rockets are hitting the Green Zone . "
Do n't Miss Uncle Sam drafts diplomats for embassy in Iraq
" It is one thing if someone believes in what is going on over there and volunteers , " he said , " but it is another thing to send someone over there on a forced assignment .
And I 'm sorry , but basically that is a potential death sentence and you know it .
Who will raise our children if we are dead or wounded ? "
Last week 's announcement said about 200 people would be informed this week they are " prime candidates " for assignment in Iraq , and those chosen would be notified later .
Selection of personnel will be finished by Thanksgiving , said Harry Thomas , the Foreign Service 's director general , who led the meeting .
Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond , according to last week 's announcement .
Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse , those who decline to go could face dismissal , it said .
Thomas said he and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are committed to what he called a fair , open and transparent process in filling the requirements for State Department employees in Iraq -- at the Baghdad embassy and elsewhere in the country .
Most of the 250 jobs to be filled in the next rotation over the coming months will go to volunteers , he said .
But about 50 remain open .
The State Department has relied solely on volunteers to fill overseas jobs in recent decades .
Forced assignments have not been used since the Vietnam War era .
" We can not shrink from our duty .
We have all agreed to worldwide availability , " Thomas said .
From now on , everyone in the Foreign Service would be required to serve one out of three tours in " hardship posts , " he said .
Thomas reacted angrily to criticism of how the new policy is being handled , saying , " Do n't you or anyone else stand there and tell me I do n't care about my colleagues .
I find that insulting . "
Rice did not attend the meeting .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack addressed the issue at his regular midday briefing .
" There are risks involved in going to places like Iraq , Afghanistan , other places around the world , and there are a lot of people who are making real sacrifices on behalf of their country -- sacrifices being away from their family , taking certain risks with respect to their personal safety , just being in some of these places .
" I understand that .
The secretary understands that . "

PORTLAND , Ore. --
The Multnomah County Sheriffs Office has launched an investigation into allegations that a local corrections deputy bragged about using a Taser gun on people in an Internet chat room .
FOX 12s news partner , the Portland Tribune , was the first to break this story .
Now , authorities at the Justice Center Jail want to know if the same deputy , identified as David B. Thompson , also filed a false police report to cover up the beating of an inmate .
Lt. Jason Gates of the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office said he is appalled at the alleged online comments of thecounty corrections officer .
According to Gates , Thompson used a county work computer to play the online video game  City of Heroes  while on the job and then boasted about the joy he gets hurting people in jail in the chat room .
According to the Portland Tribune article in Fridays newspaper , the deputy , using the screen name Trafalgar , said ,  Seeing someone get Tasered is second only to pulling the trigger .
That is money  puts a smile on your face . 
In another chat , the Tribune article claimed the deputy said ,  I crushed a dudes eye socket from repeatedly punching him in it and then I charged him with menacing and harassment ( of me ) .
He took a plea to get away from me .
He shoulda picked somebody else to try and fight . 
 All we have is public trust .
What does that do to our public trust ?
It destroys it ,  said Lt. Jason Gates .
Gates said the eye socket incident matches a case from 2005 , where Thompson claimed an inmate attacked him .
Gates said a criminal investigation has been launched to see if the deputy lied in the initial police report .
 The post suggests that the guy gets off on violence and he enjoys Tasering people ,  said Portland Tribune reporter Nick Budnick .
Budnick said that according to Trafalgars online chat , the deputy has posted more than 1,700 messages on the  City of Heroes 
Web site since January .
At one point , he allegedly posted 64 messages in 24 hours .
According to Budnick , in some of the posts , Thompson bragged about only playing the game at work .
 Here is a public servant , getting paid with public money , spending a significant amount of his shift playing video games , " said Budnick .
If the deputy is found guilty , Gates said he could be fired and prosecuted criminally .

Is the Portland Police Bureau going TASER CRAZY ?
Willamette Week
BY NICK BUDNICK | nbudnick at wweek dot com
[ February 4th , 2004 ]
Officer Bill Ollenbrook ’s police radio crackled with what sounded like life or death as he entered a low - income downtown apartment building last May .
Details were sketchy , but according to the dispatcher , a man , possibly armed , was facing off with cops in a fourth - floor hallway .
Ollenbrook sprinted up the stairs and around a corner .
A 40 - year - old man stood mid-hallway with his back to him , brandishing what looked like a pistol beneath the T - shirt he ’d wrapped around his hand and wrist .
“ 9 millimeter ! ” the man screamed at officers on the other end of the hallway .
“ Just shoot me !
Kill me ! ”
Behind him , Ollenbrook reached down , unsnapped his holster and drew his weapon .
His gut said : sick , innocent man — do n’t kill .
His training said the opposite : potential gun —must eliminate threat .
The cop squeezed the trigger .
The man , who turned out to be unarmed and suicidal , lived — because Ollenbrook ’s weapon was not a gun , but a taser .
The man was subdued with the help of 50,000 volts of electricity pumping through his body .
“ It dropped me like a rock , ” the man said last week when contacted by WW , saying he was glad Ollenbrook packed a taser in addition to his pistol .
“ ” If they did n’t have that option , I do n’t know what would have happened to me . ”
In the past 19 months in Portland , almost 400 people have been jolted by the newest weapon in the local cops ’ expanding arsenal .
And that number is sure to rise .
Because of their potential to save lives , there ’s been a “ taser revolution ” in police forces across the U.S. Chief Derrick Foxworth has vowed to acquire 190 more of these high - tech stun guns at a cost of $ 799 apiece , enough so every on - duty cop will carry one .
But even with tasers in only limited service , a WW investigation shows that Portland cops are using them at an unusually high rate and in circumstances that other cities actively discourage or explicitly forbid .
With only 62 tasers , Portland tases more people each month than do cops in Phoenix , where 1,250 tasers are in use , or Los Angeles , which has 500 of the weapons ( see chart , page 21 ) .
Those on the receiving end of these blasts in Portland include 25 people who were already in handcuffs , as well as two 71 - year - olds — one of whom was a woman with only one eye .
While the advantages of non-lethal weapons are obvious , some critics claim the Portland Police are just a bit too eager to use them .
Richard Brown , a community - policing instructor who works closely with cops , says some of them think the bureau is a little taser - crazy .
“ There are officers out there that do n’t agree with this stuff , ” says Brown , who sits on two advisory committees to the Portland Police Bureau .
“ I know that because they tell me . ”
The way the bureau has cops using tasers “ does n’t make sense to me , ” says Officer Tom Mack , a former police - union official who says publicly what other cops told WW only privately .
“ There ’s a group of us that think these things are being pulled out too quickly . ”
The 446 instances of taser deployment in the past 19 months , which WW reviewed , did n’t reveal a pattern of abuse .
In fact , numerous potentially lethal situations have been averted using the taser , including as many as 17 situations like the one Ollenbrook faced , in which a suicidal person tries to force some unlucky cop to kill them .
But several taser incidents seemed questionable even to police interviewed by WW .
“ From the reports you ’re reading me , I think what you ’re seeing is unnecessary , ” says Mack .
Loren Christensen , a recently retired cop and defensive - tactics expert , says the reports related to him remind him of the now - infamous “ sleeper hold , ” which he introduced to the agency and which was abused prior to the controversial 1985 death of Lloyd Stevenson .
That death led to the choke hold ’s ban .
“ I would listen to people talking about how they were using it , and I would think , ‘ Boy , I ’d never use it in that situation , ’ ” Christensen says .
The taser was invented by a fan of Victor Appleton ’s adventure novels featuring Tom Swift , sort of a techno - genius cousin of the Hardy Boys , and its name stands for “ Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle . ”
At close range , it can be used as a stun gun relying on direct contact with clothes , as opposed to skin .
At a distance of up to 21 feet , a taser also can fire nitrogen - propelled darts with tiny , straightened - out # 8 barbed fishhooks on the end at a speed of 100 mph .
These wire - bearing darts remain attached to the taser by a thin wire , so that the officer can trigger a second jolt of electricity if needed .
The electrical blast is so powerful it overrides a person ’s nervous system , usually causing a loss of body control and causing major muscle groups to contract in rapid - fire fashion .
It also hurts like hell , as Officer Greg Stewart learned last year when he was tased by accident .
“ Suddenly I feel like my eyeballs were popping out of my head , ” Stewart later testified in court .
“ My eyeball was — pow ! pow !
pow !— throbbing ... a charge traveled down my neck , through my cheek ....
I was in a lot of pain and having a lot of difficulty focusing on anything . ”
The five - second cycle , he said , “ seemed like forever , ” and after the incident , “ all I wanted to do was get to the hospital . ”
In fact , a resulting neck strain forced him to miss work for a couple of days .
Dontae Marks ( left ) was charged with interfering with a police officer , but lawyer Amy Elkanich successfully turned the tables in court , arguing that the officers ’ questionable taser use made them the aggressors .
Such accidental officer tasings are rare ; the device has scant downside for the officer compared with other less - lethal weapons like red-pepper spray , which is hard for cops to use without catching blowback , or batons , which require close proximity .
Because of the device ’s advantages , Taser International , the Scottsdale , Ariz . - based manufacturer , says the number of police agencies using tasers has jumped from 125 to 4,300 in the past three years .
In the past 12 months , the company ’s stock has skyrocketed from $ 3.65 per share to almost $ 147 .
To officials and bean counters , the weapons seem like the ultimate silver bullet .
In Denver and Orange County , Fla. , for example , police departments credited tasers with a large drop in injuries both to officers and citizens , translating to lower medical costs and fewer lawsuits .
In Phoenix , a city considered one of the most clear - cut taser success stories , officer - involved shootings have dropped by more than half thanks to the taser , says Sgt. Randy Force ; his officers shot only 13 people last year , nine fatally ; all were brandishing guns at the time .
Phoenix , in other words , had no Kendra James , no Jose Mejia Poot — none of the controversies that bubble up regularly when Portland cops fire their guns .
“ To have an entire year where you do n’t shoot anybody unless they were carrying a gun , that ’s remarkable , ” Force says .
“ I ca n’t think of a single advance in law - enforcement technology that is going to save the number of lives that the taser will save ; and no , I do n’t own stock in the company . ”
Dane Reister , a Central Precinct officer , believes existing bureau safeguards prevent officers from abusing what he calls an “ incredibly ” useful tool .
But , he says , there may be a risk of overuse : “ It ’s like a kid in a candy store or with a new toy :
He ’s going to play with it as much as he can until he gets tired of it . ”
Foxworth says he is confident that the current policy is appropriate , despite the concerns expressed by some subordinates .
“ We ’ve had discussions ... where supervisors had concerns about officers ’ overreliance on the taser , ” he says , adding that individual officers are given a talking - to when questionable instances occur .
“ Still , I do n’t think officers are overrelying on it . ”
At 3 am on May 3 , 2003 , three weeks before Officer Ollenbrook subdued the suicidal man in a dramatic standoff , several cops responded to a more mundane call at Southwest 3rd Avenue and Stark Street : a drunk using a shovel to liberate his keys from a parking - lot kiosk .
As officers took him into custody , a nearby line of clubgoers had formed at Chinto ’s Burritos cart .
Among them was Dontae Marks , a 20 - year - old amateur bodybuilder who had been out at the Red Sea club with his friend .
To Marks and his friend , the way the officers dealt with the man looked like brutality .
The friend went closer , cursed at the cops , then returned to the burrito line .
A short time later , two officers approached the friend and cuffed him , saying he was drunk and headed to detox .
As they escorted him to a squad car , Marks protested to an officer on the outskirts of the scene that his pal was n’t drunk .
The officer told him to leave .
Marks refused .
Another cop , Jason Lile , repeated the order and drew his taser , positioning the red dot of its laser sight on Marks ’ chest .
Scared , Marks backed away about 10 feet and turned his back to Lile .
“ I thought if I turned my back he would n’t shoot me , ” he told WW .
Marks says he shouted that he had a right to stand there .
Mark says he got one warning ;
Lile ’s account says it was a half - dozen .
Regardless , the report acknowledges the precipitating moment came when Marks looked over his shoulder and called back , “ Go ahead and shoot me , you fucking pussy . ”
Lile pulled the trigger and the darts flew into Marks ’ back , automatically triggering a five - second cycle of shocks and a noise sounding like a muted string of firecrackers : KAK -KAK-KAK-KAK .
Marks was tased even though , according to the police report , he had his back turned to the officer .
“ The darts appeared to hit him in the back but had no effect as he walked away , ” wrote Officer Lile in the incident report .
Marks says he felt the charge but was able to keep walking .
He walked 10 feet further away , said the report , then stopped to pull the taser probes out of his clothes .
Lile approached from behind and attempted to tase Marks again in the neck , using the weapon ’s touch - stun mode .
Marks , the police report says , brushed Lile off , assumed a “ fighting stance , ” and soon found himself under a pile of six cops .
Lile ’s report says that even while face down on his stomach , Marks “ continued to resist . ”
While cops punched him , pepper - sprayed him and clubbed him with an telescoping baton , Lile touch - stunned him with at least 10 more five - second cycles — KAK -KAK -KAK .
Horrified , the Chinto ’s crowd yelled and cursed the cops .
The next day Marks ’ wife , Aurora , counted marks from 13 separate taser burns spread across his back , neck , buttocks , and rear of his legs .

Portland taser trainers say the marks left by the device should look like a sunburn or bee sting .
In reality , some are much more severe .
Last August , Marks was tried on charges of resisting arrest and interfering with a police officer by failing to disperse .
In court , Marks ’ attorney , Amy Elkanich , argued that he ’d rightfully disregarded an unlawful command .
After deliberating for 20 minutes , the jury acquitted Marks on both charges .
Elkanich says the Marks case shows how tasers give cops a new power that is too easily abused .
Officer Lile had not told Marks , “ Leave or you will be arrested . ”
Nor , in his report , did he say the taser was needed to take Marks into custody .
Rather , Lile wrote that he tased the bystander because “ I believed Marks would physically resist any attempts to move him . ”
“ They went straight to the taser , because it was quick and easy for them , ” Elkanich says .
“ He was doing what they wanted him to do , but because they did n’t believe him , they tased him .
And that ’s what blew that situation up .
Without the taser , that situation would never , ever have occurred .
I think that they are using these too soon in their interactions with people . ”
It ’s not just defense lawyers who are disturbed by the Marks case .
WW read the report to a handful of Portland cops , including Christensen .
“ That ’s from a police report ? ” the retired officer said when the account was read to him .
“ That does n’t sound good at all ....
Not having been there , I do n’t have all the facts , but it sounds a little unnecessary . ”
Officer Mack does n’t understand why Marks was tased the first time , let alone 12 more times .
“ If you want to tell me I ’m a ‘ punk , ’ or a ‘ pussy , ’ I ’ll say , ‘ Whatever : Your friend is going to detox , and you should probably walk away or you ’ll be joining him , ’ ” he says .
“ I was n’t there , but hearing the report , I do n’t get it .
How is that not abusive ? ”
As part of the bureau ’s standard procedure with each taser use , police officials reviewed Lile ’s actions and deemed them “ within policy , ” meaning the officer was n’t disciplined .
To date , those higher - ups have found each one of Portland ’s 446 taser deployments to be justified , though the Police Bureau has received 10 complaints from people who say they were tased unnecessarily , says Internal Affairs Captain Darrel Schenck .
His unit reviews each complaint and has found no taser usages that do n’t comply with Portland ’s policy .
Several complaints are pending .
Officer Tom Forsyth drew up Portland ’s taser policy , contained in a three - page directive , after examining the policies of several other agencies .
He says Portland , like most other police departments , treats tasers as equivalent to red- pepper spray in terms of when it can be used .
Specifically , the policy allows tasers to be used on people who “ display the intent to engage in violent , aggressive actions , ” are suicidal , or “ display the intent to engage in physical resistance to a lawful police action . ”
At WW ’s request , Portland Capt .
Mike Crebs , in charge of training , reviewed the Marks report and conceded that he “ had some concerns ” because the report was unclear on whether Lile tased Marks in order to take him into custody — which would be appropriate — or simply because the guy did n’t leave when told to .
Thanks to the vagueness of Portland ’s policy , reports show , officers can tase you for being slow to comply with an order or for yelling at them while glaring with “ fists clenched . ”
In Phoenix , by contrast , Marks ’ tasing would be extremely unlikely , thanks to a policy that , unlike Portland ’s , prohibits officers from using tasers for “ coercion ” or “ intimidation . ”
Also unlike Portland ’s , it discourages cops from using the taser on people who are not threatening or suspected of a violent offense .
Similarly , Denver taser trainer Steve Palka told WW that a “ leave or I ’ll tase you ” command would be unacceptable under his department ’s rules .
Denver cops are trained to avoid using tasers in place of traditional policing tools such as wrist - locks and pressure points , says Palka , who notes that the majority of tasings in Denver are at a distance :
Only 10 percent are of the close - range “ touch - stun ” variety .
That compares to a figure of 43 percent in Portland , according to the bureau ’s taser database .
In Portland , reports show , officers frequently use the taser as a “ compliance tool ” in situations where previously a wrist - lock or old - fashioned manhandling would likely have been used .
For example :
* In December 2002 , officers responding to an underage - drinking party in Northeast Portland were met by an 18 - year - old kid who walked toward them , fists clenched , saying , “ Get the fuck out of my house ! ” Officer Meredith Hopper ’s report says she tased him and ordered him to put his hands up , which he did , but when they started to drop she tased him again , causing him to go “ down on his stomach and scream in pain . ”
* In January 2003 , Officer Scherise Bergstrom — whose taser exploits have given rise to the nickname “ Lady Lightning ” within the bureau — responded to a car crash in which the driver was arguing with cops and being “ uncooperative . ”
According to her police report , Bergstrom drew her weapon and warned that he would be tased if he did not “ follow directions and stop being lippy . ”
* In March 2003 , a woman who fell asleep in her car parked outside a North Portland 7 - 11 awoke to cops opening her car door and tasing her ; according to taser officer Ken Reynolds ’ report , she had glared at them and reached for her pocket even after being warned .
His partner ’s report , however , states that there was no warning and the tasing was not prompted by any move for her pocket — an account the woman echoed to WW when contacted .
* Last July , a driver pulled over on the Fremont Bridge , angry that his car was being towed for lack of insurance , turned his head and body toward Officer Bret Barnum once too many times while complaining , and got tased .
Forsyth , the taser program ’s head , defends the taser usage as appropriate , citing the nuances of each situation , such as the danger of a large , threatening suspect near the bridge railing — which he called a “ textbook ” use of the taser .
As for the discrepancies in the 7 - 11 reports , he figures Reynolds just wrote a more complete report .
Like several other cops interviewed by WW , including Mack and Christensen , Forsyth defends the tasing of handcuffed people who are actively resisting , noting that some individuals are big enough that they ’re dangerous whether they ’re restrained or not .
As for preventing abuse , he notes that with every use of the taser , a supervisor is immediately notified who must subsequently write an “ after - action ” report analyzing whether its use was appropriate .
He says that because Portland ’s taser policy gives officers more leeway in its use than colleagues in other cities , it ’s not surprising they use them more often .
Brown , the police advisory board member , says he was n’t surprised by WW ’s findings .
“ I ’m concerned that in the short period that we ’ve had these , they have been used so many times , ” he says .
Several cops told WW that the advantages of the taser that make it so effective in saving lives — its ease of use , range , effectiveness and lack of a downside — also make it susceptible to abuse , especially combined with Portland ’s permissive taser policy .
“ I think the threshold should be higher , ” says Mack .
Foxworth disagrees with the notion that a taser - happy police force might jeopardize its relations with the community , saying that if it “ is going to improve officer safety , reduce the number of injuries to officers and citizens , and reduce the number of deadly - force situations , I think that ’s what the community is crying out for . ”
But when told that model taser cities such as Phoenix and Denver had achieved impressive results with far tighter policies , Foxworth ’s boss , Mayor Vera Katz , had a different reaction : “ If we ’re going to be distributing these to a lot more officers , then we need to make sure that all of these issues are looked at . ”
Tased and Confused
A reporter gets the shocking truth about stun-guns .
For several weeks , each time I made the trek to the Portland Police Bureau office where I reviewed the stack of taser files , Officer Tom Forsyth , who heads the taser program , would cheerily offer to tase me — just so I could see how safe and harmless it is , he assured me .
One day , seduced by the need to be macho , I agreed .
Instead of being subjected to the usual barbed darts used when a taser is in pistol mode , or the touch - stun probes used at close proximity , Forsyth hooked two metal clips to my pants pockets .
The clips were attached to wires connected to the next - generation X26 taser that Police Chief Derrick Foxworth hopes to make standard equipment for Portland cops .
With two WW interns looking on , I feigned nonchalance .
Forsyth had me kneel while two other cops supported me at my shoulders .
When he hit the button — KAK -KAK -KAK-KAK — I realized why he ’d taken the precautions :
My body suddenly pitched forward as my legs involuntarily straightened and my back , as one intern put it later , “ arched like a salmon . ”
Forsyth promised I ’d get only a one - second burst , not the standard five - second blast cops use .
But it sure felt longer .
Two words cycled urgently through my brain : “ Ow ! ” and then “ STOP ! ”
As it ended , my thigh muscles were tight as if given a charley horse .
There was a stinging sensation in my skin where the clips had been .
“ Ow , ” I said .
“ That sucked . ”
Feeling an urgent desire to rip the alligator clips from my pants , I reached toward them — then stopped , recalling the police reports I ’d reviewed , in which any sudden move led to a second tasing .
I looked at Forsyth .
He still held the weapon , his finger disturbingly close to the trigger .
“ Can I take the clips off now ? ” I asked nervously , prepared to grovel if necessary — anything to get the torturous device off me .
“ Sure , ” he said .
Over the course of the next week , Forsyth kept asking , “ Any lasting effects ? ”
I did n’t know how to answer .
For the first few hours after getting tased , I felt a bit dazed .
But it was n’t the physical pain that lingered , it was the horrible firsthand knowledge of what total submission feels like .
The cops , for their part , thought I was a great sport — or incredibly stupid .
“ Wish we ’d known in advance , ” Assistant Chief Bruce Prunk quipped a few days afterward .
“ We could have sold tickets for charity . ”
I gave a presentation about the Google Talk Service a while ago at the Google Scalability Conference hosted by Googlers in Seattle .
You can watch the video below .
Here is the abstract :
Since launching Google
Talk in the summer of 2005 , we have integrated the service with two large existing products : Gmail and orkut .
Each of these integrations provided unique scalability challenges as we had to handle a sudden large increase in the number of users .
Today , Google Talk supports millions of users and handles billions of packets per day .
In the presentation , I discuss several practical lessons and key insights from our experience that can be used for any project .
These lessons cover both engineering and operational areas .

After his speech , even some of his critics said his performance may have moved some Christian conservatives to soften their opposition to him , at least in the general election , and maybe even drawn some to support his bid for the Republican nomination .
But the true impact of the moment will likely be known only after the activists gathered here return home to consider their choices .
“ I give him an A - plus on his speech , ” said Phil Burress , president of Citizens for Community Values , an Ohio group .
But , Mr. Burress added , “ These are deep voters .
They ’re going to dig deeper than just appearance . ”
As for Mr. Huckabee , he faced high odds in his own right .
With less than three months left until the first votes are cast , he has been struggling to prove his electability .
Many conservative leaders , agonizing over whether it is realistic to unite around him , fret about his ability to compete in all 50 states against Mr. Giuliani .
His campaign received a boost this summer , when he placed second in the Iowa straw poll , behind Mr. Romney , but his fund - raising has continued to lag and he remains in the single digits in national polls .
The results of the straw poll in many ways only added to the confusion within the movement .
Anyone who is a member of Family Research Council Action , one of the groups organizing the summit , could vote .
Joining the group only requires a $ 1 donation .
Mr. Romney ’s campaign , as well as others , has been actively encouraging people to vote online .
And about 3,500 new people have joined the organization , on top of the existing 5,000 members , in the last few months .
Out of the 2,500 attendees of the summit , only 952 out of 5,775 overall actually cast votes in person .
But almost 600 of those who attended had already voted online .
Of the votes cast in person , Mr. Huckabee was the runaway winner with over 50 percent of the vote , trailed badly by Mr. Romney with 10 percent .
In the overall voting , Mr. Paul , a congressman from Texas , finished a surprising third , which event organizers attributed in large part to his online following .
Mr. Thompson , a former senator from Tennessee , finished fourth .
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , whose legislative arm was one of the summit ’s organizers , said Mr. Huckabee deserves to claim a boost from the event .
“ I think he comes out of here clearly as a favorite and a winner out of the straw poll , ” Mr. Perkins said .
Users of encryption technology can no longer refuse to reveal keys to UK authorities after amendments to the powers of the state to intercept communications took effect on Monday ( Oct 1 ) .
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) has had a clause activated which allows a person to be compelled to reveal a decryption key .
Refusal can earn someone a five - year jail term .
Part III of RIPA was in the original Act but was not activated .
The Home Office said last year that it had not implemented the provision because encryption had not been as popular as quickly as it had predicted .
It launched a consultation which culminated in Part III being made active on 1st October .
The measure has been criticised by civil liberties activists and security experts who say that the move erodes privacy and could lead a person to be forced to incriminate themselves .
It is also controversial because a decryption key is often a long password – something that might be forgotten .
An accused person might pretend to have forgotten the password ; or he might genuinely have forgotten it but struggle to convince a court to believe him .
Section 49 of Part III of RIPA compels a person , when served with a notice , to either hand over an encryption key or render the requested material intelligible by authorities .
Anyone who refuses to decrypt material could face five years in jail if the investigation relates to terrorism or national security , or up to two years in jail in other cases .
Controversially , someone who receives a Section 49 notice can be prevented from telling anyone apart from their lawyer that they have received such a notice .
The Home Office said that the process will be overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner , the Intelligence Services Commissioner and the Chief Surveillance Commissioner .
Complaints about demands for information must be made by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal .
" The Tribunal is made up of senior members of the judiciary and the legal profession and is independent of the Government .
The Tribunal has full powers to investigate and decide any case within its jurisdiction , which includes the giving of a notice under section 49 or any disclosure or use of a key to protected information , " said a Home Office explanation of the process .
The Home Office said that the actions were consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and the UK Human Rights
Act as long as the demand for decryption was " both necessary and proportionate " .
" The measures in Part III are intended to ensure that the ability of public authorities to protect the public and the effectiveness of their other statutory powers are not undermined by the use of technologies to protect electronic information , " said the Home Office .

As we continue to poll and observe the various states involved in the early caucus / primary battles for the Republican presidential nomination , one thing is becoming increasingly clear to me :
While Ron Paul may lag behind most of his GOP competitors in the polls , the intensity of devotion from his supporters makes his candidacy deserving of more attention than it 's gotten to date .
His sometimes - quirky mannerisms and oddball demeanor fly in the face of what most Republicans traditionally look for in their presidential nominees .
And his comments startle many for their bluntness and contrariness to long - running establishment GOP thinking .
That 's exactly why Paul could have an unexpected impact not only on the Republican nomination process , but also on the November general election as well .
Consider that over 600 people turned out for a rally for Paul in Reno , Nevada , recently .
The media described the crowd as a mixed group that included many college students .
That 's another indicator of the potential impact of the Paul campaign .
I recall in 1980 when establishment Republicans and conservatives were backing George H.W. Bush , John Connally or Howard Baker for president .
But on college campuses , the birth of the modern College Republicans movement was feeding off of the support of frustrated college students for the maverick in the race , Ronald Reagan .
Do n't get me wrong .
I am not predicting Paul will pull a Reagan and somehow beat out the GOP 's establishment contenders .
I will suggest that Paul may fatally damage several potential candidates , and perhaps the entire Republican Party , if he breaks away and runs as a legitimate third - party candidate after Tsunami Tuesday 's primaries in early February .
Paul blends a unique mixture of cynicism over the health of the economy , loud opposition to the erosion of civil liberties , plus a stand as the only GOP candidate who 's flat - out opposed to the war in Iraq .
Those issues unite a seemingly disparate group of voters who collectively feel that 20 years of the presidency being shared between two families -- the Clintons and Bushes -- is more than enough .
They are voters who have found their mouthpiece in Paul , who 's willing to voice their frustration over Republicans , Democrats and whoever and whatever else represents " The Establishment . "
Paul could be deadly to someone like conservative Mike Huckabee , who is steadily rising in many polls but can't be assured of the devoted turnout of his supporters , as Paul almost surely can .
Paul 's words have also taken away some of the ink that should have gone to Fred Thompson , who entered the race as the supposed " I 'll say anything and throw caution to the wind " candidate , but whose measured and often boring campaign speeches have consistently fallen short of their billing .
Unlike many GOP candidates , Paul has n't tried to have his cake and eat it , too , on the subject of President Bush .
He has little or nothing charitable to say about the president .
And with new revelations coming from Bush 's own press secretary about " who knew what when " in the CIA leak scandal , Paul 's distance seems all the wiser .
How do I think Ron Paul will impact 2008 ?
It 's at least possible that he 'll fare better than expected -- and not just eventually in scattered primaries , but as early as next week in the much - awaited CNN / YouTube debate in Florida .
Paul is often quicker and less plastic than his counterparts , and could do well in such a format .
But where will Ron Paul really do his damage ?
It could be by seriously damaging the Republican establishment his followers so despise .
How ?
By running as a third - party candidate .
In critical " Red States , " where the vote may turn on just a small percent , Paul could block any hope of a GOP victory .
That would likely mean a Hillary Clinton presidency .
But it might also mean a true remake of the Republican Party for the future .
The abandonment of the get - along , go - along Republican Party is something that many , including and beyond Paul 's supporters , would like to see .
The New York Times has to correct itself again , this time on Iran
By David Walsh
26 June 2007
On Monday , June 25 the New York Times published an “ Editor ’s Note ” correcting an article in its Sunday edition .
The note hardly answers the questions raised by the “ corrected ” article .
Sunday ’s front - page story , “ Iran Cracks Down on Dissent , Parading Examples in the Streets , ” is accompanied on page 9 , where the story continues , by a large , rather sensational photograph taking up five columns .
The Times ’ caption reads , “ A police officer forced a young man whose clothes were deemed un -Islamic to suck on a plastic container Iranians use to wash their bottoms . ”
The ninth paragraph of the piece , by Neil MacFarquhar , asserts , “ Young men wearing T - shirts deemed too tight or haircuts seen as too Western have been paraded through Tehran ’s streets by uniformed police officers who forced them to suck on plastic jerrycans , a toilet item Iranians use to wash their bottoms .
In case anyone misses the point , it is the official news agency Fars distributing the pictures of what it calls ‘ riffraff . ’
Far bloodier photographs are circulating on blogs and on the Internet . ”
The image on page 9 is presumably one of the Fars photographs in question .
The modest correction Monday explains that “ the man in the photograph , according to widespread Iranian news reports , was one of more than 100 people arrested recently on charges of being part of a gang that had committed rapes , robberies , forgeries and other crimes .
The caption published on the web site of the news agency , Fars , had said only that the man was being punished as part of a roundup of ‘ thugs ’ in a Tehran neighborhood . ”
On the Times ’ web site , the article ’s headline has been amended simply to “ Iran Cracks Down on Dissent , ” and the paragraph about the youth guilty of wearing “ too tight ” T - shirts and Western haircuts being paraded through the streets of Tehran has been eliminated .
In its defense , the newspaper ’s editors complain that the “ current repression has made reporting in Iran difficult .
In this case , the Times relied on an interview with a researcher for a nongovernment agency that no longer operates within Iran , who said the photograph was evidence of a more visible police role in public crackdowns on what the authorities consider immoral behavior .
The reporter then wrongly interpreted what the researcher said as applying to a crackdown on dress , and incorporated the erroneous interpretation into the body of the article , without giving any indication of the source for it .
“ These errors could have been avoided with more rigorous editing .
The article should not have said that young men had been paraded through the streets for wearing un -Islamic dress , and the headline over it should not have said that dissenters were being paraded as part of the crackdown . ”
A strange business , especially as this involved a leading story in the Sunday edition of the newspaper , its most widely and carefully read edition .
( The Times ’ circulation on Sundays is 1.6 million , as opposed to its daily total of 1.1 million , nearly a 50 percent difference ) .
Who , precisely , was MacFarquhar speaking to ?
“ A researcher for a nongovernment agency that no longer operates in Iran . ”
Have we not heard from this type of individual before ?
In advance of the US invasion of Iraq , a variety of stories appeared in the American media , a number of the most important in the New York Times ( more on that below ) , detailing Iraq ’s alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism .
The sources were often “ unnamed ” Iraqi exiles .
All of the claims proved to be fiction .
MacFarquhar ’s June 24 article describes a “ ferocious ” campaign of repression in Iran , “ with the government focusing on labor leaders , universities , the press , women ’s rights advocates , a former nuclear negotiator and Iranian - Americans , three of whom have been in prison for more than six weeks . ”
The lengthy piece is written in an incendiary tone and intended to push a number of “ hot buttons ” with the Times ’ US readers .
MacFarquhar cites the comments of ( also unnamed ) analysts who suggest that a “ cultural revolution ” might be taking place in Iran , “ an attempt to roll back the clock to the time of the 1979 revolution , when the newly formed Islamic Republic combined religious zeal and anti-imperialist rhetoric to try to assert itself as a regional leader . ”
The period in question witnessed the sharpest confrontation between Iran and the US .
Nine months after the overthrow of Washington - backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in early 1979 , university students in Tehran took over the American embassy and held 63 US diplomats hostage for some 14 months .
In April 1980 , the American military attempted a rescue , which resulted in the deaths of five US Air Force airmen and three Marines .
The Times piece goes on to note the controversy surrounding former president Mohammad Khatami , “ the lost hope of Iran ’s reform movement , ” over his alleged violation of Islamic morals by shaking hands with an unfamiliar woman in Rome .
It points to the arrest of 30 women ’s rights advocates “ charged with endangering national security for organizing an Internet campaign to collect more than a million signatures supporting the removal of all laws that discriminate against women . ”
MacFarquhar refers several times to US - Iranian relations .
He observes that Iran ’s National Security Council sent a three - page letter to newspaper editors recently outlining banned topics , including negotiations with Washington “ over the future of Iraq . ”
The article suggests that thousands of Iran ’s nongovernmental organizations are in legal jeopardy , “ basically because the government suspects all of them of being potential conduits for some $ 75 million the United States has earmarked to promote a change in government . ”
Abbas Milani , the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University , comments , “ The regime has created an atmosphere of absolute terror . ”
MacFarquhar ’s piece is one of those items planted in the media that are intended to inflame public opinion and strengthen the case , ultimately , for US military action against Iran .
It is not necessary to lend the bourgeois nationalist Ahmadinejad regime one ounce of political support to see through the sordid role now performed by the Times , the liberal newspaper of record .
It is functioning here , directly or indirectly , as the propaganda arm of the Bush administration .
As noted above , the Times ’ record in this regard is reprehensible .
During the buildup to the invasion of Iraq and its immediate aftermath , its reporter Judith Miller served as a conduit for misinformation and lies about Iraqi “ weapons of mass destruction . ”
These articles , in one of the country ’s leading newspapers , served to legitimize the Bush administration ’s “ pre-emptive ” war of aggression .
They helped make possible the current catastrophe in Iraq .
It turned out that Miller ’s “ exclusives ” were based on information provided by Ahmed Chalabi , a convicted embezzler and Iraqi exile leader with close ties to the offices of Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney .
After the invasion of Iraq , Miller got herself embedded with a US military unit charged with the futile task of turning up the phantom WMD .
Military officials accused Miller of “ hijacking ” the unit for her own purposes and intimidating officers in the field .
Further stories emerged about “ mobile weapons laboratories , ” which also had no basis in fact .
Miller ’s role as a conduit for the Bush administration was further exposed in the course of the investigation by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald into the administration ’s leak of the CIA identity of Valerie Plame Wilson , the wife of former ambassador and Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson .
It emerged that Miller was one of the reporters chosen by I . Lewis Libby , then the chief of staff of Vice President Dick Cheney , to expose Plame Wilson ’s CIA position in order to punish her husband and intimidate opponents of the administration ’s war policy .
Miller , in the event , did not publish a story on the matter , but she sought to cover for Libby ’s role in the government witch - hunt of a war critic by refusing to divulge the identity of her source when questioned by Fitzgerald ’s investigators , citing the confidentiality of journalists ’ sources .
The author of Sunday ’s article on Iran , Neil MacFarquhar , is not a novice , lacking experience in the complicated political affairs of the Middle East or knowledge of journalistic standards .
He was formerly the Times ’ Cairo bureau chief .
This makes all the more remarkable the sloppiness , or worse , involved in the misidentified photograph .
As the newspaper ’s own “ Editor ’s note ” acknowledges , the correct identification of the individual in the photo was “ widespread ” in Iran .
There was clearly no conscientious checking of the facts — something that would seem all the more obligatory in a front - page article that could only serve to inflame public opinion both in the US and internationally against a country that has been denounced by Washington as part of the “ Axis of Evil ” and targeted for subversion or military attack .
Is this fact - checking failure not connected to the political purpose of the piece ?
Journalists and editors can make mistakes , but some are more revealing than others .
Despite its misgivings about the Iraq disaster , the Times supports the American ruling elite ’s drive for world hegemony , including its belligerent and threatening policy toward Iran .
At the very least , this renders the newspaper predisposed , in its eagerness to make a case against Tehran , to committing this type of blunder .
The Times eventually sacked Judith Miller and published explanatory columns casting her reporting as an aberrant black mark on the newspaper ’s otherwise scrupulously objective and conscientious approach to the news .
The MacFarquhar article demonstrates , however , that the Times continues to lend its prestige to the promotion of the reactionary and militaristic aims of the US government , publishing in the guise of news articles pieces of dubious veracity which promote a definite but unspoken agenda .
Timothy Rouse , 19 , was being held on charges of assault and robbery .
The fax ordering his release claimed to be from the state supreme court , but was riddled with spelling errors and had no letterhead .
Police found
Rouse two weeks later at his mother 's house after prison authorities realised their mistake .
" It 's outrageous that it happened , " said Fulton County attorney Rick Major .
" I 'm just glad nobody got hurt , because he 's dangerous . "
' No routine check '
Rouse was being held at the Kentucky Correctional and Psychiatric Center near Louisville for mental evaluation when he was released on 6 April .
Prison officials said the fax was received from a nearby grocery store .
Police are investigating who faxed the document .
The prison 's director said their policies do not require them to check the source of faxes .
" It 's not part of a routine check , " said Greg Taylor , " but certainly , in hindsight , that would perhaps have caused somebody to ask a question . "
Mr Taylor said spelling mistakes are common on court documents .

Breaking Down the Firewall
Internet censorship is the book burning of the modern age , denying as much as a third of the world 's population access to news and information .
But a new brand of activists -- or " hacktivists " -- are using their computer expertise to help people stranded in Web - censored countries abroad ( and corporate offices and military bases at home ) jump the firewall .
The key innovation , developed by the University of Toronto 's Citizen Lab , is a software program called Psiphon .
In the latest version ( due out this winter ) , prospective users , or aid groups , contact the Citizen Lab to receive passwords and Web links .
Once signed in , users are then patched directly into the Psiphon network of servers .
A search bar pops up on their own screen , and they can surf the Web freely .
All censors see is an unfamiliar IP address , which could be for anything from a bank transaction to an eBay sale .
According to Ronald Deibert , the lab 's director , the biggest threat to the system is censors who might sign up for the service to learn Psiphon 's IP addresses and block them .
But the lab has developed a high - tech shell game to counter this measure .
As soon as one address is blocked , Psiphon assigns it to another region and puts in a new one .
When the next one gets discovered , Psiphon again swaps in a new one .
The process can go on indefinitely , until the censors grow tired or the firewalls come down .

Electronic Skin
As fast and small as our electronics and computers are today , there is one major drawback .
They are hard and rigid and fragile .
Completely the opposite of what Stéphanie Lacour is making : bendable , stretchable circuits that will one day be used to make electronic skin and malleable computers .
In 2002 , as a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton , Lacour found a way to make metal stretch by embedding it in rubbery silicone .
Doing so allowed it to expand to twice its original length without breaking .
The next step was building a flexible circuit .
Lacour , now heading her own lab at Cambridge University , did this by consolidating all the hard microcomponents of the circuit into tiny rigid " safe zones , " which are networked to one another by stretchable metal .
The final product is a silicone patch the size of a stick of gum that bends and twists like a rubber band .
The most obvious application is for prostheses .
Imagine a computerized hand that can feel heat from a stove or a lover .
Lacour hopes to develop the first such prosthetic glove in two to five years .
Initially , it will need to be hooked up to a tiny computer to alert the wearer to various sensations .
The next step is a system that mimics the shape of neurons and relays signals directly to the brain , enabling the wearer to process tactile information in real time .
But those without prostheses will benefit from Lacour 's innovation as well .
She envisions T - shirts embedded with electronics that can detect if a baby has stopped breathing and a foldable GPS - enabled map .
Then there are the crazier , more fun ideas Lacour dreams up on a daily basis -- things like interactive tattoos that might change from a lion to a tiger to a skull , depending upon your mood or outfit .

The Pollution Magnet
Eighty - two thousand people die from cancer in Bangladesh every year , many due to arsenic poisoning .
But building upon her discovery of a way to get rust nanoparticles to bind to arsenic , Vicki Colvin has invented a new , astonishingly easy way to clean the water supply :
Sauté a teaspoon of rust in a mixture of oil and lye , which breaks down the rust into nano - sized pieces .
Retrieve the rust particles with a household magnet .
Then immerse the rust - covered magnet into a pot of contaminated water .
Pull out the arsenic .
The system is up to a hundred times more efficient than existing methods , and requires no electricity or manufacturing infrastructure , so even the poorest of villagers can use it .
Depending upon government regulations , Colvin 's extraction system should go global in as few as five years .
Yet ultimately , Colvin , a professor of chemistry and chemical and biomolecular engineering at Rice University , has bigger plans .
She sees her method as just the first step toward developing an easy point - of - use water - purification system that would cover virtually every pollutant .
The filter would have a dipstick to tell you what 's in the water and a reader to tell you what you need to add to pull it out -- perhaps silver nanoparticles to kill bacteria or a protein to capture pesticides .

Machines That Fix Themselves
There will come a time when computers and robots do n't need humans to program them .
For mechanical engineer Hod Lipson , that time is now .
And it all starts with his four - legged starfish robot .
Beginning with no idea of what it looks like , the starfish makes random motions and measures how it tilts .
It then generates about a hundred different hypotheses about what its structure might be , moves itself again , collects more data to determine which models are potentially correct , and behaves accordingly .
It continues this process of weeding out less - useful models until an accurate one is found and takes hold , a process inspired by Darwinian evolution .
And if anything happens to it -- for example , it loses one of its legs or falls from a table -- it can then generate a new model to adapt to different circumstances , with no human assistance .
Well beyond smart robots , this self - adapting technology could one day be used to erect buildings that can repair themselves , airplanes that anticipate mechanical problems , and bridges that sense and readjust for potential structural pitfalls .
In the shorter term , a self - modeling robot could be used to explore the planets , repairing and reprogramming itself depending upon conditions on the ground .

Burying Our CO 2
Kurt Zenz
House isnt the first scientist to suggest sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean .
But he is the first to come up with a solution that might actually work .
The key is depth .
Whereas other plans to sequester carbon in the ocean were plagued by fears that the CO 2 would escape , House advocates going much deeper -- at least three thousand meters , or two miles below sea level into the seabed .
At that depth , House hypothesizes that the extreme water pressure and low temperature will turn the carbon into a liquid denser than the surrounding water , forming a layer that will prevent it from rising back up into the ocean .
" We can store all the CO 2 from humanity for centuries , and it would n't change sea levels by a centimeter , " says House , a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in earth and planetary sciences .
" And there is n't any major life at that depth , so the footprint is very light . "
Estimated costs are about forty dollars to capture and store a ton of the gas , about the amount of CO 2 produced by a car every 500 to 1,500 miles , depending on the make .
House is currently in talks with a major oil company to start field tests while a group of developers from New Jersey wants to build the first power plant that would use his system .

The Next Plastic
Plastic has changed little since its heyday in the 1960s .
It 's still ubiquitous , oil based , and dirty as hell for the environment .
Makes you wonder what we 've been doing all these years .
For one thing , not listening enough to chemist Geoffrey Coates .
In his lab at Cornell University , he 's been reinventing plastic .
Making it environmentally friendly and biodegradable -- with orange peels .
The key is limonene , a citrusy - smelling chemical compound made from orange rinds that when oxidized and mixed with carbon dioxide and a catalyst can be turned into a solid plastic .
The final product can be made into anything from Saran wrap to medical packaging to beer bottles and naturally biodegrades in just a few months .
And because it can be produced using recycled CO 2 from carbon - spewing factories , simply making Coates 's plastic can help the environment .
Since 1999 , when Coates and his colleagues first began experimenting with limonene , they 've discovered a number of other natural materials , such as pine trees and soybeans , that can be manipulated into biodegradable polymers as well .
And more recently , they 've been experimenting with artificially creating polyhydroxybutyrate , a polypropylene - like plastic that is naturally produced by bacteria .
While Coates 's natural polymers are more expensive to produce than most current plastics , he stresses that this is n't just another radical innovation that will never make it out of the lab .
Novomer , a company he cofounded in 2004 , will see its green plastics used in high - end electronics in the next couple of years .
Once production is scaled up , less - expensive mainstream consumer products such as food containers will follow soon after .

The first step in the development of colon cancer is the formation of benign tumours , called adenomas , in the intestine .
Over time , these tumours may progress to produce colon cancer if they undergo a series of mutations and genetic alterations .
Researchers at IRB Barcelona under the direction of Eduard Batlle , ICREA researcher and head of IRB Barcelona 's Oncology Programme , have discovered a new mechanism by which the benign tumour cells receive instructions to grow in confined compartments , and no to invade other areas of the tissue .
The description of this new tumour suppression mechanism is reported in the scientific journal Nature Genetics .
The scientists observed that adenomatous tumour cells have special surface receptors , called EphB2 and EphB3 , which detect the presence of certain ligands in the healthy tissue that surround them .
These receptors and their ligands serve to organize the structure of intestinal tissue .
Thanks to the activity of EphB2 and EphB3 , the tumour cells are forced to " listen to " the signals that they receive from their environment .
These signals make the benign tumours grow in a confined space , from which they are unable to spread .
" We knew that these receptors worked as tumour suppressors , but we did not know how .
Now we have been able to observe that they compartmentalize the tumour , thereby preventing its spread " , explains Batlle .
Until the tumour cells learn to deactivate these receptors , they cannot invade other tissue outside the compartment .
Batlle goes on to say , " as the tumour cells progress to become malignant , their genetic programme is refined and they remove the signals that block their growth , including these two receptors , which impose positional information " .
This study explains one of the key mechanisms of how a benign tumour transforms into a malignant one during the onset of colon cancer .
Using experiments performed with animal models and in vitro cells , the scientists determined that the loss of compartmentalization , that is to say , the loss - of - function of these two receptors , is one of the vital factors in the development of adenoma - derived colon cancer .
It is estimated that between 30 and 50 % of people over 60 years of age may develop one of these benign adenomas .
Cancer of the colon ranks first in the list of the most common cancers in Spain , with more than 25,000 causes diagnosed each year .
Last year alone , more than half a million people worldwide died as a result of this disease .
German officials will not press their US counterparts to arrest a team of 13 CIA agents , who are suspected of illegally detaining a Lebanese - born German national , Khaled el Masri , after he was wrongfully suspected of terrorism .
German newsmagazine Der Spiegel , in an advance report on its Monday issue , wrote that Berlin does not plan to forward an extradition request by Munich prosecutors to arrest the agents linked to the detention of el Masri in Macedonia in December 2003 .
Masri still suffering from imprisonment ?
El Masri is now facing criminal charges himself
Prosecutors issued warrants for the agents at the end of January , accusing the unnamed suspects of wrongfully imprisoning el Masri and causing him serious bodily harm .
El Masri , 44 , told a German parliamentary inquiry he had been flown to Afghanistan and tortured over a five - month period .
Earlier this month , he was indicted for an arson attack on a cash - and - carry market .
He is accused of setting fire to several cans of petrol and causing damage worth 500,000 euros ( $ 700,000 ) .
His lawyer , Manfred Gnjidic , has blamed Masri 's behavior on the events of 2004 .
Justice minister wants to avoid coalition trouble
According to the magazine , the German justice ministry inquired in Washington about how a request would be handled and was informed in clear terms that the agents would not be arrested .
Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries then reportedly decided not to press the issue in order not to exacerbate divisions within the grand coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel , the magazine said .
A justice ministry spokeswoman confirmed the report to AP news service .
Harming US - German relations ?
Schäuble ( left ) and Zypries have had a rocky relationship
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble had opposed the application for fear it would harm relations with the US , in particular with regard to intelligence on terrorist suspects .
Schäuble , a member of Merkel 's Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , and Zypries , of the junior partner in the coalition , the Social Democrats ( SPD ) , have clashed in recent weeks over the interior minister 's plans to spy on the personal computers of terrorist suspects .
Schäuble also made headlines this week by saying that a nuclear terrorist attack was just a matter of time and that people should enjoy the time they had left instead of panicking .
Increasing divisions have opened up within the cabinet over the past week on a range of issues , many of them centred on countering terrorism .
The current working spec for the HTML5 standard has a lot of exciting features we would eventually like to implement in WebKit .
One feature we felt was exciting enough to tackle now even though the spec is still in flux is client - side database storage .
So for the last few weeks andersca , xenon , and I have been cooking up an implementation !
The client - side database storage API allows web applications to store structured data locally using a medium many web developers are already familiar with – SQL .
The API is asynchronous and uses callback functions to track the results of a database query .
Compact usage defining a callback function on the fly might look something like this :
var database = openDatabase ( " Database Name " , " Database Version " ) ; database .
executeSql ( " SELECT * FROM test " , function ( result1 ) { database .
executeSql ( " DROP TABLE test " , function ( result2 ) { alert ( " My second database query finished executing ! " ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
There will also be a small example of how to use the API in a real site that we ’ll try to keep up to date as things evolve .
This initial implementation has some things missing from the spec as well as a few known bugs .
But it does the basics and the best way to discover what needs work is to get it out there for people to start using it !
If you find any bugs , would like to suggest features , or have gripes about the spec itself , please drop by #webkit or drop us a line on the WebKit email lists .
Oh , and one more thing …
We ’re landing this initial implementation with pretty cool Web Inspector support !
So far you can view the full contents of any table and run arbitrary queries on each database a page is using .
We have a lot of ideas for improvements but would also love to hear yours .
Cheap Ways To Learn And Feed Your Brain
Education is pretty costly but we ’re always on the lookout for opportunities to learn without having to spend too much in the process .
So how about trying these methods for feeding the brain cells .
Not all of them will grant you a diploma ( though some will ) , but you ’ll walk away more enlightened .
Cost Effective Ways To Learn Or Get An Education
# 1 Go to the library and borrow some books .
You can read up on anything and everything at the library for free .
The computers there are free to use as well .
Libraries have saved me a bundle by being the source of books for my children , who enjoy the variety afforded by their inventory .
This way , there ’s no need to outgrow anything !
Members of my family are also avid readers who partake of this free service at our local community .
# 2 Sign up for online classes .
You can sign up for virtual classes and they ’re usually much more affordable than attending classes on site at colleges and universities .
Some are even free !
Just check out the facts over in this article : Technophilia : Get a Free College Education Online .
Some universities are going this course as well !
# 3 Audit some classes .
Certain universities allow you to drop in and check out their classes .
Some allow you to audit their classes based on their policies .
This means you can attend the lectures , but you will not be responsible for homework or exams , and you will not receive credit for the class .
Often , your cost for doing this is a fraction of what it would normally be to take these classes ( e.g. 30 % – 50 % ) but can also be full tuition in some cases , so you ’ll need to check with the school ’s office about their programs .
# 4 Have your employer pay for it .
Some companies have a wonderful benefit that allows you to take classes on their penny .
I ’ve known co-workers who took their MBA while being employed along with me !
Some schools also offer an online mba program .
This was a benefit I did n’t partake of , unfortunately .
For me , it ’s because of my perennial excuse of not having enough time !
# 5 Get a business deduction for your learning materials .
If you have a business , you may be able to take tax deductions on learning materials that you actually apply to your venture .
For example , if you ’ve set up a real estate company and on occasion go to training for the work you do , you may just be able to qualify for a tax break .
But you ’ll need to check with your CPA about this .
# 6 Attend college extension classes .
A cheaper way to get a similar education from a university is to sign up for their extension classes .
# 7 Pay tuition through someone ’s 529 account , even yours !
A few confessions :
The reason why many of my colleagues have refused to start a 529 account was because they feared their kids would bail on college and the 529 would go to waste .
I argue that they should strongly reconsider .
The 529 account saves you all sorts of tax on this education .
For the worst case scenario , you can consider this alternative : if your kid refuses to get a higher education , you can jump at the chance to use your 529 funds on yourself !
The money here happens to be transferable onto other eligible candidates such as yourself or other kin .
There ’s a lady named Nola Ochs who proves that you can never be too “ old ” to get a higher education .
I know this idea could be a stretch for some people but I honestly feel that the “ risk ” of the 529 is worth taking and that my children will indeed be attending college one day .
# 8 Get used or free books from stores and fairs .
There are stores and various places that give away books .
In fact , there are those places that ca n’t give them away fast enough .
Be there to get a piece of the action .
Big discount chains have piles upon piles of books for sale so cheap I ca n’t help but stock up on some on occasion .
# 9 Get used courses / books from eBay or other online sources .
Craigslist , my ever favorite online classified site gives a lot of stuff for free , even educational materials .
You can even subscribe to your chosen channel for easy pickings .
Definitely a great idea if you have something like this in your local area .
Ditto for eBay and other such sites .
# 10 Use audio tapes / courses .
Every so often , I receive an intriguing package in the mail , and it ’s some kind of invitation or advertisement on multimedia learning covering actual courses taught in institutions .
Or so they claim .
But for a few hundred bucks you can take these courses and apply some self - education at a fraction of what you would get from the universities themselves .
Even without the fancy degree , you ’ll still get the knowledge .
What Kind Of Student Are You ?
So just how much important is education ?
Learning is so highly valued that there are those who ’ll pursue it even when they ’re way past their physical prime … .
I mentioned an admirable woman named Nola Ochs , who decided to go to school .
To me , it ’s a highly admirable thing .
Graduating in May 12 , Nola
Ochs is the oldest person to ever get a college diploma , at 95 years old .
Or there are those who ’ll do most anything , even the most outrageous stunts to fulfill a dream .
Or maybe it ’s not as much their dream as it is that of their high - achieving families .
Case in point : Azia Kim , the fake Stanford student who pretended to be part of Stanford ’s class of 2010 .
Azia wanted so much to be a Stanford student that she “ faked ” her way into classes and wormed her way into the student body .
Imagine that !
Not that her scheme was unique : I knew students who spent entire semesters “ auditing ” classes at my college by sitting in large lecture halls where you could for the most part , blend in anonymously .
They did this in order to take a class without a grade and / or with permission from a professor .
As far as I know , there ’s nothing unlawful about registered students doing this .
Just do n’t try living on campus grounds for free or fleecing the school off their dorm food .

From ABC :
As President Bush took a question Thursday in the White House Rose Garden about scandals involving his Attorney General , he remarked , " I 've got confidence in Al Gonzales doin ' the job . "
Simultaneously , a sparrow flew overhead and left a splash on the President 's sleeve , which Bush tried several times to wipe off .
Deputy White House Press Secretary Dana Perino promptly put the incident through the proper spin cycle , telling ABC News , " It was his lucky day ... everyone knows that 's a sign of good luck . "

Fiat 500 is Car of the Year 2008
Hatchbacks , News , Fiat

The international jury presiding over the Car of the Year award , made up of 58 specialist journalists from 22 European countries , has elected the Fiat 500 Car of the Year 2008 with 385 votes , ahead of the Mazda 2 ( 325 votes ) and the Ford Mondeo ( 202 ) .
In addition to winning the Car of the Year 2008 award outright , the super - compact Fiat distinguished itself by obtaining votes from most members of the jury : 57 out of 58 included it in their short - list , and 33 made it top in their personal rankings .
This is the second time – the first was the Fiat Panda in 2004 – that an A - segment model has won the most prestigious award in the world car industry .
This extraordinary record brings total Fiat Group Automobiles wins to twelve : the Fiat 124 ( 1967 ) , Fiat 128 ( 1970 ) , Fiat 127 ( 1972 ) , Lancia Delta ( 1980 ) , Fiat Uno ( 1984 ) , Fiat Tipo ( 1989 ) , Fiat Punto ( 1995 ) , Fiat Bravo / Brava ( 1996 ) , Alfa 156 ( 1998 ) , Alfa 147 ( 2001 ) , Fiat Panda ( 2004 ) and the Fiat 500 ( 2008 ) .
Launched on 4 July this year , the new Fiat 500 immediately aroused huge interest and very favourable comments made by more than 7,000 people from 63 countries ( more than 1,000 journalists were accredited ) who homed in on Turin for its début : institutional authorities , financial analysts , businessmen and celebrities from the worlds of entertainment , fashion and sport .
Critical acclaim was immediately confirmed by intense customer interest .
More than 105,000 orders were taken in just four months in only two countries ( Italy and France ) , while interest continues to grow in the rest of Europe , ( for example : 6,300 orders have already been placed in Germany where the car went on sale just a few weeks ago ) .
As of today , in Europe , the Fiat 500 stands second in the A - segment with a share of 14.1 % ( behind the Fiat Panda with a 21.2 % share ) .
The Fiat 500 is the manifesto of ‘ new Fiat ’ , a model that is in all respects the physical demonstration of the company ’s new approach , the renewed strategies of the brand , a different way of interpreting the car .
That is why the Fiat 500 has set new benchmarks in its segment .
For example , this is the first time that a car barely 3.55 metres long has been awarded a 5 star crash safety rating by Euro NCAP , and this is the first time that a car in this segment has seven airbags fitted as standard ( it is also the only super - compact to fit a knee - bag ) , with the advanced ESP available on all models ( standard on the 1.4 16 v 100 bhp ) .
In addition , this is the first time that a model has been launched with the entire range of power units ( 1.2 69 bhp , 1.3 MultiJet 75 bhp with DPF and 1.4 16 v 100 bhp ) , built to respect emissions limits set by Euro 5 , and all this more than two years in advance of the legislative deadline .
This is also the first time that a ‘ small ’ car like the Fiat 500 has been able to boast such a broad range , which is made possible by choosing from : four trim levels , three engines and 12 colours ( among these are six vintage colours that evoke memories of the ’50s and ’60s , and the three - layer white , a sophisticated paint process that up to now has only been adopted on supercars ) .
Customers can also choose from 15 interiors including the prestigious Cordura and Frau Leather , nine types of road wheel , and 19 sticker treatments , for a total of more than 500,000 variations .
In addition , 100 original accessories have been designed for the Fiat 500 – among which the most surprising are an electric aroma diffuser and colour - coded key fobs – along with the most advanced infotelematic systems : for example a multifunctional portable navigator from the Blue&MeTM platform .
The Car of the Year award started in 1964 .
To enter , new cars must go on sale in at least five different European markets in the course of the year .
Judgments are expressed on the following parameters : design , comfort , safety , economic operation , driveability , performance , practicality , respect for the environment , price and value for money .
A first selection is made from all the new models marketed in the course of the year ( this year 33 cars were involved ) and seven are shortlisted .
Each member of the jury has 25 points to distribute among the seven cars , with a maximum of 10 points going to their first choice .
The award ceremony for Car of the Year 2008 , organised by the German magazine Stern , will take place in Berlin on 28 January 2008 .

Your Comments
I have just written a success manual .
Actually , it ’s a book on the world ’s oldest , best , yet least implemented success manual .
I posted it on - line this week .
It ’s free — a bonus for my readers .
You can be a success , just not at zero price .
The price is high .
The manual ’s price is n’t .
It ’s in the public domain .
But the cost of implementation is personally much higher than most people are willing to pay .
It ’s a lot easier to sell a success manual than a failure manual .
To sell a manual based on a record of personal failure , you must first gain the reputation of being highly successful .
That is n’t easy .
But , as I shall show , it ’s doable .
Begin with a slogan : “ Nothing succeeds like failure . ”
You must believe this with all your heart .
Next , you need a verifiable track record of failure : a career - long series of failures which nevertheless gains you the reputation for being an extraordinary success .
You need to be like the pointy - haired manager in “ Dilbert . ”
He survives , no matter how much havoc he creates .
The Federal Reserve System surely qualifies .
I can see the headline in a full - page ad .
Wake up the financial idiot inside you !
How you can cash in big - time on your own failures .
Then there are the bullet teasers .
World ’s leading experts reveal :
You ’ve heard the phrase , “ a license to print money . ”
How to get one .
How to plant your very own tree that everyone says money does n’t grow on .
How to get the reputation of being a brilliant rescue specialist when you actually caused the disasters , some of them catastrophic .
How to get all the money you want and then decide how much to pay the government at the end of the year .
How to silence your most dangerous potential critics by hiring them or else by buying them off with money that costs you nothing .
How to get your few unbought critics labeled by the media as conspiracy nuts .
How to bamboozle Congress in full public view at least four times a year , decade after decade .
IS THIS A JOKE ?
When you read the ad , you think , “ This is some kind of joke . ”
Indeed , it is : a practical joke — the most successful practical joke in modern history .
It ’s highly practical for central bankers .
The joke ’s on us !
The Bank of England pioneered this failure - guaranteed system in 1694 .
It was a privately owned bank that had the right to issue currency and buy the government ’s debt .
As its powers were expanded by Parliament over the years , its notes became legal tender .
Creditors had to accept them in payment of debts .
It was only at the end of the 19th century that central banking became universal .
It took until December 22 ( House ) and 23 ( Senate ) , 1913 , when most of Congress had gone home for the Christmas holidays , for the Federal Reserve System to be enacted into law .
President Wilson signed the bill that same day .
All the Democrats voted for it .
The Democrats had traditionally opposed central banking .
Republicans tended to oppose it , they who had always favored central banking .
William Jennings Bryan , who had been the Populist opponent of Eastern bankers and banking , was President Wilson ’s agent for getting the Federal Reserve Act passed .
As Secretary of State , he lobbied Congressmen to vote for the bill .
Years later , he said this had been his greatest mistake .
Too late .
It is always too late .
All it took was a name change .
It is called the Federal Reserve System .
The work “ bank ” is nowhere to be seen .
It has 12 regional banks , so as to confuse the rubes .
The New York FED was for decades the main decision - maker , not the Board of Governors .
The New York FED is the only permanent regional bank with membership on the Federal Open Market Committee , which decides to buy or sell debt .
My point is simple : all it took was a name change and the creation of insignificant regional reserve banks to gull the rubes in 1913 .
Today , no one cares .
This is the central fact : no one cares .
Economists of all views ( except the Austrian School , and even some of them do ) accept the idea of central banking .
Economists are employed by the hundreds by the system .
The freshman college economics textbooks are all favorable .
So are all the upper division textbooks on money and banking .
There is no other agency of government that has universal acceptance , yet all but the Board of Governors are not part of the government , as their websites ’ addresses indicate .
They are all “ org . ”
The FED is the most powerful privately owned monopoly in the United States and therefore the world .
Yet anyone who points this out as a negative factor is dismissed as a crackpot or a conspiracy theorist or both .
No other organization in the United States is equally immune from criticism in the Establishment media .
When you find any idea or organization that is immune from criticism from the major institutions , you are inside the temple .
This was the title of William Greider ’s book on the FED , Secrets of the Temple : How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country ( 1987 ) , which was unwilling to call for its abolition .
In a 1988 review in The Washington Monthly , a liberal magazine , the author made the point : nobody cares any more .
Ironically , the Federal Reserve had its philosophical roots in the populist uprisings of the late 1800s , when farmers and small businessmen rose up against the power of the big banks .
But the bankers managed to frame the new institution in a way that gave them effective control .
Reforms made in the 1930s diluted the power of the banks over the Fed but left intact an unusual , hybrid government institution with little direct accountability to the public .
The president appointed Fed governors , but they held 14 - year terms that assured their independence .
The chairman held only a four - year term , but that term was set so that one president could saddle his successor with an uncongenial central banker .
The unusual arrangement went unnoticed by most people .
As Greider points out , the “ money question ” was the subject of great debate during most of the nineteenth century , when William Jennings Bryan stirred thousands with his famous “ cross of gold ” speech , calling for an abandonment of the gold standard .
But in the twentieth century , the Fed succeeded in convincing the public that monetary policy was an arcane undertaking that need not concern the average American .
Never mind that the Fed had the power to bankrupt thousands of small businesses , to erode a lifetime ’s savings , or to throw millions of people out of their jobs .
Maybe the most accurate book title on the FED is this : The Federal Reserve : An Intentional Mystery .
It was published over two decades ago by Praeger , an Establishment publisher .
The plan worked .
No one cares .
FED - MADE DISASTERS
The basic disaster is this : ever since 1914 , the dollar has lost 95 % of its purchasing power , according to government statistics .
( Inflation Calculator , Bureau of Labor Statistics ) .
The secondary disasters have been the recessions , above all , the great depression of the 1930 ’s , which was a consequence of the FED ’s monetary policies in the 1920’s .
The best book on this is Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression ( 1963 ) .
It ’s free here .
Each time , the FED has escaped blame .
The only exception was Milton Friedman ’s attack on the FED for its policies in the 1930 ’s ( A Monetary History of the United States , 1963 ) , which he argued could have been solved with more FED - money creation .
He did not blame the FED for the fiat - money funded boom of the 1920’s .
The FED is praised when the economy booms .
The bubbles are an unfortunate side effect .
What is a side effect ?
An effect we do n’t like .
The FED is criticized when it fails to intervene with more fiat money in any liquidity crisis brought on by the FED ’s slower rate of money creation in the post - bubble period .
The critics say that the FED must take action to lower interest rates .
The FED always does .
Then the praise resumes .
Price inflation accelerates .
Debt accelerates .
Bubbles reappear .
All this is blamed on speculators .
The FED has the reputation of being the man on the white horse : the rescuer of last resort .
Here is the program : ( 1 ) Create a problem .
( 2 ) Solve the problem .
( 3 ) Get praise for having solved the problem .
( 4 ) Make sure the solution leads to the next problem .
Repeat forever .
A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY
Actually , it ’s much better than this .
It ’s a license to print digital money — so much digital money that nobody except illegal immigrants use printed money exclusively .
They send it to relatives back home .
So , there can never be a run on the banks .
Any money withdrawn from one bank winds up in another bank .
Digital money can’t go in your pocket .
Nobody who speaks English and who has a bank account uses paper money to make most of his transactions .
This has been the fulfillment of bankers ’ dreams for five centuries : no more bank runs by the public .
No more lines in front of banks .
The problem today is all those hedge fund managers and mortgage brokers , who packaged mortgages and other collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ’s ) , and who are now facing default by the borrowers .
There is no guaranteed market for these new , creative , and untested forms of debt .
In mid-August , 2007 , the markets for billions of dollars worth of these supposedly marketable securities simply disappeared at anything like a retail price .
Henry Liu comments .
In a financial crisis , there may simply not be enough credit - worthy borrowers at any interest rate level and the number of sellers stay stubbornly larger than the number of buyers because sellers need to sell precisely because they do not have credit worthiness to borrow even at low interest rates and buyers stay on the sideline waiting for even lower prices .
This is the problem facing the FED and other central bankers .
The outfits that have run up the debts to the banks are no longer credit - worthy .
They now face bankruptcy .
They cannot unload their assets at anything like book value .
The commercial banks lent hundreds of billions of dollars to them , and in a panic meltdown , these assets fall in value .
The FED can pump in money , but in a panic , banks will buy T - bills , not the assets that are threatened .
This is why the FED has announced that it will accept subprime mortgages as collateral .
But this still means mass inflation if it has to buy all of them .
The FED must create monetary base money to buy this junk , and then commercial banks expand their loans to take advantage of the FED ’s increased reserves .
They will not loan to struggling hedge funds and similar sinking ships .
When the Fed adds liquidity directly into the banking system through the discount window , it injects high - power money into banks by making interest rate for overnight interbank banks loans within its set target .
The theory is that banks will in turn be able to make loans at interest rates deemed appropriate by the Fed , thus relaying the added liquidity to the market in multiple amounts because of the mathematics of partial reserve .
This will inflate the economy .
It will not provide solvency for highly leveraged hedge funds .
With deregulated global financial markets , central bank capacity for adding liquidity to the banking system is constrained by its need to protect the exchange value of its currency .
For the US , which depends on foreign central banks to fund its twin deficits , any drastic fall of the dollar will itself create a liquidity crisis from foreign central banks shifting out of dollar in their foreign exchange reserves .
If the dollar falls in relation to other currencies , the Treasury will have to raise interest rates to attract replacement money .
That money may come from newly liquified American banks , but that does no good for the liquidity squeeze of the private capital markets .
Here is what the FED is facing :
The current challenge is one of returning an abnormal economy of excess liquidity to an economy of normal liquidity without extinguishing the flame of liquidity entirely .
The period of stress will be the time it will take to work off the excess liquidity , to turn the liquidity boom back to a fundamental boom .
It is not possible to preserve abnormal market prices of assets driven up by a liquidity boom if normal liquidity is to be restored .
All the soothing talk about the fundamentals of the economy being strong notwithstanding the debt bubble is insulting to the thinking mind .
Bernanke ’s FED tried from February , 2006 to mid-August , 2007 , to move the economy from excess liquidity to “ normal ” liquidity .
But that is what the FED has tried to do ever since 1920 .
It never sticks to the program because of the resulting liquidity crisis and recession .
Will the stock market hold up , once it is clear that the FED ’s money is insufficient to re-liquify credit - unworthy borrowers ?
Will the economy remain positive ?
Liu does not think so .
This is a debt economy fed by a liquidity boom .
When the liquidity boom turns to bust , all the strong fundamental indicators such as corporate earnings will wilt from a debt crisis .
Asset value cannot be held up by simply adding excess liquidity forever without creating hyperinflation .
Also , some liquidity problems , such as those caused by a loss of market confidence , cannot be solved by merely injecting money into the financial system which in fact will only add to the problem .
Restoring market confidence requires a rational restructuring of the economy to absorb excess liquidity .
So , having solved the age - old problem of bank runs by depositors , the commercial bankers are now facing massive default by their borrowers .
If it ’s not one thing , it ’s another .
The stock market faces a problem .
So does the corporate bond market .
“ When debts are not repaid , financial value is destroyed which will be expressed in falling asset prices .
This loss of value will need to be reckoned in the economy . ”
The FED loaned $ 2 billion to the four largest U.S. banks on August 22 .
This was through the discount “ window . ”
Why lend to banks ?
Why not lend directly to faltering hedge funds ?
Liu has an explanation .
However , the Fed ’s actions reflected a shift of the focus of concern from hedge funds towards banks who loaned the hedge funds money to trade with leverage .
Banks are also exposed to the problem of having committed credit lines to financial institutions with subprime exposure , such as mortgage lenders or specialist investment vehicles .
Banks have also arranged loans to risky firms such as buy - out groups , which they had planned to sell into a debt market that had evaporated overnight .
An estimated $ 300 billion of unsold loans are sitting on bank balance sheets , gobbling up funds pushing up reserve requirements .
If he is correct about $ 300 billion of unsold loans , then the FED faces a true disaster .
I think Bernanke ’s attempt to wring liquidity out of the system was successful .
The FED is now running like mad to reverse this policy .
CONCLUSION
The FED keeps intervening to make things better , and the result seems to be systemic vulnerability .
This is the fate of government intervention generally .
It produces the opposite of what the planners promised .
If nothing succeeds like failure , then the FED may soon be able to add a spectacular chapter to its success manual .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 27 — The Food and Drug Administration does very little to ensure the safety of the millions of people who participate in clinical trials , a federal investigator has found .
In a report due to be released Friday , the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services , Daniel R. Levinson , said federal health officials did not know how many clinical trials were being conducted , audited fewer than 1 percent of the testing sites and , on the rare occasions when inspectors did appear , generally showed up long after the tests had been completed .
The F.D.A. has 200 inspectors , some of whom audit clinical trials part time , to police an estimated 350,000 testing sites .
Even when those inspectors found serious problems in human trials , top drug officials in Washington downgraded their findings 68 percent of the time , the report found .
Among the remaining cases , the agency almost never followed up with inspections to determine whether the corrective actions that the agency demanded had occurred , the report found .
“ In many ways , rats and mice get greater protection as research subjects in the United States than do humans , ” said Arthur L. Caplan , chairman of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania .

There are times when it is not enough to feel outraged .
One has to speak out .
To express the outrage .
To speak out , and to be heard , against that which is wrong .
Indeed , there are times in life when it is difficult to determine exactly what is right .
Reality , after all , is complex and nuanced .
However , there are also times – more often than we think – when there is no ambiguity about what is wrong .
Just plain wrong .
Silence , at such moments – especially in the face of violence – cannot be justified .
The least one can do is to call the wrong , wrong .
In the short life of this blog there have been many such moments .
The disgraceful behavior of the police in pulling down the shalwar of a young man protesting his father ’s disappearance .
The killing of a woman minister in Gujranwalla just because she was a woman .
Pictures of violence against women , including by so - called ‘ celebrities ’ like cricketer Moin Khan and squash player Jansher Khan .
The criminal humiliation and murders of tailors and barbers just because they do not conform to some jahil maulvi ’s misconstrued sense of religosity .
The violence of self - righteous vigilantism .
The brutality against lawyers and judges in the aftermath of the Chief Justice ’s removal and subsequently since then .
The Karachi carnage .
The trampling of all political decency in the cause of personal ambition and thirst for power .
And more .
If we , as Pakistanis , do not wish to be defined by the acts of the vile people who do such acts , define who we are as Pakistanis , then all of us must speak out in outrage against such acts .
To speak with conviction and to speak as a prelude to action .
Now is time , again , to do .
One hears now of renewed violence against Buddhist relics in the Swat region by followers of the maverick extremist Fazlullah who has been enticing violence in multiple forms .
The most blatant mutilation of the giant Buddha of Jehanabad was back in October , but since then there have been renewed calls and attacks by militants on Buddhist relics and there is a serious concern that while attention remains diverted towards Gen .
Musharraf ’s struggle for his personal power , these historical treasures may be lost for ever .
As we have written here before , the area is rich in historical heritage of the Gandhara and Buddhist periods , and there is a history of previous attacks on Buddhist symbols in Pakistan , in fact in the Federal Capital Islamabad .
Reporting on the October 8 desecration of the Giant Buddha , Archaeology reported :
The turmoil in Pakistan , especially the situation in Swat , has scholars concerned about the safety of the country ’s artistic and archaeological heritage .
Relatively peaceful until recently , Swat was a tourist resort with spectacular mountain scenery .
It also has a rich cultural heritage , especially Ghandaran art and Buddhist monuments .
Adriana Proser , John H. Foster Curator of Traditional Asian Art , at the Asia Society in New York explains , “ This area of what is today northern Pakistan was along a major route of the Silk Road .
Gandhara was one of the major sites of the Kushan period ( first through third centuries ) .
The art of the Gandhara area is extremely important because it shows the impact of Hellenistic and Roman influence ushered in through the conquests of Alexander the Great .
The stylistic impact of Gandharan Buddhist art traveled vast space and time , reaching places as far away China , Korea , and Japan .
The Gandhara region became part of the Sasanian Empire ( 224-642 ) , which preceded Islamic rule in Persia , and consequently the arts of the region also influenced artistic developments in the Middle East . ”
The consequences of prolonged political infighting in Pakistan , leaving Taliban - like militants unchecked may have dire consequences for this heritage .
On Monday , October 8 , dynamite was used to obliterate the face of a of 23 - foot - high seventh - century seated Buddha carved into a rock face near the village of Jehanabad in the Swat Valley .
This was the second attack on the Buddha .
In early September , militants detonated explosives placed above and below the Buddha , but only damaged the stone rather than the sculpture .
It appeared , according to police chief Mohammad Iqbal in an AFP story , “ to be the work of the local militants who condemn these relics as being un -Islamic .
It looks more like a symbolic attack to embarrass the government internationally . ”
A witness in Jehanabad says that the armed group entered the village Monday evening and announced their intention to destroy the Buddha .
According to Aqleem Khan , a provincial archaeology department official who spoke to Reuters , the militants drilled holes into the rock , filled them with dynamite , then set off the explosion the morning of Tuesday , September 11 .
Abdul Nasir , a curator at the Swat museum , known for its collection of Ghandaran sculptures , told AP that “ Islam teaches us to respect other religions and faiths , but unfortunately some elements are disturbing the peace in the Swat valley . ”
“ Any destruction of archeological and artistic sites such as this Gandharan Buddhist relief are an enormous loss for all who treasure historical records and significant and rare works of art , ” says the Asia Society ’s Proser .
The attack recalls the March 2001 destruction of two giant Buddha statues in central Afghanistan by Taliban militants .
“ The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was a political act in religious guise , greatly increasing the reputation of the Taliban among its target audience , ” says Archaeological Institute of America vice president John Russell .
“ The AIA calls on all governments , and particularly in this case the government of Pakistan , to protect our shared world heritage from groups that exploit heritage for political gain by destroying parts of our common past . ”
Adds AIA president C. Brian Rose , “ Destroying icons in the name of religion has unfortunately been a component of human behavior since antiquity .
In areas of conflict , archaeological institutes throughout the world need to work in unison to document and protect cultural property that is at risk . ”
The destruction of the Jehanabad Buddha is on the direct call from extremist mullah Fazlullah who has been spreading his message of hate and violence across the region .
We have written before about the jahalat ( ignorance ) and violence that he has been preaching in relation to his opposition to children being vaccinated against polio and his violent measures against anyone – including tailors who stitch trousers and barbers who shave faces – who dares to go against his xenophobic version of religosity .
Fazlullah ’s movement enjoys local support from the so - called ‘ Local Taliban ’ but does not enjoy any support outside of the immediate area .
Fazlullah ’s organization is banned by the government and there is military action being taken against him and his followers .
However , this campaign is not very successful and the military is suffering significant losses .
This is partly because of his local support , but even more because the action is itself half - hearted and strategically misconceived .
Importantly , while Gen. Musharraf is exactly right in diagnosing movement ’s such as Fazlullah ’s as one of the greatest challenges facing Pakistan today , the General ’s obsession with wanting to remain in power has distracted him from taking meaningful action against such criminal actions .
While those who believe that simply removing Gen.
Musharraf will solve the problem are clearly wrong , it is increasingly evident that his departure is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for meaningfully tackling this menace .
It is now increasingly clear that even if Gen.
Musharraf has the will to resist religious extremism , he no longer has the ability to do so .
There are , of course , many aspects to what is happening in Swat – not just related to Pakistan ’s domestic politics but also to geo-strategic and global realities .
My former colleague at Tufts University , Prof. Gary Leupp has written a thoughtful piece on the subject in CounterPunch , pointing out some of these aspects , drawing interesting chronological linkages , and pointing out that a disrespect for cultural heritage in times of war is by no means restricted to the Taliban .
But none of this is or can be a justification for what is happening in Swat today .
The treatment of these religious symbols and artifacts in Swat is but a small indicator of the rot of extremism that is setting in , but it is an important indicator .
It is important not only because the world has its own sensibilities and is paying great attention .
It is far more important because it seems that Pakistanis themselves are not paying enough attention .
We need to do so .
We need to speak out .
We need to stand up .
We need to do so not simply because of what might happen to our past heritage if we do not , but more because of what might happen to our own future if we do n’t .
At stake here is not just an image on a rock - cliff or our image abroad , at stake here is our own image of who we are and who we might become if we remain silent in the face of injustice .
Life as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate -- especially if you 're not resting on your laurels -- is not as awash in dignity and respect as you might think .
Myanmar democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi ( 1991 ) has spent 10 of the last 17 years under house arrest .
Jimmy Carter 's ( 2002 ) name has been dragged through the mud for expressing sympathy for the Palestinians .
Meanwhile , Mohamed ElBaradei ( 2005 ) , the International Atomic Energy Agency chief , has been the object of an ongoing campaign by the administration to strip him of his credibility .
Every chance it gets , it brushes aside the passing grades the IAEA has given Iran 's nuclear program and portrays ElBaradei as not only too lenient , but a loose cannon .
Worse , the Washington Post has seen fit to carry the administration 's water .
In a recent editorial , it wrote : " Rather than carry out the policy of the Security Council or the IAEA board , for which he nominally works , Mr. ElBaradei behaves as if he were independent of them , free to ignore their decisions and to use his agency to thwart their leading members -- above all the United States . "
Due to his failure to deliver Iran an ultimatum -- never mind that it 's unwarranted -- and " represent anyone other than himself , " " the options of the Bush administration .
. . may be greatly attenuated . "
( That 's " weakened " to us rabble . )
In other words , EB , if Bush & Co. launch another witless war , the Post will lay the blame at your feet .
As if that were n't insulting enough , the editorial was titled " Rogue Regulator . "
Considering the term " rogue " is more often applied to states that have acquired nuclear weapons outside the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty , that 's clearly a low blow by the Post .
Perhaps the New York Times would be more sympathetic to ElBaradei's alarm at the administration 's eagerness to attack Iran .
An editorial Thursday got off to a promising start .
" Like Mohamed ElBaradei , we want to make sure what he calls the ' crazies ' do n't start a war with Iran . "
By crazies he meant the unholy alliance of Cheney and the Neocons .
The editorial continues by claiming it fears that ElBaradei's " do - it - yourself diplomacy is playing right into the crazies ' hands -- in Washington and Tehran . "
Reading the Post editorial , one can't help wondering if what really concerns it is that ElBaradei could thwart the administration 's war plans .
The Times , however , is apprehensive that those plans might succeed , especially if the IAEA 's el jefe does n't adopt different tactics .
" According to the so - called work plan agreed to by Mr. ElBaradei , Iran will address one set of questions at a time , and move on to the next set only after his inspectors have closed the file on the previous set .
. . .
The further along the Iranians get , the greater our fear that President Bush , and Vice President Dick Cheney , will decide that one more war is n't going to do their reputation much harm . "
Iran , it urged , should suspend enrichment and the administration should tread the diplomacy track .
" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complained last week that the I.A.E.A. should n't be in the business of diplomacy , " the editorial continued .
" Yes , that 's her job .
And she 's not done nearly enough . . . "
Sure , Rice is seeking to give her legacy a makeover from dupe of the Neocons to stateswoman .
But , even with Secretary of Defense Gates 's support , she still lacks the wherewithal to stare down Cheney .
Putting all your peace eggs in Rice 's basket is as delusional as believing in the Easter Bunny .
" Some critics , " the Times writes , " charge that the Nobel Prize has gone to Mr. ElBaradei 's head and that .
. . . he believes he 's the only one who can stop what he fears is an imminent war . "
Is that grandiosity -- or a realistic assessment ?
As became abundantly clear when Congress passed the Kyl - Lieberman bill , no government figure has seen fit to make a mission of halting the march to war in its tracks .
But nature abhors a vacuum and who better to fill the void than ElBaradei ?
The Post and the Times seem to think , sure , he 's a Nobel Peace Prize winner , but he 's taking the " peace " part way too seriously .

Pakistan captain Inzamam - ul - Haq : Ready for questions in Urdu
The players will speak only in Urdu , said former player Pervez Mir , the team 's press liaison officer .
The decision was also taken " because 2007 is our national tourist year and we are promoting Pakistan as well , " said Mir in Montego Bay , Jamaica .
" This is the perfect platform to promote and expose our language . "
He added that a Pakistan player had been misquoted in Trinidad following the gas leak that led to the team being evacuated from their hotel earlier in the week .
" A journalist spoke to Danish Kaneria and asked him what he thought about the gas leak and he tried to play the incident down and said ' It happens ' .
" But when the report came out the journalist quoted him saying ' It happens at home as well ' .
" So we would rather avoid these kinds of incidents and speak in Urdu at official times . "
The team 's coach , Englishman Bob Woolmer , is not a recognised Urdu speaker , and will presumably not be bound by the rules .

Everyone makes mistakes .
When big business plans are mistaken , however , it ’s typically after they ’ve spent millions of dollars on marketing campaigns to let us know about their flawed products .
Here we present the advertisements for ten of the most infamous product failures in history .
10 ) Sony Betamax
The 1979 Betamax was a real breakthrough for its time and for the video recording business .
It ’s a shame it did n’t catch on .
Grandma must be pretty ticked off that all of her memories are trapped in a dead format .
Why it failed :
Despite having higher quality ( and a cooler name ) , Betamax was defeated by VHS when over 40 companies decided to run with the VCR - compatible format instead .
The lower price of VHS - C camcorders probably helped a little too .
Want to avoid these types of mistakes ?
Hiring professional business plan writers can help you avoid common pitfalls .
9 ) Coca Cola - New Coke
Bill Cosby , a soda can , and a crystal ball .
Nope , nothing odd there .
Is Bill Cosby really trying to be believable ?
Why it failed :
There was nothing wrong with old Coke .
Life lesson :
If it ai n’t broke , do n’t fizz it .
New Coke brought on a lot of complaints from customers ( not nearly as many complaints that would have come in , and rightfully so , years later when Cosby ’s dark side was revealed to all ) .
We all get complaints … here are Growthink Complaints
8 ) Polaroid – Instant Home Movies
Five seconds into this commercial and this guy has already lost us .
“ Imagine if someone invented a wonderful box ( what ? ? ) and gave you a way to catch little pieces of your life so that you could see them again , anytime , by just dropping them into the box .
Now , now …wo .. would n’t that be something ? ”
Why it failed : Polaroid will inevitably be associated forever with the act of standing around shaking a picture that may or may not come out as intended .
Trusting Polaroid to capture any life event big enough to warrant a video camera would just seem reckless .
What about you ?
Are you planning a new marketing plan campaign ?
Need help planning your strategy ?

7 ) Pepsi – Crystal Pepsi
Who knew that 15 years later Van Halen would be done with Sammy Hagar and bring back David Lee Roth ?
Also , who knew we would live in a world without Crystal Pepsi ?
We were pretty sure it was here to stay .
Why it failed : Similar to New Coke , there was no real need for Crystal Pepsi .
Despite the shifting tides in early 90’s marketing towards healthiness and purity , people just did n’t get excited about a clear caffeine - free Pepsi .
Not really a surprise - those who were that concerned with the health and color of their beverage probably would not be Pepsi drinkers to begin with .
6 ) McDonalds – Arch Deluxe Burger
Worst . Commercial .
Ever .
Anytime you think the best way to market your product is by standing in an elevator in a chef ’s outfit and begging the people on that elevator to eat that product … you might want to go back to the drawing board .
Why it failed :
The goal of the Deluxe line was to market McDonald ’s fine cuisine to the adult demographic .
Unfortunately , adults were n’t interested in paying significantly more for slightly different burgers .
5 ) Apple – Lisa
Wow .
Looks like it took Steve Jobs and his minions a few years to really get the hang of that “ cool commercial ” thing … .
Why it failed :
The Lisa was geared towards business consumers , though those consumers were attracted to the lower price tag on IBM PCs .
NASA got behind the Lisa project , which they regretted after it was discontinued two years later .
4 ) Levi’s – Type 1 Jeans
Apparently jeans that are perfect for those situations when you ’re being dragged through the dirt while hanging on to a rope wrapped around a possessed car do n’t resonate with the masses .
This confusing Super Bowl commercial was simultaneously the debut and the death knell for Levi ’s Type 1 Jeans .
Why it failed : Fashion is a capricious field .
The designers at Levi ’s made Fashion Fumble # 41 b : Celebrating the launch of a product before checking to see if anyone RSVP ’d to the Evite .
3 ) IBM – PCjr
This is what happens when you only have enough money in your marketing budget to afford a dead guy .
This commercial is flawed on many levels .
Would Charlie Chaplin really know how to use a computer ?
He was born in 1889 , back when North Dakota was n’t even a state yet .
Why it failed :
This computer had a hefty price tag .
At $ 699 , it was twice the price of computers from Atari and Commodore .
Many were also disappointed at the awkward layout of the factory - shipped keyboard .
2 ) DeLorean – DMC - 12
How this car failed to catch on perplexes us .
We know we ”d want one .
Why it failed :
The fall of the DeLorean Motor Company was not due to the vehicle , which is no surprise because this car is an incredible piece of engineering and style .
Rather , failure ensued after hard times fell on the company ’s founder .
John DeLorean ’s empire was dismantled after his arrest on accusations of drug - trafficking resulted in bankruptcy .
1 ) Ford – Edsel
“ They ’ll know you ’ve arrived when you drive up in the 1958 Edsel , the car that ’s truly new ! ”
I guess in 1958 , new was slang for ugly .
The front of this car bothers us , as it looks like an angry mechanical face .
Why it failed : A small army worth of factors came together to curse the Edsel .
A name that did n’t resonate with the crowd , a bizarre pricing strategy , and a national recession have all been cited as factors by those who use the Edsel as an example of how not to market a product .
Standing 30 cm ( 1ft ) tall and boasting a chest circumference of 20 cm ( 7.75 in ) , the talking plastic Jesus is bigger than a Spiderman action figure .
But it remains to be seen whether the toy has the commercial clout to outsell the webslinger .
A US company is ready to launch Biblical dolls in Britain and is negotiating with distributors to have the products on sale in the high street by early next year .
California - based One2Believe has had homegrown success with its toys , which include a talking Mary and a Daniel complete with lion and den , and is praying for a similar happy ending in the UK .
Figures from its Tales of Glory range are available for a limited period in 400 Wal - Mart stores , the first time the world 's largest retailer has sold a full line of religious toys , and they have sold in their thousands .
Company spokesman Josh Livingston said : " We are actively looking for a company that can distribute the toys to retailers in the UK .
The UK market is important to us because we want to reach children with the Gospel whether they live in the US or Europe or elsewhere . "
One of the most popular toys is the 30cm talking Jesus , who recites three verses from the Bible - Mark 12:30 , Mark 12:31 and John 3:16 - each lasting 11 seconds or less , as well as a 59 - second telling of the feeding of the 5,000 with five loaves and two fishes .
" We are finding that the toys are being purchased by parents who are both very involved in their faith and those who are looking for a way to introduce faith to their children .
The distributors are interested in talking to Toys ' R ' Us as well as other major secular retailers .
If the toys have been placed in Wal - Mart they would be interested in doing something like that in the UK , " he added .
A foot - high Jesus may be a hard sell for British shops , says the owner of toy retail chain The Entertainer .
Gary Grant , who is a Christian , said : " Stores choose toys they know they can sell .
People in the US are more open about their faith and in certain areas the sale of these toys would have been encouraged .
Britain does not have a Bible belt but it does have large and lively churches .
I can see people being threatened by Jesus , it 's too Christian , but people would feel more at home with Daniel , who has a lovely story .
Jesus is a unique character .
I can't see why anyone would want to buy their child a Jesus toy if they were n't from a faith background . "
Mr Grant has previously sold religious products - Holy Bears - through his stores .
" They did well because they were n't explicitly Christian .
I do n't recall seeing religious toys on the high street - specialist shops yes - and it's my job to keep up with developments . "
The firm recommends using other services for important mail
Users e-mails have not been delivered to their intended recipients as other ISPs block e-mail traffic from Tiscali .
Tiscali has not said how many of its 1.8 m UK customers are affected by the outage which started eight days ago .
It said engineers were " taking urgent action " to block spammers using its e-mail service to send messages .
A statement on the Tiscali website read : " We have been targeted by spammers using our service , which in turn has meant other ISPs have taken measures to block mail sent by Tiscali .
This is not affecting all delivery addresses .
Some mail continues to be delivered as normal . "
The ISP said it was currently installing new hardware and updating its spam filters .
Spamhaus is certainly not seeing anything that would justify major blocking

" This work will be complete today .
It is likely to take seven to 10 days for these changes to take full effect across receiving e-mail providers . "
But some spam experts have expressed surprise that Tiscali has said its current problems are the result of spammers .
" There have been major problems in the past , " said Richard Cox of Spamhaus , a not - for - profit organisation of IT professionals that tracks spammers and publishes free real time databases of offending addresses used by many big businesses and ISPS .
" Spamhaus is certainly not seeing anything that would justify major blocking , unless it is being targeted at one or two specific networks . "
The organisation uses a network of anonymous e-mail addresses to " trap " spam .
" These are on most spammers lists so as soon as spam starts hitting those traps we know its happening , " he explained .
Spamhaus does not use services such as hotmail , Yahoo or AOL for their spam traps so if these alone were being targeted they would not appear on the Spamhaus radar .
Mr Cox speculated that the problem could be the result of a technical failure at Tiscali , something the ISP denies .
Tiscali advises customers sending important mail to use an alternative free email service .
In the mountains , the tradition of seasonal sloth was ancient and pervasive .
“ Seven months of winter , five months of hell , ” they said in the Alps .
When the “ hell ” of unremitting toil was over , the human beings settled in with their cows and pigs .
They lowered their metabolic rate to prevent hunger from exhausting supplies .
If someone died during the seven months of winter , the corpse was stored on the roof under a blanket of snow until spring thawed the ground , allowing a grave to be dug and a priest to reach the village .
The same mass dormancy was practiced in other chilly parts .
In 1900 , The British Medical Journal reported that peasants of the Pskov region in northwestern Russia “ adopt the economical expedient ” of spending one - half of the year in sleep : “ At the first fall of snow the whole family gathers round the stove , lies down , ceases to wrestle with the problems of human existence , and quietly goes to sleep .
Once a day every one wakes up to eat a piece of hard bread .
...
The members of the family take it in turn to watch and keep the fire alight .
After six months of this reposeful existence the family wakes up , shakes itself ” and “ goes out to see if the grass is growing . ”
It is unlikely this was hibernation in the zoological sense .
While extreme cold might have set off a biological response normally seen only in squirrels , bears and marmots , human hibernation probably reflects a sensible , communal decision to stay in bed for as long as possible .
But the French seem to have been particularly sleepy .
They “ hibernated ” even in temperate zones .
In Burgundy , after the wine harvest , the workers burned the vine stocks , repaired their tools and left the land to the wolves .
A civil servant who investigated the region ’s economic activity in 1844 found that he was almost the only living presence in the landscape : “ These vigorous men will now spend their days in bed , packing their bodies tightly together in order to stay warm and to eat less food .
They weaken themselves deliberately . ”
President Sarkozy ’s campaign slogan , “ Work more to earn more , ” would have meant nothing to most French peasants .
After the Revolution , government officials complained that farmers were “ abandoning themselves to dumb idleness , ” instead of undertaking “ some peaceful and sedentary industry . ”
Income acted only as a deterrent .
The people of Beaucaire on the Rhône made enough money at their summer fair to spend the rest of the year “ smoking , playing cards , hunting and sleeping . ”
Do n't be fooled , COBRA is only for the affluent .
My friend is paying over $ 1500.00 a month for himself , his wife and ten year old son .
But what happens when your COBRA benefits run out ?
Then what ?
If you 're not employed by one of the few companies still offering health care benefits , you 're on your own and God help you .
This is the situation in which many Americans find themselves , my friend is one such frightened citizen .
My friend is a hard - working , tax paying , play - by - the - rules , self - employed American .
Before I go any further , could someone answer this question ?
I 'd like to know whether Congresspeople who either lose their seats , or retire are entitled to continue receiving their Congressional benefits for an indefinite period of time ?
Do they encounter the same situation we do ?
Do they get 18 months of Congressional COBRA benefits and are they then on their own ?
Back to my friend .
His COBRA is expiring sometime in September , I told him we need to deal with his impending health insurance catastrophe .
Little did I imagine , his choices would be as bad and expensive as they are .
What is even more frightening is that he and I live in New York State which is supposedly one of the better states for obtaining health insurance .
We are blessed to have community rating in New York State which essentially means that if you 've been continuously insured , a for - profit insurer may not " underwrite " you and " cherry pick " only healthy people to insure .
They must insure you , but the costs are prohibitive and the polices awful .
New York State requires the for - profits to insure everyone , even those of us with the dreaded pre-exisiting conditions .
But particularly for the self - employed , the options are few , woefully inadequate , and very expensive .
Every year the premiums escalate at an alarming rate and the benefits shrink .
You pay alot more for a lot less .
Basically my friend can choose High Deductible junk insurance from one for - profit or another .

I want to make one final point .
I 've concluded that post - Bush , the United States will face another immense human tragedy .
High Deductible Junk Insurance is sweeping America .
For many Americans , junk insurance is all they can afford and the only insurance being sold where they happen to live .
I do not believe that it is an overstatement to say that the impact of junk insurance on the health of the American people is going to be devastating .
For example , junk insurance generally requires you and I to think long and hard before we go in for that screening colonoscopy because it 's very likely that we 're going to be paying for it out - of - pocket .
This means , that unless you have some terrible symptoms , you might not get the necessary screening .
And once you have the symptoms , it 's often too late .
Maybe Dallasdoc or other doctors will read this diary , and explain the devastating impact of junk insurance on the health of the American people .
Returning to the hypothetical $ 2000 - $ 3000 colonoscopy .
The out - of - pocket expense will cause many people to forego the test , this means that those relatively innocuous polyps many people have , will not be removed , and may over time , turn into colon cancer .
This ai n't nyceve delivering fear .
This is our sad American reality .
It 's a huge concern in Massachusetts where many are being mandated to purchase garbage High Deductible junk insurance .
If you remember only one point from this diary it should be this : mandating that people buy junk insurance is means by which the political class can proudly proclaim that they have achieved universal coverage .
This is a lie .
Junk insurance is insurance in name only .
High deductibles a healthcare worry
The newly insured may shun doctors
In its attempt to make health insurance premiums affordable , a state board is giving the go - ahead to plans with high deductibles , but that is causing concern that many newly insured people may avoid getting treated when they 're sick or may run up onerous debts to pay their medical bills .
. . .
But , research shows high deductibles deter people from getting needed treatment , including preventive care , and can plunge those without savings into debt .
. . . Bonnie Coleman of West Yarmouth bought a plan with a $ 3,500 deductible two years ago because that was all her employer offered .
When Coleman 's doctor sent her for a colonoscopy , she came home with a $ 1,200 bill and a sinking feeling that she would have to avoid other trips to the doctor .
Coleman , 53 , who makes just under $ 30,000 a year as a residential counselor at a group home , struggled to pay off the bill over many months , even with some help from the state 's free care pool .
. . . For patients who are low - income or sick , deductibles can even lead to an increased risk of death , according to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment , a study that randomly assigned 2,000 families to insurance plans with different levels of coverage and followed them for five years .

IN CONGRESS , JULY 4 , 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
It 's long overdue that the United States join the rest of the industrialized world and recognize that affordable and guaranteed healthcare is a basic right .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Imagine a trip to the airport without having to slip off your shoes .
A security employee at Frankfurt airport checks a passenger 's shoes with an X - ray machine December 26 , 2001 .
Imagine a trip to the airport without having to slip off your shoes .
A scanner using T - rays , a harmless form of electromagnetic radiation , could make that possible , researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory said on Tuesday .

A scanner using T - rays , a harmless form of electromagnetic radiation , could make that possible , researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Argonne National Laboratory said on Tuesday .
“ At airports we have to take off our shoes , ” Ulrich Welp of Argonne ’s Materials Science Division said in a telephone interview .
“ It is kind of a nuisance . ”
Using T - rays , it would be possible to examine travelers ’ shoes without the need to disrobe , he said .
T -rays have been difficult to generate without using a host of bulky equipment .
But researchers at Argonne have found a simple way to generate T - rays -- terahertz radiation -- using special , high - temperature superconducting crystals in a compact device .
“ We developed a new source for terahertz radiation , ” Welp said .
The work , done with researchers in Turkey and Japan , represents “ a big step forward , ” he said .
T-rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum that lies between microwaves on the low end and infrared radiation on the high end .
Unlike conventional X -rays , which can cause cell damage , T - rays do not have enough energy to alter cell ionization , which can lead to radiation sickness or cancer .
And while they cannot see through metals or water , they can penetrate many common materials like leather , fabric , cardboard and paper .
“ Terahertz radiation is sensitive to characteristics of a lot of chemicals , ” Welp said , offering the promise of new uses in airport scanners or detecting illicit chemicals or weapons that could not be picked up by an X -ray .
T -rays can also penetrate about four - tenths of an inch through human skin , offering some medical applications as well .
“ Tests have shown this could be a viable diagnostic tool for skin cancer and the spread of skin cancer under the surface of the skin .
You could diagnose without having to do an operation , ” Welp said .
“ It has been demonstrated that it can detect tooth decay without having to take an X - ray , ” he said .
Welp said he and colleagues still have a lot of fine - tuning to do , but the discovery offers a lot of promise .
As part of eliminating TimesSelect , The New York Times has decided to make all the public domain articles from 1851 – 1922 available free of charge .
These articles are all in the form of images scanned from the original paper .
In fact from 1851 –1980 , all 11 million articles are available as images in PDF format .
To generate a PDF version of the article takes quite a bit of work — each article is actually composed of numerous smaller TIFF images that need to be scaled and glued together in a coherent fashion .
Previously we had generated all the PDFs dynamically .
This approach had worked reasonably well , but with the strong possibility of a significant traffic increase we started to rethink things .
Clearly , pre-generating all the articles and statically serving them would be a great option .
Pretty quickly I thought about how we could do this ( and have some fun along the way , but beware — my idea of fun is probably radically different from that of most people ) .
I had been using Amazon S3 service for some time and was quite impressed .
And in late 2006 I had begun playing with Amazon EC2 .
So the the basic idea I had was this : upload 4TB of source data into S3 , write some code that would run on numerous EC2 instances to read the source data , create PDFs , and store the results back into S3 .
S3 would then be used to serve the PDFs to the general public .
It all sounded pretty simple , and that is how I got the folks in charge to agree to such an idea — not to mention that Amazon S3 / EC2 is pretty easy on the wallet .
The code to generate the PDFs was fairly straightforward , but to get it to run in parallel across multiple machines was an open issue .
Being a voracious reader of all kinds of blogs , I had come across and read the MapReduce paper from Google several years ago ( it made me weep ) .
I also knew about Hadoop , the open - source implementation of the MapReduce idea .
Given all these parts , I had a rough idea of how I could make all this work .
I quickly got to work copying 4TB of data to S3 .
Next I started writing code to pull all the parts that make up an article out of S3 , generate a PDF from them and store the PDF back in S3 .
This was easy enough using the JetS3t — Open Source Java toolkit for S3 , iText PDF Library and installing the Java Advanced Image Extension .
Once the basic code was up and running , I set about learning the intricacies of Hadoop .
The Hadoop documentation is pretty sparse but helpful enough .
I was able to create a Hadoop cluster on my local machine and wrap my code with the proper Hadoop semantics .
After a bit more tweaking and bug fixing , I was ready to deploy Hadoop and my code on a cluster of EC2 machines .
For deployment , I created a custom AMI ( Amazon Machine Image ) for EC2 that was based on a Xen image from my desktop machine .
Using some simple Python scripts and the boto library , I booted four EC2 instances of my custom AMI .
I logged in , started Hadoop and submitted a test job to generate a couple thousand articles — and to my surprise , it just worked .
I then began some rough calculations and determined that if I used only four machines , it could take some time to generate all 11 million article PDFs .
But thanks to the swell people at Amazon , I got access to a few more machines and churned through all 11 million articles in just under 24 hours using 100 EC2 instances , and generated another 1.5TB of data to store in S3 .
( In fact , it work so well that we ran it twice , since after we were done we noticed an error in the PDFs . )
Honestly , I had a couple of moments of panic .
I was using some very new and not totally proven pieces of technology , on a project that was very high profile and on a inflexible deadline .
But clearly it worked out , since I am still blogging from open.nytimes.com .
Now that this adventure can be called a success , I ca n’t imagine how we might have done it without Amazon S3 / EC2 .
The one caveat I will offer to people who are interested in doing something like this is that it is highly addictive .
We have already completed the S3 / EC2 portion of another project and I have ideas for countless more .
In the 1851 –1922 articles , you can see what kind of computer
was desired in 1892 : “ Computer Wanted ”
A Georgia woman 's finger was torn off when a 21 - year - old man in a car drove by and snatched her purse out of her hands .
The drive - by purse - snatching landed Caesare R. Pinkins in Gwinnett County Jail with multiple felony counts of robbery , aggravated battery and burglary .
On Wednesday , Pinkins swiped the 55 - year - old woman 's purse as he drove by and then stepped on the gas .
Her finger was pulled off during the robbery .
Surgical attempts to reattach it were unsuccessful .
Authorities did not release the woman 's name or say where the incident occurred .
On a tip , police later found Pinkins in a Lilburn neighborhood where he ditched the car he was driving and entered a home that was unlocked .
He also faces charges for another purse - snatching outside a Target store Monday .
Nice to know someone fingered the creep .

You see , monkey experts performed a monkey study a while back and discovered that the size of the monkey 's monkey brain determined the size of the monkey groups the monkeys formed .
The bigger the brain , the bigger the little societies they built .
They cut up so many monkey brains , in fact , that they found they could actually take a brain they had never seen before and with a simple dissection , analysis and a quick taste , they could accurately predict what size tribes that species of creature formed .
Most monkeys operate in troupes of 50 or so .
But somebody slipped them a slightly larger monkey brain -- but a monkey brain nonetheless -- and they estimated the ideal group or society for this particular animal was about 150 .
That brain , of course , was human .
Probably from a homeless man they snatched off the streets .
Community size
Ideal community size is no larger than 250 .
Past that , you really get subcommunities .
The typical guild size is 30 to 50 people .
Many guilds are even smaller than that .
Guilds which are larger than that are frequently fragmented , internally , into smaller groups .
This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival - oriented groups , such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25 - 80 , but is best around 45 - 50 .
Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time " grooming " to keep group cohesion …
Non-human primates use grooming to maintain social cohesion
Grooming is too inefficient with group sizes of 150
So humans use language , instead of grooming , to maintain social cohesion
Group size is a function of relative neocortical volume .
log( N ) = 0.093 + 3.389 log( CR ) ( 1 ) ( r2=0.764 , t34=10.35 , p<0.001 ) , where N is the mean group size and CR is the ratio of neocortex volume to the volume of the rest of the brain ( i.e. total brain volume minus neocortex ) ( Dunbar 1992a ) .
Use of both major axis and least - squares regression , as well as alternative indices of relative neocortex size , all yield equations that are of about this same magnitude .
The group size identified by this relationship appears to refer to the maximum number of individuals with whom an animal can maintain social relationships by personal contact .
It is not necessary that all these individuals live in the same physical group : chimpanzees ( among a number of other species ) have a fission / fusion form of social system in which at any one time the community ( the group in the sense defined above ) is divided into a number temporary foraging parties whose composition changes repeatedly ( see for example Wrangham 1986 ) .
Nor does it follow that a species ' social system consists only of a single type of group : it is now clear that most primate species live in complex multi-tiered social systems in which different layers are functional responses to different environmental problems ( e.g. the gelada and hamadryas baboons : see Dunbar 1988 , 1989a ) .
Rather , the neocortical constraint seems to be on the number of relationships that an animal can keep track of in a complex , continuously changing social world : the function subserved by that level of grouping will depend on the individual species ' ecological and social context .
Last week , I posted a link to an essay titled Monkey Law , by David Wong .
The essay makes reference to ‘ The Dunbar Number ’ , established by the research of R.I.M .
Dunbar on the relation of neocortical volume to social group size .has a tongue - in - cheek description of Dunbar 's discovery :
Also known as ‘ the Law of 150 ’ , this is of interest to virtual world developers in establishing the ‘ proper ’ size for social groups in online games .
Typically it is applied ham - fisted as a sign - post of optimum guild sizes .
The logic is something like , “ Someone smart has established that the optimum social group size is 150 , therefore we should make our online game support guilds of about 150 people , expect guilds to have 150 members on average , balance content and so forth with the number 150 in mind .
150 , 150 , 150 !
” Or developers may fall back to the Laws of Online Game Design and read : … and apply the same logic process ( “ Well guilds are communities , and the ideal size is … uh … from 0 to 250 … so… uh … ” ) and conclude that they should implement guild systems post - launch .
They are , after all , pressed for time .
So I started thinking :
This is antithetical to everything I have learned , seen , heard and smelled in my many , many years of playing online games , and in my fist - full of years making them .
Guilds , being the most common manifestation of online communities ( in MMORPGs , I mean ) , just do n’t typically get that big .
When they do , they are frequently , in practice , multiple subcommunities working together to overcome a common enemy ( such as , say , obstacles designed tomassive armies , because the developers expected most guilds to be that big ) .
I would expect the most common guild size to be the ‘ optimum ’ , which would imply that the optimum guild size is a lot lower than 150 .
My blog , my observations : I know , this approach is contrary to the “ Anthropologists say optimum community size is 150 , and therefore we should assume guilds to be ~ 150 members strong even if they are n’t ” , but I ’m crazy that way .
It does n’t fit my own personal observations , but I could be wrong .
So I did some googling , and ran across another skeptic , the esteemed Christopher Allen .
In his blog entry titled The Dunbar Number as a Limit to Group Sizes , he has some nice charts of guild sizes in Ultima Online , Allegiance Size numbers from Asheron ’s Call , and personal observations of other member - size averages ( and apparent limits ) in assorted other online groups .
The charts are from Raph Koster 's Small Worlds presentation .
He speculates : Sounds good , exceptwas supposed to be what provided humans with the ( so to speak ) that a social group of 150 requires , not the other way around ( the limit is n't 150 because that 's all we have time for , but rather the limit is 150 because of our brains , and that requires a more efficient mechanism than grooming to maintain ) .
The reason optimal size for ' creative and technical groups ' is smaller than the size for , say , a village , is not due to their function / purpose .
It is because the village is an all - encompassing group .
It isMeaning : There ’s nothing in Dunbar ’s research to suggest that the limit to human group size is 150 ( or 250 , or any other number ) due to time - limitations .
Or to put it another way , even if we had a mechanism for maintaining social cohesion that was even more efficient than language – telepathy , let ’s say – then we wouldbe limited to social groups of about 150 people , because that is all our brains can support .
Or for an even third way of putting it , this time in the form of a question :
What is the maximum group size humans could maintain if the limit were based on the efficiency of language as a tool for maintaining social cohesion ?
Answer :
We do n’t know !
So , I got lucky .
Chistopher Allen ’s going somewhere else with all this , and did n’t hit on the point I want to make .
So now I can still make my point , and I ’ll just refer to Raph 's charts and Chris ' observations to validate my suspicion that ‘ typical ’ guild sizes are much , much smaller than either our languageour brains can support .
You can take a closer look at just what exactly R.I.M .
Dunbar actually wrote , but I ’ll give you the stupid - person summary :
This point is mistaken for being useful to the virtual world developer .
We want to know the answer to the question , “ Well what size is ? ”
The answer depends on which formula you prefer .
Dunbar ’s equation is n’t simply a measure of neocortex size , volume or surface area , but rather … well , knock yourself out :
That gives us ‘ The Law of 150 ’ , Dunbar ’s number , really 147.8.
A different equation ( based on absolute neocortex volume ) gives us 248.6 , which might be the origin of the 250 in the Laws of Online Game design .
In order to understand why online communities are smaller than the Dunbar Number , we must keep in mind that the Dunbar Number is not a property of the group , but rather it is an attribute of the individuals in the group .
Groups do n’t have neocortical volumes , people do .
We , human beings , cannot maintain more than 150 social relationships .
Guilds in online games are smaller than this because their members have other important social relationships that they must maintain .
Do n’t you have any friends or family ?
No individual member of the group can maintain more than 150 social relationships , So let ’s say , offline , you have a 100 social relationships .
You could go online , join a guild of 50 people , and maintain all of your social relationships , both online and off .
The optimal guild sizeis 50 .
If your guild is larger than that , then it ceases to be ‘ your online community ’ .
More likely , you will have 150 offline social relationships , and as you invest yourself in the online community you begin to sever ties with your old offline friends .
Ever heard ofhappening ?
‘ Course .
Different people have needs ( or perhaps I should say , “ available capacities ” ) to form different numbers of relationships online , on a case - by - case , person - by - person basis .
This is determined by how many relationships they are maintaining in other groups , including ( especially ) offline ones .
You , being so popular with your rugged good - looks and smooth - talking ways , might be maintaining 145 social relations , straining your little brain to the very limit just to maintain those .
And then you join an online game .
You could form some new relationships with a tight knit little crew of six people .
If all six of your posse are in the same situation , then the ‘ optimal group size ’ for this hypothetical happy band is is n’t 250 or even 150 .
It ’s six !
Even if they are n’t all in the same situation , sinceare , then the optimal group size is still six .
If those other members want more relationships , then they need to join other groups ( of various sizes , up to their limit ) .
This may even dictate what sorts of games a personto join .
If the game is especially geared toward very large groups then it might even befor the average person to form the sorts of meaningful relationships which lead to cohesive online communities ( which lead to greater retention ) .
Again , not due to - limitations , but because our brains cannot handle maintaining more than 150relationships simultaneously .
My conclusion to all this leads to requirements for MMORPGs to support multi-guild , micro-guild and persistent - partner relationships .
To stop thinking of guilds as ' online communities ' and to instead recognize that online communities exist within subsets of even relatively small guilds , communities which should be supported and encouraged to form via system mechanics ( similar to the system mechanics which support guilds , only different ) .
But I ’m going to leave that essay for another day .
Update : Previously I had incorrectly attributed a quote to the PWoT article .
I dont know where it came from , but it did n't come from there , so .
Fixed now .
Canada 's Conservative federal government Tuesday introduced legislation that would create mandatory prison sentences for drug trafficking and drug producing offenses , including marijuana cultivation .
The move marks a firm embrace of US - style drug war policies by the government of Prime Minister Steven Harper and comes as part of a larger " tough on crime " legislative package .
" Drug producers and dealers who threaten the safety of our communities must face tougher penalties , " said Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson in a statement announcing the legislation .
" This is why our government is moving to impose mandatory jail time for serious drug offenses that involve organized crime , violence or youth . "
According to the justice minister , the legislation will amend Canada 's drug law , the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , to include the following mandatory minimum sentences and other enhanced penalties :
A one - year mandatory prison sentence will be imposed for dealing drugs such as marijuana when carried out for organized crime purposes , or when a weapon or violence is involved ;
A two - year mandatory prison sentence will be imposed for dealing drugs such as cocaine , heroin or methamphetamines to youth , or for dealing those drugs near a school or an area normally frequented by youth ;
A two - year mandatory prison sentence will be imposed for the offense of running a large marijuana grow operation of at least 500 plants ;
The maximum penalty for cannabis production would increase from 7 to 14 years imprisonment ; and
Tougher penalties will be introduced for trafficking GHB and flunitrazepam ( most commonly known as date - rape drugs ) .
" Drugs are dangerous and destructive , yet we see Canadian youth being exposed to and taking drugs at such young ages , and grow - ops and drug labs appearing in our residential areas , " said Minister Nicholson .
" By introducing these changes , our message is clear : if you sell or produce drugs -- you 'll pay with jail time . "
According to a justice ministry backgrounder on the legislation , marijuana trafficking offenses involving at least three kilograms of weed would be subject to one - or two - year mandatory minimum sentences if " aggravating factors " are present .
To earn a one - year mandatory minimum sentence , the offense would have to be " for the benefit of organized crime , " involve the use or threat of force or violence , or be committed by someone convicted of a similar offense within the past 10 years .
Aggravating factors that can garner a two - year mandatory minimum include trafficking in a prison , in or near a school or " near an area normally frequented by youth , " in concert to a youth , or selling to a youth .
The proposed legislation also includes mandatory minimum sentences for any marijuana cultivation offense -- if " the offense is committed for the purpose of trafficking . "
For up to 200 plants , it 's six months mandatory jail time ; for 201- 500 plants , it 's one year in jail ; and for more than 500 plants , it 's a two - year mandatory minimum .
The penalties increase to nine months , 18 months , and 36 months , respectively , if " health and safety factors " are involved .
Those factors include using someone else 's property to commit the offense , creating a potential health or safety hazard to children , creating a potential public safety hazard in residential areas , or setting traps .
The proposed legislation also doubles the maximum sentences for marijuana growing or trafficking offenses from seven to 14 years .
The Harper government 's legislation is a direct attack on Canada 's cannabis culture , the most - friendly in the West , according to United Nations usage statistics .
Look for a battle royal over this proposed step backward , and look for a Drug War Chronicle feature article on the coming battle next week .
There seems to be a common , not unfounded , view that programming is really hard .
The response from tool vendors is to produce products that make programming simpler .
They do this by introducing a user interface that ‘ simplifies ’ what would ordinarily be a programming task into something that mere mortals can understand and program without understanding too many of the fundamentals of the task at hand .
I think the view that such tools succeed at what they set out do is broadly untrue .
Up until this week I had intimate experience of only one such tool and that was BusinessObjects .
Now I ’m going back a bit here but in 1998 BusinessObjects made a tool that allowed a designer to take your ugly enterprise database and turn it into ‘ Business Objects ’ .
These objects contain a little more ‘ information ’ about the data you were looking at and made it possible to compose those objects in ways of your choosing , but crucially , they did this with the aid of graphical tools that did n’t make it look like you were really writing SQL queries at all .
This then , in - turn lets a common Jo-user compose a view of that data for a report or particular query they need without having to learn SQL .
In concept the idea has tremendous power because you can do things that you could never do before without a lot of expensive IT expertise .
The reality , for us at least , was a little different and this was I think for two reasons .
Unapparent Inefficiencies
A normal SQL programmer would know about the indices and relationship cardinalities on a table , hence they would know which joins would suck .
The abstraction provided by BusinessObjects would happily hide those inefficiencies of the underlying representation .
That made it it really easy to kill the database with a single mouse - click and drag .
You ca n’t just blame Jo-user for this either , when you hide the inefficiencies I would not be surprised if a seasoned programmer would sometimes make the same mistakes that Jo did .
Apparent deficiencies
BusinessObjects , of the time , was a language in itself .
Indeed the BusinessObjects language is in fact an abstraction of another much more general purpose language that we know as : SQL .
Programming languages that are developed for a specific domain ( or Domain - Specific Languages ) tend to exhibit their own behaviour .
They make some things easy at the expense of making other things less so .
The trick , with these tools , is to make sure that all the things you make hard are things people do n’t really do very often anyway .
The problem for us , at the time , was that we were putting a clean layer of abstraction on - top of a not - so - great database design .
BusinessObjects was n’t able to cope very well with those apparent deficiencies and so we had to go hunting for workarounds to put into place until we could get back and refactor the pimple on our software arse away .
In the end the project limped on for a bit and then I got moved onto another task and I lost track of it .
Perhaps it lives on , but I doubt it .
This week I discovered that Microsoft have a related but different purpose tool : SQL Server Integration Services ( SSIS ) .
Apparently it ’s been going on for years under a previous guise of DTS but I ’d never seen - nor - heard of it before .
Anyway , I was initially very excited when I started working with it , I really believed that I could take my complicated data import requirements and transform them into a few diagrams and have all the work done for me .
Yeah right .
The reality was somewhat different , and like our friend BusinessObjects , SSIS coped badly with the unapparent inefficiencies and the apparent deficiencies .
The conclusion is that tools like this are complex and that complexity includes , but is not limited to , a lot of the complexity of the lower - level underlying representation that they must use .
Often then , it will be far better to just use a general purpose tool ( like SQL or Perl ) to get you your reports or data transformations done .
Do n’t mess around with some factory - made ill fitting suit if you think you can tailor one yourself for less .
No matter how pretty the buttons are .
In the end I surmised that using gawk and bash I could produce something equivalent to what I wanted to do in Integration Services in a fraction of the time and hence cost .
If I ’d used Perl or Python I could have done it even better and / or faster .
I had been hoodwinked my friends .
Hoodwinked into thinking that I could write a program that was not there and discovered in the end that it was far easier to just knuckle down and make my own suit and have it fit nice , than use the pretty off - the - shelf one with the gaping crotch .
The problem , it seems , is that there is a market for tools that allow us to create code that seemingly is n’t .
We still believe , as I did , that tools will somehow save the day .
Dammit , why did n’t someone remind me earlier that there is still not , and never has and never will be any silver bullet .
Inside A ' Batterers Program ' for ' Abused ' Women
July 29 , 2003
by Nev Moore
Women Violating Women
When Hillary Clinton says it takes a " village " to raise a child , does this mean that snooping , nosey , prying and gossipy people will be surrounding all of us -- snoopers who are employees of the state with the power of police ?
This woman wonders .
I was forced by DSS to attend a " support group " for abused women , against my will .
Or else I would never see my daughter again .
That is what they told me .
I was required to report every week to the Independence House , Hyannis , although it 's supposedly for women who seek their help .
It 's run primarily by volunteers who are not counselors , therapists , or psychologists .
They are all former battered women .
Yet my DSS " service plan " stated that I had to attend for " treatment . "
The meetings were held behind closed doors .
I can't possibly express how much I hated and resented being in that room .
The women were , in general , obsessive , neurotic , and vengeful .
At the beginning of each meeting they went around the room and each woman was supposed to say a " brag " for the week .
I did not want to participate in this childish game .
The first week I was there , one woman 's " brag for the week " was that she 'd had an abortion .
Her DSS worker had suggested that she talk about it .
Regardless of whether you are pro-choice or pro-life , most people would agree this is a sad , intimate and private act , certainly not a " brag of the week " in a roomful of strangers .
There was a volunteer facilitator and a confidentiality notice was read at the start of each meeting .
It said that women did not have to talk if they did n't want to .
Whatever you said in the room was strictly confidential and would not leave the room .
It Was Repulsive I found it repulsive .
And yet this is where I was ordered to go for " treatment " to " raise my self - esteem . "
Some women had been away from their ex's for six to eight years , yet continued to go to the meetings .
It was like their victim hood was an all encompassing identity .
They were addicted to being a " victim " so people would feel sorry for them .
Many said that although their husbands never actually abused or controlled them , they did n't always agree with them .
So that was abusive .
Many other women said , " I never knew I was being abused until I came to Independence House . " [ Hmmm ...]
One woman who was not being abused , but I guess was just lonely , would often talk for the entire two hours .
She was very loud and aggressive , constantly interrupting others .
She told us that she was taking night courses , and her ( male ) teacher had asked her to stop interrupting and dominating the classroom .
She proudly told us that she called him at his home and informed him in no uncertain terms that he had verbally abused her .
It was easy to understand why she was lonely .
The support group was like a social club for her , where she had a hostage audience .
There were other women who were , as my teenagers say , right off - the - loop .
They were so intense and obsessive that they frightened me .
Some would rock on the floor and wail , or curl into a fetal position and cry loudly throughout the meeting .
One wanted to go to court and get a court order to have her ex sterilized so that he could never have children with another woman .
Another ( divorced from her ex ) wanted to know where his P.O. box was .
The women got all excited , jumping up and down , and yelling out : " Follow him , " " Watch him , " and " Pay someone to follow him . "
I believe if men do this it 's called " stalking . '
I felt like I was trapped in the piranha tank at feeding time .
On other nights , the group would be in depression mode , weeping and wailing .
I do n't mean to sound harsh and unsympathetic , but I did not want to be held hostage in a room listening to other peoples ' problems .
It was depressing and distasteful .
At times when I was bored to the point I thought I was going to start crying , I would take out my wallet and make out my grocery list on a scrap of paper .
The facilitator told me that was n't allowed because I might be taking notes on what the women were saying .
This is an accurate insight to the paranoia , negativity , and suspiciousness that pervades Independence House .
Making Money .
I realized that I never heard a facilitator encourage a woman to heal and move on with her life .
They encouraged women to stay stuck in the victim mentality .
I realized that , if women move on , they would no longer be clients .
Each woman is worth many dollars to DSS and to Independence House .
The more clients -- the more funding dollars .
Every week I received calls from our DSS supervisor , Larry Vadeboncoeur , chastising me for my " attitude " at the support group .
He told me in a meeting at DSS that I would not get my child back until my attitude changed and I " processed my issues " and " did my stuff . "
What " stuff " was never identified , even after repeated requests from me for clarification .
After all , I do n't have a degree in psychology , so I do n't understand these professional terms , like " client needs to do her stuff . "
When I told Mr. Vadeboncoeur what went on in the meetings and that they were terribly depressing and distasteful , he snapped , " That is not what goes on at Independence House ! "
I did n't " share much " in the meetings because I felt nothing in common with the group .
I said that I was forced to be there against my will and they needed to remove the word " Independence " from their title and stop handing out mugs that said : " Independence : the Freedom to make your own choices . "
When I could n't stand the breast - beating victim dance any more , I would offer small pieces of input .
My feeling is that , if the guy was that bad , then good riddance to bad rubbish .
By sitting in these groups forever , rehashing abuse , real or perceived , a woman keeps the wounds open and allows the man to still have power over her .
Each week I continued to get chastised by the DSS supervisor , Larry Vadeboncoeur , for my poor attitude and " not accepting the message . "
I was , much later , to read in my DSS file that , if they forced me to attend those meetings , I would " relate to " and " form a bond " with the women there .
( Translation : accept the indoctrination and embrace my victimhood . )
It Was ' Confidential ' I began to wonder how what I was saying behind closed doors at a confidential support group in Hyannis was finding its way to a DSS supervisor in an office in Yarmouth .
On two occasions I spoke with one of the directors at Independence House , Natalie Dupres .
I told her that DSS was using the fact that I did not want to attend her meetings to keep my child from coming home .
Ms. Dupres assured me that they never called or spoke to DSS .
She said , even with a release from a client , they could only verify attendance and participation .
They would " never disclose the content of what is discussed in a support group . "
She added , " You know what DSS is like , " inferring that DSS was making it up .
The only problem with this was that DSS was repeating , verbatim , what I actually was saying behind closed doors , including things that I deliberately fed into the group discussion just to see if they made their way back to me .
They did .
Ms. Dupres was never actually present in the support group meetings , which means that the group facilitators had been instructed to report back what I said in meetings .
The fact that I did not want to be there , and found the meetings boring and repulsive just increased my resentment and antagonism .
But , with our child held hostage , I would have done anything that anyone ordered me to do .
Eventually , Independence House decided that they did not want me there informing the other women that they were primarily funded by DSS and that what the women said in the group could be reported back to DSS and used against them .
At that point DSS decided that I had " processed my issues " as far as I was going to .
So I was released from my enforced obligation to attend .
The funding they received because I was attending was not worth having their little secrets exposed .
Our weekly schedule of mandated " tasks " for my husband and me included individual counseling for each of us , " angry man " classes for my husband , parenting classes at Independence House , random urine screens and three AA meetings a week for my husband , a weekly supervised visit at the DSS office , plus court days and meetings at the DSS office .
More Families In DSS . . .
More $ $ For Everyone
Unhealthy relationship between DSS and domestic violence Industry Two thirds of the funding to Independence House in Hyannis comes from DSS , channeled through the state Department of Public Health , while the other comes from private and corporate donations .
Therefore , Independence House is dependent on DSS for survival , and , therefore , beholden to DSS as the hand that feeds them .
They quickly learned from their mentors , who are pros at it , that if you pad your client roster by coercing unwilling clients , you fight your way to a better position on the " funders " food chain .
Last year the Dept. of Public Health cut $ 350,000 of funding to Independence House due to complaints by women .
Senator Henri Rauschenbach got it reinstated .
The relationship between DSS and Independence House ( and its sister organizations around the state ) is unhealthy and symbiotic .
Because DSS has allowed the battered women's " advocates " to trade in their rusty VW buses for new Lexuses ( that is literally true for some women who work at Independence House ) , greed has replaced integrity and an honest desire to help other women .
They work together to dramatically increase their client statistics .
When the support groups report women 's conversations back to DSS , this information is used to charge the mothers with neglect , for " allowing " their children to be exposed to " domestic violence . "
In court , DSS claims the women have " poor judgment " when it goes to court to terminate their parental rights .
The proof ?
The fact that the women attended the battered women 's center for services -- even though they were ordered to go by DSS .
As further " proof " DSS will use the restraining orders that they forced the women to get .
Although I was coerced to attend by DSS , some of the women come voluntarily for help .
The battered women 's groups basically pimp clients for DSS in return for money .
They are patronizing and condescending to their clients ( not to mention deceptive ) .
Women are coerced into accepting their cultish indoctrination via the use of threats , intimidation and fear of losing their children .
In fact , they employ all the methods and behaviors that are considered abuse and control if committed by the women 's husbands or boyfriends .
Independence House and its sister organizations provide DSS with additional clients .
The women 's groups get more money , and DSS gets more state and federal money .
They both are artificially inflating their numbers .
They inflate the domestic violence statistics this way and through the use of coerced restraining orders .
By artificially inflating the domestic violence statistics they are able to create political hysteria -- leading to more funding .
Women are ordered to leave their husbands , even in the complete absence of real domestic violence or abuse .
They are ordered to never let the fathers see their children , or DSS will charge the woman with neglect , again .
Women are ordered to leave their homes and to sever contact with their mates .
They then discover that , in order to get shelter , housing , food stamps , Medicaid , or cash benefits , they must claim to be victims of domestic violence to get a priority .
Women are told they must do this to keep their children or to get them back if DSS already has them .
The " Freedom to make your own choices " means the choices they want you to make .
The choices that will benefit them financially .
How Did We End Up In DSS ?
Government intervention turns to harassment
Thirteen months after my husband drank too much one night and with no problems of any kind after that incident , the social worker , Kathy Marciante , and Sue Ash , the domestic violence " expert , " showed up while I was working in my garden in May 1997 .
I was very surprised to see them as I had not seen or heard from any DSS social worker in a couple of months , so I did n't even think that we were still involved with DSS .
The two women , in deadly serious tones , told me that I had to pack a few things in a bag , and that I and my children would have to go with them to an " undisclosed location . "
After the shock wore off , I believe I burst out laughing .
I felt as if I had just slipped into a " B " spy movie .
The two women would not elaborate on their request , but kept adamantly insisting that I leave my home with them .
They informed me that I would not be able to contact anybody or allow anyone to know where I was .
I kept asking them why they were here , but I did n't get an answer .
They said that if I did n't go with them , they would have to consult with their legal department about removing the children .
My 16 - year old son told them that they were ludicrous and there was absolutely no reason for them to be there .
He also told them that our daughter was very close to us and clingy , and that it would deeply traumatize her to take her away from us and her home .
By this time the little one was home from school .
She was very frightened and hid behind me .
Eventually , I became angry and ordered them off my property , suggesting that they go down to a well - known crack neighborhood where they were needed .
Our daughter was too frightened to go to school the next day .
We sat her down and told her that we loved her and would never , ever allow anyone to take her away .
The following day they snatched her from her classroom .
It was weeks before we saw her again .
It was four months before we were able to get a hearing before a judge in Barnstable Juvenile Court .
We had 29 continuances before our case was heard .
It was 13 months before our daughter returned to her home .
A Year of Snooping
It had all started the previous spring after my husband spent a night of drinking with a buddy and assaulted me outside of our home .
A passerby called 911 on their car phone .
Our children were n't present or involved , one being away on a trip ; and the youngest , our seven - year - old daughter , was asleep in her bedroom at the upstairs back of our large , old captain 's house .
It is the practice of the police now to call DSS whenever they are called to a house where underage children reside .
Neither of us minimized or denied the seriousness of the incident , and we immediately took steps to ensure that this would never happen again .
I made it clear to my husband that I would not accept a chaotic lifestyle , and he could not remain in the home if he chose to continue drinking .
Of his own accord , he entered counseling and became active in AA .
He stopped consorting with drinking friends and has not set foot in a bar since that night .
I was clear about what I wanted for myself and quite in charge of my own life .
When the young , ditsy ( there truly is no other adjective I can use ) social worker from DSS showed up , we allowed her in and were civil .
I explained clearly that as two intelligent , mature adults we were quite capable of managing our own lives , marriage , and problems .
If I needed help , I knew how to dial 911 .
For several months she kept pushing me to attend " Independence House . "
Over and over , I explained in simple language that I did not feel myself to be a battered woman , and I adamantly did not want to go to Independence House .
I am not weak , dependent , nor in need of their services .
I was hardly the profile of a dependent , beaten - down , battered woman being controlled by her domineering husband .
I explained that my husband did n't control me , did n't control my money , and I was free to come and go as I pleased , have whatever friends I chose , and could say or do what I wished .
[ She wrote down that I was a textbook case of a battered woman " in denial . " ]
" Protecting My Abuser " I explained to her that I had the life of my dreams , was happy and fulfilled , and that , outside of that isolated incident , my husband treated me like a princess .
I told her , not that it was any of her business , my husband and I loved each other and were committed to our marriage .
[ She wrote that I was " protecting my abuser . " ]
She would complain about her ex-husband ( not that I had any interest in hearing ) and condescendingly say to me , " I know how you feel .
My husband was abusive , too . "
I would look at her like she had two heads and tell her that I never said any such thing .
I do not feel that way .
When I told her that my husband was very sweet to me and we had a great time together , she gave me a " service plan " on which one of the tasks was to go to Independence House for treatment to help me " lower my denial . "
[ When I told her I was happy and fulfilled in life , she wrote down that I needed treatment to raise my self - esteem .
Anyone who knows me will get a good guffaw from that one ! ]
If I said I did n't want to go to Independence House , she reported that as a sign that my husband was controlling and isolating me .
She would tell me that we could meet away from my house where I could speak freely , if I could get away without fear of repercussions .
I looked at her like she had three heads .
No matter how many times I , or the children , would tell her that we were fine , there was no violence or abuse , we were n't afraid of my husband , and there was no cause for her to be involved with us , it made no difference .
She would continue to write down that the whole family was " in denial , " and we were protecting my husband out of fear .
I attempted to use logic by pointing out to her that our house is on the main street of a quaint , little historical village , across the street from the court house , the fire station , the sheriff 's office , a few doors down from a Senator 's office , and surrounded by antique shops and lawyers ' offices .
There is a thrift shop attached to our house and a realty office .
We are highly visible in the community and well liked .
No one had ever seen or heard anything amiss .
There were no police calls to the house , not so much as a noise complaint .
I pointed out that this was not a location where disruption would go unnoticed .
It would be impossible to hide .
[ So she wrote down that there was " ongoing domestic violence . " ]
It was about this time that I began to feel like Alice going down the rabbit hole .
At that time I was unaware that all the considerable funding to " combat domestic violence " was channeled through DSS .
To the tune of $ 13 million a year .
The DSS worker brought a " domestic violence expert , " Sue Ash , to my home a couple of times .
( What are the qualifications to be a " domestic violence expert " ? )
I reiterated my story , over and over .
I felt like I was being subjected to an inquisition , and was down to reciting name , rank , and serial number .
They insisted that I meet them for coffee at a diner .
[ Maybe I 'd crack . ]
The expert also met Tommy and me together .
The social worker dropped me and my daughter off at our house .
I believed at this point that I had done everything I could possibly do to make DSS happy , without knowing why I should have to do so .
My children had never been abused or neglected by any stretch of the imagination , so why was my life being micro-managed by strangers ?
Harassment Starts Again
After a few weeks the social worker and supervisor started harassing me again , this time claiming that they had lost their copy of the restraining order and the court could n't find it in their files either .
I had lost all patience at this point and told them that it was n't my problem and to stop harassing me .
They continued to threaten to take the children unless I got another restraining order .
Later on , in court hearings and in the DSS case file , they claimed that I had gone into the court building and just pretended to get the restraining order .
My husband and I went over to court together to get another one .
The judge this time was a village resident , Judge Gerald O'Neil .
When we told the judge that we wanted a restraining order against my husband , he quipped that he'd never had a husband and wife come together to get a restraining order .
We said that we were being forced to get it by DSS even though there was no violence in our home , and that neither the children nor I were in fear .
Judge O'Neil said that he did n't like DSS dictating to him in his court room , but if not getting the order would put our family at risk with DSS , then he would issue it .
We got a restraining order for one year .
But it did n't stop them from taking our children .
The fact that I had applied for a restraining order helped them .
That 's why they wanted it .

Billionaire Wealth Building Strategies
Radley Balko’s has an interesting column at Fox News about Ron Paul this week and he clearly understands the impact that the Paul campaign could have if things go right :
Paul ’s presence in the race is important because he ’ll put issues on the table that would otherwise be completely ignored .
His presence in the primary debates alone will make them far more substantive and interesting than they ’ve been in a generation .
One example is the continuing disaster that is the drug war , which Paul rightly believes to be both immoral and unconstitutional .
Paul also opposed the war in Iraq from its inception .
Those two issues alone will differentiate him from every other candidate on the stage .
But Paul can then swing to the right of every other candidate on federal spending , regulation , the Nanny State , and the growth of government .
On these issues , he can reliably and credibly serve as the party ’s conscience , and browbeat the sitting senators and congressmen running for president for their votes issues like the prescription drug benefit , the surge in federal spending , and the party ’s complicity in the corrupt earmarking process .
(…)
While Paul probably can’t win the GOP nomination , there ’s a chance he can survive deep enough into the primaries to foster a national debate on issues like drug prohibition , as well as force the Republican Party to do some soul - searching , and perhaps reconnect with its limited government , Barry Goldwater roots .
In a way , Paul could have the same impact on the GOP in 2008 that Howard Dean had on the Democratic Party in 2004 .
Dean did n’t win the nomination , but he did end up pulling the candidates and the party further toward the left , specifically on the issue of the Iraq War .
He also managed to get himself appointed Chairman of the DNC and , while I do n’t think , that Paul will go that far , I do agree with Balko that Paul could have an impact on the political debate that far outweighs his actual popularity at the polls :
Ideally , Paul ’s bona fides on immigration , abortion , federalism , constitutionalism , and limited government will win him credibility with and respect from primary voters , giving him leverage to take principled stands and spur discussion on issues like the drug war , privacy , foreign policy , and civil liberties .
He could at least win enough votes and support to last well into the spring , forcing the other candidates to adopt parts of his agenda , and the press to cover his platform .
Of course , things could also go badly :
Under the less optimistic scenario , Republican Party leaders , primary opponents , and the punditocracy punish Paul for his principles , and demagogue his position on Iraq , the drug war , and federal meddling in our personal lives .
Talk radio , conservative leaders , and the party machinery dismiss him as an unserious candidate , and primary voters take their cue .
Under this scenario , Paul bows out early , the remaining candidates press on with business as usual , and the Republican Party continues down its unfortunate recent trajectory .
Whether that happens depends , as Balko points out , on whether George W. Bush has succeeded in destroying the limited government soul of the GOP .

Travelogue by Patryk Pawel Moriak , Link
Historical Crossroad Between Eastern and Western Cultures
Welcome our contributing travel writer Patryk Pawel Moriak .
For Patryk " traveling means something more than just nature or landscapes .
It gives opportunity to admire beautiful architecture , meet interesting people , see specific wild life and uncommon events , different in every part of the world . "
Here is the abridged version of his travelogue from the recent journey across Turkey :
Turkey has always fascinated both me and my girlfriend .
We 've heard that each area of the country has its own spirit , history , landscape and even cuisine .
With its wonderful nature , cultural mix and a 10,000 years - old heritage , much of which is still being uncovered , Turkey has so much to offer that it is not surprising one trip there is never enough .
Oludeniz ' Lagoon , near Fethiye
We do n't usually use travel agents to organize our trips .
Arranging things on our own is an opportunity to better feel the spirit and atmosphere of the places we visit .
We bought the return tickets from London to Istanbul for a three - week trek across the most interesting and famous places in Turkey :
Istanbul - Izmir - Selcuk - Efez - Dilek National Park - Pammukale - Fethiye - Saklikent Gorge - Olu Deniz - Antalya - Termessos - Kapadokya - Istanbul .
We only used the public transport and slept in inexpensive hotels or hostels .
Make sure to try Turkey 's fantastic cuisine : self - catering is not a good idea since you can dine in restaurants serving very good , hot meals for the price of supermarket food .
Istanbul : part Asia , part Europe
Hagia Sophia - one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture .
It was the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the cathedral in Seville .
The Fountains at the Church of Hagia Sophia
Across from Hagia Sophia is another prominent landmark of the city - The " Blue Mosque " of Sultan Akhmed , completed in 1616 .
It is considered to be the greatest masterpiece of Ottoman and Islamic architects who wanted to demonstrate that their buildings can rival anything their Christian predecessors had created :
The " Blue Mosque " of Sultan Akhmed
Travel tip : :
The best way to get to the city centre from the airport for a reasonable price is not to listen to any taxi drivers or private tourist informations and go straight to the subway terminal .
For 2 tickets for 1,30 New Turkish Lira each , you will get to the Sultanahmed where the biggest attractions of the city are waiting for you .
Splendid Coastline
One of the most beautiful places I 've seen in Turkey , Dilek Yarimadasi National Park is located in the region of Kusadasi and Soke , in the province of Aydin .
The park can be reached via the Kusadasi – Soke highway .
As the weather was fantastic we took a motorbike from Selcuk and spent a great time in the park .
The northern side of the park has plants rarely seen in the Mediterranean region .
There are many bays and chestnut trees , and it is the only area where the Finike juniper and pirnal oaks can be found together .
Mediterranean seals and sea turtles have breeding grounds on these shores , and one can enjoy walking , water sports and picnics for eight months of a year from April to December , and go swimming throughout the summer months .
You can walk among the linden and chestnut trees , cycle through pine woods , go rock climbing , or fishing for example .
Among many rare and endangered bird species which can be seen in the park are the Dalmatian pelican and pygmy cormorant , and if you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of wild horses .
Calcium - ridged pools look like ice
Pammukkale was the next stop for us after having a great time in Dilek National Park and Ephesus .
This place is well - known for its white calcium ridged pools on one side of the mountain .
One of the most popular ( and cheapest ) tourist sites in the world
At last we left Selcuk and took a bus to the south .
We stayed in Fethiye which is located 135 kms southwest of Marmaris - a pretty town at the hillsides of the Mount Mendos .
Mendos is the part of the Taurus Mountain chain , formed by rises and falls of the crust during the Tertiary Geological Period .
Hundreds of picturesque bays follow each other along the Fethiye shoreline .
This are is one of the most popular touristic sites in the world ( and one of the cheapest ) .

Oludeniz is situated just a 20 minutes drive from Fethiye and has an astonishing crystal - clear lagoon and a beautiful photogenic grey - white beach that adorns almost every Turkish travel brochure .
Travel tip :
When planning your trip to Fethiye and surrounding area , try to visit these places : Araxa - with its water spring , Letoon - a holy city , the ancient city of Cadianda , Telmessos , Likya Rocky Tombs , Fethiye Castle , Ölüdeniz ( Blue Lagoon ) referred as " The Eden bestowed by God to World " , Kelebekler Vadisi ( Butterfly Valley ) , Saklıkent ( Hidden City ) , fantastic beaches and much more ...
Many people recommended us to visit Saklikent Gorge , near Toros , between Fethiye and Kas .
It 's called " The Hidden Valley " and is well known as the longest and deepest gorge in Turkey - 18 km long and so steep and narrow that the sun can not reach the water , leaving it deliciously icy - cold in the summer .
You feel almost like on a different planet among high rocks , walking across the natural style bridge and along the canyon path .
You can also take a mud bath .
Just be careful with your equipment :-)
Travel tip :
It 's not easy to explore the mountains located around as there is not many footpaths , but you can get a great point of view of this amazing place if you fancy para - gliding .
It 's not the cheapest way of spending time in Olu Deniz , but from the height of 2000 metres over the Blue Lagoon where the flights begin , you will get the best point - of - view for your shots .
" Machu Picchu " of Turkey
Our next stop was the city of Antalya - pretty impressive , but we could n't wait to see one of the best preserved ancient cities of Turkey , Termessos .
This mysterious place lies at an altitude of 1050 metres in the Taurus Mountains .
Unfortunately Termessos is not accessible directly by local transport .
The most comfortable way to get there is to rent a car .
If you 're not afraid of 9 km walk , then take an Antalya - Korkuteli bus , and take off at the road junction to Termessos .
The walk takes about 2 hours at a steady pace .
It 's not so tiring even with another 20 minutes steep hike up to the ruins .
Cappadocia 's Rock City
We arrived in Goreme at 4.00 am after a long trip from Antalya .
Before exploring the amazing rocky formations we decided to have a quick look into the nearest valley .
Luckily we managed to get there a few minutes before sunrise so I had enough time to set up the camera on the tripod and find some interesting details in a foreground .
The view was incredible specially when loads of balloons started appearing on the horizon :
The natural rock citadel of Uchisar which you can see in the very back is the tallest point in Cappadocia , visible for a great distance from the region 's other towns such as Urgup and Avanos .
This shot was taken from the top of Goreme .
You will find there hotels , inns , rental houses and hostels , some of them with cave rooms , but the main reason visitors go there is to climb to the top of the tall rock outcrop via tunnels and enjoy the spectacular panoramic view , the best view of Cappadocia except for that which you get from a hot - air balloon .
We thank Turkey for its beauty , wilderness , culture , sunshine , perfectly clear water , hospitality and cuisine .
The trip brought us new experiences , memories and gave us a much better idea of what an amazing country it really is .

Congressional investigative arm seeks to oversee US intelligence activities Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 8 , 2007

The head of the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) wants his agency to be directly involved in helping Congress oversee actions conducted by intelligence community -- but the Director of National Intelligence , Mike McConnell , thinks the plan could jeopardize the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches .
In a March letter newly published by Secrecy News , US Comptroller General David Walker , who heads the GAO , expressed his support for legislation introduced earlier this year seeking to " reaffirm the authority of the Comptroller General to audit and evaluate the programs , activities , and financial transactions of the intelligence community . "
Proposed by Sen. Daniel Akaka ( D - HI ) and Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , the new bill Walker endorsed is called the Intelligence Community Audit Act of 2008 , a measure which underscores the GAO 's jurisdiction over intelligence gathering agencies such as the CIA .
" It is inconceivable that the GAO -- the audit arm of the U.S. Congress -- has been unable to conduct evaluations of the CIA for over 40 years , " Sen .
Akaka said upon introducing the bill in January .
" If the GAO had been able to conduct basic auditing functions of the CIA , " the senator continued , " perhaps some of the problems that were so clearly exposed following the terrorist attacks in September 2001 would have been resolved . "
" I believe that there are many areas in which GAO can support the intelligence committees in their oversight roles , " Comptroller General Walker said in a letter commenting on the bill to the Senate Intelligence Committee .
" We have significant knowledge and experience that can be of benefit to the Intelligence Community in connection with a broad range of transformation issues . "
Walker also echoed Sen .
Akaka 's concerns that GAO authority over the CIA and other agencies needed clear reaffirmation .
" While GAO has authority to perform audits and evaluations of the Intelligence Community , " Walker wrote , the Justice Department " has , for many years , taken a contrary view . "
" The reaffirmation provisions in the bill should help to ensure that GAO 's audit access authorities are not misconstrued in the future , " he added .
" But the idea of greater GAO involvement in intelligence oversight was sharply discouraged by Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell , who argued that the GAO could damage delicate relations between the intelligence agencies and the oversight committees , " says Steven Aftergood at Secrecy News .
Writing to the Senate Intelligence Committee a week after Walker 's letter , McConnell said that " self - initiated action by the GAO or action on behalf of non-oversight Committees could undermine the ability of Intelligence Committee leadership to direct or stay abreast of oversight activities . "
He also said the GAO " could risk upsetting the historic balance struck between the two branches of government in national security matters . "
Comptroller General Walker wrote a follow - up letter shortly thereafter , disputing many of McConnell 's concerns and otherwise suggesting tweaks to the legislation .
" I continue to believe , " he said , " there are many areas in which GAO can support the intelligence committees in their oversight role and , by extension , the Congress and Intelligence Community .
Instead , he said , the convoy had initiated the shooting when a car did not heed a police officer and moved into an intersection .
“ The traffic policeman was trying to open the road for them , ” he said .
“ It was a crowded square .
But one small car did not stop .
It was moving very slowly .
They shot against the couple and their child .
They started shooting randomly . ”
In video shot shortly after the episode , the child appeared to have burned to the mother ’s body after the car caught fire , according to an official who saw it .
In interviews on Tuesday , six Iraqis who had been in the area at the time of the shooting , including a man who was wounded and an Iraqi Army soldier who helped rescue people , offered roughly similar versions .
The Iraqi soldier , who said he was standing at a checkpoint on the edge of the square , said he thought the convoy believed the small car was a suicide bomber and opened fire .
According to the wounded man , recuperating in Yarmouk Hospital , the car with the family was driving on the wrong side of the road .
The convoy began throwing nonlethal sound bombs , several witnesses said , to keep people in the area away .
That drew fire from Iraqi Army soldiers manning watchtowers that are part of an Iraqi Army base on the square .
Iraqi police officers , witnesses said , also appeared to be shooting .
The Iraqi soldier , who did not give his name but said he was from a company of Iraqi commandos , said he saw another soldier trying to motion to the convoy to move on , but he was shot as well .
The new head of the Science Museum has an uncompromising view about how global warming should be dealt with : get rid of a few billion people .
Chris Rapley , who takes up his post on September 1 , is not afraid of offending .
' I am not advocating genocide , ' said Rapley .
' What I am saying is that if we invest in ways to reduce the birthrate - by improving contraception , education and healthcare - we will stop the world 's population reaching its current estimated limit of between eight and 10 billion .
' That in turn will mean less carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere because there will be fewer people to drive cars and use electricity .
The crucial point is that to achieve this goal you would only have to spend a fraction of the money that will be needed to bring about technological fixes , new nuclear power plants or renewable energy plants .
However , everyone has decided , quietly , to ignore the issue . '
Such arguments give an indication of the priorities of the new Science Museum chief , an office that has been vacant since 2005 when Lindsay Sharp abruptly left the £ 150,000 post following rows about financial waste , cronyism and the ' Disneyfication ' of exhibitions .
Now Rapley , currently head of the British Antarctic Survey and a passionate believer in man 's influence on climate , is set to take charge of the museum , one of Britain 's most challenging institutions , where strict academic requirements must be met while competing with Legoland and Disneyland to attract visitors .
Only by tackling the issues of the day can he succeed , Rapley said .
Hence his urging that we deal with overpopulation , a call of wide public interest and one that reflects the contents of the recent report by the Optimum Population Trust , which called for each couple in Britain to be limited to having two children each .
' A voluntary stop - at - two guideline should be adopted for couples in the UK who want to adopt greener lifestyles , ' it stated .
The interest of Rapley , 60 , in this subject stems directly from his climatic concerns .
He sits near the extreme end of scientific views about global warming .
He fears our planet faces a very hot and uncomfortable future .
This belief puts him opposite climate - change deniers , about whom Rapley is generally vitriolic .
He described the recent Channel 4 programme The Great Global Warming Swindle as ' a tissue of lies ' while individual deniers , like Dominic Lawson , are dismissed in unexpectedly terse , Anglo - Saxon terms .
' As to my job at the Science Museum , my remit is very simple , ' Rapley said .
' It is to make it the most advanced museum in the world .
I will only be able to do that by addressing the key issues in science today and the most important of these is climate change and energy policy .
However , there are topics like stem cell science and genomics that are set to have enormous impact and which will have to be tackled in detail . '
Rapley is passionate about making displays and instruments far more accessible .
' If you look at the Science Museum 's great engine hall , there are wonderful machines on display but the accompanying explanations are quite often above most people 's heads .
Most children today probably do n't realise these machines run on heat and water , but that is never mentioned .
We need different explanations for different levels of understanding : the six - year - old , the 60 - year - old , the PhD student .
At the same time , there is no point having a few touch - screens about the place .
People can only use them one at a time .
One idea would be to send free texts to visitors ' mobile phones , according to their needs , as they stand in front of displays .
Just about everyone has a mobile phone , after all . '
The Oxford - educated physicist earned his spurs as a scientist who built instruments for space probes , such as X - ray detectors for the international Solar Maximum Mission launched in 1980 .
He went on to work at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory using satellite radar scanners to study the Earth and in particular Antarctica .
' All sorts of environmental issues lead to the Antarctic : sea - level rise , ozone depletion , atmospheric warming , ' added Rapley , who is married with two daughters .
In 1997 , he was appointed head of the British Antarctic Survey and has worked there ever since .
As to key influences , Rapley points to an English teacher at his old school , King Edward 's School , Bath , who introduced him to the works of Conan Doyle .
' I learned the joys of deduction from Sherlock Holmes and they stood me in good stead for the rest of my life .
They got me to the Science Museum , in effect . '

Theory shows how quantum weirdness could still be seen on a large scale .
Watch closely enough , and a compass needle might occasionally jump instantaneously between directions .
Getty
The particles that make up the world obey the rules of quantum theory , allowing them to do counterintuitive things such as being in several different places or states at once , so why do n’t we see this sort of bizarre behaviour in the world around us ?
The explanation commonly offered in physics textbooks is that quantum effects apply only at very small scales , and get smoothed away at the everyday scales we can perceive .
But that ’s not necessarily so , say two physicists in Austria .
They claim that we’d be experiencing quantum weirdness all the time — balls that do n’t follow definite paths , say , or objects ' tunnelling ' out of sealed containers — if only we had sharper powers of perception .
Johannes Kofler and Časlav Brukner of the University of Vienna and the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information , also in Vienna , say that the emergence of the ' classical ' laws of physics , deduced by the likes of Galileo and Newton , from quantum rules happens not as objects get bigger , but because of the ways we measure these objects1 .
If we could make every measurement with as much precision as we liked , there would be no classical world at all , they say .
Killing the cat
Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger famously illustrated the apparent conflict between the quantum and classical descriptions of the world .
He imagined a situation where a cat was trapped in a box with a small flask of poison that would be broken if a quantum particle was in one state , and not broken if the particle was in another .
Quantum theory states that such a particle can exist in a superposition of both states until it is observed , at which point the quantum superposition ‘ collapses ’ into one state or the other .
Schrödinger pointed out that this means that the cat is neither dead nor alive until someone opens the box to have a look — a seemingly absurd conclusion .
Physicists generally resolve this paradox by invoking a process called decoherence : the destruction of quantum superposition as quantum particles interact with their environment .
The more quantum particles there are in a system , the harder it is to prevent decoherence .
So somewhere in the process of coupling a single quantum particle to a macroscopic object like a flask of poison , decoherence sets in and the superposition is destroyed .
This means that Schrödinger ’s cat is always unambiguously in a ‘ realistic ’ state , either alive or dead , and not both at once .
But that ’s not the whole story , say Kofler and Brukner .
They think that although decoherence typically intervenes in practice , it need not do so in principle .
Bring the cat back
“ We prefer to say that the [ kittens ] are neither dead nor alive , but in a new state that has no counterpart in classical physics . ”
Johannes Kofler and Časlav Brukner
The fate of Schrödinger ’s cat is an example of what in 1985 physicists Anthony Leggett and Anupam Garg called macrorealism2 .
In a macrorealistic world , they said , objects are always in a single state and we can make measurements on them without altering that state .
Our everyday world seems to obey these rules .
According to the macrorealistic view , " there are no Schrödinger cats allowed " says Kofler .
But Kofler and Brukner have proved that a quantum state can get as ' large ' as you like , without conforming to macrorealism .
The two researchers consider a system akin to a magnetic compass needle placed in a magnetic field .
In our classical world , the needle rotates with a smooth movement that can be described by classical physics .
But in the quantum world , the needle could be in a superposition of different alignments , and would just jump instantaneously into a particular alignment once we tried to measure it .
So why do n’t we see quantum jumps like this ?
The researchers show that it depends on the precision of measurement .
If the measurements are a bit fuzzy , so that we ca n’t distinguish one quantum state from several other , similar ones , this smoothes out the quantum oddities into a classical picture .
Kofler and Brukner show that , once a degree of fuzziness is introduced into measured values , the quantum equations describing an object ’s behaviour turn into classical ones .
This happens regardless of whether there is any decoherence caused by interaction with the environment .
Watch the kitten
Kofler says that we should be able to see this transition between classical and quantum behaviour .
The transition would be curious : classical behaviour would be punctuated by occasional quantum jumps , so that , say , the compass needle would mostly rotate smoothly , but sometimes jump instantaneously .
ADVERTISEMENT
But watching such quantum jumps between life and death for Schrödinger ’s cat would require that we be able to measure precisely an impractically large number of quantum states .
For a ' cat ' containing 1020 quantum particles , say , we would need to be able to tell the difference between 1010 states – too many to be feasible .
Our experimental tools should already be good enough , the researchers say , to look for this transition in much smaller ' Schrödinger kittens ' : objects consisting of a smaller number of particles .
What state would those ' kittens ' be in ?
" We prefer to say that they are neither dead nor alive , " say Kofler and Brukner , “ but in a new state that has no counterpart in classical physics . ”
No one has yet explicitly looked for such effects .
8 Lessons I Learned From The Cheapest Family In The Nation
How a family of seven is able to live on $ 35,000 a year after taxes .
I ’ve read about America ’s Cheapest Family in various articles and posts but have n’t really seen them in action till I caught a repackaged episode of 20 / 20 where they were once more featured .
I cannot believe how a family of seven with children ages 10 through 21 are able to pull off living on an annual budget of $ 35,000 .
They are the aptly named Economides family from Arizona , and they are super - savers .
After watching their segment my main impression was that living that frugally indeed takes a lot of work , organization and effort , which would appear especially more challenging to the uninitiated .
Some impressive facts :
The family paid off their house in 9 years even as their income averaged $ 33,000 a year .
Of course , the ease of pulling this off would depend on the original cost of their home .
Steve Economides refers to himself as his family ’s CEO or “ Cheap Economizing Officer ” and is a freelance graphic artist .
Both he and his wife Annette operate the family business called “ HomeEconomiser ” which offers a Web site and newsletter for frugal living .
They spend $ 350 per month for food and disposable items covering paper goods , cleaning supplies and personal care items .
A freezer is a necessity to them .
They devote a few days a month to cooking all their family meals then store 13 to 17 meals in the freezer each time .
Now you can see why they ’re all smiling here !
The Economides say that “ it takes a little bit of time to sit down and plan a menu .
But you eat better , you save more money , and it creates less stress in your life . ”
From their experiences , I picked up these lessons based just on what they ’ve shared in their interviews and stories .
To be able to stretch those dollars hard , here ’s what they did :
What America ’s Cheapest Family Has Taught Me
# 1 Plan .
Saving a lot of money begins with serious and meticulous planning .
To save some serious money , you ’ll have to start with a plan and a system that will involve developing a budget , applying a lot of resourcefulness , collecting coupons , creating a grocery list , checking and re-checking the list before going out to buy anything .
You will also need to plan your menus in advance , take careful inventory of what you have in your home , and do some product and pricing research to see which items are priced best .
The Economides family promotes once a month cooking ; here ’s a description of how it is done .
# 2 Organize .
Good organizational habits help you achieve successful money management .
By being more organized , you ’re bound to save good money .
While the cheapest family has gone on to work things out like clockwork , I ’ve unfortunately lost money to being disorganized .
Disorganization can cause you to end up with late payments , lost coupons , late fees , forgotten checks , and so forth .
Here are some tips for becoming more organized : here ’s how to organize your coupons , and how to simplify your finances .
# 3 Shop wisely .
A super - saver is an intelligent and determined shopper .
Committed savers are those not afraid to go for the best deal .
How seriously do you take your shopping ?
Well , getting the best prices can be a real sport .
For instance , waiting for sales , negotiating for a better price , hunting for the best bargains and asking questions in pursuit of the best prices can take a level of commitment and assertiveness .
Do we have it in us to save those bucks ?
In the midst of such a sport , I ’ve seen even some tough customers fold .
Yes , including myself .
# 4 Communicate effectively .
It ’s a family project .
I was impressed at how well the Economides communicate as a couple .
It is evident how both Steve and Annette complement each other well as partners in their goal to live frugally .
Their ability to communicate well goes beyond the use of walkie - talkies while shopping to find the best deals in a store .
# 6 Embrace teamwork .
Two frugalists are better than one .
When both committed partners support each other towards a common goal , it is more likely for that goal to be achieved and success to be reached .
# 5 Make sacrifices .
The fruits of sacrifice do add up .
Though I ’ve advocated focusing primarily on saving on the big things where the impact is greatest , the examples given by the Economides family demonstrate that small savings do add up .
The actual habit of saving on smaller items became instrumental in providing the basis for their lifelong strong frugal habits .
The more they saved on everything , particularly the small things , the more disciplined they became , causing a snowball effect .
Some of the tips they ’ve employed : “ We shopped for clothes at thrift stores and consignment shops instead of ‘ the mall , ’ bought used furniture , used coupons for groceries , did our own haircuts ( except for Annette ’s hair ) and borrowed free movies from the local library . ”
# 7 Prioritize frugality .
Simplicity and frugality are lifestyle choices .
Mastering frugality in the way the cheapest family has done so , looks like it will take time and dedication to develop .
Since time is also money , and planning and being proactive about living thriftily may take some amount of time , it is up to each individual to determine how much saving money is a priority for them .
How much time are you willing to spend to work on living frugally ?
# 8 Stay determined .
Saving money takes commitment , discipline and dedication .
The cheapest family swore to never accrue any debt .
They ’ve decided that even the convenience of using credit cards is n’t worth it to them .
They simply do n’t use credit cards .
Temptations abound everywhere and even as they witnessed their neighbors bring in new furniture , they did n’t give in to “ keeping up with the Joneses ” by going out and buying something similar :
“ Choosing to avoid credit had repercussions .
For instance , in the early days of our marriage , we felt discouraged when the Danish furniture truck pulled up to our apartment complex , and our next - door neighbors had beautiful new furniture delivered .
Annette just sat on our $ 25 - orange - and - brown - plaid - missionary - purchased couches and cried .
Or , after six years , when we were cramped in our smaller - almost - paid - off house , while many of our friends were buying their second or third much larger houses , we sat and wondered if there was something wrong with our plan .
In both situations , after a time of soul - searching , we found solace and motivation in our decision to live within our means without the use of credit . ”
They are a true inspiration to all of us who want to live within or below our means .

OUT of 177 countries Sudan is most at risk of failure , according to the annual failed - states index produced by Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace , a research organisation .
Each country is given a score up to ten for a dozen political , military , social and economic indicators .
These include demographic pressures , refugee numbers , economic growth , external intervention and the legitimacy of its government .
The more unstable a country , the higher its total score .
Sudan , surprisingly , pips both Iraq and Somalia as the state most at risk of failing .
The situation in Darfur means it scores worse on indicators such as human rights , displaced people and the legitimacy of the state .
Zimbabwe owes its ranking of fourth to an appalling economy , with annual inflation at 4,500 % , and its disappearing population .
Real Time in a Real Operating System , Plan 9 From Bell Labs
By Sape J. Mullender and Pierre G. Jansen
“ It is the doctrine of real - time support in a general - purpose operating system that will , in this paper , be stamped with ecclesiastical authority . ”
“ We have integrated a real - time CPU scheduler in our operating system Plan 9 [ 7 ] .
Although our scheduler is a new scheduler in terms of sharing the operating system resources , it has its fundaments in the EDF scheduler as first introduced by Liu and Layland [ 6 ] .
Instead of only considering the CPU resource , our scheduler also considers other shared OS resources : applications indicate which resources they require ( including processor use ) , and our scheduler determines if the set of applications can run concurrently and remain schedulable . ”
“ Although other operating systems may also have real - time support , we believe there are only few general - purpose operating systems with a comparable native support for real - time applications . ”
“ In many embedded systems , some applications have stringent real - time requirements , while others can be best effort .
Traditionally , general - purpose operating systems have never been good at guaranteeing deadlines .
Various attempts have been made to introduce real - time schedulers to general - purpose operating systems .
A few systems deal with real - time applications by shutting out other applications ( the general modus operandi for the Windows family of operating systems ) . ”

What does collectd do ?
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
collectd gathers metrics from various sources , e.g. the operating system , applications , logfiles and external devices , and stores this information or makes it available over the network .
Those statistics can be used to monitor systems , find performance bottlenecks ( i.e. performance analysis ) and predict future system load ( i.e. capacity planning ) .
Or if you just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some homegrown solution you 're at the right place , too ; ) .
A graph can say more than a thousand words , so here 's a graph showing the CPU utilization of a system over the last 60 minutes :
Why collectd ?
There are other free , open source projects that are similar to collectd – a few links are listed on the related sites page .
So why should you use collectd ?
There are some key differences we think set collectd apart .
For one , it 's written in C for performance and portability , allowing it to run on systems without scripting language or cron daemon , such as embedded systems .
For example , collectd is popular on OpenWrt , a Linux distribution for home routers .
At the same time it includes optimizations and features to handle hundreds of thousands of metrics .
The daemon comes with over 100 plugins which range from standard cases to very specialized and advanced topics .
It provides powerful networking features and is extensible in numerous ways .
Last but not least : collectd is actively developed and supported and well documented .
A more complete list of features is available .
Limitations
While collectd can do a lot for you and your administrative needs , there are limits to what it does :

Three men could face the death penalty after being charged Tuesday with special - circumstances murder in the fatal shooting of a longtime PC World magazine editor during a home invasion robbery in Pittsburg , authorities said .
Tremaine Amos , 25 , of Bay Point and Darryl Hudson and Montrell Hall , both 23 and of Pittsburg , were charged with murder , robbery and burglary in the Jan. 9 slaying of Rex Farrance , who was a senior technical editor for PC World in San Francisco .
The men were each charged with two special circumstances that could result in the death penalty if they are convicted : murder in the commission of a robbery and murder in the commission of a burglary , said Contra Costa County prosecutor Harold Jewett .
The men demanded money after bursting into Farrance 's home on Argosy Court , which was filled with a large quantity of marijuana , authorities said .
Farrance turned 59 two days before he was killed .
His wife , Lenore Vantosh - Farrance , was pistol - whipped , and the robbers made off with a safe with guns inside , police said .
Hudson was allegedly armed with a . 22 - caliber revolver when he shot Farrance in the chest , said Pittsburg police Lt. Brian Addington .
The weapon was recovered six days after the slaying following a car chase involving two half - brothers of Amos , Addington said .
Farrance 's family believes the killers decided to target the home after learning from his son's friend that marijuana was grown in the home and money would be readily available .
Farrance 's son , Sterling Farrance , has said his father let him grow medical marijuana at home .
Hudson and Hall are on trial in Martinez this week on charges they robbed a Pittsburg restaurant on Jan. 24 , Addington said .
Amos is in state prison following convictions on evading police and throwing a gun at a California Highway Patrol cruiser during a chase Jan. 21 .
Farrance 's stepdaughter , who wished to be identified only by her first name , Ananda , said Tuesday that she was pleased with the arrests .
" These were really bad men , " said the 36 - year - old San Francisco woman .
" These are n't your run -of - the - mill petty thieves .
They went in there and they targeted him .
I think that they deserve the death penalty .
These people do not deserve to live . "
Jewett declined to discuss authorities ' theory on why Farrance was killed .
" I 'm not going to get into the detail surrounding why ( the defendants ) did what they did or exactly what they did , " he said .
Farrance 's family also expressed outrage at initial suggestions by police and the media that he was a possible drug dealer or user .
Jewett said , " Without regard to the legality of the extensive marijuana - growing operation that was taking place in the residence , we regard Mr. Farrance as an innocent victim in this case . "
Gordon Brown was welcomed by George Bush ahead of talks
Arriving for his first formal talks as PM with President Bush , he said the UK's " most important bilateral relationship " , was that with the US .
A foreign office minister had suggested the two countries would no longer be " joined at the hip " on foreign policy .
Talks at Camp David later are expected to include Iraq , Darfur and Kosovo .
International issues
UK Foreign Secretary David Milliband and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are expected to be at the talks , which are also likely to include world trade , climate change , the Middle East and Afghanistan .
This summit will be a success - they would n't have it any other way

Read Nick 's thoughts in full
Analysts will be looking for signs of the Brown regime distancing itself from the US during the trip .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Brown was " walking a tightrope " in his dealings with America .
Private dinner
He needed to reassure Mr Bush of his commitment to the Atlantic relationship as well as convince British voters that links between the US and the UK would be different to those maintained by former prime minister Tony Blair , our correspondent said .
The prime minister flew to Camp David for a private dinner with the president on Sunday night at his Maryland retreat .
He heads to Washington on Monday for cross-party talks with senate leaders and members of congress .
Earlier this month , Foreign Office Minister Lord Malloch Brown said it was time for a more " impartial " foreign policy and for Britain to build relationships with European leaders .
We should acknowledge the debt the world owes to the United States for its leadership in this fight against international terrorism

But en route to the US , Mr Brown described himself as an " Atlanticist and a great admirer of the American sprit " .
" As prime minister I want to do more to strengthen even further our relationship with the US , " he said .
" It is firmly in the British national interest that we have a strong relationship with the US , our single most important bilateral relationship . "
Close relationship
Mr Brown said the shared ideals of two centuries of history " have linked the destinies " of the two countries .
He also quoted Winston Churchill - the first British prime minister to visit Camp David - who also spoke of a " joint inheritance " .
This close relationship would help in the fight against nuclear proliferation , global poverty , climate change and global terrorism , Mr Brown said .
Our relationship with America should be what we call solid but not slavish
William Hague
Shadow foreign secretary
" And we should acknowledge the debt the world owes to the United States for its leadership in this fight against international terrorism , " he added .
Tony Blair enjoyed a close relationship with Mr Bush but there has been speculation that Mr Brown wants to keep his distance from the president .
The shadow foreign secretary , William Hague , told the BBC the prime minister and foreign secretary needed to set a clear stance .
' Candid friend '
He said : " They should not be leaving it to more junior ministers to create misunderstandings about the relationship with America , which is what has happened over the last few weeks .
" Our approach , the approach David Cameron and I take , is that our relationship with America should be what we call solid but not slavish and it should gain frankness without losing its closeness . "
Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell said three main issues should be discussed at the meeting .
It 's clear to us that he wants a strong relationship with the United States
David Johnson
US Embassy
" Renegotiation of the one - sided extradition treaty , the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention centre and a negotiated withdrawal of British forces from Iraq , " he said .
" These should be the objectives of a candid friend .
The excessively subordinated relationship between the president and Mr Blair should be put to bed . "
But David Johnson , the deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people were getting " a little obsessive ... about the parlour game of how close people might be sitting to one another on the couch " .
" It 's clear to us that he [ Gordon Brown ] wants a strong relationship with the United States , that he is in pursuit of one , " he said .
PHILIP BURKE
From 1993 to 2004 , Barack Obama taught at the University of Chicago Law School .
According to his students , he was a gifted teacher .
“ If you had just a surface opinion , he would ask why you held it .
He always dug deeper , ” Barbara Blank , a lawyer — and a Republican — practicing in Washington , D.C. , told me earlier this year .
Another former student , Josh Pemstein , said , “ He liked being challenged , and he liked challenging us , as well . ”
Perhaps unintentionally , Obama lapsed into his pedagogic persona during a recent visit to Agassiz Elementary School , in Ottumwa , Iowa .
With seven weeks left before the Iowa caucuses — the curious ritual that this year really could set the course for the Democratic nomination and the 2008 election — Obama looked to relaunch his campaign and clarify his differences with his chief rival , Hillary Rodham Clinton .
It was teacher - parent conference day at Agassiz , and with the children away Obama , who was dressed in dark khakis and a blue shirt , had the school pretty much to himself .
In one classroom , he acted as the host of a roundtable discussion on retirement policy .
In the gymnasium , he gave a stump speech and took questions .
After that , in another classroom , he sat for an interview , during which he tried to make the case for his candidacy .
Obama began with foreign policy , but his theme was broader than any single issue ; it amounted to the unembarrassed assertion that he is the only candidate willing to be wholly honest with voters .
“ I think Hillary is committed to a much more conventional approach , ” Obama said .
“ I believe that we face unconventional threats , and that is going to require a level of personal Presidential diplomacy that can repair the damage that ’s been done by George Bush .
I think that means the President being involved in talking directly to our enemies , and not just our friends , and being less worried about the conventions of , you know , who we meet with , and what level envoys are sent , and so forth .
“ I think we have a very real difference on Iraq , ” he went on , citing Clinton ’s public statements and her support of the Senate resolution , co-sponsored by Joe Lieberman and Jon Kyl , which was intended to warn Iran about meddling in Iraq .
“ She believes that our force structure in Iraq should in part be designed to blunt the impact of Iran in Iraq .
I think that is too broad a mission and I think sending that signal to the Bush Administration while they ’re still in office potentially gives them cover to engage in more aggressive military action . ”
As for domestic issues , Obama said , “ Obviously , there are differences between health - care plans and energy plans , although they ’re relatively modest .
They ’re more issues of emphasis than they are major ideological differences .
I think the differences on domestic issues have more to do with what we think is needed to deliver on the promises that we ’re making to the American people . ”
Obama , who was sticking more closely to talking points than he had in previous conversations , went on , “ Hillary is running , in many ways , a textbook campaign .
But it ’s a textbook that I think is inadequate to the moment .
It ’s a textbook that says you do n’t answer tough questions directly because it may make you a bigger target in the general election — that you tell people what they want to hear but avoid telling some hard truths . ”
“ Hard truths ” could be the slogan for the re-started Obama campaign , which , until the October 30th Democratic debate in Philadelphia , had been viewed as listless and fading .
( By contrast , Hillary Clinton was often called the inevitable nominee . )
During that debate , Clinton ’s performance was criticized as evasive and weak ; Clinton herself acknowledged , “ I was n’t at my best . ”
Afterward , David Axelrod , Obama ’s chief strategist , summoning all the spin at his command , described the new , unfettered Obama :
“ The public is looking for someone who will level with them , even when it means telling them things that they do n’t necessarily agree with or want to hear .
They value honesty .
They value candor .
They value straightforwardness .
They do n’t want calculation and parsing .
They do n’t want someone who confers with their pollster on every move . ”
Obama has begun to embrace positions that a generation of Democrats have been advised to avoid .
The political “ textbook ” calls for a relatively inexperienced first - term senator to run hawkishly .
Obama , whom Clinton criticized when he said that he would negotiate directly and without preconditions with America ’s adversaries , now makes it a point to mention that he would sit down with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran ’s President .
On the question of torture , which Obama unequivocally opposes , the political temptation is to signal a willingness to show no mercy to our worst enemies , in much the way that Governor Bill Clinton , in his first campaign for President , returned to Arkansas for the execution of Rickey Ray Rector , a mentally disabled death - row inmate .
On the increasingly perilous subject of illegal immigration , Obama favors issuing state driver ’s licenses to undocumented workers , and tells voters , “ We are not going to send twelve million people back home . ”
When discussing his energy plan , Obama says , “ You ca n’t deal with global warming without , at least , on the front end , initially , seeing probably some spike in electricity prices , ” and on Social Security he proposes what is , in effect , a large tax hike .
These issues all have one thing in common : Hillary Clinton ’s positions are artfully vague — aimed at surviving the general election — while Obama insists that it is more important to be forthcoming .
On Social Security , Clinton has avoided a detailed approach to fixing the system , which is expected to run out of money by the twenty - forties ; for now , she would appoint a trusty “ bipartisan commission ” to recommend solutions .
Obama proposes raising the ceiling on income that is subject to the payroll tax .
As a political strategy , this appears to be a terrible idea .
A potential crisis in the Social Security system is a long way off .
Why , then , would a new President spend political capital on yet another tax hike when he will almost certainly seek to undo the Bush tax cuts for more immediate demands , like universal health care ?
When I asked Obama about this , he smiled and leaned forward , as if eager to explain that my premise was precisely the politically calibrated approach that he wanted to challenge .
“ What I think you ’re asserting is that it makes sense for us to continue hiding the ball , ” Obama said , “ and not tell the American people the truth — ”
I interrupted : “ Politically it makes sense — ”
He finished the sentence : “ — to not tell people what we really think ? ”
Obama ’s classroom lesson was not about Social Security but about the narrative of the Presidential campaign .
“ This is precisely the argument that I have with Senator Clinton , ” Obama said .
“ This is what I mean by a textbook campaign .
I think there is a conventional wisdom , and this is part of the reason I think Senator Clinton ’s campaign has up until now been so well received by the national press . ”
In other words , political journalists have rewarded the Clinton campaign for its tactical proficiency rather than criticized it for policy inconsistencies .
I asked Obama whether he thought that journalists “ respect ” Clinton for being so good at politics .
“ Absolutely .
I do n’t think that — ” he began , at which point Robert Gibbs , his communications director , interrupted to say that the correct word was “ revere . ”
Obama smiled and added , “ I think a classic example was when Adam Nagourney writes on the front page of the New York Times an admiring piece about how Hillary has finessed the fact that she voted for the war and gotten people to forget about it . ”
The article , which was co-written by Patrick Healy and published early last August with the headline “ SLOWLY , CLINTON SHIFTS ON WAR , QUIETING FOES , ” was hardly admiring .
When I asked Nagourney about Obama ’s contention , he replied in an e-mail , “ This was a very straightforward and simple story : reporting the fact that Mrs. Clinton had repositioned herself on the war in a significant way , and had done so apparently unnoticed by the press and — dare I say ? — her opponents . ”
Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey smiles during a meeting with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy at Leahy 's office on Capitol Hill , October 16 , 2007 .
A divided Senate confirmed Mukasey on Thursday , setting aside concerns he might support interrogation methods decried worldwide as torture .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Michael Mukasey took office as attorney general on Friday , the Justice Department said , after the Senate confirmed him despite concerns about his stance on torture .
Mukasey , 66 , takes over as chief U.S. law enforcement officer and succeeds Alberto Gonzales , who was resigned under bipartisan pressure in September with critics questioning his competency and honesty .
Senate lawmakers initially praised Mukasey , predicting the retired judge and former prosecutor would renew confidence in a scandal - rocked Justice Department .
But many Democrats turned against him after he declined to denounce as illegal torture an interrogation technique that involves simulated drowning , known as waterboarding .
Enough Democrats joined Republicans to approve Mukasey ’s nomination Thursday night by a vote of 53 - 40 .
Mukasey took the oath of office after flying down from New York , Justice spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said .
He was expected to receive briefings on national security and wiretapping before heading home for the weekend .
He will start full - time next Tuesday , Roehrkasse said .
A District Court judge in New York for 18 years , Mukasey presided over a number of high - profile cases , including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center .
In a more recent case , Mukasey found that the government had a right to hold U.S. citizen Jose Padilla as an enemy combatant without charging him with a crime , but ordered the administration to allow Padilla to meet with a lawyer .
In 2005 Al Qaeda 's No. 2 man , Ayman al - Zawahiri , wrote a letter to the then top insurgent leader in Iraq , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi . " [ M ] ore than half of this battle , " he wrote , " is taking place in the battlefield of the media ....
[ W ]e are in a media battle , in a race for the hearts and minds of our umma [ people ] . "
As the struggle in Iraq between the insurgents on the one hand and US military and Iraqi security forces on the other reaches a climactic phase , it is clear that the insurgents , far from being a band of crude guerilla fighters , have taken the Al Qaeda leader 's injunction to heart and have coupled the tactics of terror with a sophisticated knowledge and use of modern media .
Their command of the Internet , their use of television , their release and timing of material calculated to be picked up and used by Arab and Western TV outlets and news agencies , indicates a high degree of planning and professionalism .
When US forces stormed into Iraq bent on toppling Saddam Hussein , the Pentagon adopted a new and enlightened policy toward press coverage .
US reporters were embedded into combat units and , with the aid of modern communications techniques , sent dramatic real - time coverage of a brilliant military campaign to millions of spellbound Americans back home .
Journalists - turned - military - reporters shared the same hardships and dangers of the troops , some losing their lives in the process of reporting the story .
Censorship was minimal , designed to keep sensitive information about troop movements from giving any help to the enemy .
By contrast , the propaganda efforts of Mr. Hussein 's information ministry were laughable , with " Baghdad Bob " continuing to proclaim victory even as US tanks were entering the Iraqi capital .
In the aftermath of the war , fewer US correspondents were embedded with US military units , and the story took a different direction .
The focus was on attempts to build a democratic political system and repair an infrastructure both neglected by Hussein and then damaged even more during the fighting .
Then came more negative stories of US mistakes and the Pentagon 's unpreparedness for the enormity of problems in the postwar occupation .
Finally , Iraq lapsed into violence , with car bombings and assassinations and hostage - taking providing a daily litany of horror .
The occupying US soldiers began to take ever more casualties as did US and other foreign civilian workers and journalists , whose fatalities soon numbered more than in any other war .
They included brave Iraqi journalists and cameramen working for the Americans at great peril .
Critics in the Bush administration charged that images of chaos and violence were overshadowing stories of a more positive nature : of schools that were being opened , hospitals that were being rebuilt , and Iraqis who were coming forward to be policemen .
Now some US military officers , too , charge that a clever enemy media campaign is gaining traction and that the US is losing the war in information about battlefield operations .
A Marine officer whose credibility I trust cites an operation of success in the Fallujah region earlier this month that was reported as a disaster by US and British media companies .
His unit had established a new precinct headquarters for Iraqi police , Army troops , and US Marines to patrol and protect a dedicated area .
It was well received by the local populace and almost 200 Iraqis volunteered for police recruitment .
Insurgents sought to disrupt it but were routed .
Meanwhile , in a separate firefight at a makeshift suicide vehicle factory , three separate suicide bombers were killed , two suicide trucks were discovered and blown up , and foreign and other fighters were killed or captured .
On the defending side , one civilian and one policeman were wounded , with no US or other casualties .
" The enemy was killed in his tracks ; his best weapon was discovered before it could cause any harm , " says the officer , " but Western media reported no enemy killed in these operations , 28 civilians killed , and 50 civilians wounded .
We are getting demolished , " the Marine officer says , " by nefarious enemy media outlets … ' reporters ' or ' sources ' for Arab and other news agencies either on insurgent payrolls or who have known sympathies with insurgent operations , and by collective Western media that are often being manipulated by enemy elements .
What incredible economy of effort the enemy is afforded when US media is their megaphone .
Why spend precious resources on developing your own propaganda machine when you can make your opponent 's own news outlets scream your message louder than you could ever have hoped to do independently ? "
Clearly the insurgents have taken to heart the message that their war is a war of words as well as arms .

Gphone
I LOVE GOOGLE : Original Blog at http://blog.myspace.com/eddiethestarr
News sources like Wired magazine & such say that Google is going to announce their plans for the Gphone Monday November 5th .
I even found one website that said the codename for the Gphone OS is Android and it will include a SDK which I found to be totally awesome .
Was I just speaking in tech ?
my bad , let me explain , the OS is the operating system and the SDK means software development kit .
See , with a SDK programmers will be able to develop applications for the cellphones .
Gone are the days of buying a cellphone then having to spend time on figuring out how to either download stuff into it or transfer things to it from your computer .
See what Google is going to do is bridge the gap between cellphones and computers , it sholuld make them more symbiotic .
All I know is that I use Google Documents , Google Websites , Google Adsense , Google 's Picasa , Google Earth Services , yes I am a Google head , which is totally okay because it just makes good Internet sense to me .
Okay , I have scoured the Internet to find and share images of what some people think the Gphone is going to look like , leave me a comment and let me know what you think :)
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
Two new video games from Sony and Nintendo have players exploring jungle islands for lost treasure or skipping across the galaxy to save a kidnapped princess .
On the face of it , Sony ’s “ Uncharted ” and Nintendo ’s “ Super Mario Galaxy ” ca n’t be more different .
“ Uncharted ” harnesses the PlayStation 3 ’s graphical muscle to produce a movie - like adventure , while “ Super Mario Galaxy ” for the Wii uses cartoonish graphics and simple controls to breathe new life into an aging franchise .
The games also answer challenges facing Sony and Nintendo .
Although Nintendo has been selling as may machines as it can make , players have started to grumble about the lack of must - have titles that offer a more rewarding experience than short mini-games .
That ’s where “ Super Mario Galaxy ” comes in .
A product of Nintendo ’s legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto , “ Super Mario Galaxy ” is being hailed as the most innovative and fun Mario adventure in more than a decade .
The portly Italian plumber once again has to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser , and this time his path hops across an amazing variety of planetoids .
Add in dizzying perspectives , weird gravity effects , and finely - honed motion controls , and you end up with a game that has scored 97 out of 100 on Metacritic.com and is expected to sell 16 million copies worldwide , according to online prediction market simExchange.com .

“ It definitely captures the essence of what makes Mario so great , ” said Jeremy Parish , features editor at gaming news Web site 1up.com , which scored the game a 9.5 out of 10 .
“ Some hard - core gamers might be turned off by how cutesy this is , but if you look beyond that , the gameplay is rock - solid , it ’s incredibly new and inventive , ” Parish said .
For Sony , “ Uncharted ” is the kind of showcase game it sorely needs to drive sales of the PS3 , which has languished behind the Wii and Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 .
“ Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune ” puts players on the trail of a hidden treasure of Sir Francis Drake , the 16th century English privateer .
It is set in the modern day but crafted in the style of classic adventure movies -- think Indiana Jones meets “ Tomb Raider ” meets “ Lost ” .
Its lush jungle settings and mix of brawling , shooting and exploration set it apart from other popular games this year that feature heavy military or alien - invasion themes .
“ There are lots of sci - fi games that are very dark and brown and grey and sort of post - apocalyptic .
We wanted to do something more lush and green and vibrant , ” said Evan Wells , co-president of Naughty Dog , the Sony studio known for cartoony games like “ Crash Bandicoot ” and “ Jak and Daxter ” .
“ The goal was to create this pulp action adventure and make it very cinematic and make it feel like playing the lead role of a hero in a summer blockbuster , ” Wells said .
“ Uncharted ” has an average rating of 89 on Metacritic.com , the highest of any exclusive game for the system along with “ Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction ” , which came out last month .
“ It is another solid addition to the library and I ’m sure that for some folks that is something that would push them to buy a console this holiday , ” said Billy Pidgeon , games analyst for market research firm IDC .
“ Super Mario Galaxy ” was released in the United States on November 12 while “ Uncharted ” comes out November 19 .
The younger Mr Gore was freed on bail
Al Gore III , 24 , was stopped by police as he sped at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) in his low - emission hybrid car in California .
Marijuana and prescription drugs were found during the search of the car .
Mr Gore did not have prescription for any of the drugs , police said .
He was later released on $ 20,000 ( £ 10,000 ) bail .
" We 're glad that he 's safe and that he 's getting treatment , " the former US vice - president told NBC News .
Mr Gore is one of the organisers of Live Earth
" We 're going to leave it as a family matter , " he added .
The younger Mr Gore was stopped after Orange County sheriff 's deputies spotted his Toyota Prius speeding on a motorway near Los Angeles .
In 2003 , Mr Gore was arrested for marijuana possession in Maryland , and in 2002 for suspected drink - driving in Virginia .
His latest arrest came just days before his father is due to take part in Live Earth - a worldwide series of concerts to raise awareness of climate change .
Top 10 Tools I Ca n’t Live Without
Posted by nitzan on Thursday , October 4th , 2007
We all have our own unique ways of working .
A large part of any persons individual productivity is the tools they use .
Here is my top 10 Must Have Tools ( and why ) , please add yours in the comments !
Firefox – I started out with Mosaic , then Netscape .
For years I was an Internet Explorer user but then Microsoft dropped the ball and the Mozilla team ran with it .
Firefox is stable , extensible and fast enough .
One of the killer features that made me defect was the tabbed browsing .
Of course most web browsers now have that feature .
Firefox plus Greasemonkey takes an already rockin’ browser into a world of its own .
ScribeFire – One of my main jobs is writing on blogs .
This means lots of linking , bookmarking , making notes and of course the actual writing .
I would say using Scribefire I can do it all in half the time .
Scribefire is a Firefox plugin that provides blogging tools including a centralized word - like text editing interface .
Skype –
Many of my calls are long distance as it is rare for me to have a client in the same country as I live .
Skype makes these calls free or much cheaper and allows me to roam around and not be tied to a land - line .
With my trusty headset I might look like a geek but I can hear and be heard right across the globe .
Fastmail – While many people swear by the free Google GMail my web email service of choice is the paid service at Fastmail .
The main advantage is as well as having a web client you can also access your email using imap , allowing me to sync my desktop client and see in a web browser exactly the same email store .
WebDav – Talking of web based storage , a fantastic way to get your files on the go is WebDav .
Drag and drop your files and folders just like you were working locally .
Check out your web host to see if this is an option .
SSH – This is an extremely nerdy choice but it has been a life saver in the past .
SSH allows you a secure command line login to your remote server .
On Windows of course you can use Remote Desktop , and other platforms will have VNC , but when the proverbial hits the fan you can rely on SSH and old school commands to get the job done .
WordPress – I love WordPress , I would n’t recommend any other blogging platform for the individual or small team .
But WordPress can be so much more than a blog !
Use it for publishing your corporate website , internal project documentation , team collaboration , making notes , bookmarking , even as a discussion platform .
Photoshop –
There are cheaper options .
I will probably never use even half the features .
Photoshop still rules .
There is little it ca n’t do , and if you wander into any design studio you can be sure there will be at least one machine running it .
Productivity means being able to do what you need to do well and fast .
Once you have learned it , Photoshop makes that happen for working with images .
BlogBridge – I need my RSS feeds and I need them with me .
While many people can argue in favor of their fave web clients I keep returning to BlogBridge happily time after time .
It is a Java based desktop application so works wherever Java works and stores your feeds offline so you can read on the train , in the air or bus home .
Flickr – Flickr for me is more than just an online photo gallery , it is a photography archive , a community and a source of royalty - free images ( Creative Commons Licensed pics ) .
It ’s useful , fun and a constant source of education .
OK , I have shown you my must - have tools , what do you use on a daily basis and why ?
Let me know in the comments …
Return to the Separation of Church and State
Romney has got to stop his Crusade against the GLBT community .
The issue of legislation against gay marriage is unconstitutional on its face .
The idea that public policy against gay marriage , predicated on a claim that it should be illegal because God said so , could not be any more of a perfect example of why we have the Doctrine of the Separation of Church and State in this country .
No religious tradition has the right to force any individual to adhere to its tenants , period .
I keep waiting for some smart attorney to litigate this issue using this line of reasoning , and am continually amazed that it has not been accomplished yet .
All the while , the same self - professed religious church leaders and Republican Party members are out there performing lewd acts in church confessionals , airport bathrooms and any other place they can get away with it .
Catholic priests .
Ted Haggard .
Foley .
And the recent US Prosecutor in Florida , who was going to have sex with a five year - old girl ?
The hypocrisy must stop .

Offical guidelines on safe alcohol limits were ' plucked out of the air ' and overwhelming scientific evidence suggests they should be raised , it 's been claimed .
The recommended limits , which have shaped health policy for the past 20 years , had no scientific basis , a member of the panel that drew them up admitted .
Subsequent studies showed that guidelines should be higher - but were ignored by successive governments .
The startling revelation comes in the week that millions of middle class drinkers were told by a Government report they were consuming ' hazardous ' levels of alcohol .
But that was based on the original recommendation of 21 units of alcohol for men and 14 for women .
These were drawn up by the Royal College of Physicians in 1987 in its first significant report into alcohol misuse , the most authoritative study at the time .
The RCP found that illnesses such as liver disease , heart attacks and infertility were linked to excessive drinking .
But when faced with defining safe guidelines they hit a roadblock , admitted former panel member Richard Smith .
He said that during discussions the committee 's epidemiologist David Barker conceded 'it 's impossible to say what 's safe and what is n't ' because ' we do n't have any data whatsoever ' .
Mr
Smith , a former editor of the British Medical Journal , said that panel members thought they needed to make some sort of recommendation .
' So those limits were really plucked out of the air .
They were n't really based on any firm evidence at all .
It was a sort of intelligent guess by a committee , ' he told the Times newspaper .
The findings , despite their lessthan scientific origins , had a profound impact on health policy .
Yet at the same time studies found that men drinking between 21 and 30 units of alcohol a week had the lowest mortality out of anyone in Britain .
One unit of alcohol is approximately equivalent to half a pint of ordinary strength beer , lager or cider .
A 25 ml measure of spirits , such as gin or vodka , or a 50 ml measure of fortified wine such as sherry or port is also one unit .
By 1994 five studies had been published showing reasonable amounts of alcohol could even protect against heart disease .
Arguably the most significant was a World Health Organisation study published in 2000 .
It said that men who drank less than 35 units a week were at low risk of harm , 36 - 52 at medium risk and above 53 at high risk .
For women , less than 17.5 units was a low risk , medium was 18 - 35 and high risk was above 36 .
Yesterday it also emerged that a coalition of health organisations is launching a campaign to force a 10 per cent increase in alcohol taxation .
The group of 21 bodies , headed by the RCP , will form the Alcohol Health Alliance .
The one photo the GOP does not want anyone to see was snapped at yesterday 's NAACP GOP Presidential Candidate Forum .
The NAACP invited all 9 Republican candidates to the forum , but only one showed up : Tom Tancredo .
All the Democratic Presidential hopefuls showed up for their forum .
The excuses given by the Republican campaigns mostly had to do with scheduling conflicts -- just too busy to make it .
The resulting photo of Tancredo -- standing on a stage of empty podiums sums up the Republican party 's commitment to civil rights in America : the only Republican interested is the guy running to deny immigrant workers their rights .
One has to wonder why this photo was not the lead on every morning show and on the front pages of every morning newspaper in America .
PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) --
The death of a woman in custody at the Phoenix airport in September was an accidental hanging , with contributing factors including " acute ethanol and prescription medication intoxication , " according to a report released Friday .
Carol Gotbaum , in an undated family photo , died of accidental hanging , the medical examiner said Friday .
The report from the Maricopa County , Arizona , medical examiner rules the specific cause of Carol Gotbaum 's death was " asphyxia by hanging . "
Gotbaum was on her way to an alcohol rehabilitation facility in Tucson on September 28 when she missed her connection at Phoenix 's Sky Harbor Airport , flew into a rage and was arrested by police .
Airport surveillance video showed her arrest as police officers struggled to handcuff her and take her away .
Watch as the woman is arrested »
She was accused of disorderly conduct and placed in a holding cell at the airport , where she continued to scream for several minutes after police left the room .
Shortly after she stopped screaming , an officer found her unconscious .
Rescuers were not able to resuscitate her .
Phoenix police said she had tried to escape her handcuffs and somehow accidentally strangled herself .
Watch what the medical examiner ruled »
The woman had been handcuffed behind her back , and those handcuffs were then attached to a shackle that was attached to a bench in the holding cell .
Family members maintain that police mishandled her situation and treated her inhumanely .
Her husband made at least three frantic calls to police in an attempt to warn them about her fragile mental state but was not able to reach them until after she had died .
Listen as the husband pleads with police »
The police report on the incident said an officer smelled alcohol as rescuers tried to revive her .
And on October 31 , Phoenix police issued a a final report that cited a flight attendant on Gotbaum 's flight from New York to Phoenix who said she saw Gotbaum with a Bloody Mary on the flight .
The report also states that when Noah Gotbaum was told of his wife 's death he screamed , " they killed her , they killed her , " an apparent reference to police .
The Gotbaum family has hired its own forensic pathologist who is conducting his own autopsy to determine how she died .
E-mail to a friend
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has access to evidence of U.S. support for terrorist groups in the Middle East , a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying on Sunday .
Iran ’s new chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , made the allegation in comments to visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan , whose country may soon send troops to hunt down Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq .
Tehran says the rebels are operating in Iraq with U.S. forces present in the country and this shows Washington is refraining from tackling them .
Like Turkey , Iran also has faced cross - border attacks by Kurdish rebels and has shelled targets inside Iraq in response .
“ Escalation of terrorism in the region is one of the direct results of the presence of occupiers in Iraq , particularly America , ” Jalili , an ally of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said according to the country ’s state broadcaster .
“ And there are documents and information available proving America ’s support for terrorist groups in the region , ” he said , without giving details .
Jalili is also the new secretary of Iran ’s Supreme National Security Council .
The United States often accuses Iran of backing and training militias responsible for some of the bloodshed threatening to tear Iraq apart .
Tehran denies the charge and blames the violence in Iraq on the presence of U.S. forces .
The two countries are also locked in a stand - off over Tehran ’s nuclear program , which Western powers suspect is aimed at developing bombs .
Iran says it only wants to generate electricity .
Washington last week dubbed Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and accused its Qods force of backing terrorists .
It also imposed sanctions on more than 20 Iranian companies , major banks and individuals .
At a joint news conference with Babacan , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Sunday also accused the United States and Israel of involvement in terrorism in the region .
“ We see ... their hand behind some of the regional terrorist activities , ” Mottaki said .
Babacan , whose country ’s ties with the United States have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks , thanked Iran for helping Turkey fight the PKK guerrillas and said the two sides had talked about continuing their cooperation .
The Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) launched its campaign for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey in 1984 .
More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict since then .
Jalili on October 20 replaced Ali Larijani as Iran ’s chief nuclear negotiator , a move analysts saw as signaling a toughening of Tehran ’s position in the atom row .
Spam sucks .
Any site which allows unauthenticated users to submit forms will have a problem with spamming software ( spambots ) submitting junk content .
A common technique to prevent spambots is CAPTCHA , which requires people to perform a task ( usually noisy text recognition ) that would be extremely difficult to do with software .
But CAPTCHAs annoy users , and are becoming more difficult even for people to get right .
Rather than stopping bots by having people identify themselves , we can stop the bots by making it difficult for them to make a successful post , or by having them inadvertently identify themselves as bots .
This removes the burden from people , and leaves the comment form free of visible anti-spam measures .
This technique is how I prevent spambots on this site .
It works .
The method described here does n’t look at the content at all .
It can be augmented with content - based prevention such as Akismet , but I find it works very well all by itself .
Know thy enemy
By watching how spammers fail to create spam on my site , there seem to be three different types of spam creators : Playback spambots , form - filling spambots , and humans .
Playback bots
These are bots which have recorded POST data which they replay back to the form submission URL .
A person visits the form the first time , and records the form data .
Certain fields are marked as slots to be filled in with randomized spam later , but the structure of the form is played back verbatim each time .
This includes the names of the fields , and the contents of hidden fields .
These bots do n’t even bother looking at the form as served by the site , but blindly post their canned data to the submission URL .
Using unusual field names to avoid these bots will only work for a week or so , when they will then record the new field name , and begin posting with it .
A playback bot can be stopped by varying the hidden data on the form so that it will not be valid forever .
A timestamp is a simple way to do this , making it possible to detect when old data is being replayed .
The timestamp can be made tamper - proof by hashing it with a secret and including the hash in the hidden data of the form .
Replaying can be further hindered by including the client ’s IP address in the hash , so that data ca n’t even be immediately replayed across an army of spambots .
Form - filling bots
These bots read the form served by the site , and mechanically fill data into the fields .
I do n’t know if they understand common field names ( email , name , subject ) or not .
On my site , I ’ve observed bots that look at the type of the field , and fill in data based on the type .
Single - line edit controls ( type=text ) get name , email , and subject , while textareas get the comment body .
Some bots will fill the same data into all the fields of the same type , while others will enter ( for example ) different first names into each of the single - line fields .
Form - filling bots can be stopped by including editable fields on the form that are invisible to people .
These fields are called honeypots and are validated when the form data is posted .
If they contain any text , then the submitter must be a bot , and the submission is rejected .
Using randomized obscured field names , and strict validation can also stop these bots .
If the email field must have an @ -sign , and the name field must not , and the bot ca n’t tell which field is email and which is name , then the chances it will make a successful post have been greatly reduced .
Humans
These are actual people using your form .
There ’s nothing you can do to stop them , other than to remove the incentive .
They want link traffic .
Use the rel= ” nofollow ” attribute on all links , and be clear that you are doing it .
Building the bot - proof form
The comment form has four key components : timestamp , spinner , field names , and honeypots .
The timestamp is simply the number of seconds since some fixed point in time .
For example , the PHP function time ( ) follows the Unix convention of returning seconds since 1/1/1970 .
The spinner is a hidden field used for a few things : it hashes together a number of values that prevent tampering and replays , and is used to obscure field names .
The spinner is an MD5 hash of :
The timestamp ,
The client ’s IP address ,
The entry id of the blog entry being commented on , and
A secret .
The field names on the form are all randomized .
They are hashes of the real field name , the spinner , and a secret .
The spinner gets a fixed field name , but all other fields on the form , including the submission buttons , use hashed field names .
Honeypot fields are invisible fields on the form .
Invisible is different than hidden .
Hidden is a type of field that is not displayed for editing .
Bots understand hidden fields , because hidden fields often carry identifying information that has to be returned intact .
Invisible fields are ordinary editable fields that have been made invisible in the browser .
The invisibility of the honeypot fields is a key way that bots reveal themselves .
Because bots do not process the entirety of the HTML , CSS , and Javascript in the form , and because they do not build a visual representation of the page , and because they do not perceive the form as people do , they cannot distinguish invisible fields from visible ones .
They will put data into honeypot fields because they do n’t know any better .
The form is built as usual , including :
editable fields for all of the information we want to collect from the user ,
hidden fields for identifying information , including the timestamp , the spinner , and the entry id ,
invisible honeypot fields of all types , including submission buttons .
Processing the post data
When the form is posted back to the server , a number of checks are made to determine if the form is valid .
If any validation fails , the submission is rejected .
First the spinner field is read , and is used to hash all of the real field names into their hashed counterparts so that we can find data on the form .
The timestamp is checked .
If it is too far in the past , or if it is in the future , the form is invalid .
Of course a missing or non-integer timestamp is also a deal - breaker .
The value of the spinner is checked .
The same hash that created it in the first place is re-computed to see that the spinner has n’t been tampered with .
( Note that this check is n’t actually necessary , since if the spinner had been modified , it would n’t have successfully hashed the timestamp field name and the timestamp verification would already have failed , but the extra check is harmless and reassuring . )
Check the honeypots .
If any of them have any text in them , the submission is rejected .
Validate all the rest of the data as usual , for example , name , email , website , and so on .
At this point , if all of the validation succeeded , you know that you have a post from a human .
You can also apply content - based spam prevention , but I have not found it to be necessary .
Making honeypots invisible
This is the essence of catching the bots .
The idea here is to do something to keep the honeypot fields from being visible ( or tempting ) to people , but that bots wo n’t be able to pick up on .
There are lots of possibilities .
As you can see from looking at my comment form , I ’ve simply added a style attribute that sets display : none , but there are lots of other ideas :
Use CSS classes ( randomized of course ) to set the fields or a containing element to display : none .
Color the fields the same ( or very similar to ) the background of the page .
Use positioning to move a field off of the visible area of the page .
Make an element too small to show the contained honeypot field .
Leave the fields visible , but use positioning to cover them with an obscuring element .
Use Javascript to effect any of these changes , requiring a bot to have a full Javascript engine .
Leave the honeypots displayed like the other fields , but tell people not to enter anything into them .
Criticisms
Let me address a few common criticisms .
Defeatability
In theory , it is possible for a spambot to defeat any of these measures .
But in practice , bots are very stupid , and the simplest trick will confuse them .
Spam prevention does n’t have to make it theoretically impossible to post spam , it just has to make it more difficult than most of the interesting forms on the internet .
Spammers do n’t make software that can post to any form , they make software that can post to many forms .
A relevant joke :
Jim and Joe are out hiking in the forest , when in the distance , they see a huge bear .
The bear notices them , and begins angrily running toward them .
Jim calmly checks the knots of his shoes and stretches his legs .
Joe asks incredulously , “ What are you doing ?
Do you think you can outrun that bear ! ? ”
Jim replies , “ I do n’t have to outrun the bear , I just have to outrun you . ”
In any case , yes , spammers may eventually write spambots sophisticated enough to navigate honeypots properly .
If and when they do , we can switch back to CAPTCHAs .
In the meantime , honeypots work really well , and there are lots of ways to make them invisible we have n’t even needed to use yet .
Accessibility
Users that do n’t use CSS or Javascript will be exposed to all of the honeypot fields .
A simple solution is to label the fields so that these users will leave them untouched .
As long as no text is entered into them , the form will submit just fine .
It works
This technique has been keeping spam off my site for a year now , and works really well .
I have not had problems with false positives , as Akismet has had .
I have not had problems with false negatives , as keyword - based filtering has had .
Spambots may get more sophisticated , but their software complexity will have to increase orders of magnitude before they can break this method .

California Bans Hazardous Chemical in Plastic Baby Toys
SACRAMENTO , California , October 17 , 2007 ( ENS ) - Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation to prohibit the manufacturing , sale and distribution of vinyl toys and childcare products that contain phthalates designed for children under three , making California the first state in the country to ban these chemicals used in baby toys .
" We must take this action to protect our children , " said the governor .
" These chemicals threaten the health and safety of our children at critical stages of their development . "
The phthalate ban was among 80 bills the governor signed Sunday to meet a midnight deadline .
The ban will take effect on January 1 , 2009 .
Several other states are expected to follow suit .
" California continues to lead the nation in protecting children from dangerous chemicals and in safeguarding our environment , " said Assemblymember Fiona Ma , the San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill .
" AB 1108 sends a clear message to the Consumer Product Safety Commission that if the Bush administration wo n't act , states will . "

" We are thrilled that California is taking action to protect our kids from dangerous chemicals , " said Dan Jacobson , legislative director for Environment California , a co-sponsor of the legislation .
" This bill is so important because as children ’s minds and bodies go through the delicate processes of growing and developing , they are particularly vulnerable to chemicals that could affect proper development . "
Phthalates are chemicals added to plastic to make it soft and flexible .
Among many other things , they are used in soft plastic toys and other baby products , such as teethers , bath books , and rubber ducks .
Because phthalates are not chemically bonded to the plastic , these toxic chemicals are easily released .
When children suck on these products , phthalates can leach out and enter their bodies .
" When a child puts a phthalate - laden teether in her mouth , it ’s like sucking on a toxic lollypop , " said Rachel Gibson , staff attorney for Environment California .
Phthalates have been shown to interfere with the natural functioning of the hormone system .
These toxic chemicals have been linked to reproductive problems , early onset of puberty , liver and thyroid damage , and testicular cancer .
Phthalates interfere with the hormone system and have been linked to reproductive defects , premature birth , and the early onset of puberty , which is a cause of breast cancer .
Four of the six phthalates banned in the bill are listed on California 's Proposition 65 list as reproductive toxins .
Studies by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency show the cumulative impact of different phthalates leads to an exponential increase in associated harm .
According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , levels of phthalates found in humans are higher than levels shown to cause adverse health effects .
The data also show phthalate levels are highest in children .
Fourteen countries and the European Union have already banned or are phasing out the chemical .
AB 1108 faced hurdles in the legislature , including heavy lobbying by the chemical industry .
American Chemistry Council chief executive Jack Gerard expressed " deep regret that California Governor Schwarzenegger chose to sign the bill banning certain vinyl toys , but expressed the hope that the act would not imperil the state ’s future plans for addressing chemical health and safety issues in a rational and science - based way . "
" This law is the product of the politics of fear .
It is not good science , and it is not good government , " said Gerard .
" Thorough scientific reviews in this country and in Europe have found these toys safe for children to use .
California businesses will now be obliged to take products off the shelves that their customers need and want . "
" Next year , we hope that policy makers and special interest groups will abandon their chemical - by - chemical , attack strategy and put their support behind the state ’s Green Chemistry Initiative , " said Gerard .
California Secretary for Environmental Protection Linda Adams and the Schwarzenegger administration are drafting a Green Chemistry Initiative to develop policy options for implementing green chemistry policies .
Instead of making chemical policy through the legislature on a case by case basis , the goal of this initiative is to work with scientists from California and around the world to evaluate the health effects of chemicals and possible alternatives in a comprehensive manner .
" A comprehensive and unified approach is needed to ensure good accountable policy and I encourage the legislature and all interested parties to participate in the development of this important initiative , " said Schwarzenegger .
The creation of a viable list of options to advance Green Chemistry must be submitted to Secretary Linda Adams by January 2008 .
From that list proposed recommendations for a final policy are due by July 1 , 2008 .
Public comments on the Green Chemistry Initiative are welcome through November 16 .

There is a new twist on the question of how biological clocks work .
In recent years , scientists have discovered that biological clocks help organize a dizzying array of biochemical processes in the body .
Despite a number of hypotheses , exactly how the microscopic pacemakers in every cell in the body exert such a widespread influence has remained a mystery .
Now , a new study provides direct evidence that biological clocks can influence the activity of a large number of different genes in an ingenious fashion , simply by causing chromosomes to coil more tightly during the day and to relax at night .
“ The idea that the whole genome is oscillating is really cool , ” enthuses Vanderbilt Professor of Biological Sciences Carl Johnson , who headed the research that was published online Nov. 13 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ The fact that oscillations can act as a regulatory mechanism is telling us something important about how DNA works :
It is something DNA jockeys really need to think about . ”
Johnson ’s team , which consisted of Senior Lecturer Mark A Woelfle , Assistant Research Professor Yao Xu and graduate student Ximing Qin , performed the study with cyanobacteria ( blue - green algae ) , the simplest organism known to possess a biological clock .
The chromosomes in cyanobacteria are organized in circular molecules of DNA .
In their relaxed state , they form a single loop .
But , within the cell , they are usually “ supercoiled ” into a series of small helical loops .
There are even two families of special enzymes , called gyrases and topoisomerases , whose function is coiling and uncoiling DNA .
The researchers focused on small , non-essential pieces of DNA in the cyanobacteria called plasmids that occur naturally in the cyanobacteria .
Because a plasmid should behave in the same fashion as the larger and more unwieldy chromosome , the scientists consider it to be a good proxy of the behavior of the chromosome itself .
When the plasmid is relaxed , it is open and uncoiled and , when it is supercoiled , it is twisted into a smaller , more condensed state .
So , the researchers used a standard method , called gel electrophoresis , to measure the extent of a plasmid ’s supercoiling during different points in the day / night cycle .
The researchers found a distinct day / night cycle :
The plasmid is smaller and more tightly wound during periods of light than they are during periods of darkness .
They also found that this rhythmic condensation disappears when the cyanobacteria are kept in constant darkness .
“ This is one of the first pieces of evidence that the biological clock exerts its effect on DNA structure through the coiling of the chromosome and that this , in turn , allows it to regulate all the genes in the organism , ” says Woelfle .
Some cyanobacteria use their biological clocks to control two basic processes .
During the day , they use photosynthesis to turn sunlight into chemical energy .
During the night , they remove nitrogen from the atmosphere and incorporate it into a chemical compound that they can use to make proteins .
According to the Johnson lab ’s “ oscilloid model , ” the genes that are involved in photosynthesis should be located in regions of the chromosome that are “ turned on ” by the tighter coiling in the DNA during the day and “ turned off ” during the night when the DNA is more relaxed .
By the same token , the genes that are involved in nitrogen fixation should be located in regions of the chromosome that are “ turned off ” during the day when the DNA is tightly coiled and “ turned on ” during the night when it is more relaxed .
The researchers see no reason why the bioclocks in higher organisms , including humans , do not operate in a similar fashion .
“ This could be a universal theme that we are just starting to decipher , ” says Woelfle .
The DNA in higher organisms is much larger than that in cyanobacteria and it is linear , not circular .
Stretched end - to - end , the genome in a mammalian cell is about six feet long .
In order to fit into a microscopic cell , the DNA must be tightly packed into a series of small coils , something like microscopic Slinkies .
Previous studies have shown that in higher organisms between 5 to 10 percent of genes in the genome are controlled by the bioclock , compared to 100 percent of genes in the cyanobacteria .
In the case of the higher organisms , the bioclock ’s control is likely to be local rather than the global situation in cyanobacteria .
With a circular chromosome ( as in cyanobacteria ) , twisting it at any point affects the entire molecule .
When you twist a linear chromosome at a certain point , however , the effect only extends for a limited distance in either direction because the ends are not connected .
That fits neatly with the idea that the bioclock ’s influence on linear chromosomes is limited to certain specific regions , regions where the specific genes that it regulates are located .

Booming sales of laptops have led to a surge in the number of computer users with back and muscle problems , experts have warned .
Girls as young as 12 are being diagnosed with nerve damage caused by slouching over screens , a group of leading chiropractors said .
Millions of others are at risk of
" irretrievable damage " to their spines , necks and shoulders because of poor posture when using laptops , it was claimed .
Back specialists say as many as four in five patients have chronic nerve damage caused by working on portable PCs .
The problem is being driven by falling prices and the increasing availability of wireless technology , which makes portable computers more attractive .
Laptop sales in PC
World went up by more than 25 per cent last year .
In addition , laptops used at work are not subject to the same health and safety regulations
as desktop computers .
This makes it more likely they will be used incorrectly .
A common problem is perching a laptop on the legs so users stare down at the screen and put strain on their necks , spines and legs .
London - based chiropractor Michael Durntall was among those calling for more research into the issue .
He said he had seen dozens of Xrays showing signs of degeneration in the joints of regular laptop users .
Mr Durntall added : " Mothers bring in their 12 - year - old daughters suffering back pain and when they arrive I can see their slumped posture straight away .
" I also see many people in their twenties and thirties with a dowager 's hump - a rounding at the base of the neck - after only a few years of looking down at a small screen while sitting slumped on a chair for long periods . "
Rishi Loatey , a chiropractor from Wembley , North - West London , said he often treated back and neck pain caused by using a laptop on the move , such as on a train .
Nicola Hunter , a physiotherapist and occupational health specialist , said that hand and arm pain similar to repetitive strain injury was easily induced by resting wrists against the edge of a laptop .
She added : " There 's evidence that it stops the nerves and tendons moving as they normally would , and this can cause nerve injury . "
There are more than five million laptops in circulation in the UK .
They account for 70 per cent of all computer sales , according to PC Pro magazine .
The problem of laptop - related pain is yet to be properly examined by the Health and Safety Executive .
The HSE merely advises users to follow guidelines
for general computer use , but take more breaks .
Chiropractors recommend the use of a docking station , which links a laptop to another screen and keyboard , or a stand which raises the screen to a higher level .
The Murray is the lifeblood of Australia 's farming country , a legendary river that thundered 1,500 miles from the Snowy Mountains to the Southern Ocean .
Now , it 's choking to death in the worst drought for a thousand years , sparking water rationing and suicides on devastated farms .
But is the ' big dry ' a national emergency , or a warning that the earth is running out of water ?
Claire Scobie reports
Australian farmers always know someone else who is doing it tougher .
They pride themselves on their resilience .
They take pleasure in living in ' a sunburnt country of droughts and flooding rains ' .
Conservative and deeply sceptical , many dismiss global warming as hogwash .
But with unprecedented water scarcity and the Murray , the country 's greatest river system , on the verge of collapse , warning bells are ringing around the globe .
Financially , the drought is pinching as far away as the UK , hiking up the cost of bread in British supermarkets as wheat prices reach a 10 - year high .
Symbolically , it cuts much deeper .
Commentators are looking on , nervously , wondering if what is becoming the norm in Sydney could be the future for Sydenham .
Professor Tim Flannery , an Australian environmental scientist and an international leader on climate change , has no doubts .
' Australia is a harbinger of what is going to happen in other places in the world , ' he says .
' This can happen anywhere .
China may be next , or parts of western USA .
There will be emerging water crises all over the world . '
In Kenya , the herdsmen of the Mandera region have been dubbed the ' climate canaries ' - the people most likely to be wiped out first by global warming .
In Australia , the earth 's driest inhabited continent , it is the farmers who are on the frontline .
This extended dry spell began in 1998 .
Four years later came the one - in - 100 - years drought .
Last year was declared a once - in - a - millennium event .
Every city , bar Darwin in the ' top end ' , is facing water restrictions .
Rivers are reduced to a trickle a child can jump across .
Old Adaminaby , a town drowned by a reservoir 50 years ago , has resurfaced from its watery grave .
Distressed koalas have been drinking from swimming pools .
The list goes on .
The extent of the crisis was illustrated in January , when the Prime Minister , John Howard , announced a A$ 10bn ( £ 4.3 bn ) package to seize control of the Murray - Darling basin , the nation 's food bowl , accounting for 41 per cent of Australia 's agriculture and A $ 22bn worth of agricultural exports .
The region covers an area the size of France and Spain combined and is home to almost 3 m people ; its famed waterway , the River Murray , no longer holds sufficient water to flow out into the sea .
Despite Howard 's massive rescue plan to overhaul the water system , six months later the irrigation taps to the region 's farmers were turned off .
Malcolm
Holm knows just how bad things can get .
A dairy farmer with a bullish smile , Holm , 39 , is a respected pillar in his local community of Finley , on the flat plains of southwest New South Wales ( NSW ) .
He depends , as do more than 50,000 other farmers , on the River Murray .
I first meet Malcolm and his wife , Jenny Wheeler , 47 , in Sydney in mid-July .
As we sit down for coffee , it 's hard not to notice his strapped left arm , with angry red weals seared along the forearm , resting inert on the table .
Last October , with no water flowing into the major dams , the NSW government faced an unparalleled situation .
Following last year 's lowest inflows into the Murray on record , they miscalculated how much water was available across the board .
' Carryover water ' worth millions of dollars , which had been saved and paid for by farmers for irrigation , was slashed by 20 per cent without consultation .
Three weeks later , farmers were hit with another 32 per cent cut .
Today they are on zero allocation .
Aside from running his own 1,000 acres and 500 dairy cows , Holm works tirelessly on a raft of community committees .
The day after the second water cut , which had ' blown out ' his drought strategy and would cost him A$ 1.5 m from the loss of water , fodder and milk production , he was back at work in the dairy .
The grain auger - a cylindrical barrel that moves the grain from one massive silo to the other - was jammed .
After fiddling with the machine he flicked a switch .
' I was n't concentrating . '
He pauses , frowning .
' I was thinking about water . '
It was the wrong switch .
In the blink of an eye , Malcolm Holm had sliced off his hand .
In March 2006 , Professor Flannery 's The Weather Makers was published in the UK , spelling out in incisive detail what awaits us unless we decarbonise our world by 2050 .
Described by Sir David Attenborough as ' in the league of the all - time great explorers ' , and the 2007 Australian of the Year , Flannery combines a Gaian approach with hard science .
The result : Australia 's answer to Silent Spring .
When I speak to Flannery , he 's recovering from the flu after a particularly cold , damp July .
Floods and violent storms have caused havoc along Australia 's eastern seaboard , beaching one 40,000 - tonne tanker like an aluminium dinghy .
I put it to Flannery that the difficulty with global warming is that many areas are facing freak flooding .
' General modelling suggests that every degree Celsius of warming leads to a 1 per cent increase in rainfall globally , ' he explains .
' But these downpours are not uniform , causing intense bursts and downpours of rain in some places and not in others .
We are learning about this 1 per cent effect as we go . '
In his book , Flannery describes the dramatic decline in winter precipitation in southwestern Australia since the Sixties .
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has forecast that on the east coast , rainfall could drop by 40 per cent by 2070 , along with a seven - degree rise in temperature and an increased chance of bush fires .
Last November , the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report added to the predicted misery , stating that ' the annual flow in the Murray - Darling basin is likely to fall by 10 - 25 per cent by 2050 ' , resulting in a decline in production from agriculture and forestry .
Five years ago , during the last major drought , I travelled through western Queensland , across a fragile , red - baked landscape that was obviously not suited to the hooves of millions of cattle and sheep - there are no Australian native animals with cleft hooves - and met farmers whose dreams were crumbling to dust .
Back then , there was virtually no mention of global warming .
The problem was attributed to the dry , cyclical conditions caused by El Nino , a powerful climatic phenomenon linked to the Pacific Ocean , which drives rain - bearing clouds away from the continent .
Fast - forward to July 2007 and few scientists doubt the ' big dry ' is caused , in part , by climate change .
Some refer to it as a climate shift ; others , like Flannery , who matches Al Gore in his Armageddon - like predictions , are unequivocal that it is a foretaste of what 's to come .
As the first developed nation to experience such a prolonged dry spell , it 's no wonder that the rest of the world is looking on to see how Australia copes - and what lessons can be learned .
This time I chose not to trek to the burnished outback .
I wanted to see the effect of the drought a day 's drive from Sydney or Melbourne .
This would n't be a story of skeletal cows and cracked earth , rather the more complex tale of water mismanagement and a pounding assault by humans on a delicate ecosystem .
What is remarkable is the seismic swing among ordinary Australians over the past 12 months .
The synergy of An Inconvenient Truth ( although John Howard , until recently a climate sceptic , snubbed Gore on his Australian tour ) , the release of the Stern Report by British economist Sir Nicholas Stern and a rise in food prices have combined as a loud wake - up call .
Now , as the stress of trying to squeeze every drop out of an over - stretched waterway threatens to tear communities apart , fierce public debate has forced the environment to the forefront of this year 's general election .
Two massive desalination plants will be built in Victoria and NSW , following the construction of Perth 's successful ' de - sal plant ' ; the government also announced it would ban incandescent light bulbs , which contribute to greenhouse gases .
For Flannery , these are baby steps .
' We could be the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy .
We 've got solar potential ; we 've got a geo - thermal province in central Australia and the best potential for wind power off the east coast . '
For Anne Jensen , an academic who 's been studying the ecology of the lower Murray in South Australia for 25 years , it 's a question of priority .
' Everyone is fighting to keep what they 've got in a situation where people are going to need to give something up , ' she says .
' While everyone is on rations , we have to make sure that the river is healthy enough to support us all . '
It was Mark Twain who compared the River Murray to America 's Mississippi .
During the 19th century , paddle steamers were a familiar sight along its lazy green - grey currents , ferrying goods from town to town .
Covering an area of more than one million km2 , the basin carries water from the tropical north in Queensland to the Darling River , and from the Murray 's source in the Snowy Mountains to the outskirts of Adelaide , 1,500 miles downstream .
Nearly 60 years ago , the Snowy Hydro scheme was opened , harnessing the headwaters of three rivers to generate hydroelectricity and capture melting winter snows in two large lakes , Eucumbene and Jindabyne .
With the creation of 16 dams and countless weirs , the scheme promised to ' drought proof ' the nation by creating a reliable supply of water to the Murray .
In the long term , the environment lost out , but the dry , fertile country , like Finley , to the west , was transformed into dairy pastures , orchards and lush rice fields .
When it comes to the River Murray , nothing is straightforward .
Despite the commission in charge of the river being set up in 1917 , it is only this year that the federal government is wresting control from the four states which , until now , have had their own rules and conflicting regulations .
While Queensland , NSW and South Australia were quick to cede power to the central government , Victoria has raised the possibility of bringing a case to the High Court to protect its water rights .
The accumulation of years of over - allocation and drought has resulted in a pitifully low stream level .
In June 2006 , the catchment received an inflow of 700 gigalitres .
A year later , it had plummeted to 300 gigalitres .
( One gigalitre is 1,000 m litres . )
What is keeping the region functioning is the depleted water storage in dams like Hume , just outside Albury , a bustling centre on the border between NSW and Victoria .
And it is from Albury that I set off , the day after meeting Malcolm Holm .
Ironically , it 's raining .
To an untrained eye , the green verges look promising .
To Neville and Ruth Kydd , the grass in their paddocks is too sparse for their herd of dairy cows , which they have been hand - feeding since Christmas .
This salt - of - the - earth couple , in grubby jeans and wellies , were particularly hard hit by last year 's water cuts .
They had bought A$ 500,000 worth of water early in the season , but the government took back almost half , Neville tells me , grim - faced .
' How could they get it so wrong ?
It 's mind - boggling . '
Australia 's water system is , indeed , mind - boggling .
There are 24 different sorts of water licences in the Murray - Darling basin alone , which provide irrigators with varying degrees of security .
Almonds and oranges are on the more costly high - security licences because without regular sprinkling the trees will die .
As Neville Kydd says , ' If this season there is no water in the dam , virtually no dairy farmers will survive .
It will return to sheep country .
You can't sustain those sorts of losses year in year out . '
From their spartan bungalow it is 15 miles down the road to Prairie Home , the generous homestead of Louise and Andrew Burge .
A log fire burns ; tea and cake are laid out on a wooden kitchen table , alongside a wad of typed notes .
Louise , 49 , has written a summary of the state of their sheep and crop farm .
She refutes evidence that the current drought is driven by climate change , providing a series of old photographs showing the Murray in drier conditions than it is in now .
' Global warming represents a herd mentality with a herd mentality for the solutions , ' she begins .
' Australia has developed mass plantations in the upper catchments so in the next drought we will have less run -off because the trees are going to take water .
This will exacerbate the drought , ' she pauses for breath .
' My solution is to encourage new technologies and address emission reductions at the source . '
Even though Australia is one of only two western countries ( the other is the US ) not to ratify the Kyoto Treaty , it still adheres to international obligations to offset its emissions .
According to a UN report , per capita , Australia 's emissions of greenhouse gases are among the highest in the world .
While planting vast forests attempts to fix one problem , it creates another .
As the drought bites , the conflict between farmers , traditionally portrayed as rampant land - clearers , and environmentalists is brought to the fore .
In reality , while all the farmers I spoke to were global warming sceptics , they were passionate conservationists .
And to be fair , as a huge island , Australia experiences such volatile swings in climate it can mask a perception of an irreversible shift .
Farmers will argue that the current drought is very similar to that of the 1890s and 1940s .
Nonetheless , the effect on rural towns all along the Murray is acute .
Figures from the Reserve Bank reveal that rural debt has almost doubled from A$ 26.4bn in 1999 to A$ 43.3bn in 2005 .
In Deniliquin , 20 minutes from the Burges ' farm , the wide streets are eerily quiet .
That evening , in the empty Federal Hotel , I meet Wayne Cockayne , an obliging 44 - year - old whose glassy eyes stare into the mid-distance .
' This town 's gone backward , ' he says , taking a sip on a Diet Coke .
' In 1979 , when I left school , the town was prospering .
Farmers ' children are leaving the land now . '
For the past four years , Cockayne has n't made a cent from the cereals on his 3,000 - acre property 20 miles south of Deniliquin .
This year he had to pay for water to be trucked in to flush his toilet .
He grits his teeth .
' I know about depression , ' he goes on .
' I locked myself in at home for four days .
Then I got in the family car and drove into town .
A friend found me slumped over the steering wheel crying .
I never thought I 'd be a person who would suffer from it , but I 've been better since I went to a grief and depression counsellor . '
' In the first seven years , I had , on average , two people a year from the farming community who presented with depression , ' Dr Harry von Rensburg tells me in his surgery in Barham , 60 miles west of Deniliquin .
An owlish , direct - talking South African GP , Von Rensburg has lived in Barham for the past decade .
This year he is ' actively managing ' more than 120 farmers , including some of the most high - profile landowners in the district .
A psychologist comes once a week and has back - to - back appointments .
' If we could get her twice a week we would fill that . '
A year ago , Beyond Blue , the national mental health body , reported that one farmer commits suicide in Australia every four days .
I ask Dr Von Rensburg whether this figure is accurate .
' Absolutely .
In the past three years there have been eight suicide attempts here .
A handful are on suicide watch - their spouses or children have taken control of firearms . '
He leans back in his big black chair .
' Shooting is the most favoured method ; second is hanging . '
Von Rensburg puts this dramatic increase down to the drought 's longevity and the uncertainty it brings .
' People are asking themselves , will this be ongoing ?
Are we going to see our landscape change ?
That is the greatest fear - what we can't control . '
Neil Eagle , the grand old man of orchard farming in the region , is a sprightly 73 - year - old with large , dirt - encrusted hands and a deep , rumbling voice .
He refuses to be beaten .
Unlike his neighbour , who did n't purchase water this year , and whose orange trees are virtually bare , Eagle 's citrus forest looks healthy .
' It could get to the stage where there 's no water to buy , ' he says , biting open a juicy orange .
' We could lose our trees .
Then it would take seven to 10 years to get back into production .
That would be very serious . '
Eagle 's family have been living around Eagle Creek since 1870 .
' As far as temperature changes go , in the Forties and Fifties it was definitely hotter than it is now , ' he says .
' I do n't agree with the doom and gloom merchants that the sea is going to rise . '
He gives a wry smile .
' It 's become nearly a religion , this idea of global warming . '
Still , he can't resist a swipe at those downstream in South Australia .
' The equivalent of two - and - a- quarter Dartmouth Dams go up in evaporation in the Lower Lakes .
It 's a squander of our resources . '
Some 300 miles west of Eagle Creek , in South Australia , Anne Jensen is witnessing a collapse of entire ecosystems on the floodplains .
In the Nineties , one local from Kingston - on - Murray described this as a ' garden of Eden ' for river red gums , some 400 years old .
Today it resembles a graveyard .
Jensen sees the ' hundreds of thousands of trees ' dying in the Lower Murray as ' a combined effect of a man -made drought in the river system , together with the severe natural drought which is proving to be the last straw ' .
The twisted , ashen - grey branches of the black box eucalyptus and river gums are stark indicators of the region 's deteriorating health .
These hardy trees require natural flooding to survive .
They have done without a decent drink for over a decade , but now there 's ' an abrupt change ' , according to Jensen .
' If we got a flood in the next two to three years we could save the river , but only with enormous amounts of rain . '
A mile from Kingston is Banrock Station .
More famous in Britain for its crisp white wines than its pioneering conservation strategies , this vineyard pumps profits back into restoring the local wetlands .
It has had considerable success in improving the Riverlands ' biodiversity , but due to the minimal amount of water in the Murray allocated for the environment , and the rising salinity , they can only achieve so much .
Two years ago , the ' Living Murray ' programme pledged to recover 500 gigalitres , the equivalent of Sydney Harbour , for the Murray for environmental purposes by 2009 .
At present they are likely to fall 80 per cent short of that target .
For years , the country 's most valued artery has been withering , some would say dying .
' In 2002 the river ran out of water , ' says Adelaide - based Professor Mike Young , a water expert .
' There are three dredges in the mouth to keep it open and to keep water going into the Coorong wetlands . '
This 60 - mile stretch of wetlands holds a particularly poignant place in Australian history , as the inspiration for the film Storm Boy , about a young lad who befriends a pelican called Mr Percival .
The Coorong is an internationally recognised wetland sanctuary for migratory birds , but it sits on a part of the coast that is now gasping to stay alive as sand pours in .
Over the years there has been a steady decline in its pelican population , due to a lack of fish and hyper- salinity .
The water in the southern lagoon of the Coorong is four times saltier than the ocean .
As Anne Jensen explains , ' In South Australia there is water in the river and it looks all right , because of artificial pools held up by weirs .
You can see plants and birds . '
She pauses , sighing .
' It 's the same problem with the drought .
It 's been raining , people 's gardens are green .
But it 's a false image . '
And many hundreds of kilometres away in Albury there is no water in the Hume dam .
I catch up again with Malcolm Holm and his family at the Hume dam .
Reduced to 12 per cent of its capacity , there is a yawning gap of cracked red earth at the end of the boat ramp where the water level should be , and the limbs of blackened trees reach skywards .
Holm laughs when I tell him that after driving around the region , I 'm drowning in arguments about water allocation .
' It is very political , ' he says .
What has struck me is that if temperatures continue to rise globally , as predicted , what is happening now in Australia is bound to occur in other regions , where many countries share one river system - the Euphrates in the Middle East , the Mekong in Asia .
The World Bank estimates that by 2025 , about 48 countries will experience water shortages , affecting more than 1.4bn people , the majority in under - developed regions .
Here in Australia , at least the economy is robust and competing groups whose livelihoods depend on the dwindling flow of the Murray can sit down and talk .
Where rivers cross borders , it wo n't be a case of negotiating and compromise - it will be war .
The future of many Australian farmers hangs in the balance .
Notwithstanding showers in recent months , the pendulum from a La Nina wet - weather phase , which usually follows an El Nino drought , has not swung .
' And it is unlikely to do so for the rest of the year , ' says Dr David Jones , head of climate analysis at Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology .
The drought , the bureau warns , is a long way from breaking .
' It will take years to refill the dams . '
Last year the drought whittled 1 per cent off the national economy , and this year reduced the available annual milk supply by more than a billion litres .
As I write this in late July , during Australia 's winter , the blistering summer is still several months away .
But Professor Mike
Young warns that already ' Adelaide is in a very frightening situation .
If it does n't rain and the dams do n't fill , there is n't enough water in the system to supply the city . '
Living with such continued stress inevitably takes its toll , as it did on Holm , known by his friends as a particularly careful person .
What 's improbable is how rationally he dealt with the tragic mistake in his dairy .
' I called Jenny on the mobile and told her I 'd cut off my hand , ' he says .
It had ended up on the ground after going through the whole machine and was taken and preserved by the paramedics .
' Luckily it was n't mangled . '
Holm was given a hefty dose of morphine and antibiotics and transferred by air to a Sydney hospital .
His hand lay in ice in an ' esky ' , a cool box more commonly used in Australia for chilling beers .
' He amazed me , ' says Jenny , who travelled with him .
' On the plane , he kept saying , " Have you got that esky ? " '
How did you cope ?
She shrugs and smiles , her face crumpled from the strain .
' He 's still alive .
I knew we'd be OK . '
Five weeks and 22 hours of anaesthetic later , Malcolm 's hand was sewn back on .
As he pulls off the protective glove , Ellena screws up her face and looks as queasy as I feel .
' The first skin grafts from my arm did n't take , so they took 12 ml [ of skin ] from my back , ' he points to the bulbous lump on the wrist .
' I 've got another three operations ahead .
There are two tendons to stitch up , pins to remove and a bit of liposuction on the arm to get rid of the flap . '
Movement is returning as the nerves grow back .
' It 's a good outcome , ' he says , cradling his arm .
' It 's the little things ...
I can't do up a button , so we 've put Velcro on my shirts . '
At least it 's your left hand , I say .
' I am left - handed . '
He gives a dry smile .
' But I feel lucky .
If I was wearing a jumper or a long - sleeved shirt I would n't have had an arm at all . '
Malcolm had to hire extra staff , and eight households are now dependent on his business .
What if the drought does n't break ?
' We 're in a lot of trouble . '
His eyes narrow .
' We have very little fodder .
After mid-August , there 's no hay left . '
He half - laughs .
' I 'm a typical farmer .
I just get on with it .
Life 's always a challenge . '

The difference myth
We should n't believe the increasingly popular claims that boys and girls think differently , learn differently , and need to be treated differently
Some kids learn best visually , others verbally ; some do best in " boot - camp " type settings , while others thrive in informal classrooms with lots of freedom .
But science and aptitude surveys tell us that gender is n't a helpful way to sort students into those groups .
( Getty Images ) WOMEN ARE THE chatty sex , using three times as many words each day as men .
They are society 's great communicators .
The verbal parts of their brains are larger than men's and they are hard - wired for empathy , but they lack a natural ability to reach the top levels of math and science .
Men , on the other hand , have brains that are good at understanding systems , and they are adept at acquiring and using power .
They are hard - wired to excel at math and science , but lag behind women in reading ability .
They talk less and are not naturally inclined toward caring for others .
Sound familiar ?
In the past decade , such claims have coalesced into an almost unshakable conventional wisdom : Boys and girls are different because their brains are different .
This idea has driven bestsellers , parenting articles , and even - increasingly - American education .
The problem is , a hard look at the real data behind these claims suggests they are simply untrue .
Some of them are baseless , using the language of science to cloak an absence of serious research ; others are built on tenuous studies , with methodological flaws and narrow margins of significance .
More and more , they are simply coating old - fashioned stereotypes with a veneer of scientific credibility .
Scientists have turned up some intriguing findings of anatomical differences between the sexes .
But we know very little about their real - world effect on how boys and girls behave - meaning that any conclusions based on these findings are premature .
Nonetheless , more policy makers , employers , parents , and teachers appear to be buying into the notion of great gender differences in cognitive abilities .
The education world has seen a strong push for single - sex classrooms , with the Bush administration clearing the way for more public schools to segregate students by gender .
There are now more than 360 such classrooms in the United States , with more in the offing .
And brain - difference theories are making their way into business , medicine , psychotherapy , and parenting .
As they do , we risk letting an avalanche of dubious science overwhelm decades of legitimate findings - and , more importantly , we risk limiting the futures of a whole generation of boys and girls .
The idea that men and women are cognitively different has deep historical roots .
Victorian - era scientists generally accepted as fact that the larger brains of men made them intellectually superior ; women 's smaller brains made them closer to children than to mature adults .
Medical wisdom held that women 's brains and ovaries could not develop at the same time , making education dangerous to motherhood .
The 20th century saw those ideas debunked .
We now know , for instance , that brain size is proportional to body size and does n't determine intelligence .
A 7 - foot man is not smarter than a woman who is 5 - foot - 2 .
By the 1970s , the women 's movement was applying social pressure behind that science , breaking down the barriers that had kept women out of the top medical and law schools , the Supreme Court , the military , the astronaut corps .
But then , in the 1990s , the tide appeared to turn back .
New neurological findings , provocative but inconclusive , began to surface .
Female " essentialism , " a strain of feminist thought , argued that women were more naturally caring than men in how they made moral decisions .
Spurred also by a broader social anxiety about women's new roles , a cornucopia of books began tumbling from publishing houses and selling briskly .
By now they include titles such as " Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps " ( Barbara and Allan Pease ) , " Boys and Girls Learn Differently ! " ( Michael Gurian ) , " Why Gender Matters " ( Leonard Sax ) , and the granddaddy of them all , " Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus " by John Gray .
Though written by a family therapist whose PhD came from a now - shuttered diploma mill , " Men Are From Mars " for a time outsold the Bible .
The broadest claim of the advocates of difference - and the most widely repeated - is the idea that boys and girls are innately different in math and science ability .
One key piece of evidence is that boys tend to dominate the upper reaches of SAT math scores :
In the top 1 percent of scorers on the SAT math test , for instance , boys widely outnumber girls .
And that performance gap seems to be echoed in math and science careers :
There are very few top women professors in those fields .
The quest to explain those facts , however , has fallen back on some very thin neurological explanations .
Best - selling author Gurian argues , in his books and his lectures , that boys have brains naturally wired for understanding systems , due to high testosterone , low serotonin , low oxytocin , and a smaller " corpus callosum , " a bundle of nerve fibers that aids language by connecting the brain 's two hemispheres .
He 's echoed by Sax , another best - selling author .
In " Why Gender Matters , " Sax writes , " Girls and boys behave differently because their brains are wired differently . "
But their scientific - sounding lingo turns out to be not especially rigorous .
A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2002 found there were no gender differences in the size of the corpus callosum , and recent studies using MRI images agree .
Sax 's argument that " boys have a brain - based advantage when it comes to learning math " is based on a very small study in which 19 participants looked either at faces or at a small white circle , while the blood flow in their brains was measured by an MRI .
The data from the study , however , found so much variation among individuals that it would be meaningless to draw bigger conclusions about boys or girls as a group .
The SAT scores themselves are misleading as well .
Though boys outnumber girls among top scorers , they also outnumber girls among the lowest scorers .
The average score is nearly identical .
And major new research finds that the gap at the top end is narrowing each year .
It 's also not clear what very high SAT scores mean in practical terms .
An exhaustive 2006 review of major studies , funded by the National Academy of Sciences , indicates no relationship between scoring in the upper tier of ability and eventual success in math or science careers .
In 2000 , psychologist Diane Halpern of Claremont McKenna College reviewed a range of studies of cognitive abilities in areas in which you might expect to find sex differences , such as problem solving , computation , and spatial and verbal abilities .
She found that differences were so slight as to be inconsequential .
Cognitively , there is far more variation within each gender than there is between boys and girls .
Looking for explanations for the apparent boy - girl divide in math and science performance , some experts and numerous newspaper and magazine articles have seized on the idea that boys are biologically programmed to focus on objects , predisposing them to math and understanding systems , while girls are programmed to focus on people .
This idea was based on a study of day - old babies done by British psychologist Simon Baron - Cohen in 2003 .
Baron - Cohen surveyed 100 babies and found that the boys looked at mobiles longer and the girls looked at faces longer .
His study , however , has since been attacked as unreliable by Elizabeth Spelke , a Harvard psychology professor .
In an article in American Psychologist , she pointed out that the experiment lacked critical controls against experimenter bias .
Female and male infants were propped up in a parent 's lap and shown , side by side , an active person or an inanimate object .
Since newborns can't hold their heads up independently , their visual preferences could easily have been determined by the way their parents held them .
In fact , there 's a vast scientific literature showing that male and female infants respond equally to people and objects .
If girls get the short end of the stick in the math and science wars , boys also get their share of knocks from the new biological determinism .
Males are increasingly seen as inherently deficient in verbal abilities .
In The New Republic , education author Richard Whitmire writes of a " verbally drenched curriculum " that is " leaving boys in the dust . "
One suggested solution is boys - only classrooms in which boys would be taught in boot - camp fashion , with diminished emphasis on verbal abilities .
Gurian writes approvingly of the ' 50s - style classrooms " that kept a lot of boys in line . "
Do most boys lack verbal skills ?
In a word , no .
In 2005 , the University of Wisconsin's Janet Hyde synthesized data from 165 studies on verbal ability and gender and found a slight female superiority - a difference measurable in statistics , but so small as to be useless in distinguishing real - world boys and girls .
But the idea that boys are less verbal has gained wide currency .
In the 2006 bestseller " The Female Brain , " author Louann Brizendine argues that girls and women are the talkative sex , while males remain naturally strong and silent .
A woman uses 20,000 words per day , while a man uses only 7,000 , she asserts .
Brizendine is an academic neuropsychiatrist , and her statistic has been repeated in publications around the world .
But it appears to be completely bogus .
Brizendine 's footnotes cite pop psychology writer Allan Pease - but Mark Liberman , a professor of linguistics and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania , has traced her citations in his popular blog Language Log , and says that Pease 's work offers no source for the numbers .
In fact there is better , newer science that suggests those figures are wrong .
The most recent study of word use found men and women in a statistical dead heat , with women clocking in at 16,215 words per day and men at 15,699 .
When that study was published earlier this year in Science , its coauthor , James Pennebaker of the University of Texas , Austin , made a specific point of debunking Brizendine 's claims .
The lack of hard findings on the real - world difference between boys ' and girls ' brains has n't slowed down the impulse to change education .
South Carolina , for instance , aims to have sex - segregated classrooms available in public schools for all children in five years , and gender difference theories are starting to drive curriculum .
Teachers are allowing girls to evaluate cosmetics for science projects and assigning action novels for boys to read .
Gurian has exploited his ideas with great success as an educational consultant , claiming to have trained 30,000 teachers in 1,500 schools .
Sax runs a lobbying group for more single - sex public schools .
When we gave a speech at a national teachers meeting , one private - school teacher in the audience stood up to say that his headmaster was revamping the entire curriculum based on Sax 's theories of gender difference .
Of course , it would be naive and even harmful to pretend there are no differences between boys and girls .
Boys , for example , are more vulnerable to autism and dyslexia - and teachers and parents need to be alert to that fact .
But there 's a mountain of evidence to show that gender is the wrong lens through which to view education policies and practice .
Some kids learn best visually , others verbally ; some do best in " boot - camp " type settings , while others thrive in informal classrooms with lots of freedom .
But science and aptitude surveys tell us that gender is n't a helpful way to sort students into those groups .
As science becomes more central to our public and political conversations , it 's perhaps not surprising that neurological factoids are being used to " prove " ideas on both sides of a debate .
But science should n't be enlisted as an excuse for believing what we want to believe .
Rather , it should be seen as part of a long series of steps that can lead to fresh understandings of the world .
What we can hope is that eventually , good science drives out bad , and that facts , by their sheer heft , ultimately crush the factoids .
But we have to pay attention to make sure this happens .
Otherwise , we will end up trusting our kids ' futures to ideas and programs that - ironically - rely on science to shore up some of society 's most unscientific prejudices .
Caryl Rivers , journalism professor at Boston University , and Rosalind C. Barnett , senior scientist at the Women 's Studies Research Center at Brandeis , are at work on " The Truth About Boys and Girls : How Gender Stereotypes Harm Our Children . "

The world 's largest offshore wind farm , which will occupy a site of 90 square miles off the coast of Kent , has been given the go - ahead by the government and should be ready to provide clean power for a quarter of London 's homes by 2010 .
But a sharp increase in costs for the scheme from the original estimate of £ 1.5 bn to closer to £ 2bn could still push it off course .
Costs have soared while the London Array project has been delayed 18 months because of local opposition to an electricity sub-station near Faversham .
The consortium developing the wind farm , which is led by Shell and Eon , is reluctant to comment on the ambitious plan for up to 341 turbines until it has tied up a range of commercial contracts and received approval from National Grid to provide new high - powered overhead cables .
A spokesman for Eon confirmed that the last regulatory hurdle was overcome yesterday : " We are now in the middle of the tendering process and we will be in a position to give the green light - or not - in the second half of next year . "
The company admits that the biggest hurdles have been overcome after it gained permission for the offshore side of the scheme and also for it to proceed with the construction of a sub-station that was subject to a challenge and a protracted planning inquiry .
The local Swale borough council , backed by local residents , voted against the scheme , but a planning inspector recommended to the government that it should get the go - ahead .
Ministers have given it the green light amid mounting concerns that dozens of renewable projects vital to help Britain reduce carbon emissions and meet Kyoto protocol targets are stuck in the planning system .
The London Array also had to overcome earlier opposition from the RSPB by making changes to a scheme which could have threatened the red- throated divers that occasionally winter in that part of Kent .
The developers have been forced to pay for legal advice as well as keeping design teams on staff even though there was little work to do .
There is also deep frustration that over the past 18 months there has been a growing shortage of wind farm materials due to a worldwide boom , triggering a huge escalation in costs for these kinds of renewable energy projects .
Eon is in the middle of a £ 1bn spending programme on wind , tidal and biomass projects around Britain .
It already has a wind farm running at Scoby Sands , off the coast of Great Yarmouth , and has plants at Robin Rigg in the Solway Firth and another called the Humberside Gateway in development .

A UK court has ordered evangelical preacher Gilbert Deya back to Kenya to face five counts of child stealing .
The self - proclaimed bishop of a congregation with 36,000 UK members claimed he could give infertile couples ' miracle babies '
Gilbert Deya said the babies were " beyond a human imagination "
The children 's true parentage remains unknown .
It is also unclear how Mr Deya and his wife convinced churchgoers that they were pregnant when they were not and how they believed that they had given birth in backstreet Kenyan clinics .
Kenyan police say Gilbert Deya Ministries is an international child trafficking ring .
A British family court judge agreed , saying infertile couples and congregation members were " deceived " by Mr Deya and that he was motivated by " the most base of human avarices : financial greed " .
Mr Deya regards the children as miracles given to him by God for his followers .
" The ' miracle babies ' which are happening now in our ministry is beyond a human imagination but it's not something that I can say - I can explain because they are of God and things of God cannot be explained by human beings , " he told BBC Radio 4's Face the Facts programme in 2004 .

Gilbert Deya Ministries 2004 advert
He denies all charges and plans to appeal against extradition , saying he is the victim of a Kenyan political vendetta .
Kenya sought Mr Deya 's return in 2005 after his wife , Mary Deya , and two other women were arrested in Nairobi on child stealing charges .
That followed a raid on the Deya home when 10 children were taken into care .
Mr Deya told British police he was the children 's natural father and his 57 - year - old wife was their mother - DNA tests proved negative and forged birth certificates were found in his home .
The three women were found guilty and Mr Deya 's wife has been sentenced to two years in prison - she is appealing against this .
British and Kenyan officials say vulnerable church members were convinced that Mr Deya had the power of prayer to make them pregnant although they showed no outward signs .
They say he used trickery to convince women they had delivered babies .
A former stonemason who moved to London from Kenya in the mid-90s , Mr Deya developed 14 churches in Britain along with African and Asian branches .
Gilbert Deya 's wife , Mary , is appealing against her conviction
A ministeries advertisement said : " God has blessed us with miracle babies that the world has never seen anything like before .
Your donation is very useful to your miracle .
" Please send your donation and expect your miracle .
Ten pounds , a hundred pounds , a thousand pounds - make cheques payable to Gilbert Deya Ministry " .
Desperate women , some past the menopause and others who were infertile , were convinced that being prayed for by Mr Deya and travelling to Kenya would result in a child .
Once there , they were convinced by Mrs Deya and others that they were in labour and taken to illegal clinics where they underwent what they believed to be childbirth .
In a related case heard in a London family court , a baby was removed from a couple who belonged to Deya Ministries after their local GP alerted authorities when the woman tried to register him .
The woman had not been pregnant and returned from a brief stay in Kenya with the child .

Millie Odhiambo - Mabona ,
The Cradle children 's charity
Mr Justice Ryder granted custody of the child to Haringey Council and publicly rebuked the church 's practices .
" The funds of his ministry have been generated at least in part by the tithes collected from a congregation that , on the facts I have found , have been deceived by the claims that have been made about Mr and Mrs E's miracle births , " Mr Justice Ryder said , referring to the couple in that case .
Mr Deya 's extradition hearing was told that the women who believed they had given birth had been assaulted in illegal clinics in Nairobi slums .
Kenyan police believe this explains unclear recollections about their ' birth ' experience .
Millie Odhiambo - Mabona , executive director of The Cradle , a Kenyan children 's rights charity , said no - one is sure where the ' miracle babies ' came from .
None of the children taken from the Deya house have been identified .
She believes the women who became convinced they had given birth were simply devout , not wilfully naive .
" Some believe in the power of witchcraft and those who are Christian believe in the power of God , " said Mrs Odhiambo - Mabona of the intense level of spirituality in some African countries , including Kenya and Nigeria .
" They believe Bishop Deya is a serious man of God so if he prays for them and then they have babies for them it is a religious reality . "
In a rout that will , hopefully , be a harbinger of things to come in the US , right wing , Bush rectal appendage John Howard , one of the true fascists of the 21st century has been excreted from Australian politics .
The Wall Street Journal reports ,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard suffered a humiliating defeat in national elections Saturday , according to preliminary results , most likely ending the political career of one Asia 's most enduring conservative leaders and a key ally of U.S. President George W. Bush in the region .
Voters were ready to hand control of the government to Australia 's opposition Labor party , headed by former diplomat Kevin Rudd , who has promised to boost relations with China , pull some troops from Iraq , and re-make Australia as a leader in the global effort to stop global warming .
The defeat appears so complete that the 68 - year - old Mr. Howard , Australia 's second - longest - serving prime minister , appeared likely to lose his own parliamentary seat , which he has held for 33 years .
Still , Rudd ran as a free trade advocate , just like Howard .
But Rudd promised to be a global warming activist .
One thing that helped Rudd and his labor party beat Howard 's party was Howard 's backers were caught distributing fake literature suggesting that the labor party supported Islamic extremists .
( Swiftboat ads , anyone ? )
Al Jazeera reports that Rudd promises to withdraw 500 troops from Iraq , just leaving a small number to aid in security .
He also promised to become more independent of the US on Foreign Policy .
Defeated Howard had promised , that if he was re-elected , he 'd keep Australian troops in Iraq .
It appears that the way to obscurity for Leaders of US allies is to unflinchingly support George W. Bush .
Ask a certain kind of security - minded geek about " copy protection "
technology and chances are they 'll tell you that it 's flat out impossible .
They might even avow it with the same certainty that physicists employ when they say you can't travel faster than the speed of light .
That level of certainty can be a little daunting , especially since our intuition tells us something different .
We can imagine accelerating and accelerating and accelerating until our speed exceeds 299,792,458 m/s – hey , just rev the old spaceship up to 299,792,457 m/s , open up the throttle a little and voila … we 've just proven generations of physicists wrong .
The thing is that when they say that you can't travel faster than the speed of light , they 're talking about the fundamental principles of physics : it 's impossible to get beyond lightspeed , even if science fiction movies help us conceptualise it .
In the same way , we can imagine building progressively better software locks for movies , music , ebooks , and software until we hit on one that even the wiliest hacker can't defeat .
But , just like the physicists , the geeks who say that DRM can never reach this point are speaking about fundamental principles of information science .
It 's impossible to get that far .
To understand this , you need to understand a little bit about cryptography - the mathematics of scrambling and descrambling information .
Modern industrial cryptography consists of three crucial components : first , a " cipher " - a system for scrambling messages .
These are always public and never secret or proprietary .
Banks , spies , retailers , child pornographers and your web browser all use the same basic set of ciphers .
That 's because the only way to prove that a cipher works is to expose it to public scrutiny and see if any clever bastard can spot a flaw in it .
It 's a little counterintuitive to think of full disclosure as a prerequisite for security , but it is a basic tenet of cryptography – and it has been so ever since Alan Turing and the lads at Bletchley Park broke the Nazi ciphers and spent the rest of the war reading Hitler 's secret dispatches and snickering to themselves .
Second , there is a " ciphertext " - a blob of data that has been encrypted with the cipher .
Finally , and crucially , there 's the " key " .
This is a very small piece of information - usually less than 1000 characters - that is kept secret from all but the legitimate senders and receivers of the information .
The key is the secret bit of information that the cipher uses to unscramble the ciphertext .
As a system , it works brilliantly .
You can download an email privacy program that uses standard , public encryption algorithms to scramble your email so that only its intended recipients can read them .
You know that messages can only be read by the authorised sender and the authorised receiver because you are the only ones who know have the key .
It 's great for email , but it can never work for movies , TV shows or music , because in the case of " copy protection " the receiver is also the person that the system is meant to guard itself against .
Say I sell you an encrypted DVD : the encryption on the DVD is supposed to stop you ( the DVD 's owner ) from copying it .
In order to do that , it tries to stop you from decrypting the DVD .
Except it has to let you decrypt the DVD some of the time .
If you can't decrypt the DVD , you can't watch it .
If you can't watch it , you wo n't buy it .
So your DVD player is entrusted with the keys necessary to decrypt the DVD , and the film 's creator must trust that your DVD player is so well - designed that no one will ever be able to work out the key .
This is a fool 's errand .
Because the DVD player has the key , it 's always possible that it can be extracted by academics , hardened hackers – or just kids who are in it for the glory .
One hacker known as Muslix64 got the keys to the HD - DVD system he owned .
Then he did the same trick again with a Blu - Ray player – this time without ever being in the same room as it .
He just had a mate email him the contents of the computer 's memory , captured while it was playing a Blu-ray disc .
Muslix64 reasoned that if the computer was unscrambling the Blu-ray disc , it must have the key in its memory somewhere .
He did a quick search of the file and hey presto , Blu-ray was broken .
And the thing is that if a DRM is broken once , it 's useless .
The breaker can put his copy of the movie , music , ebook , or software online on a peer to peer network or fileserver , and from there anybody can " break " the copy protection simply by downloading a copy .
It 's a one - shot deal .
DRM is supposed to force those unwilling to pay into buying , rather than nicking , their media - but once the cheapskates can search for a cracked copy on Google , it is meaningless .
This means that ultimately , DRM only affects people who buy media honestly , rather those who nick , borrow or cheat their way to it .
In turn that means that the people who ultimately bear the inconvenience , cost and insult of DRM are the paying customers , not the pirates .
There are some fundamental truths in the universe .
We cannot travel faster than light , and we cannot make a copy protection system that is uncrackable .
The only question is : how long will paying customers stay when the companies they 're buying from treat them as attackers ?

Orwell did not agree fully with the Communist Party , MI5 said
A Scotland Yard Special Branch report in January 1942 said the author of 1984 had " advanced communist views " .
However , an MI5 officer responded that Orwell " does not hold with the Communist Party nor they with him " .
A file from the National Archives also shows MI5 did not object to him having a wartime job at a military base .
Orwell was vetted for the post as a correspondent for the Sunday Observer at Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa .
' Bohemian dress '
The Special Branch report said : " This man has advanced communist views and several of his Indian friends say that they have often seen him at communist meetings .
" He dresses in a bohemian fashion both at his office and in his leisure hours . "
The MI5 officer rang the inspector in charge of the sergeant who wrote the report , to question what it meant .
From the call it emerged that Orwell - referred to in the documents by his real name Eric Blair - was thought to be an " unorthodox communist " who did not agree fully with Communist Party views .
The officer from the security service wrote : " I gathered that the good sergeant was rather at a loss as to how he could describe this rather individual line hence the expression ' advanced communist views ' .
" It is evident from his recent writings - The Lion and the Unicorn - and his contribution to Gollancz 's symposium The Betrayal Of The Left that he does not hold with the Communist Party nor they with him . "
' Bit of an anarchist '
Orwell is best known for books including 1984 and Animal Farm , which criticise totalitarianism , and other works attacking inequality , including Down and Out in Paris and London and The Road to Wigan Pier .
The records show Orwell first came to the attention of intelligence service MI6 in 1929 when he was in France and offered to become Paris correspondent for the Workers Life .
In 1942 , a record described him as " a bit of an anarchist in his day and in touch with extremist elements " .
He had " undoubtedly strong left - wing views , but he is a long way from orthodox communism " , it added .
Toilet spy
Other MI5 records released by the National Archives reveal a rather basic approach to intelligence gathering .
Kent policeman Pc Ivan Smith resorted to hiding in a toilet to listen in on apprentices from the Royal Navy dockyards at Chatham discussing strike action in December 1941 .
American musician Alan Lomax was put under surveillance by MI5 as a potential communist , and his BBC TV shows in the early 1950s were monitored by Special Branch .
The BBC was informed that Lomax was in contact with the Hungarian press attache in London , although that could have been linked to his interest in folk dancing .
Naked women
The records reveal that a German spy - Argentine Ernesto Hoppe - was involved in plans to transport Nazi valuables to South America .
However , he was arrested in Gibraltar in October 1943 after a tip - off and interrogated at Latchmere House , south London .
After going on the run from a military hospital and trying to contact the Argentine ambassador , he was recaptured and admitted his role in the plot .
In other records , it is revealed that a 1945 edition of The Naturist magazine was examined by MI5 for " hidden writing " , which would have been shown up by a solution of soda and water .
Norwegian spy Hans Larsen was interrogated by the British , also at Latchmere House , in May 1945 .
A copy of the magazine he had in his possession was tested for the writing among the pages of naked women and articles titled Naturism in the United States and All the Year Round Natural Fitness .
Anti-US protests have been held in Turkey 's main cities
The passing of the resolution by a House committee on Wednesday despite appeals by the Bush administration was denounced by President Abdullah Gul .
Turkey accepts there were mass killings in 1915 - 17 but denies genocide .
Turkey 's foreign ministry said the ambassador would return to Turkey for a stay of " a week or 10 days " .
" We are not withdrawing our ambassador , " said ministry spokesman Levent Bilman .
" We have asked him to come to Turkey for some consultations . "
US President George W Bush had argued against the resolution , saying its passage would do " great harm " to relations with " a key ally in Nato and in the global war on terror " .
Turkey is a regional operational hub for the US military , and some suggest access to Incirlik airbase or other supply lines crucial to US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan could be affected by the row .
The US also fears Turkey may make a military incursion into northern Iraq to neutralise Kurdish separatist guerrillas , who continue to cross the border to ambush Turkish troops there .
' Unacceptable and invalid '
The non-binding vote , passed by 27 to 21 votes by members of the congressional House Foreign Affairs Committee , is the first step towards holding a vote in the House of Representatives .
A German soldier took photos of Armenian deportees at the time
It was welcomed by Armenian President Robert Kocharyan who said he hoped for " full [ US ] recognition ... of the genocide " .
For Turkey 's president , the US vote showed that some US politicians had " closed their ears to calls to be reasonable and once again sought to sacrifice big problems for small domestic political games " .
" This unacceptable decision of the committee , like similar ones in the past , is not regarded by the Turkish people as valid or of any value , " Mr Gul said late on Wednesday .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed that the Turkish parliament would discuss allowing military incursions into northern Iraq , possibly next week .
The move comes after an escalation in attacks by the PKK killed almost 30 soldiers and civilians in just over a week .
Mr Erdogan said such authorisation , which would be valid for one year , would ensure all options were available to Turkey in its fight against the PKK .
Burning argument
Last year , the lower house of the French parliament declared the killings of Armenians a genocide and at least 20 countries at various levels of legislation have passed resolutions on the issue .
If you start counting the killing of people in recent history , the situation in Darfur should get top priority

Armenia alleges that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed in an organised campaign to force them out of what is now eastern Turkey .
That is strongly denied by Turkey , which says that large numbers of both Turks and Armenians were killed in the chaos surrounding World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire , when there was an uprising by Armenians .
Earlier on Thursday , the son of murdered Turkish - Armenian writer Hrant Dink was found guilty by a Turkish court of insulting " Turkishness " along with another newspaper editor .
Arat Dink and Serkis Seropyan were convicted after printing Dink 's arguments for describing the Ottoman - era killings as genocide .
Rancor becomes top D.C. export GOP leads charge in ideological war
WASHINGTON - When President Bush gave his first formal campaign speech as a candidate for re-election last week , he cited his efforts to curtail partisan rancor and " change the tone in Washington . "
But the nasty redistricting fights in Texas and Colorado are an indication , analysts from both political parties say , that the partisan divide is as sharp as ever in America , and that acrimony exported from Washington is increasingly infecting state and local governance .
The al - Qaeda threat requires U.S. political leaders to assume a certain patriotic decorum in the nation 's capital .
But opportunists of both parties seek any edge , and have come to view the nation 's statehouses , traditionally known as more pragmatic forums , as arenas for ideological combat .
" We are trying to change the tones in the state capitals - and turn them toward bitter nastiness and partisanship , " said Grover Norquist , a leading Republican strategist , who heads a group called Americans for Tax Reform .
" Bipartisanship is another name for date rape , " Norquist , a onetime adviser to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , said , citing an axiom of House conservatives .
Indeed , conservative Republicans have been the most successful combatants in the war for the statehouses .
Last fall 's election marked a tectonic and largely unheralded shift in the American political landscape .
For the past half - century , Democrats dominated the state legislatures - in the mid-1970s by 2 - to - 1 ratios in the number of overall legislative seats .
But when the dust settled after the 2002 elections , Republicans had emerged on top .
" For 50 years there were more Democratic legislators than Republicans .
It was n't until 2002 that the Republicans caught and passed them , " said Tim Storey , an expert on redistricting for the National Conference of State Legislatures .
" In every mid-term presidential election ( in that time period ) , the party in the White House had lost seats , but last year the Republicans had a net gain of 175 . "
Many of the gains came in the South , where moderate Democrats with roots in their communities had for years defied political trends by taking more conservative positions than their party 's national candidates .
But as those down - home Democrats grew old or retired , moved on because of term limits , or lost their seats due to redistricting , the Republicans were poised to attack .
As recently as 1990 , Storey said , " there were no legislative chambers controlled by Republicans in the South .
Now half of them are controlled " by the GOP .
" You also see it here in the West , " said Karl Kurtz , a political scientist at NCSL headquarters in Denver .
" Traditionally , there was n't much difference between Republicans and Democrats , but now lines are starting to harden .
" There is an increased level of partisanship as things get closer between the parties .
A lot of the intensified partisanship in Congress is being reflected in the state legislatures , " Kurtz said .
" It is intense at the federal level , and trickling down , " said Larry Sabato , a political scientist at the University of Virginia .
These days , Norquist and other conservative activists use the GOP tilt in the legislatures to make life difficult for Democratic members of Congress .
On issue after issue - the war on terror , taxes , judicial appointees - Republican leaders in Washington have been getting GOP - controlled legislatures to go on record in support of Bush initiatives .
It makes it more difficult for Democrats to explain unpopular votes back home .
" It 's not some D.C. guy telling them what to do .
It 's South Dakotans telling Tom Daschle ( the Democratic Senate leader from South Dakota ) how they feel , " Norquist said .
Conservative efforts to capture state legislatures date back to the Reagan era , when former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont set up a political action committee named GOPAC to breed candidates at the state and local level .
Gingrich employed the PAC in his drive to seize control of the House in 1994 .
The level of detail was precise .
Aside from money and professional advice , members of the farm teams got audio cassettes that taught them about tactics and issues as they drove around their states .
Redistricting helped the GOP as well , Kurtz said .
After the 1990 census , the Republicans joined forces with minority groups in urban areas to draft compact legislative districts that boosted the number of minority Democrats from cities , but diluted the Democratic vote , and representation , in the suburbs and rural areas .
The resultant political parity is cause for increased rancor .
" When you have many more chambers in play from election to election , you have more of these pitched battles between the parties , " Storey said .
" When one party dominates , sometimes the minority is willing to work with the majority in a way that is not as confrontational .
If the margins are very close , the thinking shifts .
When you are only a few seats behind you tend to have a more competitive , electoral focus . "
Texas offers a good example .
When Bush was first elected governor , conservative Democrats ruled the Legislature and Bush served as a pragmatist who could sit down and work with the other party .
Ten years later , in part because of his popularity in the state , the GOP controls both chambers of the Legislature and the governor 's office for the first time since Reconstruction .
With control of the U.S. House of Representatives now resting with a handful of swing seats , Republican leaders have tried to exploit last year 's capture of the Texas and Colorado legislatures by reopening congressional redistricting .
It was the first time in at least 50 years , said Storey , that a state had chosen to revisit the process twice in the same decade .
Colorado Democrats are asking the courts to strike down the new GOP - drawn lines ; their counterparts in Texas fled the state to deprive the Republicans of a necessary quorum and block the plan 's passage .
Any doubts that actions in Texas were tied to the partisan jousting in Washington vanished last week when U.S. Rep .
Tom DeLay of Texas , the Republican House majority leader , acknowledged that his staff had sought help from the Justice Department and the Federal Aviation Administration to try to track down the missing Texas Democrats .
The new Department of Homeland Security had also been asked by Texas police to help trace the political fugitives .
Rep. Maxine Waters , a liberal Democrat from California , has introduced legislation in Congress that would limit redistricting to once a decade and so prevent legislatures from reopening the process .
In a " Dear Colleague " letter , she suggested that if that measure fails , Democratic - controlled legislatures such as those in California , Oklahoma or New Mexico might follow the Republican example .
Rep. Charlie Stenholm , a conservative Democrat best known for siding with President Reagan against the liberals of the Democratic caucus in the 1980s , was left sputtering last week at DeLay 's tactics .
Complaining about a breakdown of trust and civility in the House , he asked , " Who is causing it in the House of Representatives ?
The same person or persons who are causing it in the Texas Legislature . "
Stenholm 's ire is explainable .
The GOP can live with urban liberals such as Waters , Norquist said ; it 's moderates such as Stenholm who are its prime targets .
If the Texas redistricting plan is adopted , Norquist said , ``it is exactly the Stenholms of the world who will disappear , … the moderate Democrats .
They will go so that no Texan need grow up thinking that being a Democrat is acceptable behavior . "

Is Google ( GOOG ) Phone fact or fiction ?
Engadget says
Google ’s entry into mobile phone business is for real , and the company is going to announce it soon .
Scott Kirsner talked to a bunch of folks over who are intimately familiar with the effort and outlined his findings in an article for The Boston Globe .
The story talks about a handful of Boston entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who have seen the phone , but are under NDA and ca n’t talk about it .
Rich Miner , a co-founder of Android , a mobile software company he started with Andy Rubin ( formerly of Danger ) is based in Boston .
Google bought Android in August 2005 .
Later Google snapped up Reqwireless and Skia , two tiny start - ups with mobile expertise , and since then has been hiring mobile - focused folks at a pretty steady clip .
[ digg=http://digg.com/tech_news/Five_Facts_About_Google_Phone]
The news ( or rumors ) were enough to get me dialing - for - dirt over the big holiday weekend .
These are the tidbits I picked up from a reliable source :
1. Google Phone is based on a mobile variant of Linux , and is able to run Java virtual machines .
2 . All applications that are supposed to run on the Google Phone are java apps .
The OS has ability to run multimedia files , including video clips .
3 . The user interface is similar to a UI typical of mobile phones , and the image ( with red background ) floating around is n’t representative of the Google Phone UI .
The entire UI is said to be done in Java and is very responsive .
The UI , of course has a “ search box . ”
4 . There is a special browser which has pan-and - browse features that are common to modern browsers such as browsers for iPhone and Symbian phones .
The entire browser is apparently written in Java .
But then others have told us that the browser is based on the WebKit core , the same engine in Safari and in iPhone , and Google has been making optimizations to speed it up .
This is one aspect of the Google Phone I am not sure about .
5 . Initially there was one prototype , but over past few months Google has the mobile OS running on 3 - to - 5 devices , most of them likely made by HTC , a mobile phone maker , and all have Qwerty apps .
The model that folks have seen is very similar to the T - Mobile Dash .
Around 3GSM , there were rumors that Google , Orange and HTC were working together on mobile devices .
These tiny - bits of information are pretty close to what Simeon Simenov , a VC with Polaris Venture Partners had very clearly outlined on his blog eons ago .
I ca n’t seem to find that post , so here is is an alternate link .
Simenov also wrote a pretty good post on what should be an ideal mobile stack .
Google is pretty close to what Simenov had outlined .
We will post more details as they come our way .
I had initially thought that it could be a more viable option to the $ 100 PC .
While that argument still remains true , I think this is a strategic move by Google to keep Windows Mobile ’s growing influence in check .
Microsoft has spent billions on its mobile efforts including buying companies such as Tell Me Networks .
Andrew Roth at Club for Growth reports on a great speech by Congressman Jeff Flake on earmarks that deserves to be reproduced :
“ Mr. Speaker , I rise today out of concern for what earmarks are doing to this body .
Those of us on the Republican side understand very well the political perils of this practice .
Unfettered earmarking , and the corruption that accompanies it , was a major factor in putting us right where we are today : squarely in the minority .
“ But there are greater concerns than which party is in the majority .
I would hope that all of us , Republicans and Democrats , would be concerned about what earmarks are doing to the practice of authorization , appropriation , and oversight that has been the hallmark of this institution for more than two centuries .
“ Proponents of earmarking defend the practice by noting that Article One of the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse , and that earmarking is consistent with that responsibility .
It is true that Congress has the power of the purse .
But the contemporary practice of earmarking circumvents , rather than enhances , the careful execution of our responsibility as stewards of public funds .
“ Take the Labor - HHS Appropriations bill that we will consider this week .
Under the new earmark rules adopted earlier this year , a list of earmarks accompanies the conference report .
We received that list late last week .
It contains 1,300 earmarks .
Are we to assume that each of these 1,300 projects have been individually scrubbed to ensure their appropriateness to the legislation ?
“ I suspect that , as the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee said just weeks ago , there is no way to adequately screen these earmarks given the tight appropriation schedule .
The question needs to be asked :
Why are we so bent on moving forward with so many earmarks when we know we ca n’t adequately screen them ?
“ I should note that no House earmarks were approved in last year ’s Labor - HHS bill .
Last time I checked , the world did n’t come crashing to a halt .
What ’s more , owing to the politics surrounding the bill , no earmarks were approved the year before that .
Here again , the planets seemed to stay in their orbit .
The Chairman has frequently pointed out that , until a decade ago , the Labor - HHS bill was n’t earmarked at all .
So , why are we so insistent on approving 1,300 earmarks this week , earmarks that we know have n’t been adequately vetted and scrubbed ?
“ Perhaps the most frequent justification for the contemporary practice of earmarking is that , quote , â€ ˜Members of Congress know their districts better than some faceless bureaucrat in Washington , DC . ’
I ’m not here to defend faceless bureaucrats .
In fact , faceless bureaucrats often waste money on questionable projects in my own district .
Faceless bureaucrats in federal agencies waste so much money that they need someone constantly looking over their shoulder .
This is why congressional oversight is so important .
“ But , let ’s face it : when we approve congressional earmarks for indoor rainforests in Iowa or teapot museums in North Carolina , we make the most spendthrift faceless bureaucrat look frugal .
Excess by federal agencies should not excuse congressional excess .
If federal agencies do n’t follow procedures requiring competitive bidding or other processes we have mandated , we should act by cutting funding and / or mandating improvements , not trying to one - up them with equally suspect appropriations .
“ As an aside , we saw just weeks ago that the majority of this chamber chose to deny funding for an earmark requested by an individual member .
For the record , I offered the amendment to deny funding for the “ Perfect Christmas Tree Project . ”
There was no federal nexus and it was not a wise use of federal dollars .
But it was no less worthy than hundreds of projects funded by the same legislation .
I would like to conclude that the amendment succeeded thanks to the compelling case I presented , but I suspect that political payback had more to do with it .
“ The distribution of earmarks is based on politics , not policy .
Most appropriations bills award 60 percent of the earmarks to the majority party and 40 percent to the minority party .
Is there a policy reason for this allocation that can reverse itself with an election ?
In most appropriations bills , well - positioned members award themselves many more earmarks than rank and file members receive .
Are we to assume that districts represented by well - positioned Members are needier than those represented by less seasoned Members of Congress ?
In some appropriations bills , each member of the committee is given an equal share of the available dollars .
Are we to assume here that these districts have identical needs ?
“ The truth is , we can try all we want to conjure up some sort of noble pedigree for the contemporary practice of earmarking , but we are just drinking our own bathwater if we think the public is buying it .
It seems that over that past few years we ’ve tried to increase the number of earmarks enough so that the plaudits we hear from earmark recipients will drown out the voices of taxpayers all over the country who have had enough .
It has n’t worked , thank goodness .
For every group that directly benefits from earmarks , there are hundreds who see it as a transparent gimmick to assure our own reelection .
“ Mr. Speaker , our constituents deserve better , and this institution deserves better than we are giving it .
Let ’s return to the time honored practice of authorization , appropriation , and oversight that has served us so well . ”

Interest in lost H - bomb resurfaces By Larry Copeland , USA TODAY TYBEE ISLAND , Ga . 
This seaside resort town 18 miles east of Savannah is the very personification of " laid back . "
The primary pursuits seem to be sunbathing and people - watching .
Islanders tend to ignore hurricane evacuation orders , and the city manager wears shorts and sandals to work .
Scientists search the waters of Wassaw Sound looking for an H - bomb lost over 46 years ago .
By Gerald Weaver , Getty Images
So folks here are n't about to fret over a hydrogen bomb that might — or might not — be buried off their coast , left there since a crippled Air Force bomber jettisoned it in 1958 .
" The only time it even comes up is when one of these groups brings it up .
It 's been out there since ' 58 .
What are you gonna do ? " says Michael Buttimer , a bartender - manager at Doc's , a legendary drinking establishment near the beach .
He 's wearing a baseball cap that says " Tybee Island Bomb Squad — Wassaw Sound . "
Wassaw Sound , about 10 miles south of Tybee Island City Hall , is the latest likely site of the long - lost bomb .
Late last month , a federal government team of 20 experts spent two days searching a football - field - sized area in Wassaw Sound .
The team collected water and sand samples and radiation readings and took them to Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories in New Mexico for analysis , says Lt. Col .
Frank Smolinsky , an Air Force spokesman .
" We feel comfortable that we will be able to provide an answer of yes , it can be located at this site , or no , it cannot , " Smolinsky says .
He says that process will take " several weeks or a little more . "
LOST WEAPONS
The U.S. military lost an estimated 11 nuclear bombs during the Cold War that have never been recovered .
Some of those incidents : 1956 : A B - 47 bomber from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa carrying two nuclear weapon cores in their carrying cases disappeared over the Mediterranean Sea .
No trace of the aircraft , weapon cores or crew was found .
1957 : A C - 124 cargo plane from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware lost power and was forced to jettison two unarmed nuclear bombs in the Atlantic Ocean .
The incident was kept secret for more than 10 years .
1959 : A Navy plane that had caught fire jettisoned a nuclear bomb in water 8,500 feet deep near Whidbey Island , Wash .
The incident was kept secret for more than 10 years .
Source : The Brookings Institution
And if it is the bomb ?
" That 's the second million - dollar question , " Smolinsky says .
" We 'll cross that bridge when we come to it .
The same experts would need to reconvene and decide what would be the appropriate action .
" We will do whatever is best for the local area in regards to removing the bomb or not removing the bomb .
Moving it would not be an easy endeavor to undertake . "
The Air Force estimated in 2001 that it would take up to five years and cost $ 5 million to $ 11 million to recover the bomb .
The military searched for the bomb for more than nine weeks in 1958 before declaring it irretrievably lost .
Several years ago , Derek Duke , a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who lives in Statesboro , Ga. , about 90 miles northwest of here , asked the military to search again .
The Air Force said in a July 2001 report that the bomb , likely buried beneath 6 to 40 feet of water and more than 5 feet of mud , posed little threat if left undisturbed .
The 7,600 - pound bomb is about 12 feet long and about 1 ½ feet in diameter .
It contains about 400 pounds of conventional explosives plus an undisclosed amount of uranium .
It is incapable of a nuclear explosion because it does not have the plutonium capsule necessary to trigger an atomic blast , the Air Force says .
If it were armed , the bomb 's destructive power would be 100 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima , Japan , in 1945 — strong enough to incinerate almost everything within a 5 - mile radius .
It would produce a 160 - mile radius of deadly radioactive fallout .
The bomb was dumped into the Atlantic Ocean off the Georgia coast the morning of Feb. 5 , 1958 .
A B - 47 bomber on a simulated combat mission from Homestead Air Force Base near Miami collided with an F - 86 fighter jet .
The F - 86 pilot bailed out , and his jet crashed .
The crew of the damaged B - 47 attempted three landings at nearby Hunter Air Force Base with the bomb onboard .
Crewmembers then were given permission to jettison the bomb offshore , dropping it from an altitude of about 7,200 feet .
They did not see an explosion when the bomb hit the water , and they later landed safely at Hunter .
Duke 's interest in the bomb dates to 1998 , when he learned of the missing bomb .
He used radiation and metal detection equipment to search Wassaw Sound .
Military authorities decided to search the sound last month after Duke reported finding unusually high radiation levels in that area .
Duke initially maintained that the bomb did have the arming capsule .
Now , he says , that 's not really a consideration .
" With ( the search team ) having come , it 's a moot point with me right now , " Duke says .
" If it is armed or not , unless it creates any additional danger , I 'm not going to go there .
That 's for someone higher up the food chain than me . "
Duke , 59 , says he started searching for the bomb because " if I did n't do it , I did n't see anyone else that would or could do it . "
He says the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon added urgency to his search .
" We 've got a very real terror threat .
"
That might suggest that island denizens are sitting on pins and needles awaiting the military 's test results .
Not so , Tybee Island Mayor Walter Parker says .
" We 've always been fairly laid back , and we 're not all that concerned , " says Parker , 69 and in his 15th year as mayor .
" I have not heard one person on Tybee Island say they 're concerned .
We 've been assured there 's no chance of a nuclear explosion at all .
" The only concern some people might have is that it might deter some tourists , but we have not seen or heard anything to support that . "
Tybee Island , which boasts a famous lighthouse , earns up to half of its annual budget from tourism .
Its population of 3,600 year - round residents swells to as much as 12,000 during the summer .
Some weekends , 40,000 sun worshipers crowd its beaches .
" I have not heard from one property manager , one hotel manager or one condo manager about this hurting their business , " City Manager Bob Thomson says .
" And I would have heard . "
Louie Williford , 59 , is nursing a beer at Doc 's and not pondering the bomb .
" I do n't really think about it , " he says .
" If it 's gonna happen , it 's gonna happen .
Ain't nothing I can do about it . "

Thanks , everyone , for pitching in !
Methodology ·
The questions were :
Is your work mostly Rails , or do you do significant non-Rails Ruby development ?
Which developer tools do you use ?
Pick as many as you want .
On the latter , the options were ( presented in random order to each participant ) :
TextMate
Emacs family
Vi family
Eclipse
NetBeans
IntelliJ
Other ( please say which )
I announced the survey on this blog , on the ruby - lang mailing list and IRC channel , and asked someone to do the same in the Rails equivalents .
I cut off the survey when the sample size reached 1,000 , after six days .
I downloaded a .xls of the results from SurveyMonkey , and did a little hand - sanitation .
Lots of people had listed tools ( irb , rake , autotest , you name it ) that were n’t actually editors .
Also , there were a few editors that showed up often enough under “ Other ” that probably they should have been among the choices .
So I did three flavors of cleanup : First , where they ’d listed Aptana and / or RadRails , but had n’t listed Eclipse , changed that to an Eclipse vote .
Second , I regularized the names of Komodo , jEdit , sciTE , and so on .
Third , I removed all the non-editor tools .
Then a ran a little Ruby script to group the totals by into the “ mostly - Rails ” and “ significant non-Rails Ruby ” buckets , using the labels “ Rails ” and “ Ruby ” .
Results · [ Corrected : Editing error had undercounted sciTE . ]
First of all , the sampling methodology is laughably unscientific ; the audience is self - selecting .
I asked SurveyMonkey to accept only one result from any given IP address , but we know how much that ’s worth .
I find the results interesting , but they ’d be bounced out of any refereed journal .
You can look at Survey Monkey ’s decent presentation of the results ; it does n’t group by Ruby / Rails , but it does allow you to look at the raw “ Other ” comments .
Lots of people selected multiple tools ; in aggregate , the 1,000 responses named 1,575 .
Here are three quick graphs summarizing the results , with bars for any software that got at least 10 votes , which is 0.1 % .

Everyone is grabbing Super Mario Galaxy , right ?
Right ?
Two years ago , at The Last E3 Ever , I can recall wandering around the Nintendo booth ’s bizarre inner temple , wondering if they had well and truly gone mad .
I was going to cut them some slack , as I ’d been wrong about the DS , and was prepared to invest what little optimism I possess into their surreal , prophetic dream .
I found a couple other items to enjoy , Excitetruck especially .
But until I saw Galaxy , I did n’t really get it .
And once I had it , it clung .
It was like a secret I knew but could not tell , and the knowledge that you ’ll finally be able to play it for yourselves is an immense relief .
I never felt especially convinced of my ability to express the game , anyway .
One often sees the multiplayer mode of Super Mario Galaxy dismissed out of hand in reviews , but I know that for Gabe and Kara it ’s almost a perfect fit .
This second player can have as much or as little gameplay as they ’d like : similar to Double Dash , breaking out the full suite of controls into a cooperative experience can expose some amusing synergistic gameplay .
This other player can boost jumps , hold obstacles , grip enemies , and fire candy " bullets , " but their best trick is to pick up distant Star Bits - Galaxy ’s delicious , omnipresent collectible .
Player
One can focus on the tight platforming while Player Two manages the playspace .
Everyone online seems to have tracked down a copy of Mass Effect , which leads me to wonder if MS will actually hold to their November 19th embargo for reviews .
Acclimating myself to Knights of the Old Republic was made easier by the wealth of brand totems available in every eyeful of game content .
Up until now , BioWare ’s best games have relied upon existing worlds to give them this heft .
Honestly , I wondered if they were up to the task .
After about hour three , there was enough information present about the setting to buoy the game events , and I was enraptured .
Before this , I mostly found myself frustrated by performance dips and pronounced texture pops - Gears of War fans will recognize this second one , and its source in the Unreal Engine , almost immediately .
Now , with the girders of their context firmly set , I do n’t even notice these occasional intrusion of these things .
There is only a constantly unfurling space opera of profoundly humbling scope .
Once you ’ve gotten your bearings , I suggest you try playing the game with the Film Grain and Motion Blur effects turned off .
It ’s strange , but I think I actually prefer it minus the condiments .

Telephone : 07845039980 Email : [ email]uxbridge7@riseup.net [ /email ]
Agrexco is Israel ’s largest importer of agricultural produce into the European Union , and it is 50 % Israeli state owned .
It imports produce from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
The protestors will face trial at Uxbridge Magistrates Court , between the 23rd January to 2nd Febuary 2006 .
They are each charged with two offences under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 .
Section 68 : ( Aggravated Trespass ) and Section 69 : ( Failure To Leave Land ) .
The defence team will be advised by Palestinian QC Michel Abdel Massih of Tooks Chambers .
The protesters will argue as a defence that they were acting to prevent crimes against international law , that are also offences in the UK under the International Criminal Court Act .
The defendants will argue that these offences are being supported by Agrexco ( UK ) .
THE BLOCKADE
In a well planned operation , using wire fences and bicycle D - Locks the protesters succeeded in blockading the Agrexco ( UK ) distribution centre , blocking all motor vehicle traffic in and out of the building for several hours before being arrested .
THE TRIAL
One of the Israeli expert witnesses in the trial , Dr Uri Davis , will be calling for a boycott of apartheid Israel at a press conference and public meeting on Weds 25th January along with defendants of the trial .
They will be joined by Sue Blackwell , who recently spearheaded the AUT
campaign in the UK for an academic boycott of Israeli institutuions .
Other witnesses at the trial will include Professor George Joffe ( Centre for International Studies , Cambridge University ) and Palestinians affected by the occupation who will be present in court to give first hand testimony about the effect of Agrexco ’s business in the occupied Jordon Valley .
BACKGROUND
Carmel - Agrexco is 50 % owned by the state of Israel , and imports produce from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
At the same time Israeli forces have blocked Palestinian exports on grounds of ‘ security ’ .
Israeli state sponsored settlements have appropriated land and water resources by military force from Palestinian farmers in a deliberate policy of colonial settlement .
In a hearing in September the judge ruled that Agrexco ( UK ) must prove that their business is lawful .
Before taking part in this action many of the defendants had witnessed first hand the suffering of Palestinian communities under the brutal Israeli occupation , having served as volunteers with the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) , documenting human rights abuses by the IDF in the West Bank and Gaza , and taking part in non-violent civil resistance to the occupation organised by Palestinian civilian committees .
The international campaign to boycott Israeli goods is growing across Europe .
In December 2005 a whole region of Norway voted to cut economic relations with Israel .
The US administration has threatened ‘ serious political consequences ’ against Norway if the boycott should develop into a national policy .

NOTES FOR JOURNALISTS
DR URI DAVIS is a Palestinian - Hebrew citizen of Israel and the UK , He was born in 1943 , when Palestine was still undivided and his autobiography , published in 1995 , is entitled " Crossing the Border : an autobiography of an anti-Zionist Palestinian Jew " .
For over thirty years , he has worked to expose the truth about Israeli " democracy " .
He is probably best known for his book , " Israel : An Apartheid State " ( Zed Books ) and its sequel " Apartheid Israel : Possibilities for the Struggle Within ( Zed Books ) which analyses Israeli legislation establishing that
Israel is little short of a herrenvolk democracy -- a state which offers first - class rights only to those recognised as ' Jews ' .
He is an anthropologist who , in addition to a PhD in Philosophical Anthropology , also holds a BA in Arabic and Philosophy and an MA in Philosophy .
Dr. Davis is an honorary research fellow at the Institute for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies ( IMEIS ) in the University of Durham and at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies ( IAIS ) in the University of
Exeter .
PROFESSOR GEORGE JOFFE is a visiting professor in Geography at Kings College London , and lecturer at the Centre for International Studies at Cambridge University .
Prof .
Joffe is considered to be one of the foremost authorities on the Middle East politics in the UK , being widely published in academic journals , as well as quoted in mainstream print , television and radio journalism .
The professor was one of a handful of experts invited by PM Tony Blair to give advice about the effects of a possible Iraq war before it took place .
Prof .
Joffe has been outspoken in his criticism of the decision to go to war , as well as Israel ’s expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank .
He says in a report commissioned for the Uxbridge case ; " There is no doubt that , under international law , the complex of settlements , interlinking road systems
and the Separation Wall are considered to be illegal .
Many aspects of them are illegal under Israeli domestic law as well . "
SUE BLACKWELL is a lecturer at Birmingham University .
She will speak at the press conference and public meeting in support of the defendants call for a boycott of Apartheid Israel .
Sue Blackwell spearheaded the AUT motion to boycott Bar Ilan because of violations of the 4th Geneva convention in the illegal settlement of Ariel , Haifa University because of its attacks on academic freedom when a student 's thesis exposed a massacre of Palestinians , and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem because of its evictions of Arab families to expand its student accommodation .

Republicans call for withdrawal of ' hidden cost of wars ' report John Byrne
Published : Wednesday November 14 , 2007

Print This Email This Welcome Digg readers !
A faster Raw Story goes into testing this month , but we 're short on funds : 894 readers needed to help close the gap !
Two Republican senators say Democrats can't do math .
Or not exactly .
Senior Republicans on Congress ' Joint Economic Committee , Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - KN ) and Rep. James Saxon ( R - NJ ) are calling on Democrats to retract a staff report alleging the hidden costs of the Iraq war could total more than $ 1.5 trillion .
In a joint statement issued to the Washington Post , the committee 's Republicans called the report " another thinly veiled exercise in political hyperbole masquerading as academic research . "
" All wars involve costs , and the war on terror is no exception , " Brownback and Saxton said .
" The Democrats ' report would have benefited from more analysis and quality control , and less political content .
We call on [ Economic Committee Chairman Charles ] Schumer ( D - NY ) and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate to withdraw this defective report . "
The Democratic analysis claimed that President Bush 's six - year invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq would end up costing Americans about $ 1.5 trillion , or nearly twice as much as the White House has actually spent to fight its wars , because of unseen costs like inflation , rising oil prices and expensive care for wounded veterans .
The estimate was revealed in a Democratic staff report from Congress 's Joint Economic Committee .
The staff report , titled " The Hidden Costs of the Iraq War , " estimated that the Iraq and Afghan wars have cost the average family more than $ 20,000 .
The White House apparently vastly underestimated the war 's costs , the authors assert .
It requested $ 804 billion -- just more than half the total costs -- to keep up its wars and occupations through 2008 .
" The report argues that war funding is diverting billions of dollars away from " productive investment " by American businesses in the United States .
It also says that the conflicts are pulling reservists and National Guardsmen away from their jobs , resulting in economic disruptions for U.S. employers that the report estimates at $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion , " the Post 's Josh White wrote Tuesday .
Israel Klein , a spokesman for the committee 's majority , replied in the Post .
" Instead of dealing with the substance of this report , the White House is once again trying to deflect attention away from the blistering costs of this war in Iraq , " he said .

CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's detractors danced in the streets Monday after voters shot down a referendum that would have allowed the firebrand leftist to seek re-election indefinitely and tightened socialism 's grip on his oil - rich nation .
President Hugo Chavez thanks opponents Monday , saying the results show Venezuelan democracy is maturing .
more photos »
In Caracas , Valencia , Maracaibo and other major cities , large crowds spilled into the streets , shouting , chanting , clapping and waving flags .
One man carried a sign proclaiming , " Vota No , " which by Monday was more an exclamation than an imperative after voters the day before dismissed 69 proposed amendments to Venezuela 's 1999 constitution .
Chavez said Monday he accepted the vote , calling the slim margin of victory -- 51 percent to 49 percent , according to early reports -- a " photo finish . "
The vote represented a rare poll defeat for Chavez , who has generally enjoyed popular support among the lower classes .
Among the exceptions : a bitter national strike , an abortive coup against him in 2002 and a 2004 attempt to recall him as president , a vote he easily survived .
Many of Monday 's revelers were university students who had worked doggedly to defeat the proposals .
They burst into singing the national anthem upon hearing news that their efforts paid off .
" This is not a moment only for students ; it is for the whole country , " student Juan Andres Mejia said .
" It 's time for us to start walking the same path to walking together , and I think this day could be the start of a new republic of a new Venezuela . "
Watch what led to the referendum 's defeat »
In Washington , the White House applauded the results of the vote .
" We congratulate the people of Venezuela on their vote and their continued desire to live in freedom and democracy , " said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
In what he called a talk " from my heart , " Chavez said the election results proved Venezuelan democracy was maturing , a sentiment echoed by Tibisay Lucena , president of the National Electoral Council .
Thanking his opponents , Chavez told a roomful of supporters and journalists , " Now Venezuelans should have faith in our institutions . "
View scenes from the historic election »
However , Chavez promised to continue his pursuit of the defeated proposals .
" Not a single comma of this proposal will be withdrawn , " he said , holding up a small red book containing the text of the proposed changes .
" I will continue proposing this to the Venezuelan people .
The proposal is alive , not dead . "
One of the more controversial proposed amendments would have abolished term limits , allowing Chavez to hold office indefinitely as long as he is re-elected .
The 53 - year - old Venezuelan president , who was elected in 1998 as the country 's youngest - ever president , has twice been re-elected by large margins .
However , the present law prohibits Chavez from seeking re-election when his term ends in 2012 .
Another amendment on the ballot would have pushed the country more toward socialism .
Chavez has said he should have full authority over the autonomous Central Bank as well as the nation 's economic policy .
These measures , Chavez has said , are necessary to move the economy toward socialism .
Since winning a second six - year term in December , Chavez has promised to push forward with his particular brand of socialism and his " Bolivarian Revolution . "
Chavez has used skyrocketing oil revenues , which reportedly account for about 90 percent of the nation 's export earnings , to garner support in the country 's poorer neighborhoods .
In Venezuela , the poor receive free health care and education , much like in Cuba , which is under the rule of Chavez 's friend and mentor , President Fidel Castro .
Chavez 's opponents say he has undercut Venezuela 's democracy by systematically concentrating power in his own hands .
In the last year , Chavez has nationalized oil , telephone and power companies and refused to renew the broadcast license for RCTV , an independent open - air television station that had been broadcasting for 53 years .
The Venezuelan government later threatened to investigate broadcasters it said were inciting the public to violence over the decision .
RCTV returned as a cable and satellite broadcaster in July .
On Friday , Chavez threatened to take independent Venezuelan network Globovision off the air if it broadcast partial results of the Sunday referendum .
Chavez , a former paratrooper , also routinely lambastes the United States , which has had thin diplomatic but close economic ties with Venezuela .
The United States is Venezuela 's top oil customer , buying about 1 million barrels a day , and is one of the few countries that can refine its low - quality crude .

All About Hugo Chavez • Venezuela
Whereas there is visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks , including suicide bombings , IED [ improvised explosive device ] explosions , rocket firing and bomb explosions and the banding together of some militant groups have taken such activities to an unprecedented level of violent intensity posing a grave threat to the life and property of the citizens of Pakistan ;
Whereas there has also been a spate of attacks on state infrastructure and on law enforcement agencies ;
Whereas some members of the judiciary are working at cross purposes with the executive and legislature in the fight against terrorism and extremism thereby weakening the government and the nation 's resolve diluting the efficacy of its actions to control this menace ;
Whereas there has been increasing interference by some members of the judiciary in government policy , adversely affecting economic growth , in particular ;
Whereas constant interference in executive functions , including but not limited to the control of terrorist activity , economic policy , price controls , downsizing of corporations and urban planning , has weakened the writ of the government ; the police force has been completely demoralised and is fast losing its efficacy to fight terrorism and intelligence agencies have been thwarted in their activities and prevented from pursuing terrorists ;
Whereas some hard core militants , extremists , terrorists and suicide bombers , who were arrested and being investigated were ordered to be released .
The persons so released have subsequently been involved in heinous terrorist activities , resulting in loss of human life and property .
Militants across the country have , thus , been encouraged while law enforcement agencies subdued ;
Whereas some judges by overstepping the limits of judicial authority have taken over the executive and legislative functions ;
Whereas the government is committed to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and holds the superior judiciary in high esteem , it is nonetheless of paramount importance that the honourable judges confine the scope of their activity to the judicial function and not assume charge of administration ;
Whereas an important constitutional institution , the Supreme Judicial Council , has been made entirely irrelevant and non est by a recent order and judges have , thus , made themselves immune from inquiry into their conduct and put themselves beyond accountability ;
Whereas the humiliating treatment meted out to government officials by some members of the judiciary on a routine basis during court proceedings has demoralised the civil bureaucracy and senior government functionaries , to avoid being harassed , prefer inaction ;
Whereas the law and order situation in the country as well as the economy have been adversely affected and trichotomy of powers eroded ;
Whereas a situation has thus arisen where the government of the country cannot be carried on in accordance with the constitution and as the constitution provides no solution for this situation , there is no way out except through emergent and extraordinary measures ;
And whereas the situation has been reviewed in meetings with the prime minister , governors of all four provinces and with the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee , chiefs of the armed forces , vice chief of army staff and corps commanders of the Pakistan army ;
Now , therefore , in pursuance of the deliberations and decisions of the said meetings , I General Pervez Musharraf , Chief of Army Staff , proclaim emergency throughout Pakistan .
I hereby order and proclaim that the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan shall remain in abeyance .
This proclamation shall come into force at once .

One problem with our complicated lives these days is that many of us never find time to spend alone , in peace , without being bombarded with noise and information .
There ’s no time for solitude and quiet contemplation , and as a result , we have stress and anxiety and depression and repression .
Find time each day to be alone , for your mental health , by stealing pockets of time from other areas of your life .
This time will pay off for you in the long run .
You will become sane , and with the ability to reflect on your life , on what you ’ve gone through in the last 24 hours , in the last week , in the last year , you can slowly improve it or learn to be happy with it .
Finding time for solitude is extremely important , and yet it ’s an area that is often neglected .
I do n’t mean time alone , where you ’re watching TV or surfing the Internet or reading or watching the news .
There ’s nothing wrong with those activities , but they are n’t conducive to contemplation , to getting to know yourself , to reflecting on what you ’ve been going through , for thinking about your dreams .
Learning to spend time in quiet solitude is also very difficult .
It ’s probably best if done in small doses at first , so if you only do it for 20 or 30 minutes at first , that ’s OK .
Learn to fight the urge to turn the TV on or turn your computer on or play music or read .
It ’s hard , but it ’s worth it .
What follows are just some ideas for recapturing about an hour a day of extra time , from other sources of time , so that you can have time for solitude .
These are temporary fixes … ways for you to find that time for 30 days , and in those 30 days , you can find other ways to simplify your life so that you can have this time permanently .
Use those 30 days , in part , for thinking about the complications in your life , about things you might want to eliminate to free up more time for important things , like your dreams , your loved ones , your passion , and solitude .
Television .
I ’m not on a crusade against television , and I ’m not saying you should get rid of it .
I watch TV .
And though I ’ve eliminated cable TV from my life , I ’m not saying you should .
This is a temporary fix , remember … so try to reduce your television consumption by 60 minutes , just for 30 days .
You may find that you enjoy reduced TV consumption , but every person is different .
Internet .
Again , I ’m not saying you should stop using the Internet .
Just reduce your consumption of the Internet by 60 minutes for 30 days .
Be sure to use those 60 minutes for solitude and contemplation .
Reducing your Internet use will force you to use the time you do use the Internet more productively … you can still do the things you love to do , but you have to use them in a more focused way .
Wake earlier .
I ’ve talked about the benefits of rising early , and how to do it in the past , and one of its best benefits , for me , is the quiet time I have alone .
I like to use this time for writing , for exercise , and for contemplation .
Try waking 1 hour earlier , just for 30 days .
Or if that does n’t work for you , stay up an hour later .
Either way works .
Email .
If email consumes a huge part of your life , try going on an email diet .
Only allow yourself to do email once a day , for 30 minutes .
See if you can stop yourself from doing email at all other times .
Remember , this is just for 30 days … after that , if you want to go back to doing email all day long , you can .
Stop shopping .
Again , it ’s only temporary !
But if you ’re also trying to reduce debt or save money , this is a great permanent solution .
But just try it for 30 days .
Eliminate all shopping except essential grocery shopping .
Everything else goes on a 30 - day list .
Leave work early .
If your work allows it , see if you can leave work earlier .
If you have a smart boss , the only thing that will matter is if you ’re getting your work done — not how long you ’re in the office .
So really focus on getting the essential work done within the time you have , and leave an hour earlier .
Go to work late .
The flip side of the above suggestion .
Again , this is if your work allows it .
Take a longer lunch .
Sometimes it ’s easier to squeeze out extra time for your lunch break than it is to come in early or to leave early .
If you can take 90 minutes for lunch , use the first 30 for eating ( pack a lunch if possible ) and the other 60 for solitude .
Stop digesting news .
Are you a news junky ?
I ’ve written before about how I have n’t watched TV news or read a newspaper or even Internet news sites for a couple of years .
It ’s possible to go without it .
See if you can stop reading newspapers , or watching TV news , for just 30 days .
After that , you can go back .
Do n’t do anything after work .
If you make social commitments after work , or business meetings , or whatever , stop making these plans for 30 days and use this time for solitude .
Skip civic commitments .
Do you volunteer or serve in an organization or are you a member of some group ?
Skip the meetings and other functions for a month .
The organization wo n’t fall apart without you … even if you ’re president , you can temporarily hand the reins over to your vice president .
Minimalize laundry .
Do you do a load of laundry several times a week , or even every day ?
That ’s an hour or two each time .
Instead , go to a laundry mat and do your laundry all in one shot — that ’ll take about two hours .
You can easily save 1 - 3 hours this way .
Minimalize housework / yardwork .
Do these chores take up a large part of your day ?
See if you can minimalize this , just for a month .
Relax your standards a little .
Or do a speed - cleaning stint once a week for two hours , and do n’t clean the rest of the week .
For yardwork , hire a teen - ager to do it for a month .
Cut out non-essential reading .
Cut out magazine reading and most book reading ( unless it ’s essential ) to give you some extra time .
This will also include cutting out newspaper and Internet reading , if you are n’t implementing the tips above .
Minimalize recreation .
Partying , drinking , playing sports , playing video games … however you spend your free time , see if you can cut into that time .
Remember to use any time you free up for solitude and contemplation , not extra TV time .
For those who just can't call it quits , a team of researchers at Tufts University has developed a head adornment which can determine when you 've been overly stressed , bored or simply numb to the world around you when using your computer .
The crew is studying functional near - infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) technology , which " uses light to monitor brain blood flow as a proxy for workload stress a user may experience when performing an increasingly difficult task . "
The band itself utilizes " laser diodes to send near - infrared light through the forehead at a relatively shallow depth , " after which it can purportedly judge how intense one 's workload is ( or is n't ) .
' Course , we 'd guess the most of us would n't need a machine to tell us that , eh ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government said the number of Americans who went hungry in 2006 was held in check at 35 million people from the prior year , but food advocacy groups said on Wednesday more needs to be done .

The U.S. government said the number of Americans who went hungry in 2006 was held in check at 35 million people from the prior year , but food advocacy groups said on Wednesday more needs to be done .

The U.S. Agriculture Department said a total of 12.65 million households were “ food insecure , ” or 10.9 percent of U.S. homes , up from 12.59 million a year ago .
The USDA defines food insecurity - its metric for measuring hunger - as having difficulty acquiring enough food for the household throughout the year .
“ It looks very stable from this year to last year , ” said Mark Nord , who co-authored the annual report for USDA ’s Economic Research Service .
Overall , 35.52 million people , including 12.63 million children , went hungry compared with 35.13 million in 2005 .
The survey was conducted in December 2006 and represented 294 million people , an increase of 2.5 million from 2005 .
Food advocacy groups said the figures showed the United States was not doing enough to combat hunger , and feared conditions could worsen .
“ As costs for food , energy , and housing continue to rise and wages stagnate or decline , households are finding themselves increasingly strapped , ” said Jim Weill , president of the Food Research and Action Center .
“ This may mean even worse numbers in 2007 . ”
Very low food security was most prevalent in households with children headed by a single woman -- 10.3 percent in 2006 , USDA said .
Food stamps and other public nutrition programs account for about 60 percent of the USDA ’s spending .
Funding for the department ’s 15 nutrition assistance programs has risen 70 percent since 2001 to $ 59 billion in 2006 , and 20 percent of all Americans are impacted by the programs each year .
Some 27 million people are enrolled in the food stamp program alone , which helps poor Americans buy food .
USDA has estimated 65 percent of eligible people participate in the program , up from 54 percent in 2001 .
“ We have more work to do , ” said Kate Houston , USDA ’s deputy undersecretary for Food , Nutrition and Consumer Services .
“ We ca n’t say that everybody that is eligible for our programs is participating . ”
Here are some tips on how to “ compress ” your paper vertically by minimizing white space gaps between elements .
I had to do this few days ago when school refused to duplicate my syllabus because it was 14 pages long .
I got it down to 6 without any cuts , and then down to 3 after doing some reductions in text .
So how do we squeeze the vertical whitespace ?
There are many ways to do this , and some are more complicated than the other .
My tips range on the easy side , so you wo n’t need to write custom .sty files or redefine commands using intricate tex sequences .
First we want to set the spacing between paragraphs as small as possible .
The commands below should kill just about any space inducing setting in your paper unless you are doing something fancy :
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt} \setlength{\parsep}{0pt} \setlength{\headsep}{0pt} \setlength{\topskip}{0pt} \setlength{\topmargin}{0pt} \setlength{\topsep}{0pt} \setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
Now the paragraphs are snugly against each other so let ’s take a look at line spacing .
The \linespread command is usually used to increase the line spacing but we can exploit it to make it smaller by passing in a value smaller than 1 :
\linespread{0.5}
You may want to play around with that value – if you set it to small , LaTex will just reject it .
Below certain threshold some lines may start running into each other .
For me 0.5 value did the trick , and slurped up swaths of white space .
Our next offender are section headings .
By default they have huge gaps above and below them .
Totally wasteful , especially if you are trying to save trees by decreasing your page count without sacrificing content .
So what do you do ?
There are very complex ways to change the spacing above and below the section headings but we are lazy bums and do n’t feel like using them .
So let ’s use the titlesec package and zero out all the spaces :
\usepackage [ compact ] {titlesec} \titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{*0}{*0} \titlespacing{\subsection}{0pt}{*0}{*0} \titlespacing{\subsubsection}{0pt}{*0}{*0}
If you look int the documentation , the attributes to \titlespacing are command , left margin , above - skip and below - kip respectively .
The * notation replaces the formal notation using plus / minus and etc .
If you set it to zero , headings will snug up to the paragraphs above and below them .
Enumerations and itemizations are horrible space wasters too .
By default , all the lists are double - spaced .
Why ?
Do n’t ask me , but it ’s easy to get rid of that by using “ compacted ” lists provided by the mdwlist package .
In your preamble add :
\usepackage {mdwlist}
Then instead of using normal lists use :
\ begin{enumerate*} \item \end{enumerate*} \ begin{itemize*} \item \end{itemize*}
This is not as straightforward as the other steps , as it will require some search and replace in a pre-existing text .
If you know a better way to do this , please let me know .
Last thing I did was to change my margins using the geometry package .
My command looked like this :
\usepackage[left=2cm,top=1cm,right=2cm , nohead , nofoot ] {geometry}
My document had no headers or footers so I was able to disable them .
You should probably experiment a bit with the values above to see what is the maximum range of your printer .
Most devices wo n’t print all the way to the paper edge so you must set margins appropriate to your printer .
My document had no formulas or figures , but had several long item lists .
Some of them were very narrow – 2 - 3 words per item .
These types of lists are major space wasters so I set them in multi-column mode .
Depending on your list you can either use 2 , 4 or either 4 columns .
For me 2 columns were the right fit .
I recommend using the multicol package .
In your preamble add :
\usepackage {multicol}
Then surround your text to be “ columnized ” ( shut up , it ’s a new word I just mad up ) using :
\begin{multicols} {2} % your stuff goes here \end {multicols}
Once I did all of that , the page count of my document was cut roughly in half .
Feel free to add your vertical space squeezing tips in the comments .

The Israeli overflight of Syrian airspace through its ally , Turkey , involved as many as eight aircraft , including Israel 's most ultra-modern F - 15s and F - 16s equipped with Maverick missiles and 500lb bombs , the British newspaper The Observer reported Sunday .
According to the report , which quotes Turkish security sources , flying among the Israeli fighters at great height was an ELINT - an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft .
Turkey has a close security - strategic alliance with Israel .
According to one media report during the holiday of Rosh Hashana , Turkey 's military and intelligence units were in on the secret and even assisted the IDF , although the government was not informed about the operation in advance and later condemned it .
Over the weekend , the foreign press attempted to offer explanations for the Israeli overflight , which has yet to be officially confirmed by an Israeli official .
According to the Washington Post , quoting a senior US expert on the Middle East , the Israel Air Force raid over Syria allegedly occurred three days after the country received a shipment of material from North Korea labeled as cement .
The expert said the attack seemingly targeted a northern Syrian facility that was labeled an agricultural research center , close to the Turkish border .
It was not clear what the ship arriving from North Korea was actually carrying , although Israeli sources largely believed it was delivering nuclear equipment , the expert told the Washington Post .
The ship arrived at the Syrian port of Tartus on September 3 ; the attack supposedly occurred on September 6 .
The expert told the Washington Post that the attack was under such strict operational security that the pilots conducting the attack were briefed only after they were in the air .
Meanwhile , sources in NATO headquarters in Brussels told the London - based Arabic - language newspaper al - Hayat that the goal of the Israeli overflight was " a warning and an experiment " and that it was not aimed at causing damage or bringing about a war .
According to the source , Israel was surprised by the Syrian initiative to publicize the attack , as in two previous overflights over Syrian territory Israel was the one that initiated the publication .

William McGonagall ( Image Credit : McGonagall 2002 Virtual Gallery )
Great poetry must be considered art -
It tickles the brain and stabs the heart .
Could there be a worse poet than Uncle John ?
It 's all in the story that follows ; read on .
ALL FIRED UP
One afternoon in June 1877 , an impoverished Scottish weaver named William McGonagall fell into a funk .
McGonagall was depressed because he wanted to escape the gritty industrial city of Dundee for a few days in the countryside , but he could n't afford a train ticket .
He was stuck at home , and to make matters worse , he was starting to feel a little funny .
Was it a cold ?
The flu ?
Hardly .
As McGonagall later wrote in his autobiography , it was something else entirely : Divine Inspiration .
I seemed to feel as it were a strange kind of feeling stealing over me .
A flame ... seemed to kindle up my entire frame , along with a strong desire to write poetry .
I began to pace backwards and forwards in the room , trying to shake off all thought of writing poetry ; but the more I tried , the more strong the sensation became .
It was so strong , I imagined that a pen was in my right hand , and a voice crying , " Write ! Write ! "
So McGonagall wrote .
His first poem was a tribute to his friend the Reverend George Gilfillan :
The first time I hear him speak , ' Twas in the Kinnaird Hall .
Lecturing on the Garibaldi movement ,
As loud as he could bawl .
My blessing on his noble form ,
And on his lofty head , May all good angels guard him while he 's living And hereafter when he 's dead .
BARD IS BORN McGonagall showed the poem to Reverend Grilfillan , who remarked diplomatically , " Shakespeare never wrote anything like this ! "
Encouraged , McGonagall dropped into the mailbox of the Weekly News , hoping they might print it .
They did ... and he was off on a new career .
McGonagall already had a reputation for being eccentric :
His impromptu performances of Shakespeare 's plays at the factory where he worked were so bad they were funny , and his co-workers once rented a theater to watch him make a fool of himself along - side professional actors .
But it was McGonagall 's poetry that cemented his fame as a local nut .
He sold his poems on the street and gave readings at local pubs .
And as with his Shakespeare performances , his readings were so funny that people rented halls and subsidized his performances just so they could laugh at his work .
Unfortunately , they also pelted him with pies , wet towels , rotten eggs , and garbage while he read his poems .
It got so bad that McGonagall refused to perform unless a clergyman sat next to him onstage to keep people from throwing things .
OUCH !
How did McGonagall cope with the abuse ?
Though his poetry was awful , he never doubted his own talent and refused to believe that his audiences were there to laugh at him .
But it was so unrelenting that , by the early 1890s , McGonagall began threatening ( in verse ) to leave the city forever .
Would he really leave ?
In 1892 the Scottish Leader speculated that " ... when he discovers the full value of the circumstance that Dundee rhymes with 1893 , he may be induced to reconsider his decision and stay for yet a year . "
McGonagall stayed until 1894 , when he moved to Edinburgh .
There he continued writing poetry until ill health forced him to lay down his pen forever .
McGonagall passed away in 1902 , at the age of 77 , and was buried in an unmarked pauper 's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard .
The grave remained unmarked until 1999 , when the city of Edinburgh finally erected a plaque at the cemetery .
The Oxford Companion to English Literature says he " enjoys a reputation as the world 's worst poet , " and more than a century after his death , his poems are still in print .
A MCGONAGALL SAMPLER
So is William McGonagall the worst poet ever ?
Here are selections from his poetry to help you decide .
ALAS !
Sir John
Ogilvy is dead , aged eighty - seven , But I hope his soul is now in heaven ;
He was a public benefactor in many ways , Especially in erecting an asylum for imbecile children to spend their days .

And from the British battleships a fierce cannonade did boom ;
And continued from six in the morning till two o'clock in the afternoon .
And by the 26th of July the guns of Fort Moro were destroyed And the French and Spaniards were greatly annoyed - The Capture of Havana ALAS !
Lord and Lady Dalhousie are dead , and buried at last , Which causes many people to feel a little downcast .

Ye sons of Great Britain , I think no shame To write in praise of brave General Graham !
Whose name will be handed down to posterity without any stigma , Because , at the battle of El - Teb , he defeated Osman Digna .

- The Battle of Tel - el - Kebir Beautiful city of Glasgow , I now conclude my muse , And to write in praise of thee my pen does not refuse ;
And , without fear of contradic - tion , I will venture to say You are the second grandest city in Scotland at present day !
- Glasgow The New Yorkers boast about their Brooklyn Bridge , But in comparison to thee it seems like a midge .
- To the New Tay Bridge And when life 's prospects may at times appear dreary to ye , Remember Alois Senfelder , the discoverer of Lithography .

He told me at once what was ailing me ;
He said I had been writing too much poetry , And from writing poetry I would have to refrain , Because I was suffering from inflammation of the brain .

Ben Bernanke has been applauded for cutting rates
His comments to a US finance committee come two days after the Fed cut base interest rates to 4.75 % from 5.25 % .
The rate cut was made " to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy " , he said .
That , along with pumping cash into the financial system , aimed to counter " significant market stress " he said .
Mr Bernanke was appearing before the House Committee on Financial Services .
We are committed to preventing problems from recurring , while still preserving responsible sub - prime lending
Ben Bernanke
However , unlike his Bank of England counterpart , Mervyn King , who was grilled by a committee of MPs on Thursday over troubles in the banking system , Mr Bernanke is not facing pressure .
" He 's being applauded for taking timely precautionary measures , " said the BBC's New York business correspondent Dharshini David .
" He injected cash into the money markets early on to ensure there was enough liquidity in the system , and cut the main interest rate once evidence was gathering to suggest that the financial crisis was taking its toll on consumer activity and confidence . "
Repossessions set to rise
Mr Bernanke told the committee that US mortgage woes were set to continue - especially with adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) .
Proceedings for about 320,000 foreclosures - or repossessions - were begun in each of the first two quarters of 2007 he said , against an average of 225,000 per quarter in the past six years .
" With house prices still soft and many borrowers of recent - vintage sub - prime ARMs still facing their first interest rate resets , delinquencies and foreclosure initiations in this class of mortgages are likely to rise further , " he said .
Mr Bernanke added that it was difficult to be precise about how many repossessions would take place , but he said that in normal circumstances about half of homeowners who were given repossession notices ended up losing their homes .
" That ratio may turn out to be higher in coming quarters because the proportion of sub - prime borrowers , who have weaker financial conditions than prime borrowers , is higher , " Mr Bernanke said .
" We are committed to preventing problems from recurring , while still preserving responsible sub- prime lending . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who also spoke at the hearing , said he will consider allowing the two government - backed mortgage companies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , to temporarily buy , bundle and sell as securities any loans exceeding $ 417,000 .
The plan is being billed as a way to inject liquidity into the stretched mortgage market .
Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird explored racial prejudice in America
Her only novel , To Kill a Mockingbird , which was a plea for racial tolerance , won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 .
The award will be presented to Lee during a ceremony at the White House on 5 November .
The Presidential Medal of Freedom was reinstated in 1963 by President Kennedy to honour remarkable achievements .
Falsely accused
Past recipients of the honour include Muhammad Ali , Aretha Franklin and Doris Day .
Lee , 81 , who stopped giving interviews after winning the Pulitzer Prize , rarely makes public appearances .
The film version of To Kill A Mockingbird , made in 1962 , won an Oscar for actor Gregory Peck .
He played laywer Atticus Finch , a lawyer who represented a black man who was falsely accused of rape .
In a rare article published in The Oprah Magazine last year , Lee said that in a society where technology prevails , " I still plod along with books " .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) �
Gasoline prices in the United States , which have recently hit record highs , are actually much lower than in many countries .
Drivers in some European cities , like Amsterdam and Oslo , are paying nearly 3 times more than those in the U.S .
The main factor in price disparities between countries is government policy , according to AirInc , a company that tracks the cost of living in various places around the world .
Many European nations tax gasoline heavily , with taxes making up as much as 75 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline , said a spokesperson for AirInc .
In a few Latin America and Middle - East nations , such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia , oil is produced by a government - owned company and local gasoline prices are kept low as a benefit to the nation 's citizens , he said .
All prices updated March , 2005 .
Nation City Price in USD Regular / Gallon Netherlands Amsterdam $ 6.48 Norway Oslo $ 6.27 Italy Milan $ 5.96 Denmark Copenhagen $ 5.93 Belgium Brussels $ 5.91 Sweden Stockholm $ 5.80 United Kingdom London $ 5.79 Germany Frankfurt $ 5.57 France Paris $ 5.54 Portugal Lisbon $ 5.35 Hungary Budapest $ 4.94 Luxembourg $ 4.82 Croatia Zagreb $ 4.81 Ireland Dublin $ 4.78 Switzerland Geneva $ 4.74 Spain Madrid $ 4.55 Japan Tokyo $ 4.24 Czech Republic Prague $ 4.19 Romania Bucharest $ 4.09 Andorra $ 4.08 Estonia Tallinn $ 3.62 Bulgaria Sofia $ 3.52 Brazil Brasilia $ 3.12 Cuba Havana $ 3.03 Taiwan Taipei $ 2.84 Lebanon Beirut $ 2.63 South Africa Johannesburg $ 2.62 Nicaragua Managua $ 2.61 Panama Panama City $ 2.19 Russia Moscow $ 2.10 Puerto Rico San Juan $ 1.74 Saudi Arabia Riyadh $ 0.91 Kuwait Kuwait City $ 0.78 Egypt Cairo $ 0.65 Nigeria Lagos $ 0.38 Venezuela Caracas $ 0.12

A Palestinian artist paints a mural marking the anniversary of the Nakba in the Jabalya refugee camp in the northern Gaza strip , 15 May 2006 .
( Wesam Saleh / MaanImages )
When my mother was nine years old , she and her family mounted the back of a pickup truck and left their village of Lifta , adjacent to Jerusalem , under threat from Zionist militias .
My grandmother covered the furniture in the family home that my grandfather had built .
Anticipating a short absence until fighting in the area died down , they took only a few clothes .
That was almost six decades ago .
Like hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians , they were never allowed to return , and their property was seized by Israel .
My mother remembers her early childhood and the Jewish neighbors who rented the apartment her father owned .
She recalls helping them on the Sabbath and playing with their daughter after school .
A life such as this is no more than a distant memory for most Palestinian refugees , who , with their descendants , now number more than 5 million .
But a better life need n’t be just a memory .
It is feasible for Palestinians to return to their homeland while peace with Israelis is built at the same time .
Another diplomatic push will not bring about the fantasy of neat separation of Israelis and Palestinians into two states .
This would only perpetuate inequality and division .
Instead , international pressure should be put on Israel to drop its insistence on supremacy over Palestinians .
Then both parties can come together to begin building a single , multiethnic state where Jews and Palestinians can again live side by side .
One of the hard — but not impossible — tasks will be convincing many Israelis of the viability of a single - state solution .
In 2004 , for example , Israeli historian Benny Morris , who has written several books documenting the forced expulsion of the Palestinians , said that a “ Jewish state would not have come into existence without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians .
Therefore it was necessary to uproot them . ”
But Mr. Morris is no bleeding heart .
He added , “ There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing . ”
If Israel ’s founding prime minister , David Ben-Gurion , could be faulted , Morris said , it was because he “ did not complete the transfer in 1948 . ”
Millions of Palestinians live in squalid camps under Israeli military rule and in surrounding countries .
Israel has refused to allow these refugees to return home as required by international law .
The reason is simple : From its inception , the Zionist movement set out to turn a country where the vast majority of people were not Jewish into a country that gives special rights and privileges to Jews at the expense of non-Jews .
If Palestinian refugees were black Africans , no one would dispute an “ apartheid ” label that former US president Jimmy Carter has used to describe the situation .
But while some see Israel as a miracle , many Israelis themselves recognize that the Zionist project has been far from a success :
Today the number of Israeli Jews and Palestinians inhabiting the country is roughly equal at about 5 million each .
Just more than 1 million Palestinians live as citizens of Israel , albeit with inferior rights , while almost 4 million live under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza .
Their high birthrate means that in a few years , Palestinians will once again become the majority as they were prior to 1948 .
To assert , as Israel does , that it has a right to be a “ Jewish state ” means to recognize that it has a right to manipulate demographics for the purpose of ethnic domination .
This outlook violates fundamental human rights .
Palestinians , many of whom are already being forcibly displaced by the cruel wall that snakes through the West Bank , fear another 1948 - like expulsion .
At the last Israeli election , parties that explicitly endorse ethnic cleansing of Palestinians made major gains , including the one led by Deputy Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman .
Palestine / Israel is as unpartitionable as was South Africa and Northern Ireland , where similar ethnic conflicts had also defied resolution for generations .
In both places , it was only when the dominant group dropped its insistence on supremacy that a political settlement could be reached .
What was once unimaginable happened : Nelson Mandela ’s African National Congress and F.W. de Klerk ’s National Party joined hands in a national unity government in 1994 .
Leaders in Northern Ireland made similar progress this year .
Neither political marriage came about through love , but through necessity and with outside pressure .
In time , social reconciliation may come , but it has not been the prerequisite for political progress in South Africa or Northern Ireland .
Such pressure on Israel as the strongest party is necessary , which is why I support the growing movement for boycott , divestment , and sanctions modeled on the antiapartheid campaign .
At the same time , we must begin to construct a vision of a nonracial , nonsectarian Palestine - Israel , which belongs to all the people who live in it , Israeli Jews , Palestinians , and all exiles who want to return and live in peace with their neighbors .

Algarrobo , Chile Olympic - size is for plebs .
Thanks to advanced hydrotechnology , swimmers can paddle in a private ocean — like this $ 3.5 million , 20 - acre , half - mile - long , 66 million gallon leviathan recently certified by Guinness as the largest pool in the world .
Located in Algarrobo , Chile , about 70 miles west of Santiago and just yards from the Pacific , the pool at the San Alfonso del Mar condo complex handles water treatment like a surgical strike .
While most pools filter all the water several times a day , the San Alfonso 's 150 in - wall sensors focus the cleanup only on the dirty bits .
Fernando Fischmann , developer of this " pulse oxidation " system , is cagey about specifics , but he says it uses at least 10 times less chemicals per gallon than conventional setups , at a 50th of the cost .
Also helping to keep the water clear are a nonstick plastic liner and the immense volume of the pool itself , which dilutes the concentration of any contaminants .
Do Fischmann 's claims hold water ?
According to Ralph Keller , an expert in industrial hygiene , the principles are sound — for the short term .
" For the first few years , " he says , " it may just be the size of the pool that 's keeping it clean . "
In the meantime , Fischmann 's company , Crystal Lagoons , has been tapped to install half a dozen more super pools for some big backyards in Argentina , Panama , and — of course — Dubai .

5 Things You Didn't Know : The Presidency
Page 1 of 2
according to the January 2007 report from Yahoo !
Search Marketing
Of being the president of the United States , Harry S. Truman said it is " like riding a tiger .
A man has to keep riding or be swallowed . "
An exhibit on the presidency at the Smithsonian puts it another way , saying that the presidency is “ a position for which no training can be adequate , no preparation complete , no counsel sufficient — an office that outstrips anyone 's capacity to negotiate the ever - widening circle of its responsibilities . ”
As an antidote to the monarchies and autocracies of the past , the founding fathers virtually invented the position of a leader elected from the populace .
They laced a series of ingenious checks and balances throughout the entire political system to prevent the president from being able to exercise more power than was considered appropriate .
The job description as defined in Article II of the Constitution is fairly modest but has for the most part been flexible enough to stay relevant after over 200 years of changes and advances , things that were unimaginable to Jefferson , Madison , Hamilton , and the rest .
The following offers five things you may not know about the presidency of the United States :
1- It receives four death threats a day
The Secret Service investigates about 1,500 death threats leveled against the president every year , or around just over four per day .
The Secret Service was not established in time to save Abraham Lincoln ; in fact it was established in the wake of his assassination .
Ostensibly it was created to investigate counterfeit currency and is , therefore , under the Department of the Treasury , and not until the assassination of President McKinley did Congress assign to the Secret Service the job of protecting presidents .
Statistically , the presidency is among the most dangerous jobs in history — of 43 presidents , four have been assassinated , making its homicide rate around nine homicides per 100 .
Compare that to the profession generally considered to be the most dangerous , driving a taxi , in which the rate is around 18 homicides per 100,000 .
2- Its job description lists just six duties
He must take an oath to uphold the Constitution .
He must " take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " as well as " commission all the Officers of the United States . "
He is the " Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , and of the Militia of the several States , when called into the actual Service of the United States . "
He has the " power , by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , to make Treaties . "
He can nominate , with the consent of the Senate , Supreme Court Judges and “ Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls ... and all other Officers of the United States " as well as " receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers . ”
And finally , the president has some legislative pull , since he can " from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union , and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . "
As defined in Article II of the Constitution , here are the duties of the president : To quote the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies , “ You would hardly know from the foregoing that the president of the United States is the most powerful man in the world . ”
Three more things you did n't know about the presidency ...
Olbermann : ' Morbid proof ' Giuliani is exploiting 9/11 Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday September 26 , 2007
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann noted on Tuesday 's Countdown that if you were to attend a Rudy Giuliani houseparty in Palo Alto , CA this week , " you will get morbid proof that despite his denials , Mr. Giuliani is exploiting the events of September 11 , 2001 . "
The admission fee to the fundraiser is exactly $ 9.11 , and the event is titled " $ 9.11 for Rudy . "
The Giuliani campaign has denied knowing about the gimmick but has not denounced it , while Giuliani himself released a two - sentence statement merely calling it " an unfortunate choice . "
Newsweek editor Jonathan
Alter suggested to Olbermann that the campaign would n't have gotten away with something like that in New York or Washington , where people are more sensitive on the subject of 9/11 .
" You really do n't mix events where a lot of people lost their lives with trying to raise money for your campaign , " he stated .
" It 's just really pretty tasteless . "
Alter also noted that " this is just the latest in a series of kind of strange episodes in the Giuliani campaign , " pointing to Giuliani 's apparent stunt of having his wife call on his cellphone while he was speaking before the NRA .
" I think the Onion had it right , " Alter concluded .
" He 's running to be president of 9/11 .
Nobody who 's been a mayor , Keith , has ever gone directly from mayor to president .
...
His springboard is this tragic event , this horrible attack on this country , and there 's something that 's just a little bit tasteless about trying to do that . "
The following video is from MSNBC Keith Olbermann 's Countdown , broadcast on September 25 , 2007 .
It 's a question I ask myself several times a day , usually after using a folding chair as a ladder or cleaning the oven with the burners on .
( Okay , the obvious response is , ' Maybe you 're not all that smart to begin with . '
But anyways . )
The capacity for cluelessness of the clever was the subject of an Idea Festival talk by journalist Laurence Gonzales , who in Deep Survival examined the question of why some people survive crises and others die .
The two questions , he said , overlap : survivors are often those who think deliberately under pressure , while deliberation is what helps people avoid stupid mistakes .
Such mistakes originate , he believes , in the tendency of people to instinctively and thoughtlessly follow already - established mental scripts rather than addressing reality directly .
Of course , such patterns of behavior are what let us move through life without re-learning to tie our shoes every time we leave the house ; to some extent they 're necessary .
And so long as the present resembles the past , this works fine in more complicated scenarios ; but add a few wrinkles , and things go wrong .
Gonzales gave a personal anecdote of piloting a plane on a route he'd taken often before , feeling so comfortable that he did n't register until the last moment a looming thunderstorm that would have destroyed his plane but for a fortuitous radio message that disturbed his reveries .
" We use models and scripts , not the real world ; we operate on the basis of what we learned in a slightly different situation , " he said .
The antidote to this is to pay attention and think deliberately – good , common - sense advice for situations large and small .
But Gonzales might push his own models and scripts a little too far .
Can the Iraq war or Quaker 's disastrous purchase of Snapple ( to use his examples )
really be explained as misapplications of previously held assumptions
\– about the realities of Iraqi politics , or the grassroots ethos of
Snapple drinkers ?
In a sense , yes .
But as a standalone explanation , this just feels too glib , too easy .
On a side note , I asked Gonzales about the recent correlation between reflex control and political tendency , in which the ability to jettison faulty assumptions in a split - second situation was correlated with the ability to do the same on a measured , political level .
Gonzales said he has n't heard of anyone making such a connection , but thinks it 's worth exploring .
( Attention , parents : want your kids to be democrats ?
Just do this experiment and reward them for succeeding !
Want some little republicans instead ?
Do the experiment and punish them . )

If you ’re wondering about your next job , there are a series of Rands articles which might make the transition easier .
First off , there ’s A Glimpse and a Hook , which will describe how managers read your resume .
Then we ’ve got The Sanity Check , which will prepare you for the phone screen .
And finally , there ’s Ninety Days , which sketches out a plan for the first three months of your new gig .
There are two gaping holes in this series of articles .
First , I ’m missing a piece on your interview , and second , there ’s no article about how to negotiate .
I ’m saving negotiation for a later piece because first you ’ve got to convince a bunch of people you do n’t know that they should spend the next three years with you .
An interview is an exchange of information , and the first and best way to screw up an interview is to forget is that it ’s as important for you to gather information as it is to give it .
You may really need this job , and this might give you the impression that the steady flow of people who are parading through your interview room are calling the shots .
And yes , if you let them , they will be , but while they need to learn about you , you need to learn about them .
You need to figure out their Button .
Structure
Before you start pushing buttons , you need to gather a little data about how your interview is constructed .
Is it structured or unstructured ?
In a structured interview , each person interviewing you has a specific topic area : people skills , technical skills , etc .
This means that each interview has a specific purpose and no two interviews that day are going to be alike .
Someone has put in effort to make sure the different interviewers do n’t step on each other ’s toes .
The unstructured interview is a free - for - all .
There ’s an interview list , but no one has been given guidance about what to ask , so they wing it .
With each person who walks in the door , an unstructured interview is a study in personality identification .
More on this in a moment when I explain about interview creatures .
In general , the participants in structured interviews come prepared .
There is a process , which occurred before you showed up .
This might have involved a pre-interview meeting .
They ’ve read your resume and each person is likely capable of carrying the interview .
Unstructured interviewers waste the first ten minutes of the interview doing the homework they should ’ve done before you arrived .
It ’s annoying , but , as you ’ll see , it ’s a great way to figure out what they are about .
As an aside , my preferred use of interview time is a structured - unstructured hybrid .
While I do n’t give interviewers specific topics to cover , I ’ve chosen specific people because I know they gravitate towards certain professional areas such as technical aptitude or cultural fit .
This structural ambiguity means interviewers can creatively adapt their questions to each person while also assuring that I get a complete professional picture of the candidate .
Understanding the structure of the interview process gives you some of your first insight into the organization , but the information does n’t start to flow until you stare at and understand your potential future co-workers .
Interview Creatures
Structured or unstructured , each person who walks into the interview will bring a different agenda .
The sooner you know what their agenda is , the sooner you ’re prepared to handle your only job during this interview .
You need to get them talking .
That ’s right .
Your goal is exactly the same as their goal , which is to learn by getting them to talk .
It might strike you as a bad strategy , because if they ’re talking , they ’re not learning anything about you , but that is not your problem .
In fact , if I get through a round of interviews and the interviewers have done most of the talking , I ’m wondering if I want to work in a group where they have n’t figured out how to vet candidates .
Like meetings , there are different personalities that are going to walk into the interview , and each person has a Button .
When you press this button , they ’re going to be compelled to talk .
Some personalities hide their buttons better than others , but most people have at least one .
Here ’s a list of some common interview creatures organized by increasing difficulty of button discovery .
Pissed Off Pete
Pete ’s agenda is obvious 30 seconds into the interview because he ’s pissed off .
This is n’t an interview ; this is an opportunity for Pete to rant to a captive audience .
He ’s going to go through the motions by bringing in your resume and feigning interest , but all he really wants to do is gripe about “ the situation ” .
The Button : Ask anything .
Does n’t matter , Pete is going to twist the answer so that he can ramble some more about how screwed up “ the situation ” is .
Influence : Low .
These interviews are normally a waste of time and there are two red flags to consider .
First , who thought it was a good idea for Pete to interview you ?
Do n’t they know he ’s a one - trick rant pony ?
Second , why is Pete so pissed off ?
What kind of organization lets
Pete get this tense ?
Perhaps your best tactic with Pete is to spend as much time as possible understanding “ the situation ” .
If it ’s so bad that he ’s going to ignore the opportunity of learning about you , a potential co-worker , maybe “ the situation ” is something you should understand before you consider joining the company .
Even better , asking about “ the situation ” is a great button exploration technique in later interviews .
Chatty Patty
Yeah , Patty ’s here , too .
Again , this is n’t an interview .
Patty loves to talk and the moment you ask anything , she ’ll start and it ’ll be hard to get her to stop .
The Button : Ask any question .
Influence : Like Pete , I have concerns about an organization that puts Patty on the interview schedule .
Unlike Pete , Patty can be a huge source of information , so use the time well .
She ’ll answer any question : “ Why do you love your job ? ” , “ Who ’s a jerk ? ” , “ Why ’s Pete so pissed off ? ”
Given that Patty is going to do most of the talking , her report on you is going to be vanilla and dull .
Do n’t sweat her .
The Poet
This is an advanced , artful combination of Pete and Patty .
Like them ,
The Poet really has something he wants to tell you about , but unlike them , he ’s not going to give it up unless you specifically ask him about it .
He ’s aware of what his job is and that ’s to ask you questions .
The Button : The Poet is sneaky , but he ’s still going to reveal his button via his questions .
What is he asking about ?
Where is he repeating himself ?
“ He ’s an engineer , but he keeps asking interaction design questions .
I wonder what happens if I ask him a question about interaction design ? ”
WHAM .
Pure Poetry .
Listen hard because what ’s coming out of The Poet ’s mouth is important , and he ’s not going to talk for long because , unlike Patty ’s chattiness and Pete ’s pissed - off - ed - ness , he ’s not dedicated to his poetry .
He ’s going to turn it around quickly because he really wants to hear about your poetry .
Influence : Medium .
The Poet is articulate and artful and this will not only color his opinion of you .
The distinctiveness of his report will travel further in the organization than the useless vanilla crap captured by Patty and Pete .
Got’cha Greg
Halfway through the interview day , Greg is going to walk in the room and say nothing .
He ’s going to size you up for ten seconds and then he ’s going to ask , “ How … would you … test a soda machine … in the dark … submerged in strawberry jello ? ”
What ?
Greg is on a power trip .
He believes his job is to confuse you with a dazzling brainteaser .
His belief is that catching you off - guard with this left field question is going to demonstrate whether or not you ’re mentally nimble , but my belief is that Greg mostly just likes to see people squirm .
The Button :
You ’re going to need to first get past Greg ’s question and my advice is to relax and have fun with it .
These types of brainteasers are usually designed to demonstrate your thinking process , so think out loud and when you ’re done , go on a button hunt .
This can be tricky since Greg clearly likes to be on the offensive , but I ’ve found that interviewers who lead with random , huge , bizarre questions are compensating for the fact they do n’t really like having a normal conversation .
So .
Have one .
Influence : Low to medium .
Greg believes his value is high , but it ’s likely the rest of his team know who you figured out with his first question .
He ’s a mental bully .
Slick Steve
Now we ’re getting into some tricky personalities .
Slick Steve is probably not a part of the engineering organization .
He ’s the product manager or some other Marketing denizen .
This means that he does n’t natively speak engineering , but as part of the strategic portion of the organization , he routinely talks to a lot of people , so he can wing it .
He ’s read this article and he knows that you ’re trying to gather information .
He ’s a tough nut to crack .
The Button : Steve is going to completely ignore your attempts to find his button .
“ So Steve , what do you think the biggest challenges are for product marketing ? ”
His response , “ What do you think they are ? ”
Dammit .
You ’ve got to fake Steve out a bit to find his button , and that means getting a little tricky .
Try this : hit Steve with an esoteric engineering question you ’re sure he wo n’t know .
Remember , Steve is slick , which means he wants to maintain the calm , controlled elegance of his interview , so being unable to answer a question might trip him up .
This is why you follow up with a question you ’re sure he ’ll be able to answer .
Ask him that lame marketing challenges question again .
He ’ll answer it this time because he ’s presently feeling ignorant , flustered , and needing to get back his feeling of control .
Like The Poet , Steve is n’t giving up his button easily , but once you ’ve got him talking you have a chance to listen and see if you can find it .
Influence : Medium ?
Steve ’s here and he ’s not an engineer , which means the organization values him .
He ’s here to vet something .
The question is : what ?
Silent Bob
Bob is a button problem .
Bob will sit down , ask his first question , his second question , his third , and you will learn nothing about him except that he ’s silent .
He ’s not going to engage in witty repartee , he ’s literally going to ignore your button exploration questions , and this is going to annoy you .
The Button : Do n’t get rattled .
In my experience , Bob is the senior technical guy on the team and his social skills just are n’t that good .
He ’s there to vet your technical chops and that ’s it .
He has no button .
He ’s not qualified to assess team fit and he knows this , so show him what you ’ve got .
Influence : Very High .
If you ’re interviewing for a technical gig , this is the interview .
This is the one you were losing sleep over .
This is why you bought Dive into Python and read it over the weekend .
No one , other than the CEO , is going to trump Bob .
Good luck .
The CEO
Interviewing with
The CEO is not necessarily an interview with the CEO ; it ’s the interview with the highest - level manager during your interview process .
This is likely the hiring manager ’s manager .
Where ’s the Button ?
Simply put , you need to be prepared for some serious Jedi Mind Shit with The CEO .
The feint ’n ’jab you used on Slick Steve is n’t going to work here .
In fact , the CEO may start the whole interview with , “ What questions do you have for me ? ”
Oh good .
This is going to be easy .
Yeah , it ’s not .
The Button :
As you ’ll see below , the influence of The CEO is extraordinarily high , and like Silent Bob , I want you to ignore your button acquisition activities with this guy .
I want you to talk .
I want you to sell yourself and tell great stories about your successes .
Gather your organizational intelligence in other interviews ; this is your opportunity to sell yourself to one of the major influencers in the organization .
Influence : Very High .
The CEO is going to say that he is n’t the decision - maker .
He ’ll say that the hiring manager is , but it ’s unlikely that if you do poorly with the CEO that the hiring manager will contradict his boss .
A Fresh Perspective
Interviews are exhausting .
Baring your professional soul for multiple rounds of interviews with a bunch of strangers will wear you out and , when you ’re done , you ’ll be wondering , “ What did they learn about me ?
Did I nail it ?
Am I a fit ?
Did I get the gig ? ”
All good questions , but you should also be asking , “ Do I want this job ?
Do I like these people ?
Is it a healthy organization ? ”
By the end of a couple of rounds of interviews , you ’re going to know more about the health of the group you interviewed with than a lot of the people who interviewed you do .
Freaky , is n’t it ?
Fact : all the different creatures you interview with are lost in the day to day of their respective jobs .
The fresh perspective that you have after many hours of interviewing is unique and informative and while you still need Ninety Days to figure out what is really going on , you still have a lot of data .
… if you pushed a lot of buttons .
The government has the legal authority to prosecute journalists for publishing classified information , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said yesterday .
" There are some statutes on the book which , if you read the language carefully , would seem to indicate that that is a possibility , " Mr. Gonzales said on the ABC News program " This Week . "
" That 's a policy judgment by the Congress in passing that kind of legislation , " he continued .
" We have an obligation to enforce those laws .
We have an obligation to ensure that our national security is protected . "
Asked whether he was open to the possibility that The New York Times should be prosecuted for its disclosures in December concerning a National Security Agency surveillance program , Mr. Gonzales said his department was trying to determine " the appropriate course of action in that particular case . "
