Twenty or so years ago I worked for a pharmaceutical company that had a large database of compounds .
That got me thinking about the problem of how to perform lookups based on molecular structures .
If you can find a bunch of numbers that encapsulate the molecular structure then you can use them as database keys .
But you need to ensure that the same molecule entered in two different ways gets mapped to the same numbers , and you 'd like different molecules , such as stereoisomers , or even enantiomers to get mapped to different values .
That got me thinking and around then I came up with an idea for hashing molecules inspired by some of the mathematics I 'd been doing not long before .
I never got around to coding it up but twenty years later it dawned on me that I could easily do it using a similar technique to what I used for untangling tangles and translating trace diagrams .
Anyway , as I 've already given examples of how to translate diagrams to monadic expressions I 'm going to skimp on the details in this post and just talk about things specific to molecular structures .
For this post to make sense you have to understand those earlier posts .
So first comes the usual Haskell preamble : I'm going to be using the vector space monad with a 4 - dimensional vector space .
This type labels the dimensions : n- valent atoms will be represented by functions that consume n- tuples .
We 'll start with a simple hash :
My prime motivation for using Haskell for this problem is that the code was super - easy to write and investigate .
But it 's inefficient .
I 'll talk about how to remedy this properly at the end .
But for now I 'm going to memoise many functions as arrays using atype class with amethod .
So I 'll be usinginstead of > c = memo $ \x -> symmetrise a 4 c' x .* return ( ) Note the use of thefunction .
The idea is that the 4 bonds coming out from ( singly - bonded ) carbon can be thought of as lying at the corners of a tetrahedron .
They have tetrahedral symmetry .
So I 'd like my hash to also have this symmetry so that , for example , .
We can enforce this by summing over all 24 permutations of the arguments compatible with this symmetry , also known as A4 .
Solists all of these permutations : Andperforms the summation :
We can define other molecules too .
Hydrogen is easy : Oxygen has S2 symmetry : You can think of a carbon atom and a hydrogen atom , say , as a pair of arrays cand h , and bonding them together as summation over a shared index .
So methane would be the sum over i , j , k, l = A..D of c .
To this end , define a bond as : We can make Hlike so : makesa bond which we then attach to two hydrogen atoms .
Evaluatingwill give us the hash for hydrogen gas .
Rather than dive straight into CHwe can construct some useful building blocks .
Hydrogen with a bond already attached : I'm using a trailing underscore _ to indicate a free bond .
accepts one bond and returns another .
Once memoised it is , in effect , just a 4x4 matrix and can be used to rapidly build chains .
So here 's code to make an alkyl chain with a free bind at the end .
We can now make alkanes by attaching a hydrogen atom at the end and make methane as a special case :
Now a hydroxyl group
And you can have a drink on me : Carbon double bonds turn out to be straightforward .
We can simply use a pair of bonds : Carbon - carbon double bonds tend not to twist and this is reflected in the hash .
We 'd have to applyif we wanted twistable bonds .
We can make a pre-canned doubly bonded carbon atom pair :
So we can build ethene like this Here 's a methyl group with a free bondSo we can build a bunch more compounds
An interesting problem is building a benzene ring .
Here 's a first attempt with six free bonds :
The problem with that is that benzene rings are special .
The electrons are ' delocalised ' so that the ring has rotational symmetry .
We need to sum over the two consistent ways to assign single and double bonds around the ring .
For the more general case of interlocking benzene rings we must still sum over all consistent assignments .
And some more compunds :
As we might hope , the three different ways to define toluene give the same result .
We also discover that 1,3 - and 1,5 - dimethylbenzene are the same compound ( or at least probably are , this is n't a perfect hash ) .
Now I need to say something about performance .
The above code is naive and performs many unnecessary summations .
For example , hashing a long chain should only take time linear in its length .
But using the above code indiscriminately could give you exponential time .
A good implementation might take a divide and conquer approach : slice the molecule in half through a bunch of bonds , compute partial hashes for each half and then sew the halves together in time exponential in the number of bonds you sliced through .
For the types of molecules I 've seen in real pharmaceutical databases ( say ) this is actually pretty cheap if you 're smart about the slicing .
The hashes in the above code could probably be computed many thousands of times faster .
As it is , you 'll probably need to compile the above with optimisation .
I 'm willing to bet that with small changes , and with suitable choice of matrices over the reals , we can get invariants of molecules that predict physical properties .
These calulations are reminiscent of algorithms for various types of counting algorithm so at the very least they probably compute things that are meaningful from a statistical mechanics perspective .
Incidentally , this approach to stitching together atoms was inspired by an old paper by R. C. Penner on fatgraphs - nothing to do with chemistry .
A few days ago he put a paper online about an application to modelling proteins Update : Since writing this I 've found a name for what I 'm doing .
I 'm converting a chemical structure diagram into a tensor network .
There seems to be lots of literature on how to evaluate these efficiently .
In effect , everything I 've been doing in this blog in terms of converting diagrams to code is an example of evaluating a tensor network .
Now comes the memoisation class : Missing instances fromAnd the same vector space monad I 've used many times before .
Strictly speaking , it 's more like a semiring module monad asis n't a field .
As described in an article published this week in an advance , online edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , the work demonstrates some of the classic principles of evolution .
For instance , research shows that when different species directly compete for the same finite resource , only the fittest will survive .
The work also demonstrates how , when given a variety of resources , the different species will evolve to become increasingly specialized , each filling different niches within their common ecosystem .
Conducted by Sarah Voytek , Ph.D. , a recent graduate of the Scripps Research Kellogg School of Science and Technology , the work is intended to advance understanding of Darwinian evolution .
Using molecules rather than living species offers a robust way to do this because it allows the forces of evolution to work over the course of mere days , with a trillion molecules in a test tube replicating every few minutes .
" We can study things very quickly , " says Scripps Research Professor Gerald Joyce , M.D. , Ph.D. , who was Voytek 's advisor and her coauthor on the paper .
Joyce is the dean of the faculty at Scripps Research , where he is also a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology , the Department of Chemistry , and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology .
On the voyage of the HMS Beagle , Darwin collected and studied different species of finches on several of the Galapagos Islands .
The finches differed in their beak structure — some had thick , strong beaks and others had thin , delicate ones .
Darwin observed that the different finches were each adapted for the specific types of seeds that served as their primary food source .
The big - beaked birds were indigenous to the places where the big seeds grew ; in areas where there were also small seeds , there were also small - beaked birds .
Darwin reasoned that the finches had a common ancestor but had separated into different species — a classic concept in Darwinian evolution known as " niche partitioning , " which holds that when two species are competing for resources within a common environment , they become differentiated so that each species adapts to use different preferred resources .
For several years , Joyce has been experimenting with a particular type of enzymatic RNA molecule that can continuously evolve in the test tube .
The basis of this evolution comes from the fact that each time one of the molecules replicates , there is a chance it will mutate — typically about once per round of replication — so the population can acquire new traits over time .
Two years ago , Voytek managed to develop a second , unrelated enzymatic RNA molecule that also can continuously evolve .
This allowed her to set the two RNAs in evolutionary motion within the same pot , forcing them to compete for common resources , just like two species of finches on an island in the Galapagos .
In the new study , the key resource or " food " was a supply of molecules necessary for each RNA 's replication .
The RNAs will only replicate if they have catalyzed attachment of themselves to these food molecules .
So long as the RNAs have ample food , they will replicate , and as they replicate , they will mutate .
Over time , as these mutations accumulate , new forms emerge — some fitter than others .
When Voytek and Joyce pitted the two RNA molecules in a head - to - head competition for a single food source , they found that the molecules that were better adapted to use a particular food won out .
The less fit RNA disappeared over time .
Then they placed the two RNA molecules together in a pot with five different food sources , none of which they had encountered previously .
At the beginning of the experiment each RNA could utilize all five types of food — but none of these were utilized particularly well .
After hundreds of generations of evolution , however , the two molecules each became independently adapted to use a different one of the five food sources .
Their preferences were mutually exclusive — each highly preferred its own food source and shunned the other molecule 's food source .
In the process , the molecules evolved different evolutionary approaches to achieving their ends .
One became super efficient at gobbling up its food , doing so at a rate that was about a hundred times faster than the other .
The other was slower at acquiring food , but produced about three times more progeny per generation .
These are both examples of classic evolutionary strategies for survival , says Joyce .

GOOD DAY FOR : Mixing business and leisure , after an Australian study found that employees who surf the Internet for personal reasons on company time are about 9 percent more productive than those who do n’t .
The study looked only at workers who check email or Facebook , watch YouTube , read the news , or do other non-work surfing for less that 20 percent of their workday .
“ People need to zone out for a bit to get back their concentration , ” said University of Melbourne researcher Brent Coker , who conducted the study .
( Reuters , in Wired )
BAD DAY FOR : Switching jobs , after the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent , its highest level since 1983 , according to new Labor Department figures .
The U.S. economy shed 663,000 jobs in March , the government said , and those with jobs worked fewer hours : a record low of 33.2 hours a week on average , from 33.3 hours .
About 5.1 million people have lost their jobs in the current recession .

Denmark is very socially progressive — the first country to legalize pornography and same - sex unions — so it 's fitting that a Danish author , Per Holm Knudsen , wrote How a Baby Is Made , an incredibly detailed children 's book that depicts penetration and crowning .

Originally titled The True Story of How Babies are Made , the book was first published in 1973 .

This is a baby .

This is the baby 's parents , both of whom are fond of horizontal stripes .

Mom 's carpet matches the curtains .

The father 's definition of " large " seems relative , if not completely inaccurate , but the mother is OK with that , because the large ones kind of hurt anyway .

Danish kissing is just like French kissing , minus the tongues .

Shrinkage can be a problem for some men , but Danish kissing can take the focus away from the crotch .
Magicians refer to this as " redirection . "

When parents are very much in love , they hang out together in the nude .
Advertisement
Like all the time .
Advertisement
And the vagina in the middle of the father 's chest does n't even freak out the mother .
Advertisement
The father , however , is sometimes freaked out by the mother 's see - thru belly .
Advertisement
But that 's no reason to put on clothes .
Advertisement
After all , passionless nudity is natural .
Advertisement
But when it 's time to go to the hospital , the parents have to put on the clothes they removed nine months earlier .
Advertisement
Because it would 've been weird to drive around naked , even if they do own a hippie love van , and people in town expect that kind of thing from them .
Advertisement
The mother appears unperturbed by labor pains , or the fact that her doctor has blood - drenched shoes .
Advertisement
The doctor nervously grips the candlestick holder that he bought at Ikea , and prepares himself for the worst , in case the baby is evil and needs to be clubbed .
Advertisement
The baby exits the vagina kind of drunk .
Luckily he is n't a violent drunk , but one of those happy drunks who just wants to hug everyone in the room .
The doctor feels relieved about this .
Advertisement
The father , a known nudist , would like to remove his clothing like the rest of his family , but the doctor , whose behavior has been odd , wo n't leave the room .
Advertisement
The family is happy to be at home , and the father is happy to see a breast , even though he is n't the one who gets to suck on it .
Advertisement
Their friends and relatives , although happy about the baby , are not pictured here because they do n't want their names or faces to be associated with any of this .

Real talk .

If you view this sideways , it looks like a tampon exiting a vagina , which is kind of the opposite of a sperm going into an egg .
So this is like one of those optical illusion illustrations on display at the Franklin Institute .
YOU GETTIN ' THIS ? [ 12 oz .

Right now , if you want to understand the state of the art in computer programming , those are your choices as I see them .
Sorry to be so blunt … please do n’t shoot the messenger .
My awakening started when I began searching for a better Java , and found Scala .
Scala had these weird ( in my ignorance ) functional features and learned Scala people often talked about Haskell .
A uni friend Bernie Pope raved about it too .
I took a look at Haskell .
It was n’t a pleasurable experience .
Much of the code was almost incomprehensible .
Half the concepts I ’d never heard of before .
It made me feel stupid , but actually what I was was ignorant .
I say ignorant , rather than innocent , because Haskell has been around for over a decade , and FP much longer .
I still struggle to read most Haskell , and I certainly ca n’t use it to build anything .
But I am starting to get a sense of just how sophisticated it is , and a map of it ’s concepts in my mind .
I began by going down a rabbit - hole , and expected to find a burrow , a community of Haskelliers programming in their own unique way .
Instead , bit by bit Ive realised Ive ended up in a vast cavern absolutely full of stuff I barely even knew existed .
The bit that stirs me up is that this “ stuff ” is n’t , repeat is not , Haskell - specific .
Its rooted in the fabric of our reality , in our mathematics and our problem domains , and bits poke up like the tips of icebergs into mainstream OO languages , their true structure part - revealed .
But rarely in the OO - world have I found such carefully abstracted and subtle techniques of programming in daily use .
Ideas from Haskell & Functional Programming will continue to flow into the mainstream over the next couple of decades .
Innovations will be trumpeted , trends identified , features debated , technologies evangelized .
But personally , Im too curious ( and too lazy a typist ) to wait that long . ,

Jia Jem made a dress out of real meat .
I chose salami because it's thin , keeps in one piece , and is quite cheap , and bacon because it looks very , um , meaty .
I considered somehow vacuum - sealing sheets of meat with those sealers they have on the markets now , but the machines were too expensive for a one - time - only disposeable dress .
I ended up using the K.I.S.S. method of construction , which involved a basic shift dress out of thick cotton .
I layed the meat on top , then put clear vinyl over it and sewed tracks with clear thread .
I used a wide stitch length to avoid perforating the meat to the point it might just … uh , slide down the bottom of the dress .
I also blotted it all before sewing to get rid of as much grease as possible to avoid clouding the vinyl .
Lastly , I made sure to bind the bottom of the dress with a strip of clear vinyl to catch drips .
( I love talking about this ; it 's so disgusting . )
The whole project took about 6 hours , and I kept it refrigerated until the party .
Good times .
Driven by rising health care costs at home , nearly 1 million Californians cross the border each year to seek medical care in Mexico , according a new paper by UCLA researchers and colleagues published today in the journal Medical Care .
An estimated 952,000 California adults sought medical , dental or prescription services in Mexico annually , and of these , 488,000 were Mexican immigrants , according to the research paper , " Heading South : Why Mexican Immigrants in California Seek Health Services in Mexico . "
The paper is the first large - scale population - based research ever published on U.S. residents who travel to Mexico for health services .
It is based on an analysis of 2001 data from the California Health Interview Survey ( CHIS ) , the nation 's largest state health survey .
" What the research shows is that many Californians , especially Mexican immigrants , go to Mexico for health services , " said lead author Steven P. Wallace , associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research , which conducts CHIS .
" We already know that immigrants use less health care overall than people born in the U.S. Heading south of the border further reduces the demand on U.S. facilities . "
Cost and lack of insurance were primary reasons both Mexican and non-Mexican U.S. residents sought health services across the border .
Both " long - stay " Mexican immigrants ( those in the U.S. for more than 15 years ) and " short - stay " immigrants ( less than 15 years ) have high rates of uninsurance : 51.5 percent of short - stay immigrants and 29 percent of long - stay immigrants do not have medical insurance .
" This points to the importance of expanding work - based insurance in health care reform , since virtually all Mexican immigrants are in working families , " said co-author Xochitl Casteñada , director of the Health Initiative of the Americas at the University of California , Berkeley .
Both short - stay and long - stay immigrants have even higher rates of uninsurance for dental care : 77.6 percent and 51.6 percent , respectively .
Not surprisingly , dental care was the most common service obtained by immigrants .
Among non-Latino whites , prescription drugs were the most common medical service obtained in Mexico .
Long - stay immigrants used Mexican health services the most , with 15 percent reporting crossing the border during a year 's time for health services .
Half of these long - stay immigrants lived far -- more than 120 miles -- from the border .
Long - stay immigrants are more likely to be documented than short - stay immigrants , Wallace noted , which makes it easier for them to travel back and forth to Mexico .
Short - stay immigrants -- those most likely to be undocumented -- were also the least likely to need medical care in all areas , with one exception : mental health .
" Undocumented immigrants tend to be younger , stronger and consequently healthier , " Wallace said .
" But they are also the most stressed out , as many are struggling economically , culturally and linguistically . "
Short - stay immigrants who sought treatment in Mexico were more often women and were more likely to tell their doctor they were feeling " sad or down . "
Other findings :
Immigrants who travel to Mexico for health services are not necessarily the poorest .
One explanation :
The cost of travel may offset any financial savings , creating a disincentive for the very poor to travel .
Although cost was the primary factor in seeking health services , cultural and linguistic barriers and immigration factors were also important motivators .
How often immigrants cross the border to Mexico for health services is particularly relevant to efforts to create and expand binational health insurance plans , Wallace said .
Since 2000 , several private insurance companies and at least one employer group have developed such plans , which cover an estimated 150,000 California workers who use Mexican medical facilities near the border .
These plans may be both more cost - effective for employers and more culturally relevant for participants , Wallace said .
" To the extent that binational plans encourage more people to access preventative and other health care , they should be encouraged , " he said .

From The New York Times -- Bush Weighed Using Military in Arrests :
WASHINGTON — Top Bush administration officials in 2002 debated testing the Constitution by sending American troops into the suburbs of Buffalo to arrest a group of men suspected of plotting with Al Qaeda , according to former administration officials .
Some of the advisers to President George W. Bush , including Vice President Dick Cheney , argued that a president had the power to use the military on domestic soil to sweep up the terrorism suspects , who came to be known as the Lackawanna Six , and declare them enemy combatants .
Mr. Bush ultimately decided against the proposal to use military force .
A decision to dispatch troops into the streets to make arrests has few precedents in American history , as both the Constitution and subsequent laws restrict the military from being used to conduct domestic raids and seize property .
The Fourth Amendment bans “ unreasonable ” searches and seizures without probable cause .
And the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally prohibits the military from acting in a law enforcement capacity .

Glenn Greenwald :
Though it received very little press attention , it is not hyperbole to observe that this October 23 Memo was one of the most significant events in American politics in the last several decades , because it explicitly declared the U.S. Constitution -- the Bill of Rights -- inoperative inside the U.S. , as applied to U.S. citizens .
Just read what it said in arguing that neither the Fourth Amendment -- nor even the First Amendment -- can constrain what the President can do when overseeing " domestic military operations " ( I wrote about that Memo when it was released last March and excerpted the most revealing and tyrannical portions : here ) .
Joints and baggies sold at California ’s medical marijuana dispensaries will soon carry a new warning label .
Next to tags like “ Purple Haze ” and “ White Widow ” will be the advisory : Contents may cause cancer when smoked .
On Friday , California added marijuana smoke to its official list of known carcinogens , joining the ranks of arsenic , asbestos and DDT .
Pot brownies , lollipops and other non-inhalables are not affected by the new ruling .
Scientists found the pungent smoke shares many of the same harmful properties as tobacco smoke , warranting its inclusion on the Proposition 65 warning list .
The law requires the state to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity , and businesses and government agencies must post warnings when they use such chemicals or sell products containing them .
“ Marijuana smoke is a mixture of different chemicals , and a number of those were already on the Prop. 65 list , ” said Allan Hirsch , chief deputy director of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment , which made the designation .
From a health perspective , pot advocates say the ruling was not surprising , given the state ’s track record on documenting the harmful effects of all kinds of smoke inhalation .
However , some are worried about its political implications as advocates attempt to legalize recreational use of marijuana .
“ I definitely have concerns about law enforcement and politicians who are n’t in favor of medical marijuana or law reform , who would use this designation to further restrict access , ” said Allen St. Pierre , executive director of NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law , based in Washington , D.C. “ This will be a vexing series of conversations and negotiations . ”
Though marijuana smoke was added to the list Friday , the labeling requirements wo n’t go into effect until June 19 , 2010 .
Only medical marijuana dispensaries with 10 employees or more are required to post a warning either in their shop or on the products themselves .
Violations of the law carry a fine up to $ 2,500 a violation per day .
The panel of scientists at the state Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment reviewed an extensive body of research finding links between marijuana smoke and cancer , particularly head and neck cancers .
“ There ’s not one single piece of evidence that was a slam dunk , ” said Dr. George Alexeeff , ﻿ deputy director for scientific affairs at the OEHHA .
“ But the pieces together form a very compelling argument . ”
The panel did not consider studies showing medical benefits of marijuana , like reducing nausea and restoring appetite after chemotherapy or slowing the progression of glaucoma .
“ Singling out marijuana is gratuitous , ” said Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , who introduced a bill to legalize recreational marijuana .
“ Many , many symptoms of disease can be alleviated through smoking marijuana . ”
St. Pierre says the ruling may factor into the larger philosophical debate about the role public health officials may play in adult choices .
He hopes the national conversation will turn to minimizing the harmful consequences of smoking pot , rather than aiming for a utopian drug - free society .
Because the ruling highlighted the harmful effects of smoking pot , St. Pierre believes it may accelerate what he calls the “ pharmaceuticalization ” of the drug : marijuana pills , arm patches , under - tongue sprays and suppositories .
His organization has even paid for studies showing the benefits of the vaporizer , a device that heats marijuana to a very high temperature to release THC , the active substance in marijuana , in a vapor that is cleaner and more pure than smoke .
“ In years to come , kids wo n’t be smoking blunts or bongs , they ’re going to be vaporizing , ” he said , remembering a young man who recently asked to take his photo with him .
“ He wore a T - shirt that said ‘ Got Vape ? ’ “

The Church of Scientology has launched a deeply creepy advertising campaign .
They 're buying spots on CNN 's Anderson Cooper 360 , and seem to have stolen the ad playbook from their arch - enemies in the pharmaceutical industry .
The ad — it 's new to us , though we 're not sure how long it 's been in circulation — is awash in blue tones and features assorted lost souls struggling with an " unexplainable emptiness that can only be filled by one thing — the truth . "
It looks exactly like an ad for one of the anti-depressants that Scientologists regard as tools of a fascist psychiatric regime .
Except at the end , you do n't get a pitch for Paxil , you get a glowing Scientology logo directing you to the group 's web site .
( For comparison , see this old Effexor ad . )
And it 's been working : According to the rough stat guide of Alexa.com , the reach of Scientology.org has seen a bump in the past month .
Traffic aside , the ad's real purpose is clearly branding :
It 's a slick , well - produced effort designed to position the church as a mainstream provider of spiritual answers and not a cult that relies on the slave labor of children .
It 's certainly miles ahead in that regard from Scientology 's earlier efforts :
They 're learning .
Yay !
I 'm tall enough to see what they ... ... put in the ... ...... ew.

Nano Teddybear , Garden of Eden and other spectacular nanotechnology images
( Nanowerk News )
At the 2008 MRS Fall Meeting last December in Boston , MA , and the Spring Meeting this April this year in San Francisco , CA , the Materials Research Society conducted the sixth and seventh installments of their popular " Science as Art " competition .
Here are some of the amazing images from the fields of nanotechnology that won prizes :
Nano Teddy Bear
The scanning electron microscopic image ( taken using a FESEM LEO 1530 ) shows the ZnO nanostructures on an indium oxide coated glass substrate deposited at 70 oC by using a facile electrochemical deposition technique .
A potentio-/ galvanostat electrochemical workstation ( CH Instruments 660A ) was used to deposit the ZnO nanostructures by amperometry potentiostatically at - 1.1 V ( relative to the Ag / AgCl reference electrode ) and a spiral platinum wire served as working electrode .
An aqueous zinc nitrate [ Zn( NO3 ) 2.6H2O ] solution was used as an electrolyte to prepare these ZnO nanostructures .

Computing Thoughts
The Cathedral and the Pirate
by Bruce Eckel
July 12 , 2009
Summary
The impact of the Google Chrome OS , told through ( probably excessive ) metaphor .
Advertisement
Windows is an enormous collection of design mistakes that work well enough to get by .
Each mistake eventually turns into myth -- after awhile , no one understands the reasoning behind it so everyone begins to believe it was a carefully - considered decision that has deep technical roots and can't be modified for fear of the entire stack falling over .
For years the mythology of Windows has grown and evolved into the cathedral described by Eric Raymond -- filled with rococo curlicues and other tributes to the forgotten gods of past technical decisions .
Along comes Google , the pirate .
It uses a new kind of ship , swift and agile that can dart among the lumbering Microsoft galleons .
The galleons have three and four rows of heavy cannon , but they are too ungainly to turn , and the big guns , so effective when attacking a fixed fortress , can hit nothing ( Apple is far over the horizon during all this , in a high - tech racing sailboat .
It 's just one boat , but it flies ) .
The pirates have no allegiance to history , and no respect for encrusted , senseless decisions .
They take aim at anything that looks interesting , whether or not the monarchy behind the galleons considers it important .
They begin chipping off customers and carrying them away .
The monarchy harrumphs and dismisses the tiny losses with a wave of the hand .
" Mere decoration .
Statistical outliers .
Not important . "
Microsoft becomes accustomed to the petty theft of things it was n't paying attention to anyway .
The initial concern about the pirates is downgraded to annoyance .
After all , the monarchy is vast and entrenched -- really , what could challenge it ?
So the two settle into a weirdly symbiotic relationship ; Google subtly taking over -- and fixing -- things that Microsoft had n't seized with both hands , and Microsoft spasming a bit at each cut , then settling back down and going back to sleep , a water buffalo bothered by mosquitoes .
Google steadily adds fast little ships to its fleet .
A few sink without taking anyone else down .
A few become more powerful , but without seizing control of nearby ships .
They are a loose affiliation , held together only by the web of advertising .
Unfortunately for the monarchy , each interaction with the pirates further convinces it that galleons are the winning solution .
After all , they survive each encounter with insignificant losses , chalked up to a need for minor adjustments .
The right way to do things is to put everything into one basket and then guard that basket .
Microsoft continues to make variations on the same operating system .
Customers pay more and more for virus prevention and removal ( despite virus software , my brother -- who provides IT services to small and medium businesses -- says he spends fully half his time cleaning up virus - infected systems ) .
Google can live with all this , because they are taking over the new , relatively undefended frontier of the internet .
Bill Gates saw the importance of the net and his last grand effort before going philanthropic was to try to wake Microsoft up to the fact that the internet was going to be very important .
The behemoth arose long enough to make a few attempts at creating internet services that looked and acted like desktop applications , tied to the operating system .
But there were too many VPs defending their turf to do anything actually innovative ( some of you will remember when there was a temporary rallying cry -- originating from Gates , I believe -- that Microsoft was all about " innovation . "
This was Gates ' attempt at creative visualization , as in " keep telling yourself you are a thin person , and eventually it will happen " ) .
Amidst all this , Internet Explorer ( IE ) appeared , starting the browser wars .
The fallout was that there were no standards .
Standards were invented by a committee somewhere , mostly out of touch with actually need .
Then there were implementations , and Microsoft felt they could do whatever they wanted in order to leverage the OS ( obviously you do n't want to mess with the crown jewels , obviously you continue to manipulate things to promote the OS , as long as you can get away with it ) .
Nobody correctly followed the non-standard , so all browsers are broken , some are useful .
After endless years of this , Google sees that browsers will never be fixed .
They will always be messed up and require cross - browser fixes within every web application you create , even the simplest ones .
This is one thing I have n't understood : Google 's choice of JavaScript as the client - side programming language .
They 've had to struggle with cross - browser flaws in every application they 've made , so why not use something like Flash to raise the level of abstraction out of the mire of the browsers ?
Or ... you could take a bigger risk and redefine the playing field by creating your own browser , and then implement the most advanced technologies , correctly , or at least the way you want them .
At some point -- you 've got enough clout , after all -- you can start saying " this application will only run properly under Google Chrome . "
And for that matter , you can start shipping Chrome with all the necessary support for offline storage and connection to the operating system services required to create more sophisticated apps .
" Developers , developers , developers ! " will soon start creating their own apps that will only run under Chrome , just because it's the easiest path ( they already know JavaScript , but now it works without pain and they have access to storage and other OS things , but sandboxed so they do n't have to worry about viruses and other corruption ) .
Hmm .
It 's almost starting to sound like an operating system .
And if we solve all these problems through the browser , why not make the browser the operating system ?
Heck , as far as the vast majority of people are concerned , " operating system " means " windowing system , " because that 's what they interact with .
More and more , people begin using computers because of the internet , so the browser is the first thing they encounter anyway -- that other stuff is messy and complicated , while the browser makes sense .
Why not make the browser the primary contact to the OS ?
The timing is perfect .
Microsoft still has no clue how big the Vista disaster really is .
They wo n't until Windows 7 comes out and all the people who were burned with Vista decide just to stick with XP or whatever they are currently tolerating .
Marketing is n't going to fix this one , no matter how hard the folks in Redmond fling vast sums of money at the problem ( the temptation to wade into that river of money will be great ) .
And of course there 's the netbook .
The price of these will continue to go down , especially if the OS becomes less intrusive and requires less processing power .
Most people are using netbooks the way the name sounds -- to connect to the internet .
If Chrome OS has a small footprint and runs on cheap , low - power chips without bogging them down , then the solid - state disk versions of netbooks become more practical and useful .
The timing of the shot across Microsoft 's bow is no coincidence .
Redmond is just starting to crank up the marketing for Windows 7 , and one of the significant improvements is that it actually works on netbooks .
Vista does n't , so Microsoft had to continue to sell XP -- just when they decided to force those darn reluctant customers to upgrade to Vista by terminating XP , along came the disruptive netbooks .
With Windows 7 , Microsoft will finally be able to kill XP .
But two problems remain :
The Microsoft tax adds a lot to the cost of a really cheap netbook , which as I noted , will be getting cheaper .
When the computer costs $ 200 or $ 150 or $ 100 , people really start to notice the extra $ 50 to Microsoft .
Linux has always been the free alternative , but the typical Linux distro includes a lot of stuff that does n't fit ( and is n't necessary ) on solid - state netbooks ( the Chrome OS is built on a Linux kernel ) .
Plus , your grandma or uncle does n't know who Linux is or whether he can be trusted ( after all , he has these wild and crazy free love hippie roots ) .
Google , now , I 've heard of them , and free sounds pretty good .
Unless we 've suddenly switched to a parallel reality in the last cycle of Windows , Windows 7 will require the netbook to have a hard disk .
Google Chrome wo n't , and will work just fine on the solid - state disk versions of netbooks .
Not only that , the solid - state disk versions will boot much faster in combination with the very lightweight Chrome OS .
The combination of cost and dramatic performance difference will make Windows 7 on a netbook look like a terrible choice .
Add to this all the people burned by Vista and buyers will run towards netbooks with Chrome and away from netbooks with a hard disk and Windows 7 .
What 's sad is that there are a lot of really smart people trapped within the Monarchy of Microsoft , doing great work that will never see the light of day ( better than not being allowed to do great work at all , which is no doubt what keeps them there .
But creating things that wo n't be used is soul - sucking ) .
The only " innovation " that comes from Redmond happens when a competitor creates something that gains traction .
Take .NET , for example .
Java tried to be OS - agnostic , and Microsoft was about the OS , so it created .
NET .
In many ways , .NET is a significant improvement over Java .
But it 's not revolutionary as Java was ( by introducing the virtual machine , garbage collection and unified error reporting into the programming mainstream ) .
It evolves Java , but with sometimes subtle and sometimes not - subtle ties to Windows .
Can I program .NET on my Mac ?
I do n't even know , since I could never take it seriously ( every programming conference I attend anymore is almost universally filled with Macs .
If it 's all about " Developers , developers , developers ! " then Microsoft really has n't begun to see the problems yet , stacking up like the traffic in the Greater Seattle area ) .
Microsoft could have taken .NET and created a thin layer of glue onto the hardware , and come up with a really good , robust , and revolutionary OS .
When I mentioned this in a previous blog , a commenter who apparently worked within Microsoft research said that a project like that had been going on and some pieces of it might eventually appear in Windows .
Of course , it could never be put out there as a real OS because it would compete with Windows and someone has too much turf power for that to happen .
Contrast this with Chrome OS .
It 's been pointed out that Android is also being used as an OS , so gasp !
There are two potentially competing OSes from a single company !
Google shrugs and says " yeah , there might be some overlap , but they were designed with different goals in mind so we 'll just see what happens . "
Something that would cause major political battles within Microsoft produces indifference within Google .
Another " innovation by reaction " from Microsoft is Silverlight .
Adobe has been making inroads with Flash and Flex , which produce applications that are browser and OS independent .
Everyone has Flash on their computer -- everyone .
Why does Microsoft need to invent a new system ?
Flash is too cross platform , and does n't help sell OSes , and is in fact becoming its own OS !
This is certainly the first argument that comes to mind , and it's the very one that makes a lot of programmers suspicious that there 's a poison pill buried somewhere within Silverlight so that , in the end , the really interesting things only work on Windows .
I think it 's good that Microsoft created Silverlight , and Sun created JavaFX .
It 's really invigorated Flash / Flex development at Adobe , for one thing , and it promotes the idea that we need to stop wasting our time solving cross - browser incompatibility problems in our applications .
( Disclosure : I consulted for Adobe on Flex for about a year , but that contract ended over a year ago ) .
Now , Google could have created its own RIA platform and made it run on the various different browsers , but they chose not to .
I think this is because , first of all , Adobe already solved the problem and Google did n't seem to see the value of duplicating the effort ( as Sun and Microsoft did ) .
What , really , would it have accomplished ?
But by creating a new browser and expanding its footprint into an OS , Google is moving diagonally .
And note that this " OS " will run just as happily by itself as it does under Windows or MacOS , so it becomes something universal that everyone can learn once and use everywhere -- which makes it viral .
And the best thing is that it does n't matter to Google whether you use Chrome as a browser on your OS , or Chrome as your OS .
( One of the great things about free software is that you can always say " sure , whatever works for you .
It 's all the same to me " ) .
Now take a step back and look at this from the developer 's standpoint .
If you can start assuming that everyone has Chrome in one form or another , and that it supports the leading - edge JavaScript , HTML and CSS -- well , that means you can write powerful code once and run it everywhere .
From a business standpoint the cost savings are compelling .
Far more compelling than paying for endless bug fixes due to cross - browser incompatibilities .
It means the difference between treading water and moving forward two , three , four times faster than your competitors .
The second reason Google made Chrome instead of another RIA platform is branding for trust .
Flash is pretty invisible to most people , which is fine ; for what it does I suspect it 's actually better that it 's invisible -- Java has always had problems becoming ubiquitous because installation and usage were too intrusive for the majority of end users .
But if you want to solve all the messy programming problems created by Windows and the browser wars , you need to get everyone 's trust and imprint it , so that the salesperson can say to the new netbook buyer " this runs the Google OS " and our novice buyer will think " I 've heard of Google and everyone says good things about it . "
( Which , by and large , everyone does ) .
Consider the Windows 7 sale : it starts out adding significant cost to a cheap netbook appliance .
It takes a long time to boot .
And the customer will probably ask about viruses -- they 've certainly heard a lot about those .
The salesperson will say that you can add software to prevent viruses , but such software will be much more interesting to the salesperson as an add - on purchase .
And the customer will also know stories about the escalating virus wars where Microsoft and the virus software manufacturers are constantly trying to plug the leaky dike .
Maybe the customer should just go with the free , super - fast , virus - proof thingy from Google instead .
I do n't see how Microsoft can change .
What you 've got is one of those nets in the jungle ( think " Lost " here ) which springs up and traps people into a hanging ball of bodies .
Take one of those nets and fill it with Microsoft VPs .
The net is constantly pressing them together as they struggle .
No one can see that the net itself is an arbitrary constraint , because it presses everyone into a zero - sum game .
Google comes wandering through the jungle , whistling , notices for a moment the ball of VPs fighting among themselves , and wanders on .
Unfortunately , the only way to fix the problem is for someone to come along and cut through the net , while everyone inside is screaming " Do n 't cut it !
We 'll fall ! "
And of course there would be a fair number of bruises , sprains and some broken bones .
( Important note to Microsoft : I now do management consulting , although prepare yourself for truly outrageous fees , payable in advance .
I can definitely come in and fix your company ) .

Seven Days in May , 2009
13 May 2009
The past week has seen a series of incidents that suggest a mounting crisis within the American state machine .
It is not yet possible to provide a full explanation of these events , but they testify to the extraordinary degree of political tension in official Washington .
On Friday , May 8 , the head of the White House Military Office , former secretary of the army Louis Caldera , tendered his resignation , after an uproar provoked by the still - unexplained decision to have one of the two Boeing 747 jets at the disposal of the White House fly low over Manhattan escorted by an Air Force fighter jet .
The official explanation of the incident — that lower - level federal officials wanted to replenish their stock of photos of Air Force One passing over US landmarks like the Statue of Liberty — is incredible on its face .
It is equally implausible that no one in the chain of command up to Caldera gave any thought to what effect such a fly - by , evoking memories of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , would have on the population of New York City .
On Monday , May 11 , the Pentagon announced that the commander of US forces in Afghanistan , General David McKiernan , had been replaced [ See : " Pentagon changes Afghanistan commander as military ’s crisis deepens " ] .
Whatever the disputes within the military hierarchy over the tactics and methods to be employed in escalating the war in Afghanistan , the summary dismissal of McKiernan is without recent precedent , and undoubtedly will spark bitter recriminations within the Pentagon .
The denunciations of the Obama administration by former vice president Dick Cheney , Sunday on the CBS News program “ Face the Nation , ” and Tuesday on Fox News , are equally remarkable .
In the four months since he and Bush left office , Cheney has dispensed with the usual norms of American political life , which call for the outgoing top officials of the executive branch to show deference to their successors .
Instead , he has mounted a series of full - throated attacks on the incoming Obama administration ’s policies , particularly in relation the use of torture and other anti-democratic methods employed by the Bush administration in the “ war on terror . ”
On Sunday , Cheney came close to accusing Obama of violating his oath of office and betraying the United States of America , denouncing the White House announcement that the Guantánamo Bay detention camp would be closed , and Obama ’s release of Justice Department memos from 2002 and 2005 that provided legalistic justifications for torture .
Citing these decisions , Cheney said : “ That whole complex of things is what I find deeply disturbing , and I think to the extent that those policies were responsible for saving lives , that the administration is now trying to cancel those policies or end them , terminate them , then I think it ’s fair to argue — and I do argue — that that means in the future we ’re not going to have the same safeguards we ’ve had for the last eight years . ”
Two questions should be posed here : What does Cheney know ?
And who does he speak for ?
The invocation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks became the all - purpose justification for the policies elaborated by Bush and Cheney in the name of the “ war on terror ” : wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ; the creation of a worldwide network of secret prisons and torture chambers ; the establishment of a US concentration camp at Guantánamo Bay ; and the systematic violation of the democratic rights of the American people , through the creation of a vast apparatus of domestic spying .
There has never been a serious investigation of the 9/11 attacks , nor in particular of the role played by US intelligence agencies , which had penetrated the Al Qaeda organization and were engaged in surveillance of many of the alleged participants at the time of the attacks .
In harping on the dangers of a new 9/11 , Cheney may well be speaking in the expectation — or with actual foreknowledge — of some new “ terrorist ” provocation being engineered by sections of the American state , with or without the knowledge of the Obama White House .
As for who Cheney speaks for , it is not the conservative “ base ” of the Republican Party , as the uncritical media coverage suggests .
This is a man with the closest ties to the military - intelligence apparatus — former secretary of defense during the first Bush administration , de facto chief of the “ war on terror ” in the second .
It was Cheney who oversaw the Continuity of Government exercises after 9/11 that established a secret government in the proverbial “ undisclosed , secure location ” where he spent much of his time .
His staff supervised the drafting of the infamous “ torture memos ” that Obama released last month under court order , and Cheney directly participated in and led the “ principals ” meetings where specific torture techniques were discussed and ratified by top US officials .
Cheney ’s attacks on the Obama administration clearly demonstrate the contempt for the American people and their democratic rights which characterizes the American financial oligarchy .
At one point in his appearance on CBS Sunday , he told interviewer Bob Schieffer , “ What we ’ve seen happen with respect to the Obama administration as they came to power is they have moved to take down a lot of those policies we put in place that kept the nation safe for nearly eight years from a follow - on terrorist attack like 9/11 .
Dealing with prisoner interrogation , for example , or the terrorist surveillance program .
They campaigned against these policies across the country , and then they came in now , and they have tried , very hard , to undertake actions that I just fundamentally disagree with . ”
[ Emphasis added . ]
Cheney grossly exaggerates the actual change in policies by Obama .
But it is noteworthy that he expresses particular bitterness over the fact that , to even a limited extent in the course of the 2008 presidential campaign , the American people sought to express their opposition to the anti-democratic policies of the Bush - Cheney administration .
The evident hostility of the former vice president to the American people having any influence over national security policy is symptomatic of the attitude that prevails within the entire military - intelligence apparatus , which regards American elections in the same light as elections held overseas : political events to be manipulated , disregarded or suppressed , depending on the worldwide interests of American imperialism .
One right - wing publication , National Review , perhaps inadvertently , called attention to the ominous implications of the Cheney campaign , in a column noting that “ the whole presentation gives off a serious Seven Days in May vibe . ”
Seven Days in May was a best - selling novel of 1962 on the theme of a military coup in the United States .
Its authors were familiar with conflict between the Pentagon and the new administration of President John F. Kennedy , who was assassinated one year after the book ’s publication .
Under conditions of global economic meltdown , two failed wars by American imperialism , and a deepening conflict within the American state , the stage is being set for new political provocations and eruptions of anti-democratic violence from the US military - intelligence apparatus .

A nice little piece of Perl advocacy made the rounds of programming sites the other day .
I recommend Fast , concise and reliable code ?
Try Perl ! ; it 's simple , it 's accurate , and it 's reasonably free of bad advocacy .
Now read the comments on the Reddit Perl advocacy story .
Ignore the grandstanding and Internet - based ruler - wielding contests .
Ignore all of the posts that repeat a 45 year old APL joke ( that was n't funny in the '60s ) .
Ignore all of the posts that pretend that software maintainability has anything to do with the presence or absence of sigils or the ability to iterate over a list more than one way or the requirement to indent your code instead of using braces , because those are the dumbest comments about maintainability and their only value is in identifying people who know so little about what makes software maintainable that you can ignore everything they say on the subject .
Read just the posts that say things like " Why does n't Perl have function signatures ? " and " You know , modules can be hard to install . " and " The default OO system is very minimal . "
Then read some of the responses .
Read them again .
This time take off your I Heart Perl Advocacy hat .
Close your IRC window to #perl on freenode .
Read them one more time .
Are you sick of them yet ?
Good .
Badvocacy
It 's okay to say " Yes , all parameters to Perl functions get passed in a list you must explicitly unpack , but you can write your own validation code . "
It 's not okay to say " You can write your own validation and unpacking code , so it 's not a problem that you must write your own validation and unpacking code . "
It 's okay to say " Here are a couple of good CPAN modules that handle parameter unpacking and validation for you .
They 're efficient and they provide good syntax . "
It 's not okay to say " The existence of those CPAN modules means that it 's okay that after 15 years , Perl 5 still makes you unpack your arguments by yourself or install third party code to do so . "
It 's never okay to say " Why would you ever want to do anything other than unpack your arguments yourself ? "
Perl is a great language .
It has many great features .
Its ecosystem is impressive , and I believe that many of its features compare very , very favorably to other languages and communities .
It 's not perfect , however .
The reference syntax is awful .
The lack of function signatures is embarrassing .
The minimal OO system is too minimal .
Ignoring these problems is bad advocacy .
Dismissing these problems is bad advocacy .
Telling people they 're wrong for wanting good defaults ( this being Perl , of course there are tuning knobs ! ) is hostile and malicious advocacy .
If I were the sheriff of Perl Advocacy City , you 'd end up wailing and gnashing your teeth in the outer darkness for lying to other people about Perl .
There 's no Perl Advocacy City and I 'm not the sheriff .
Even so , we should be honest about Perl .
It is wrong that you have to add two lines of boilerplate code to every module to ask Perl to help you write robust programs .
It is wrong that there is no declarative syntax for parameter passing in the core , 15 years after the release of Perl 5 and several years after the release of the relevant Perl 6 specification .
It is wrong that the default metaprogramming model of Perl 5 classes requires poking in package global variables and symbol tables , and even then method dispatch to overridden parent methods is very , very wrong in certain circumstances .
It is wrong that there is no way in the core to distinguish between methods and functions when performing reflection .
It is wrong that the syntax for defining a class in Perl 5 is to use the keyword package .
Perl 5 gets a lot of things right , but it gets all of these things wrong .
They get more wrong every year that passes .
The Perlian Knot
Why do they remain wrong ?
There 's no single reason ; a big jumble of reasons feed into each other .
Adding new keywords to Perl may be backwards incompatible in some cases , provided that someone actively upgrades to a new version of Perl , does not have adequate testing and change management strategies for existing code , does not read changelogs , is unlucky enough to suffer collisions of ambiguous barewords , and does not explicitly use core mechanisms to give the parser hints as to what 's a keyword and what 's not .
Modifying the Perl 5 core means wading through a big wad of poorly - encapsulated C code strewn throughout with concise and easily confused macros that are n't self - documenting in any meaningful sense .
The Perl 5 core wad of C macros has escaped to the DarkPAN because there 's little enforced encapsulation between even the internal data structures used in the core and what embedders or extenders can manipulate .
There 's a backwards compatibility layer for this big wad of C code intended to run on at least three major versions of Perl 5 , spanning the gap between a release in 2000 and the latest stable major release .
( If the thought of maintaining that does n't make you queasy , you might be the Buddah .
More likely you need psychiatric assistance . )
Despite a specification for the same features in Perl 6 ( and existing implementations for both Perl 5 and Perl 6 ) , no one has taken the time to create a plan to port those features to Perl 5 , or write test cases for them , or identify limitations in Perl 5 as it exists to make certain features difficult , or even suggest a timeframe or milestone plan to implement them .
Some people in the Perl 5 world do n't even want these features .
Despite the fact that refactoring the internals of Perl 5 has been a sore necessity since at least 1998 , if only to provide a stable and well - encapsulated API behind which the guts can actually change , no one has provided a plan by which to do so .
It 's supremely difficult to tell whether a change causes test failures on other platforms because Perl 5 must run on several platforms where people have access to test results once a week ( if not less frequently ) , where getting results is a manual process .
Only a handful of people in the world know the core well enough to start to address some of those problems , and those people have day jobs and do not wish to work on the core full - time even for money .
There 's not enough money to entice anyone who already knows how to work on the core to do the cleanup work necessary to enable other people to work on the core .
Even if there were , there 's little obvious interest in other people in working on the core because there 's little guarantee that any effort put into these areas would be useful .
( Yes , I 'm talking about myself here in part . )
Even if there were hordes of volunteers willing to code new features or fix bugs , it 's not clear that hordes of people are willing to help maintain these features or to stick around to ensure that the bugs stay fixed , especially on all of the platforms they need to stay fixed , especially as people find more and more corner cases that require you to revise code .
Even if there were maintainers , it 's not clear that anyone has the good taste or the time to refactor the system regularly to ensure that it 's clean ( especially as so much of the code is of the " Dear sweet Cthulthu , please do n't touch this ! " variety . )
Even if there were ready volunteers willing to fix bugs and run tests and identify changes which passed several different compilers on several different platforms , there 's still no roadmap .
No one really guides the direction of development .
Even if there were a roadmap , there 's no schedule , so you can't even tell when you 'll be able to use a feature or rely on a bugfix in a stable release .
Even if there were a stable release schedule , the push toward backward compatibility in new code means that you can rarely rely on users having the most recent stable version of Perl available , so you must persist in your backwards compatibility workarounds and hacks until some point in the glorious future when you may be able to remove them and write clean , concise code again ....
... which persists cruft and workarounds and brittle , fragile code that 's difficult to maintain and difficult to understand .
I 'm as guilty as anyone of contributing to this problem .
I 've written a few ( thousand ) tests , wrote a core library , fixed a few bugs , added a couple of features , and had a feature or two shot down ... but the process is hugely demotivating .
I can point out flaws in every programming language I 've ever used ( and that 's a lot ) and design flaws in every programming language I 've ever helped implement ( and that 's a few ) .
That 's not the point .
The point is that Perl 5 is missing some simple features present in almost every other programming language of its class , and the reasons why are not primarily technical .
I 'm not sure how to cut this knot , except to say that Perl 6 suffers far different problems , namely that inventing the future is difficult to do even if we were n't working primarily with volunteer labor .
That 's why I spend precious development time working on Perl 6 and Parrot -- they 're software where I can make a difference .
I wish I could say I could make a difference on Perl 5 , but I 'm not sure I can .
Rodney , an artist / poet / landscaper who also happens to be my wife ’s old boyfriend , got his mobile phone bill the other day and was shocked to see that Echo , his 16 year - old daughter , had the month before sent or received more than 14,000 SMS text messages from her mobile phone .
Yes , Echo has unlimited texting , but among her friends this behavior is n’t unusual and it says a lot about how media habits — good and bad — are changing in our culture .
If a typical month has 30 days that ’s 720 hours , a third of which we ’ll guess Echo spends asleep , giving her 480 hours of texting time per month .
Fourteen thousand texts ( the number was actually higher , but we ’ll round it down for simplicity ) divided into 480 hours is about 29 texts per hour or about one every two minutes .
Since texting is usually a binary activity ( the texter sends a text for every text they receive ) we can guess that Echo writes about 7,000 text messages per month , with writing probably taking twice as much time as reading .
Half an hour at the mall with a stopwatch told me the average teenage SMS message takes about 20 seconds to type ( if you can call it typing ) suggesting that Echo is spending about a quarter of her waking time on texting .
According to both Neilsen and the Pew Internet Life Project , Echo is an outlier , a user of texting at prodigious levels beyond her peers .
A Neilsen study from the second quarter of 2008 , for example , says that mobile phone users age 13 - 17 send or receive an average of 1742 texts per month , which would only require 7.25 hours by my reckoning .
So Echo is an outlier , but on the other hand her data is fresher and texting IS rising at a rapid pace .
So who cares ?
Advertisers care .
Kids who are texting are n’t attending to TV ads while they are doing it , nor are they reading magazines or newspapers ( what are those ? ) .
So advertising is coming quickly to SMS .
TV executives care .
Remember those words “ standard text messaging rates apply ” at the end of every American Idol episode ?
Well for reality television , texting means revenue .
Idol averages 30 million voters per week of which a quarter are using SMS that reportedly yields a nickel per vote to the TV producers .
Seven and a half million messages per week and 12 weeks of voting yields another $ 4.5 million per season for Simon and the gang .
Educators care because texting competes with other activities like paying attention at school and doing homework .
Keeping kids from texting in school is almost impossible .
To really understand the Echo phenomenon , though , you have to appreciate that she ’s a very pretty girl living in a semi-rural area where kids like to complain that there is n’t anything to do .
So they gossip .
If teens twittered , which studies show they do n’t , Echo would be a twitterer because her peers are interested in her life .
And THAT ’s what really makes her an outlier , because Echo is an opinion leader and a trend - setter and SMS — generally a one - to - one technology — is n’t well - suited for that .
So the poor girl has to work really hard to keep all her friends informed , using an antiquated interpersonal communication technology as an ad hoc social network .
What ’s most interesting to me about this phenomenon is the part about teens not twittering .
All the studies show that ’s true but do n’t seem to look for causality .
They miss the simple point that twittering is public behavior ( one - way at that ! ) and texting is private and bi-directional .
An adult or a teen celebrity might twitter but most regular kids see what they are communicating as too private to share with anyone other than the person for whom it is intended , much less any old creep who chooses to subscribe .
And divas like Echo , who might happily embrace a more public channel , are trapped by the tools of their audience .
Girls age 13 - 17 are interested in relationships ( who likes who ) and boys age 13 - 17 , who would normally be interested more in things , also happen to be generally obsessed with girls age 13 - 17 , effectively dragging boys into the sway of SMS , too , sustaining an industry .
There ’s clearly a new product opportunity in here , somewhere .
Andy Hertzfeld tells how Steve Jobs used to argue for a faster - booting Macintosh citing the man-years and lives it would save .
But that ’s nothing compared to the impact some twitter - like hybrid SMS product would have for a girl like Echo .
It could change her life .
Maybe even free up enough time for her to get into Duke .
And as the central node in an Idol - like SMS network , her popularity might even cover some of that Duke tuition , too .
" Conference " spelled wrong on banner at Pat Buchanan - hosted event for " English - only " advocates I 'm not suggesting that not being able to spell ( or edit ) everything correctly makes one a bad person or in any way .
( Maude knows I make enough mistakes around here ! )
I am , however , suggesting that the irony inherent to " English - only " fuckwads of the Moral Majority — whoattach superiority to language — misspelling something on their own banner , , ought to be hilariously embarrassing enough to make them rethink their position .
Of course , in the grand tradition of conservative double - standards , what would be contemptible — and evidence of Everything Wrong With Multiculturalism ZOMG !— if done by a brown - skinned immigrant is just an honest mistake when done by an upstanding member of the Moral Majority .

A design student made a battered old Skoda " disappear " by painting it to merge with the surrounding car park .
Sara Watson , who is studying drawing at the University of Central Lancashire ( Uclan ) , took three weeks to transform the car 's appearance .
She created the illusion in the car park outside her studio at Uclan 's Hanover Building in Preston .
The car is now being used for advertising by the local recycling firm that donated the vehicle .
' Just amazing '
Ms Watson , a second year student , said : " I was experimenting with the whole concept of illusion but needed something a bit more physical to make a real impact . "
She was given the Skoda Fabia from the breaker 's yard at local firm Recycling Lives .
Owner Steve Jackson described her work as " amazing " .
" When I first saw the photos I was convinced it was something which had been done on the computer , " said Mr Jackson .
" But when you look more closely you see the effort and attention to detail she has put into it .
It is just amazing . "
The arrests followed the removal of a structure at an outpost
Ten people have been arrested during a series of disturbances caused by Jewish settlers in the West Bank after Israeli authorities removed an illegal caravan .
Two Palestinians were taken to hospital after settlers threw stones at cars and tried to block a road near Nablus in the northern West Bank on Monday night .
Settlers also set fire to a Palestinian olive grove in the area .
The caravan was part of an " outpost " , a settlement illegal under Israeli law , which Israel has agreed to remove .
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law .
Right - leaning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under US pressure to halt all settlement building and carry out previous Israeli pledges to remove the outposts .
But the settlers , many of whom say they have a God - given right to live in the West Bank , have threatened to impose what they call a " price tag " on such evacuations .
The Human Rights Group Yesh Din said this can include attacking Palestinians and their property " to create a price for each evacuation , causing Israeli authorities to think twice about carrying them out " .
Police did not give details of the incidents in which the 10 arrests were made , but said they were from a series of " disturbances " across the West Bank .
At least 280,000 Jews live in settlements ( with a further 180,000 living in East Jerusalem ) , established in the occupied West Bank with Israeli government backing , in contravention of international law .
Israeli activist groups say there are , in addition , about 100 unauthorised outposts in the West Bank , where Palestinians want to locate their future state .
On Tuesday , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israeli forces were drafting a plan to remove 23 such outposts in one day .
We make too much and buy too much .
But maybe there is a way not to waste too much .

In a closely watched case that could have a broad effect on hiring and promotion policies , the Supreme Court ruled Monday that white firefighters who earned top test scores were the victims of illegal discrimination when the city of New Haven , Conn. , tossed out the results and denied them promotions .
The 5 - 4 decision sent a warning to employers -- private as well as public -- that they could not use their good intentions and concerns about racial diversity as reasons for discriminating against white employees .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the goal of a racially diverse workforce did not justify “ a de facto quota system . ”
The case had been eagerly anticipated not only for its legal significance but for its potential effect on the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor , who along with two other judges on the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected the claims of the white firefighters .
Advertisement
By overturning that decision , the Supreme Court gave new fuel to conservative critics who have questioned Sotomayor ’s fairness .
But her supporters said the close decision showed she was no legal radical .
Civil rights lawyers called Monday ’s decision a setback , but they were not sure how great .
“ There ’s a lot we do n’t know .
This seems to leave employers caught between a rock and a hard place , ” said John Payton , president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund .
He said employers clearly could not follow the example of New Haven and cancel a test based on the results .
But employers can do more to make sure tests are fair .
Advertisement
“ This requires more effort on the front end , making sure in advance that a test is not going to have this disparate impact , ” Payton said .
Since the 1970s , the court has said employers should not use hiring or promotion tests that would disqualify a disproportionally high number of minority candidates .
But the court Monday pulled back from that approach and said employers could not discriminate against white job seekers to avoid a disparate impact on minorities .
“ No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race , ” Kennedy said .
Once an employer has given a test that is fair and geared to the job , it is not entitled to disregard it “ based solely on the racial disparity in the results , ” he added .
The high court ’s ruling is a clear win for the white firefighters .
Though the court stopped short of ruling on constitutional grounds , it said the city violated the firefighters ’ rights under the 1964 Civil Rights
Act and that they were entitled to be promoted .
Advertisement
The decision highlighted the final day of the court ’s term -- and the last day for retiring Justice David H. Souter .
He agreed with the liberal dissenters who said the city of New Haven was justified in setting aside a test that would have kept any blacks from being promoted .
In a poignant moment in the courtroom , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he and his colleagues were sad to see Souter retire after nearly 20 years on the court , but added he understood his wish to “ trade white marble for White Mountains , ” a reference to Souter ’s native New Hampshire .
Souter said he was “ touched more than I can say ” by the kind send - off from his eight colleagues .
For decades , the court has been closely split over whether race can or should play a role in who gets hired or promoted .
In the Civil Rights Act , Congress said employers could not discriminate against anyone because of race , gender or ethnicity .
In the 1970s , however , the court said employers sometimes could give an edge to minorities to make up for a history of discrimination .
Advertisement
Since then , the conflict has played out in many cities in long - running legal battles involving fire and police departments .
“ Municipal lawyers often say that every time a new test is adopted , it generates not just one lawsuit but two , ” said Andrew Pincus , a Washington lawyer who backed New Haven in the firefighters case .
On the one side , blacks and Latinos have sued , claiming that the tests discriminated against them .
On the other side , lawyers for whites have sued when city officials failed to strictly follow test results in awarding jobs .
When New Haven backed away from using the results from its 2003 promotion test , firefighter Frank Ricci and 19 others sued Mayor John DeStefano for racial discrimination .
Advertisement
Kennedy said New Haven ’s officials were wrong to rely “ on raw racial statistics ” as their reason for setting aside the test .
In all , 118 firefighters took the exam hoping for one of 15 promotions to lieutenant or captain .
Kennedy said the test was valid and geared to the skills and knowledge needed by firefighters .
“ The process was open and fair , ” he said .
City officials had no “ strong basis ” for thinking the test was flawed and unfair and , therefore , had no legal basis for setting aside the results , he said .
Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. agreed .
Because the ruling interpreted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , it applies to all employers , private as well as public .
Advertisement
Civil rights lawyers criticized the decision but said it could force needed changes in tests .
“ It might mean less use of these multiple - choice tests , ” Payton said .
“ Who would think the best way to choose a lieutenant with leadership ability is to give a multiple - choice test ? ”
But a former Reagan administration lawyer praised the court for insisting on equal treatment without regard to race .
“ The practical impact of the decision will push employers toward a colorblind policy , ” said Roger Clegg , president of the Center for Equal Opportunity .
“ That ’s a good thing in a country that is increasingly multiracial and multiethnic .
We ca n’t have a legal regime that says people are protected differently based on their racial or ethnic group . ”
In reading her dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared to tweak her conservative colleagues by citing a word used by President Obama .
Advertisement
“ Mr. Ricci and his fellow petitioners understandably attract the court ’s empathy , ” she began .
Senate Republicans have repeatedly criticized Obama for saying he wants judges who can show empathy for those who are vulnerable .
In her written dissent , Ginsburg used the word “ sympathy ” rather than “ empathy . ”
She went on to fault the court ’s majority for ignoring the history of discrimination against blacks and Latinos in the New Haven Fire Department .
In the early 1970s , minorities made up nearly half of the city ’s population , she said , yet just one of 107 firefighters was black .
Besides Souter , Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer joined her dissent .

Tulloch was locked away in his Wandal home early this morning when he heard a terrifying “ crack , crack , crack ” .
He knew exactly what happened .
At about 8.30 am , a 24 - hour police siege ended in dramatic fashion when police were forced to shoot a man armed with a knife , when he charged at them .
Mr Tulloch had been in lockdown since police entered into a stand off yesterday morning with the man , just a few houses away .
In this video he tells of his fear as the siege continued overnight .
He said he heard three distinct gun shots .
The man was immediately taken to hospital for treatment .
It is believed the man went into surgery at Rockhampton Hospital early this afternoon .
At the scene , police Chief Superintendant Steve Gollschewski ( see second video ) told how the incident unfolded .
Senior police from the Ethical Standards Command are on their way to the scene to investigate the incident .

Stand - off puts street in lockdown
I write a lot about Perl 5 and its ecosystem , but I spend most of my hacking time helping with Rakudo and contributing to Parrot .
I realize this leaves me open to charges of hypocrisy ( though what a tired claim ; the only modern sin for which you cannot blame your upbringing , your parents , your diet , society , poverty , or your circumstances is when someone believes your words do not match your actions to a surgical degree ) -- if I know what Perl 5 needs , why do n't I donate my precious time to make it happen ?
That 's a good question , but I want to talk about something else first .
" Just Write it in C ! " is a Terrible Long - Term Strategy
One of my long - term goals in Parrot is to remove as much C code as possible from the project to make it run faster .
This seems counterintuitive to people used to dynamic languages such as Perl , Python , and Ruby .
" If it 's too slow , you can always drop down to C! " , or so the claim goes .
Sometimes that 's even true .
TraceMonkey shows that it's not true ( at least if " fast " is enough and " really fast " is better ) .
Dynamo , HotSpot , Strongtalk , Forth , and Smalltalk are also good sources of inspiration and information -- especially the latter two .
C's overhead for bit - twiddling , character - by - character banging , and dispatch in tight loops is minimal .
If you can coerce your algorithm into C code amenable to perform a lot of work there before returning , your code can get faster with smart use of C .
Of course , if your language has a smart compiler , you 've likely thrown away a lot of chances for optimization : in particular , escape analysis and inlining ( specialized or not ) are difficult , if not impossible .
You also have to pay the penalty of converting between your language 's calling conventions and C's calling conventions .
( You have to run a lot of C code very fast to make this worthwhile sometimes . )
Parrot crosses this C boundary often .
Sometimes it 's okay to write code in PIR ( Parrot 's native language ) that operates a little bit more slowly than the corresponding C code because calling the PIR code is faster than calling C code from PIR code ( or worse , calling back into PIR code from C code called from PIR code , and so on ) .
My goal of removing as much C code as possible from Parrot -- writing Parrot in itself -- is a Parrot 3.0 goal .
Parrot 1.3 comes out next week .
I believe we can achieve all of these goals without stopping the world , scrapping large parts of Parrot , and leaving piles of steaming debris in our wake .
Rebuilding a Charging Locomotive on the Go
How 's that ?
One of the not - so - hidden themes of all of my writings is gradual and inexorable progress in software .
I believe that all Parrot contributors help to improve Parrot with every commit .
( Some commits are regressions and some need further commits , but we 're heading in the right direction and fixing more bugs than we create . )
A lot of projects can say that .
One of the poorly hidden themes in my writings is that backwards compatibility , like a dairy product , has an expiration date beyond which your fridge -- and your project -- gets scary .
I 've written some great code for Parrot and I 've maintained some awful code .
I believe the awful code is less awful for my work , but one of the greatest joys of software development for me is deleting bad code because it 's unnecessary .
The strategy we 've discussed for removing as much C code from Parrot as possible has several phases .
Our built - in data structures -- hashes , arrays , subroutines , et cetera -- are special files written in a mixture of an unnamed language and C .
A series of Perl libraries parses this code and generates a ( much longer ) plain C file for compilation and linking into Parrot itself .
Step one of the plan is to write a compiler using Parrot 's compiler tools that understands this unnamed language and can emit C code equivalent to what the current parser / generator produces .
This step is underway .
Step two of the plan is to develop a new language ( or extend the unnamed language ) that the compiler from the first step can transliterate to C code equivalent to what the current parser / generator produces .
This means that the new language can represent the same operations that the C code in the current language uses .
Step three of the plan is to replace the current Perl 5 parser / generator with the PCT - based compiler .
Step four is to add an emitter to the PCT - based compiler to produce opcodes Parrot understands which perform the same functions that the existing C code perform .
Step five is to remove the C emitter and run everything through the native Parrot instructions .
Although this process has several dramatic changes , only one is visible to users : the switch from writing PMCs in the current mixture of semi- parsed C to writing PMCs in a PCT - hosted language .
Though we can deprecate the C version at step two , we only have to remove it at step 5 .
I believe that this is possible both technically and socially primarily because of the project 's organization :
We have a defined interface with which to write code which interacts with Parrot .
( Admittedly we have n't formalized this interface yet , but that 's in progress . )
We have a documented support policy which notifies users as to our deprecation schedules and defines our backwards compatibility plans .
We have a regular release schedule which , when combined with our documented deprecation and backwards compatibility policy , allows us to refactor and modify Parrot on a predictable schedule at a pace which allows for frequent improvements .
I 'm sure some people could argue -- some of them even successfully -- that these types of changes after a project has reached 1.0 would be unnecessary if we'd only tried to plan the project in more detail years ago .
Perhaps they 're even right .
Yet when was the last project you know of that both tried to do something new and successfully predicted the future such that it needed no architectural changes ?
I do n't mind rewriting code or even writing code I 'll throw away in six months if it progresses toward something better that 's faster , cleaner , easier to understand , easier to maintain , simpler , better designed , and / or more featureful .
Sources of my Unmotivation to Contribute to Perl 5
... which brings me to the long - promised explanation of why I have so much trouble contributing to Perl 5 .
When I posted the final version of the patch to add class { ... } to Perl 5 , I had just finished wrestling with the Perl 5 parser to work around the Perl 4 apostrophe package separator superseded by double - colons and recommended against in Perl 5 .
You may recall the release of Perl 5 in 1994 .
I wrote that patch to Perl 5 because I felt guilty about complaining about Perl 5's flaws ( despite my contributions to Perl 5 , such as they are ) without at least attempting to address them .
I had little hope the patch would be accepted , but I was open to the possibility that someone might say " You know , it does n't break backwards compatibility , it does make boilerplate code easier to read , to write , and to explain to novice programmers , and it is compatible with Moose , MooseX : : Declare , and Perl 6 .
Maybe it'll be a part of Perl 5.12 , if Perl 5.12 ever comes out .
Maybe someone else 'll pick it up and maintain it and argue for it and get it committed to the core .
Meanwhile I can get the urge to fix a memory leak in Parrot or Rakudo , fire up Valgrind , and commit it today for people to use from the stable monthly release next Tuesday ( for Parrot ) and next Thursday ( for Rakudo ) or the packaged release included in free software distributions in July and everyone 's life is a little bit better in days or weeks .
The same goes for improving performance or fixing another bug or adding a feature .
If it 's a big feature or an architecture change or something otherwise disruptive I still have to discuss it with other developers and figure out how it fits with our backwards compatibility and deprecation policies , but if we decide it 's worthwhile , it wo n't languish for years between releases .
The lag between producing something wonderful for other people to enjoy is months at most .
Perhaps people critical of my views are right in that it 's inappropriate to compare Parrot to Perl 5 .
Perl 5 certainly has more users .
Perl 5 has had more contributors .
Several orders of magnitude more people and businesses rely on Perl 5 as it exists now .
Yet I wonder if they 're perfectly happy with Perl 5 as it is -- or do they secretly wish that 5.10 's argument passing performance problem found and fixed in source control three weeks after the release of 5.10 were released in a form they could use , or that Perl 5 had working subroutine signatures , or that Perl 5 had declarative classes , or that strict and warnings were n't optional for all new code ?
The Perl 5 committers are right in that the best way to ensure that there 's a Perl 5.10.1 sometime this year is to fix bugs , to write documentation , and to perform other thankless maintenance tasks .
I hope to write about how to do that and I may do some of it myself .
( Goodness knows I 've done plenty of that for Parrot . )
That 's noble work and it deserves far better praise and far more respect than it gets .
Even though I criticize of Perl 5's project management , I still believe that maintainers deserve much credit and appreciation for their work .
Still , the long - term viability of the project concerns me .
If Perl 5 has a volunteer time and effort problem ( and it 's clear that it does ) , I wonder how many other potential contributors have declined to participate for reasons similar to mine .
( After several people have told me in person that they agree with most of what I 've written but do n't want to say anything in public , I wonder how many other ideas for process improvements the community has lost . )
I take two lessons from this .
First , sometimes it 's easier to rebuild a train barrelling down the tracks than a train stopped in a weedy cow pasture .
I would n't have believed that either before now .
Second , any project management strategy which relies on a sense of guilt to recruit new and prodigal developers has problems no technical mechanism can solve .
New research published in the June issue of the Journal of Dental Research suggests that oral bacteria may contribute to the development of obesity .
Alexandria , Va. -
The world - wide explosion of overweight people has been called an epidemic .
The inflammatory nature of obesity is widely recognized .
Could it really be an epidemic involving an infectious agent ?
In this climate of concern over the increasing prevalence of overweight conditions in our society , investigators have focused on the possible role of oral bacteria as a potential direct contributor to obesity .
To investigate this possibility , the study 's researchers J.M. Goodson , D. Groppo , S. Halem and E. Carpino measured salivary bacterial populations of overweight women .
Saliva was collected from 313 women with a body mass index between 27 and 32 , and bacterial populations were measured by DNA probe analysis .
Levels in this group were compared with data from a population of 232 healthy individuals from periodontal disease studies .
The median percentage difference of seven of the 40 bacterial species measured was greater than 2 percent in the saliva of overweight women .
Classification tree analysis of salivary microbiological composition revealed that 98.4 percent of the overweight women could be identified by the presence of a single bacterial species ( Selenomonas noxia ) at levels greater than 1.05 percent of the total salivary bacteria .
Analysis of these data suggests that the composition of salivary bacteria changes in overweight women .
It seems likely that these bacterial species could serve as biological indicators of a developing overweight condition .
Of even greater interest , and the subject of future research , is the possibility that oral bacteria may participate in the pathology that leads to obesity .

We were surprised last week to see that the GAO has issued a report certifying that , “ As of April 2009 , TSA had generally achieved 9 of the 10 statutory conditions related to the development of the Secure Flight program and had conditionally achieved 1 condition ( TSA had defined plans , but had not completed all activities for this condition ) . ”
Surprised , that is , until we we saw how the GAO had defined ( re - defined ? ) those statutory conditions in ways very different from what we thought they meant , or what we think Congress thought they meant :
Before Secure Flight can be deployed ( except for testing ) , the GAO must certify that , “ ( 1 ) a system of due process exists whereby aviation passengers determined to pose a threat who are either delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights by the TSA may appeal such decision ” .
But the GAO defines “ due process ” as “ redress ” , and then in a footnote says that , “ In general , the term “ redress ” refers to an agency complaint resolution process whereby individuals may seek resolution of their concerns about an agency action . ”
Having thus redefined “ redress ” as requiring only a “ process whereby individuals may seek resolution of their concerns ” , the GAO made no attempt to investigate or report on whether that process actually succeeds in resolving those concerns , does so fairly , or meets the standards of “ due process ” .
But “ due process ” has specific legal meaning , which Congress cannot possibly have been unaware of when they used this term in the law .
Congress ’s intent was clear , and the GAO needs to go back to the TSA and evaluate whether the redress scheme ( in which decisions are made in secret , based on secret evidence , by unnamed non-judges , according to unspecified procedures , with no decision ever communicated to the complainant ) , satisfies the legal meaning of the term “ due process ” .
The GAO must certify that , “ ( 2 ) the underlying error rate of the government and private data bases that will be used both to establish identity and assign a risk level to a passenger will not produce a large number of false positives that will result in a significant number of passengers being treated mistakenly or security resources being diverted . ”
A “ false positive ” in this context is an identification of a passenger by Secure Flight as a risk or threat , when in fact they do not pose such a risk or threat .
False positives could occur in several ways , but the GAO only considered false positives resulting from erroneous matches of names on passenger lists to names on watchlists .
That excludes the equally serious category of false positive identifications of passengers as dangerous resulting from watchlistings of people who are not , in fact , dangerous .
Matching names on lists of passengers to names on watchlists is the easy part .
But that ’s useless if the names on the watchlists are n’t matched to dangerousness , and ( because of identity theft ) names of passengers , especially the dangerous ones , are n’t likely to be matched to the names on passenger lists .
The GAO was supposed to , but did n’t , look at all the types of false positives .
The GAO must certify that , “ ( 3 ) the TSA has … demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of all search tools in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow on / successor programs and has demonstrated that CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow on / successor programs can make an accurate predictive assessment of those passengers who may constitute a threat to aviation . ”
The GAO dismisses this clause of the statue with the following bizarre footnote : “ Condition 3 also requires that TSA demonstrate that Secure Flight can make an accurate predictive assessment of those passengers who may constitute a threat to aviation .
As TSA did not design Secure Flight with this capability , this element of the condition is not applicable to the Secure Flight program . ”
We ’re not sure why the GAO says Secure Flight was n’t designed to be capable of predicting threats to aviation .
We do n’t think it would succeed in that , but that ’s always been what the TSA claimed it was intended for .
It really does n’t matter , though , what the GAO thinks about the TSA ’s intent .
This condition is applicable to the Secure Flight program because Congress said it was so , in the plain language of the statute .
We have no idea why the GAO thought it was empowered to declare the plain language of the law “ inapplicable ” .
The GAO must certify that , “ ( 8 ) there are no specific privacy concerns with the technological architecture of the system . ”
The principal ( and almost the only ) privacy concerns related specifically to the technological architecture of the system are those we raised in our comments and testimony to the TSA , and result from the fact that passengers will be required to provide personal information not to the government but to third parties ( airlines , travel agencies , and other travel companies ) who will be under no restrictions whatsoever with respect to their use of this data .
The GAO makes no mention of these concerns , nor of anything that the TSA might have done to address them .
Whatever the reasons the GAO chose to reframe its task this way , the latest report makes clear that Congress can’t evade responsibility for a clear - cut decision on Secure Flight by handing it off to the GAO .
Congress and the Obama Administration need to give the TSA an unambiguous and unconditional directive , by executive order and / or statute , to abandon the Secure Flight scheme and to subject no - fly decisions to the rule of law .
[ Update : In October 2009 , Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law P.L. 111-83 , the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act , 2010 , which provided funding for deployment and operation of “ Secure Flight ” , without any of the the conditions placed on “ Secure Flight ” spending under previous appropriations . ]

Over the weekend , approximately 190,000 people made their way to Worthy Farm in western England to attend the 2009 Glastonbury Festival .
Attendees came to see performances at what is billed as " Europe 's largest open - air music festival " on many stages over four days - headliners included Bruce Springsteen , Neil Young , and a reunited Blur .
Rainy weather did little to dampen the mood , as attendees enjoyed themselves in tent cities , concert performances , dance tents , and the surrounding countryside of Somerset , England .
Collected here are a handful of images from this year 's festival .

I need at least one i386 installation here at Studio Dave because some production software is not yet 64 - bit ready , and I happen to need that software .
SuperCollider3 can run on a 64 - bit system , but only after some tricky maneuvers ; the label printing programs for my Lightscribe drive are 32 - bit only ; and VST / VSTi audio plugins still work best in a pure 32 - bit system .
My main production machine runs a pure 64 - bit distribution ( 64 Studio ) , but an i386 box is still required for the complete Studio Dave .
The Road To Jaunty
I already have one such system here .
My secondary desktop machine runs the excellent Jacklab Audio Distribution ( JAD ) , based on the rather old OpenSUSE 10.2 .
However , JAD has not been updated for a while , and I need an up - to - date distro .
The 64 Studio developers also make a 32 - bit " legacy " version of their product , but I wanted to try a new flavor .
Enter Ubuntu Studio .
I 've already chronicled my recent experience with Ubuntu 8.10 ( Intrepid Ibex ) .
Given the overall hassles I encountered then you might wonder why I returned to any variety of Ubuntu .
Well , the most recent Ubuntu Studio is based on the latest Ubuntu 9.04 ( the Jaunty Jackalope ) , with a tested realtime kernel , so I thought it might be a good time to revisit the system .
I planned to install Ubuntu Jaunty on my notebook , an HP G60 machine with an AMD64 Turion X2 CPU , 3G memory , and a 250G hard disk .
Video is handled by an integrated nVidia 8200M GPU , on - board sound is managed by an nVidia chip based on Intel 's HDA codec .
I had already installed Ubuntu 8.10 on the machine , but I decided to install Jaunty from a DVD .
Turns out that was not such a good decision , and thus began my most recent series of trials and tribulations with Ubuntu .
I downloaded the ISO images for the i386 and x86_64 Jaunty installers , checked their md5 sums , and burned them to DVD discs .
As noted , I especially wanted the i386 version so I tried installing it first .
Everything went along nicely until I received an error message that stated that the installation had failed at the Select & Install Software stage .
I retried that step via the installation menu , but it failed again .
I then tried moving on to the next step of installing grub , but the installer failed again with the same non-specific error , only this time for the grub step .
I tried to back out of that step but the error message would n't close .
Fortunately I could still access the installation menu , so I opted to abort the installation .
I tried the installation again , this time with the x86_64 installer , and had exactly the same experience , i.e. the same errors at the same stages .
At that point I was left with a hosed partition and no usable Jaunty .
At least the installer did n't hose my 64 Studio partition and I could still boot into that system without problems .
After some research I discovered that indeed the DVD installers are flawed in some way , though the md5checksums were correct and the media integrity checks reported no problems with the discs .
I searched Google and figured out that I would have been better off to have simply upgraded from my Intrepid installation , so I re-installed Ubuntu 8.10 and went directly to its Update Manager .
I clicked on the big button that said " Upgrade to Jaunty " and let the network installer do its thing .
After a while my notebook had a brand new Ubuntu Jaunty system ( kernel 2.6.28 -11 - generic ) , so I rebooted , logged in , and started to organize the system for eventual use as the base system for Ubuntu Studio .
First , I installed the latest nVidia driver from the Hardware Drivers panel .
I rebooted , but no nVidia splash screen appeared .
The nvidia - settings utility said that the nVidia driver was not in use and advised running the nvidia - xconfig program to correctly set up X for full graphics hardware acceleration .
I ran the config program , rebooted the machine , and this time the nVidia splash screen appeared signalling that all was well with the nVidia hardware .
I had attained Jaunty status .
On To Ubuntu Studio
At the next stage I added all the Ubuntu Studio meta packages .
These packages are simply lists of the software required by the specialized distribution .
For example , the audio package includes a good selection of audio - related software , along with a 2.6.28 kernel optimized and patched for realtime performance .
After these packages were installed I rebooted , selected the rt kernel from the grub menu , and soon encountered the next batch of troubles .
The first problem occurred when the system stalled at the Ubuntu Studio logo display .
However , on reboot the system made it past the logo screen and I finally arrived at the login prompt , complete with an apparently working nVidia driver .
I logged in , looked around for a while , then exited and restarted .
Once again I made it to the login page , but after I logged in the system froze completely as soon as the Ubuntu workspace appeared .
By " completely " I mean that the mouse and keyboard were unresponsive .
I had to press the power switch to shut down the system .
Not a good outcome .
I rebooted with the normal system kernel ( non-realtime ) , logged in , and experienced the same problem .
My first thought was to blame the closed - source nVidia driver .
I did some research on Google and the Ubuntu forums , and I soon discovered that other users had reported the same tribulations on machines with non-nVidia graphics chipsets .
The consensus was that the problem did not lie with the video subsystem .
To verify that consensus I followed an interesting suggestion .
Since I could get to the graphic login screen I could also switch to a console display where I could log in at the terminal prompt .
I installed the OpenSSH server software , logged on to the machine from a desktop box , and used X forwarding to verify that the system was there and viable .
Programs ran happily with their GUIs intact , so it seemed that nVidia was off the hook with regards to my basic problem .
Following suggestions found in my research I added these kernel boot options to the realtime kernel 's entry in / boot / grub / menu.lst :
nosmp acpi=off pnpbios=off
Incidentally , the acpi option required the pnpbios option .
When I booted with only the nosmp and acpi options the boot loader issued a fatal error message that advised using the pnpbios=off setting , I tried it , and voila , the system was now open and available for business .
I logged in without troubles with either the mouse or keyboard .
At last I could start to explore Ubuntu Studio .
Alas , my expectations were quickly soured when I tried running QJackCtl .
It failed to connect to the JACK server , and I was pretty sure I knew why .
As it turns out , I was correct .
The problem was Pulseaudio .
Resolving The Pulseaudio Problem
A word or two about Pulseaudio .
The normal Linux desktop wants a sound server for various purposes such as system alerts and support for regular sound applications such as media players .
As with some other aspects of Linux we now have too many solutions for that purpose , and the result has been a very messy affair .
Developers are faced with an embarrassment of choices , and those choices are most certainly not equal in capabilities or intended purposes .
As a result , confusion reigns when it comes to Linux sound servers .
Pulseaudio attempts to resolve many issues , but in doing so it has become an issue itself .
Pulseaudio itself is not necessarily a bad or even problematic thing .
However , its implementation can be very problematic indeed .
As I said , I could at last boot into Ubuntu Studio .
However , the alsamixer utility showed only two active audio channels ( master volume and I forget what else , sorry ) .
No other controls were present as far as I could tell .
Following another bit of advice I looked into the depths of / var / log / user.log and found a stream of these errors :
pulseaudio[ 3519 ] : alsa - util.c : Cannot find fallback mixer control " Mic " or mixer control is no combination of switch / volume pulseaudio [ 3519 ] : alsa - util.c : Cannot find fallback mixer control " PCM " or mixer control is no combination of switch / volume pulseaudio [ 3519 ] : alsa - util.c :
Device plug : front : 1 does n't support 44100 Hz , changed to 48000
Ubuntu Studio employs Pulseaudio as its default sound server .
Unfortunately this employment stands in the way of directly using JACK , and any Linux distribution that advertises itself as an audio production system will assuredly be using JACK for its audio server , not Pulseaudio .
The typical solution would simply remove Pulseaudio , but Ubuntu does n't let that happen without removing the GNOME desktop , a rather drastic operation .
Worse , the Pulseaudio daemon is persistent , so killall pulseaudio works only until the next call to the audio system , when the daemon reloads itself and remains in the way of a successful launch of JACK .
Fortunately I discovered an excellent HOWTO titled Keeping The Beast Pulseaudio At Bay by a user with the handle of idyllictux .
Thanks to his instructions I safely disabled Pulseaudio , and I recommend his advice to anyone who wants to put aside Pulseaudio .
By the way , I want to emphasize that I have nothing against Pulseaudio per se .
Its developers have taken on a terribly difficult task , and I believe that they are working hard to make it the system sound server of preference for the mainstream Linux distributions .
However , it does not currently suit my purposes , and its current implementation in Ubuntu creates problems for me .
The advice from idyllictux resolves the matter nicely .
Perhaps his suggested process could be offered as a configuration option to the advanced user ?
Until the problem is resolved on the distro side I 'm afraid that Pulseaudio will take heat from users who are unaware that the problem may occur because of the distribution 's implementation of the server , not with any particular aspect of Pulseaudio itself .
More Configuration Trickery
My experiences with Ubuntu Intrepid taught me a few other tricks that were necessary before I could be happy about this new Jaunty - based Ubuntu Studio .
I removed the network manager ( easily done with the Synaptic package manager ) and set up the default network device ( eth0 ) for autoconnection via dhcp at system start - up .
I disabled HAL polling on / dev/sdb and / dev/ sr0 , neither of which were listed in /etc / fstab .
The polling was causing an xrun every 2 seconds ( verified with the top utility ) .
I turned off my machine 's touchpad , but only after discovering that the solutions I used for Intrepid no longer worked with Jaunty .
Thankfully , the solution was this simple one - line addition to /etc/rc.local :
modprobe -r psmouse
Shazam , no more random touchpad irritations .
By the way , in case anyone was wondering why I did n't just use the administration tool for the mouse / touchpad :
No tab or other dialog was present for controlling the touchpad , so I was left to manually reconfigure the thing .
A more serious problem presented itself when I discovered that JACK would not start in realtime mode .
Surprisingly , Ubuntu Studio does n't automatically create an audio group , so I had to open the dialog at System -> Administration -> Users and Groups , create the group , and add myself to it .
I also had to edit /etc / security / limits .conf to add these instructions :
@audio - rtprio 99 @audio - nice - 19 @audio - memlock unlimited
I restarted the system , logged in , configured and started QJackCtl , and behold , I was in realtime heaven .
Figure 1 shows the settings I use for 8 milli-seconds latency with no xruns from my Edirol UA25 USB audio / MIDI interface .
Figure 1 . QJackCtl settings for the Edirol UA25
By the way , the Ubuntu Studio Preparation Web page is an indispensable resource at this stage .
The information there is clearly presented and should be required reading by anyone new ( or even not so new ) to Ubuntu Studio .
The specified changes are recommended for every high - performance audio distrbution , the figures come straight from the JACK devs , so why is this step relegated to the user ?
It seems a simple enough matter to have the installer make the entries during the system configuration .
Ditto for the creation of the audio group , it should be prepared by the installer and the user should be added to it automatically during configuration .
Moving On , At Last
After all that , I finally had a fully - functioning Ubuntu Studio on my HP G60 ( Figure 2 ) , complete with stable low - latency audio performance , an excellent selection of sound and music production software , and support for nVidia accelerated graphics .
I like to build my own software from source packages , so I proceeded to install the necessary boatload of dev packages , the build - essential meta package , and anything else needed for the complete Linux software development environment .
As previously reported , my first project was the rc2 release of MusE 1.0 , and I 'm very happy to write that the build finished without complaint , installation was a breeze , and MusE 's performance was rock - steady during my initial tests .
Figure 2 . Ubuntu Studio 9.04
The Verdict
I 've only started to dip into the various goodies provided by the Ubuntu Studio meta packages .
I 'm eager to check out the latest LMMS and Pd , and I plan to use the machine as my main platform for working with SuperCollider3 .
Thanks to the currency of the system I can build and test the latest Ardour3 as well as many other applications that require up - to - date graphics and audio components .
Performance - wise this system is now a beauty .
Alas , the hoops I jumped through to get it into this condition were many and formidable .
The solutions to my problems were not too difficult to find or implement , but they would be extremely challenging for users unfamiliar with the inner workings of Linux .
In my opinion the Ubuntu Studio installer needs to go further in its preparation of the system for pro-audio needs , perhaps offering the user a choice between a high - performance desktop media playback system , a low - latency pro-audio production environment , or some stable mixture of both .
The Pulseaudio problem ought to be easily resolvable by the user , and more system probing might be able to spot and resolve problems such as needless HAL polling .
It 's worth pointing out that my experiences may not be typical because of the hardware involved ( it 's a fairly new machine ) , and you should expect your mileage to vary , hopefully towards the better .
I 'd like to hear from other Ubuntu Studio users , so please feel free to add your opinions to the Comments section below .
In closing , I want to thank the users and developers who populate the Ubuntu Forums , I definitely needed and heeded their help and advice .
Thanks also to the regulars on the Linux Audio Users mail list , from whom I continue to learn so much .
I had a stretch of rocky road to traverse , but the way was made easier with such excellent company .

IAN O'RIORDANjoins Greg LeMond on a bike ride in Clare as the former Tour de France winner takes him on whirlwind spin of his extraordinary career
HE ARRIVES at Doonbeg Golf Club in the late afternoon .
His transatlantic flight was badly delayed .
He has n’t slept in two days .
His wife and three kids got in yesterday .
Now they ’re missing .
And the first thing Greg LeMond does is start unpacking his bike .
He spreads out the different parts in the main courtyard .
Frame , wheels , handlebars , saddle .
A few golfers pass by looking bemused .
Is n’t that the famous American cyclist ?
Before Lance Armstrong came along ?
With one small wrench he has the bike assembled in five minutes .
“ LeMond ” is written along the white frame and forks .
He leans it against the wall ; it gleams in the sunshine .
“ Best way to deal with the jet lag , ” he says with a smile .
“ Go for a bike ride . ”
Story of Greg LeMond ’s life .
Best way to deal with his prodigious sporting talent ?
Go for a bike ride .
Best way to handle his Attention Deficit Disorder ?
Go for a bike ride .
Best way to cope with his fame ?
Go for a bike ride .
Best way to recover from his near fatal shotgun wound ?
Go for a bike ride .
Best way to manage his depression ?
Go for a bike ride .
Only in recent years has he realised this was the best way of dealing with the abuse he suffered as a 13 - year - old growing up in Washoe Valley , Nevada .
Go for a bike ride .
These days it ’s the best way to deal with his increasingly bitter litigation battle with team Armstrong .
Go for a bike ride .
Story of Greg LeMond ’s life .
If only it were an uncomplicated as going for a ride .
“ Have you got a pump ? ” he asks .
“ I forgot my pump . ”
THE THREE - TIME winner of the Tour de France , the man who introduced professional cycling to the joys of time - trial handlebars , aeroframes , wind - tunnel testing , heart - rate monitors , Oakley sunglasses and Giro helmets , has forgotten his pump .
I ’m tempted to say no and let him ride on flat tyres .
That might even things up .
“ Ha ha , right , ” – and we head off along the magnificent coast .
A tour of the west Clare countryside which LeMond discovered last year .
He could n’t get enough of it so he ’s back for more , basing himself at Doonbeg where he can share in his other passion outside of cycling : golf .
Maybe it ’s the weather , maybe it ’s where he is , but straightaway he ’s disarmingly open , utterly unpretentious .
“ Hey , you ’re a little skinny , ” he says .
I ’m thinking he looks a little heavy .
He ’s two days shy of his 48th birthday but his powerful , athletic frame is still as striking as that Kennedy - like smile .
So is his competitive spirit .
“ I know some nice little hills up this way , ” he says , setting the pace .
There is no reason for him to be so generous with his time .
Story of Greg LeMond ’s life .
When the organisers of this weekend ’s BDO Get Back Challenge in Doonbeg asked him to lend his name to their event – a fundraiser for cancer care and activities for disadvantaged children – the one condition was he could ride some of the way .
He ’s good fun , as we say over here .
The real deal , as they say over there .
I ’m looking at him on his bike , thinking he still fits it like a glove .
A few miles later I ’m wondering if I ’ll last the pace .
I can barely keep up .
With his conversation , that is – as over the next hour he takes me on a whirlwind tour of his extraordinary career .
He does have a tendency to wander , but he never once pauses for breath .
Retelling stories he ’s told countless times , still with childlike enthusiasm .
How he first comes to Europe in 1978 , age 17 .
How a year later he wins the World Junior road race title .
How two years after that , courted by Bernard Hinault and celebrated directeur sportif Cyrille Guimard , he ’s racing professionally in the peloton with Renault - Elf - Gitane .
“ My French was pretty crude .
Still is .
So I actually spent more time in Belgium .
Plus they had BBC . ”
How in 1983 , age 22 , he becomes the first American to win the World Championship .
And how he takes to the Tour de France : 1984 , third – best young rider ; 1985 , second – beaten only by Hinault , his team leader ; 1986 , first – again the first American champion , this time leaving Hinault in his wake .
That ’s the kind of sporting talent he was blessed with .
That ’s also why LeMond never needed to play around with doping , and why – almost unique in professional cycling – there is zero evidence he ever did .
“ I was beating the East Germans at age 18 .
Beat them all .
None of the teams I rode with ever had any organised doping .
Whatever riders did take , they took on their own .
I did n’t need to .
But I do n’t think it made a big difference .
Because no one was dramatically better .
For athletes , placebos are very powerful .
Give a rider an aspirin and say its go - go juice , and they ’ll feel great .
“ The problem is that every rider has their own ego .
It became a vicious cycle .
If someone was better , they did n’t want to admit he ’s just better .
They believe it ’s something else .
Like , what ’s he on ?
Riders will take anything because they think somebody else is doing it .
It became like an arms race .
The landscape changed so much .
It became a science , and suddenly endocrinologists , haematologists were leading the way in training .
Not physiologists .
It just became a different animal . ”
It ’s a subject we ’ll return to later .
Out past Doughmore Bay it ’s too beautiful a setting for such serious conversation .
So I ask him about being shot .
He points to right side of his back .
“ A complete accident .
Bang .
I just felt bad for my brother - in - law .
It was his first time hunting .
But you know , maybe it was a mixed blessing .
I ’d been pushing my body so hard , non -stop , for nearly 10 years by then .
Maybe I needed that break , to come back and do what I did after . ”
EASY TO SAY that now .
Not so easy then .
It was April 1987 and he was two months away from defending his maillot jaune .
And he was 15 seconds away from dying .
He was saved by a primitive mobile phone , a police helicopter and a nearby hospital that specialised in gunshot wounds .
When the shell exploded about 40 lead pellets ripped through his back and legs , and into his small intestine , liver , diaphragm and heart lining .
The surgeons could only remove a few of them , and 37 pellets remain exactly where they ’re not supposed to be .
For several weeks after he could n’t walk across the room .
It should have finished him as a professional cyclist .
Instead , he won back his maillot jaune in 1989 , famously surpassing Laurent Fignon by a mere eight seconds in the final time trial down the Champs - Élysées .
Next time he did defend it , in 1990 , by over two minutes , despite not winning a stage .
With that the conversation gets serious again .
Just a few weeks ago Fignon revealed he has advanced pancreatic cancer .
He ’s the same age as LeMond .
He won the Tour in 1983 and 1984 .
He may only have months to live .
So he ’s put out a book about his life , Nous Étions Jeunes et Insouciants – We Were Young and Carefree .
In it Fignon admits to taking amphetamines and cortisone shots during his career .
He twice failed a drugs test .
No one can say for sure this contributed to his cancer .
LeMond ’s face immediately saddens .
“ It makes you think about how short life is .
I had dinner with him at last year ’s Tour .
I ’ve always liked Fignon .
People think we ’re bitter enemies .
But we ’re not .
We were team - mates .
He was different to the other riders .
He was a thinker .
“ He ’s thinks now that the drugs he took may be related .
But I do n’t think anything Fignon was on is related to cancer .
I mean , he was on the baby aspirin .
It was always a wink , or a joke , at dinner table .
‘ Ca n’t wait ’ till the Tour is over , and we do n’t have to feel pain anymore ’ .
The problem was the criterion races , which came after .
They were all fixed , and kind of disgusting .
But they were even more painful , because you ’re racing flat out .
“ So you have to understand why amphetamines got there .
In the ’50s and ’60s , they were n’t considered cheating .
They were considered taking care of your body .
Like a soigneur .
Then there was the transition , where it became illegal , and there was drug testing .
But there was still the leftover through the ’70s and ’ 80s .
“ Also , talk to any psychiatrist with a brain and he ’ll tell you Type A personalities are in cycling .
They come into cycling because it calms their brain down .
But the thing about cycling is that it creates depression .
It ’s natural to seek a stimulant to get out of that .
And that can become highly addictive .
It ’s not performance enhancing .
It ’s just the beginning of the end . ”
The end , certain cyclists would admit , came sometime around 1990 , when a newly - discovered drug aimed at treating kidney disease flooded the sport : erythropoietin .
Better known these days as EPO .
It became not just the drug of choice but the drug of necessity .
LeMond thinks so anyway .
He rode the 1991 Tour and took seventh , but three years later he could n’t even finish .
Something had changed .
Riders he would normally drop without breaking sweat were sticking with him .
Several more were further on up the road .
He reckoned he was just burnt out .
He retired .
“ We should probably head back , ” he says .
“ I like to push myself , still , but I got to be careful these days .
I found that a couple of years ago , when I started back riding a lot more .
The more I pushed myself , the worse I felt .
I ended up in the Mayo Clinic for a week , last year , doing some tests .
The problem , we think , is those lead pellets .
When I push myself now , the body goes catabolic , and that leaks some lead into my system .
I ’m going to have to get them taken out .
I do n’t know .
That ’s a big operation . ”
We shower and agree to meet in the Doonbeg Lodge , overlooking the first tee .
I tell him I ’ll bring along my tape recorder , get some stuff on the record .
“ None of this , ” he says , “ is off the record . ”
I ’m just not sure what he can say about Lance Armstrong .
Turns out he has plenty to say .
INEVITABLY THEIR careers became entangled .
Armstrong won the World Championship in 1993 , the first American since LeMond .
In 1996 , he overcame cancer .
A survivor , in his own way , like LeMond .
And in 1999 , he won the Tour , his first of seven , and the first American since LeMond .
Shortly after that LeMond questioned Armstrong ’s association with the Italian doctor Michele Ferrari , and his alleged doping practices .
Since then any relationship between Armstrong and LeMond has gone from bad to worse .
It could be seen as just personal .
Except it ’s not .
It ’s about business .
It ’s about fighting for what you believe in .
LeMond started his own bicycle company in 1990 , then two years later signed a deal with Trek .
They would manufacture and distribute the bikes and sell them under LeMond ’s name .
But by 2001 , when LeMond raised his concerns about Michele Ferrari , by far the biggest name on Trek ’s books was Lance Armstrong .
LeMond , under pressure , retracted , but the fall - out was only beginning .
Eight years later it ’s headed for the courts ; LeMond claims Armstrong , as a way of getting back , was responsible for Trek ’s neglect of his line of bikes , which ended the deal completely last year .
“ Believe me , I want to walk away from this , ” he says .
“ But right now I ’m suing Trek .
I ’m really not the litigation type .
I do n’t even want to say disparaging things about Lance , because I do n’t think he ’s worth it , really .
“ He ’s starting to paint me as disillusioned , unstable .
Now that I realise Trek is over and I do n’t have a gag order I ’ve been a little more outspoken .
But I have n’t just been talking about Lance .
The guy has an obsession with me , somehow thinks when I talk about drugs , rehabilitations , I must be talking about him .
That ’s not a good sign .
“ Why ca n’t we have an open , intellectual debate about it ?
They want to shut everybody down who talks about it .
What I do n’t get is , I make comments about cycling in general , about doping , and he always relates them to him .
I ’m not talking about him .
I ’m talking about the sport in general .
“ It ’s all just made me aware of how really corrupt the world of cycling has become .
I ’m just amazed at how many peoples ’ morals are for sale .
It ’s just a matter of price .
They ’re trying to take everything away .
My business , my reputation .
But I am a fighter .
And I will go down in flames . ”
If LeMond has learnt one thing from the doping mess that has crippled cycling , has somehow become a stronger person because of it all , it ’s the importance of being honest with yourself as much as everyone else .
About coming clean .
For most of his life he told nobody about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of an old family friend sometime around 1974 .
Until he could n’t keep it in any longer .
In a twisted way , what convinced him to speak out was a phone call from Floyd Landis , the third American to win the Tour , in 2006 .
Landis was about to be stripped of that title for failing a drugs test , and LeMond pleaded with him to tell the truth .
That keeping it secret , like he did his abuse , could destroy him .
What happened next was even more twisted , as Landis ’ business manager tried to scare LeMond from testifying in the doping trial by pretending ( in a phone call ) to be the man that abused him as a kid .
As traumatic as this was , it proved to LeMond how sick the sport had become .
“ Because of what happened to me as a kid , the abuse , I was trying to please everyone .
Trying to do the right thing .
Maybe some people thought I was naive .
But it ’s the same with the riders right now .
I know they do n’t want to be doing this .
They ’re like lab rats .
That ’s why I ’ve likened it to somebody who is being abused .
They think they ’re willing participants , but they ’re not able to make that adult , long - term decision .
And when they ’re 45 or 50 they ’ll look back and go , ‘ God . . .’
“ It ’s one thing harming yourself .
I ’ve done stuff I ’m not proud of .
Tried recreational drugs .
It ’s another thing when you ’re consciously manipulating , and trying to cheat other people .
That to me is a big difference .
I see Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton as tragic stories .
Marco Pantani as well .
I know some people look on them as the problem .
They ’re not the problem .
“ They ’re tragedies of the rules not being implemented .
Who makes sure the rules are implemented ?
The governing body .
There are some big efforts being made , but it only takes one person to mess it up .
There should be no questioning when it comes to implementing the rules .
There is enough good science now to get 98 per cent of doping out of the sport .
“ It ’s just like what happened on Wall Street lately .
If you have the fox guarding the hen house .
It ’s about a trust system .
Nobody trusts anybody .
Some people are trying to make a living doing it the right way .
Some people are trying to get away with murder .
So you lose trust .
Cycling has mimicked that . ”
It ’s a sad way to end an extraordinary day with an extraordinary man .
Next Saturday , LeMond will head to Monaco for the start of the 96th Tour de France .
“ I do n’t even know if I want to be there , ” he says .
“ Last year I was a little more hopeful , and then . . .
I mean , right now , would I get back involved with professional cycling ?
No .
Would I like my kids to get involved with professional cycling ?
No way .
For me , it ’s a lost cause . ”

July 17 , 2009  -- U.S. intelligence officials were caught " off - guard " by the Friday terror attacks against two U.S. - based hotels in Jakarta , Indonesia .
A senior U.S. official told ABC News the attacks came as a " surprise . "
A second U.S. counter - terrorism official said the CIA and other intelligence agencies had given no indication to the White House of " any threat reporting in the last 18 months " involving the Indonesian al Qaeda affiliate , Jemaah Islamiyah .
" Any suggestion that the CIA has not taken the JI threat seriously in recent years is wrong , " said a CIA spokesman .
" No one from the CIA has ever said that this terrorist group was completely down and out . "
U.S. officials had been confident that the group had been dismantled after almost of all its leaders were killed or captured in a joint operation involving Indonesian , U.S. and Australian personnel .
" They were quiet but they were n't dead , " said former White House counter - terrorism official Richard Clarke , an ABC News consultant .
" They were just playing dead . "
U.S. law enforcement officials today said two male suicide bombers were responsible for the attacks on the Ritz Carlton and Marriott hotels in Jakarta .
Both bombers had registered as guests at the respective hotels two days ago .
The officials said the attacks were scheduled on a Friday , the Islamic holy day , when most Muslims would likely have been at prayer .
There were no immediate claims of responsibility from Jemaah Islamiyah but they are considered the group most likely to have carried out the attacks given their past history in the region .
" They wanted to send a sign that they are alive and well , " said the former U.S. ambassador to Indonesia , Robert Gelbard .
" This attack comes shortly after the re-election of the country 's president who is committed to fighting Jemaah Islamiyah and al Qaeda . "
In voting earlier this month , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won a majority of votes and avoided a run-off in his effort to be elected to a second five year term .
" He has been very effective in making the commitment to not only go after them but also in instituting a wide set of reforms , " said Ambassador Gelbard .
Jemaah Islamiyah 's most senior commander , known as Hambali , was captured in Thailand in August 2003 shortly after he claimed responsibility for an earlier bombing at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta .
He is currently being held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo .
Jemaah Islamiyah
The group 's second - in - command was recaptured last year after escaping from a prison in Singapore .
" The lesson here is that unless you take out all of the leadership , a group like this will continue to operate , " said Clarke .
" Every root and branch has to be taken out for the group to be truly dismantled . "
Indonesian , U.S. and Australian authorities are now focusing on the group 's remaining leader , Noordin Top , who is considered a charismatic recruiter , financier and bomb maker .
He was reportedly trained in explosive at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the late 1990s .

Government subsidy stripped from ‘ naked news ’ program
TOKYO ( TR ) –
The government subsidy afforded to SKY PerfecTV satellite porn channel Paradise TV for providing sign - language assistance within its naked news feature will stop next year , but the unique program will continue , according to officials from the station .
“ Hadaka no Shuwa News ( Nude Sign Language News ) ” is a short segment within the channel ’s “ Nude News Station , ” which is broadcast each Friday between 9 p.m. and 9:55 p.m .
“ Hajime Shimajiri was the original director of the show , ” said spokesman Shinichiro Fukuyama of Paradise , whose wacky programming in the past has featured the making of brownies from the breast milk of lactating mothers and the peddling of silicone love dolls live on the air .
“ He set his mind to creating a new style of news – something that nobody else was doing . ”
With content originating at bath - side , in which a caster undresses as she runs through the day ’s events , or next a weather map , where a forecaster ’s clothes will be pulled off seemingly by a raging snow storm , “ Nude News Station ” integrated the five - minute “ Nude Sign Language News ” program starting in 2004 .
It began with a fully clothed sign - language signer making motions in a corner of the screen to supplement the main anchor , in the buff , reading the news in the center .
The sub -program “ One Point Sign Language Lessons ” gives instruction on various colloquial terms and phrases , such as “ hand me your penis ” and “ do n’t look at my breasts , ” which requires the signer to make two large sweeping motions with both hands in front of her chest .
To reinforce the learning process , the text of the phrase appears on the bottom of the screen and the actions are repeated multiple times .
For “ Nude Sign Language News , ” the tasks of the current signer , Miyabi Fujino , have recently expanded in both scope and size .
Instead of a fringe role off to the side of the screen , the actress is seen in the full frame delivering the news while disrobing in between motions .
“ At first , it was very , very difficult , ” recalled the spokesman of the show ’s beginnings .
“ It took us one year to find a girl who could do sign language and take off her clothes simultaneously . ”
Further complicating matters , Fukuyama explained , was the fact that the first anchor found it troublesome to accurately sign the rather crude terminology in the lesson segment .
Help came via social networking Web site Mixi .
Four months after the program started , Paradise searched through the site and found a deaf graduate student who agreed to teach the girls the ropes in sleazy signing .
Applied for a subsidy
About two years ago , Paradise applied for a subsidy through the Broadcasting Programming Center of Japan .
The center has a contract with the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology ( NICT ) , which is funded by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications .
NICT can pay up to half of the production costs for adding features to benefit visually - or hearing - impaired viewers .
Thus far Paradise has received 150,000 yen for broadcasts that began in September last year and concluded in March this year .
This October 250,000 yen will be provided for broadcasts running through the end of March 2008 .
After that the subsidy will cease .
This month the Ministry modified the subsidy allotment program to restrict adult content .
Paradise , however , has no intention of stopping its sign - language stripping .
The program is now employing its second instructor and fourth sign - language presenter .
“ We have received so much positive feedback from people who work with the disabled , ” said Fukuyama .
“ They have encouraged us to keep going . ”
Paradise TV does not take pride in having played a key role in changing government policy , but it does feel overjoyed to have connected with a new audience .
“ We are very proud that a lot of people have begun to think about the sexual desires of disabled people , ” said Fukuyama .

Obama 's campaign for health care reform by this fall , once considered highly likely to succeed , suddenly appears in real jeopardy .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO How Obama could lose health fight
President Obama 's campaign for health care reform by this fall , once considered highly likely to succeed , suddenly appears in real jeopardy .
Top White House advisers , especially chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , are still privately predicting massive changes to the health care system in 2009 .
But for the first time , Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the administration are expressing frank worries about stronger - than - expected opposition from moderate Democrats and worse - than - expected estimates for how much the plan could cost .

Business groups , which had embraced the idea of reform and have been meeting quietly with Democrats for months in an effort to shape the legislation , now talk of spending millions of dollars to oppose the latest proposals out of Capitol Hill .
And Democrats themselves are not united , with leading party figures making contradictory declarations about how far they should go to overhaul the system when deficits are soaring and prospects for an economic recovery remain cloudy .
And top Democratic officials tell POLITICO they are increasingly pessimistic about getting any more Republican votes than they did on the stimulus package , with some aides referring to the idea of a bipartisan bill as " fool 's gold " — an unattainable waste of time .
“ This was always going to be messy , ” said a senior administration strategist .
“ It got messy faster and earlier than people thought .
But none of it is anything that ’s going to stop it . ”
Emanuel is anxious for the president to sign the new law by October so that Democrats have a year to campaign on it ahead of congressional midterms , aides say .
Administration officials concede the new kinks in the schedule make that harder .
It has been conventional wisdom Obama would overcome a sluggish start by congressional Democrats to win approval of his plan this fall — perhaps even backed by a notable number of Republicans .
But there is a growing list of reasons this conventional wisdom could be wrong :
Money troubles
Public anxiety about red ink — muted during this winter ’s debate over an economic stimulus package — has come roaring back , with a Gallup Poll showing deficits and spending as the only issues where more people disapprove of Obama ’s performance than approve of it .
Republicans think the “ borrow and spend ” issue may be the biggest single vulnerability for Obama and the Democrats in the midterm congressional elections of 2010 and the presidential year of 2012 .
The president ’s own advisers privately agree .
That ’s one of the reasons Obama is emphasizing what he calls “ savings ” — otherwise known as cuts — that would help pay for his plans .
That is why Democrats admit that it was a public relations disaster this week when the Congressional Budget Office issued a report this week concluding , from a partial draft of a Senate health committee bill , that the plan would cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years but only provide coverage for 16 million of the estimated 50 million Americans who are uninsured .
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , a member of the health committee , said on Fox News Thursday that he considers the CBO finding “ a devastating blow to the administration ’s plan . ”
Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) now says Democrats will need to come up with a bill that costs less than $ 1 trillion — but many liberals say it would be meaningless to do something that small and leave so many people still uninsured .
A crowded stage
Everyone has big ideas for changing the health care system — and many lawmakers have waited years , in some cases their entire careers — to put their stamp on it .
That ’s why you have clashing Democratic ideas from Obama , Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( Mass . ) , Baucus , Rep. Henry Waxman ( Calif . ) and many others .
Democrats say they sorely miss the constant presence of Kennedy , chairman of the health committee and longtime champion of the issue , who has retreated to Massachusetts as he battles cancer .
Some worried officials say Kennedy would never have allowed the strategic blunder of submitting the incomplete health committee bill for CBO scoring , which produced estimates that have been a public relations nightmare .
Without Kennedy to mediate Democratic infighting , Obama and his top aides are going to have to do it .
But based on the lessons learned from the disastrous White House micromanaging of health care under President Bill Clinton back in 1993 , Obama ’s aides are holding off for now , letting Congress find its own way .
“ It ’s too soon to be cracking heads , ” said one administration official .
At some point they will probably have to be more immersed in the deal making because there are many moderate Democrats who are cool to many of the ideas pushed by Obama and their congressional leaders .
False hope
For most of this year , it has appeared that Obama and business interests were searching for common ground .
But this was always somewhat of a charade .
It was in the political self - interest of Obama and the business community to go through the motions of working together — even while reserving the option to go to war .
As details have emerged , business groups that had sounded supportive are suddenly openly critical , with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce referring to the Senate health committee blueprint as “ a dangerous proposal ” in an e-mail to members .
Insurance companies see an existential threat in Obama ’s plan to include an option for government coverage , even though the administration says it is not meant to drive the industry out of business .
But health finance experts believe such a plan would inevitably drain dollars from the private - sector market .
It is virtually impossible to sketch out a plan that can pass a Democratic Congress — and contain some version of a public option for insurance — that will not provoke a major backlash among the best - funded business groups .
This means millions of dollars in TV ads warning of government attempts to control and ration care .
Recognizing the need to woo an increasingly skeptical public , House Democrats on Friday afternoon plan to release — in conjunction with their draft health reform bill — a new pitch called “ 12 Ways Health Care Reform Will Help You and Your Family . ”
The House Democrats ’ description paints a utopian picture : lower costs , including more affordable monthly premiums , an annual cap on out - of - pocket expenses and “ an end to rate increases based on preexisting conditions , age or gender ” ; “ greater choice ” and “ peace of mind ” so that job and life choices do n’t have to be based on insurance considerations .
“ No more denial of coverage for preexisting conditions like diabetes , cancer or heart disease , ” a late draft of the document says .
“ More family doctors and nurses entering the work force at better payment rates . ”
Big bang backfire
The White House ’s “ big bang ” theory of proposing a raft of landmark legislation all at once is giving way to fears of a “ big chaos ” backlash .
Congressional chairmen saying that the pipes are overloaded between health care and climate legislation — and that was before this week ’s arrival of the biggest overhaul of financial regulations in 70 years .
And do n’t forget Congress needs to fit in work on all of its annual spending bills and take a month off in August .
This mad rush of legislation is posing fiscal and tactical problems for Democrats .
They simply do n’t have the money to change the health care system , overhaul the energy sector and increase domestic spending as part of the appropriations process — without imposing big tax increases or exploding the deficit .
Something has to give .
Even if they did , the gears of Congress move slowly .
Any or all of these proposals could easily jam them up .
To keep the pressure on , the Democratic National Committee embarked this week on a major fundraising campaign for a “ Summer Organizer Program ” that will hire hundreds of staffers for Organizing for America , the new name for the Obama campaign ’s grass - roots organization .
The plan is to build a summer grass - roots campaign around health care , an effort strategists believe will later morph into Obama ’s reelection army .
“ Please donate whatever you can afford to support the campaign for real health care reform in 2009 , ” pleads an e-mail purporting to come directly from “ President Barack Obama . ”
“ The campaign to pass real health care reform in 2009 is the biggest test of our movement since the election . …
To prevail , we must once more build a coast - to - coast operation ready to knock on doors , deploy volunteers , get out the facts and show the world how real change happens in America .
The enemy smells blood
Republicans did a poor job of trying to stop the economic stimulus bill earlier this year , in part because they were confounded by a popular president with very few obvious weak spots .
Obama remains popular , and his ideas for fixing health care remain more popular than the Republicans ' .
But Obama ’s vulnerabilities are starting to show .
Public concerns with heavy government spending are rising .
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found more people want the focus to be on deficit reduction , not new spending to boost the economy .
The public is also expressing unease with the government ’s increasing role in the economy .
Republicans have a lot of practice in warning voters about socialized medicine and government - mandated rationing , and the NBC - WSJ poll suggests these warnings could work again .
Republicans came out with the outlines of their own plan this week .
But few will pay attention to a health care plan by the out - of - power party that has zero chance of becoming law .
They know they win by Obama losing .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
In developing countries , young women ’s use of modern methods of contraception is limited by a range of factors , a review of seven studies conducted in five countries suggests .

Lack of knowledge , access problems and side - effect fears were the “ overarching themes ” limiting the women ’s use of hormonal contraceptives such as the birth control pill or hormone implants , Dr. Lisa M. Williamson of the MRC Social and Public Health Sciences Unit in Glasgow and her colleagues report .
The studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia and asked young women about their views on contraceptive use .
Results showed that overall , the young women had gotten very little information on sex or contraception , and the information they did get was frequently misleading .
For example , one young woman thought she only had to take the birth control pill before having sex .
The belief that hormonal methods might impair future fertility was widespread .
In five of the studies , young women said they were reluctant to use modern contraceptive methods because they perceived them as intended for married women .
Some feared that health clinic staff would treat them poorly or not help them .
Many women also feared having others find out they were using contraceptives , because they would be known to be having sex , or thought of as being unable to bear children later on .
In four studies , women said their partners would pressure them or even use violence to prevent them from using contraception .
Generally the young women reported having an easier time accessing condoms , but many saw them as methods for preventing sexually transmitted infection , rather than as a contraceptive , and associated them with disease and promiscuity .
For these reasons , many of the women relied on traditional birth control methods , such as charms and herbs , or even aspirin and antibiotics .
Women in Tanzania and Nigeria considered abortion to be an option in the case of unintended pregnancy , with one study saying the procedure was much less dangerous than using birth control pills .
However , abortion is only legal in these countries to save a woman ’s life .
Illicit abortions carry serious risks of their own , Williamson and her team note ; there are 20 million unsafe abortions each year , and 70,000 deaths related to such abortions annually .
Lack of knowledge and access may be the easiest problems to address , Williamson said .
Efforts must also be community - wide to help address negative perceptions of contraceptive use and to encourage older women , as well as younger women , to consider using modern methods , she added .
Interventions also need to be “ youth - friendly , ” Williamson said , and should help young women build the life skills they need to take control of their reproductive health .

An effort on the scale of the Apollo mission that sent men to the Moon is needed if humanity is to have a fighting chance of surviving the ravages of climate change .
The stakes are high , as , without sustainable growth , " billions of people will be condemned to poverty and much of civilisation will collapse " .
This is the stark warning from the biggest single report to look at the future of the planet – obtained by The Independent on Sunday ahead of its official publication next month .
Backed by a diverse range of leading organisations such as Unesco , the World Bank , the US army and the Rockefeller Foundation , the 2009 State of the Future report runs to 6,700 pages and draws on contributions from 2,700 experts around the globe .
Its findings are described by Ban Ki-moon , Secretary - General of the UN , as providing " invaluable insights into the future for the United Nations , its member states , and civil society " .
The impact of the global recession is a key theme , with researchers warning that global clean energy , food availability , poverty and the growth of democracy around the world are at " risk of getting worse due to the recession " .
The report adds : " Too many greedy and deceitful decisions led to a world recession and demonstrated the international interdependence of economics and ethics . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Although the future has been looking better for most of the world over the past 20 years , the global recession has lowered the State of the Future Index for the next 10 years .
Half the world could face violence and unrest due to severe unemployment combined with scarce water , food and energy supplies and the cumulative effects of climate change .
And the authors of the report , produced by the Millennium Project – a think - tank formerly part of the World Federation of the United Nations Associations – set out a number of emerging environmental security issues .
" The scope and scale of the future effects of climate change – ranging from changes in weather patterns to loss of livelihoods and disappearing states – has unprecedented implications for political and social stability . "
But the authors suggest the threats could also provide the potential for a positive future for all .
" The good news is that the global financial crisis and climate change planning may be helping humanity to move from its often selfish , self - centred adolescence to a more globally responsible adulthood ...
Many perceive the current economic disaster as an opportunity to invest in the next generation of greener technologies , to rethink economic and development assumptions , and to put the world on course for a better future . "
Scientific and technological progress continues to accelerate .
IBM promises a computer at 20,000 trillion calculations per second by 2011 , which is estimated to be the speed of the human brain .
And nanomedicine may one day rebuild damaged cells atom by atom , using nanobots the size of blood cells .
But technological progress carries its own risks .
" Globalisation and advanced technology allow fewer people to do more damage and in less time , so that possibly one day a single individual may be able to make and deploy a weapon of mass destruction . "
The report also praises the web , which it singles out as " the most powerful force for globalisation , democratisation , economic growth , and education in history " .
Technological advances are cited as " giving birth to an interdependent humanity that can create and implement global strategies to improve the prospects for humanity " .
The immediate problems are rising food and energy prices , shortages of water and increasing migrations " due to political , environmental and economic conditions " , which could plunge half the world into social instability and violence .
And organised crime is flourishing , with a global income estimated at $ 3 trillion – twice the military budgets of all countries in the world combined .
The effects of climate change are worsening – by 2025 there could be three billion people without adequate water as the population rises still further .
And massive urbanisation , increased encroachment on animal territory , and concentrated livestock production could trigger new pandemics .
Although government and business leaders are responding more seriously to the global environmental situation , it continues to get worse , according to the report .
It calls on governments to work to 10 - year plans to tackle growing threats to human survival , targeting particularly the US and China , which need to apply the sort of effort and resources that put men on the Moon .
" This is not only important for the environment ; it is also a strategy to increase the likelihood of international peace .
Without some agreement , it will be difficult to get the kind of global coherence needed to address climate change seriously . "
While the world has the resources to address its challenges , coherence and direction have been lacking .
Recent meetings of the US and China , as well as of Nato and Russia , and the birth of the G20 plus the continued work of the G8 promise to improve global strategic collaboration , but " it remains to be seen if this spirit of co-operation can continue and if decisions will be made on the scale necessary to really address the global challenges discussed in this report " .
Although the scale of the effects of climate change are unprecedented , the causes are generally known , and the consequences can largely be forecast .
The report says , " coordination for effective and adequate action is yet incipient , and environmental problems worsen faster than response or preventive policies are being adopted " .
Jerome Glenn , director of the Millennium Project and one of the report 's authors , said : " There are answers to our global challenges , but decisions are still not being made on the scale necessary to address them .
Three great transitions would help both the world economy and its natural environment – to shift as much as possible from freshwater agriculture to saltwater agriculture ; produce healthier meat without the need to grow animals ; and replace gasoline cars with electric cars . "

Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed that Manchester City 's latest signing Emmanuel Adebayor was " desperate " to join Manchester United or Chelsea instead , and contacted both clubs even after he had agreed his £ 25 m move to Eastlands .
Speaking to The Observer , the Manchester United manager – who also dismissed City as " a small club with a small mentality " – said the striker tried to engineer an alternative move away from Arsenal even as the transfer to City was being finalised .
" At the last minute , from what I can gather , either Emmanuel Adebayor or his agent phoned us after they had agreed a deal with City and then did the same with Chelsea .
He was desperate to get to either Chelsea or us . "
Ferguson , speaking in Malaysia during United 's pre-season tour of the Far East , claimed that Adebayor 's move , and those of other high - profile players who have joined City this summer , was motivated by money , not ambition : " When someone offers you that kind of money , it 's a big attraction to people nowadays .
That is the reason they have gone there . "
The 25 - year - old said that " silverware and trophies " were behind his decision to join Mark Hughes 's side , but Ferguson does not think City will challenge , saying signing the likes of Adebayor , Roque Santa Cruz and Gareth Barry may be the sum total of their success this season .
" Do you know what City 's biggest triumph is ?
It 's getting those players there .
I do n't know if they will do anything with them , " he said .
" It is not easy to get into that top four so the biggest success of all is to just get the players there .
" There will be three teams to beat .
Ourselves , Liverpool and Chelsea will be very close together …
The one who has the challenge this season is Arsène .
He does n't have the money and how he uses the £ 25 m from Adebayor will be very , very interesting , " he said of the Arsenal manager .
Continuing his attack on City , Ferguson also suggested that Hughes has focused too much on attack in his spending spree .
" For all the buying they have done , they still have to pick a team with balance .
That wo n't be easy for Mark .
What 's he got , 10 strikers ?
So if he picks a squad to go to Chelsea he has to leave seven behind , or five at least . "
One of those strikers is Carlos Tevez , whose move to the blue half of Manchester prompted City to erect a billboard sporting an image of the Argentinian with the message " Welcome to Manchester " – a stunt Ferguson dismissed as typical of the club 's mentality .
" It 's City is n't it ?
They are a small club with a small mentality , " he said .
" All they can talk about is Manchester United , they can't get away from it ...
They think taking Carlos Tevez away from Manchester United is a triumph .
It is poor stuff . "
While far from the focus of his historic Cairo speech today , President Barack Obama ’s comments on America ’s history with Iran have caused something of a stir , as he became the first sitting US president to publicly admit to America ’s role in the 1953 coup in Iran .
“ In the middle of the Cold War , the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government , ” Obama admitted , referring to the CIA ’s role in the coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq after he nationalized the Iranian oil industry .
The US and British governments supported a coup d’etat in 1953 to ensure Western control over Iranian oil production .
Iran remained under the control of the Shahist government until the 1979 Iranian Revolution , in which the current government ceased power .
In the 30 years since the revolution , the US and Iran have had a hostile relationship .
In the 1980s this led to the US and Britain supporting the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein as a regional opponent to Iran .
The US provided Iraq with considerable support during the eight year long Iran - Iraq War .
This culminated on July 3 , 1988 , when a US warship attacked an Iranian civilian jetliner which it claims to have mistaken for an F14 fighter plane .
The attack killed all 290 passengers aboard Iran Air Flight 655 .
Admiral Crowe , the Joint Chiefs chairman at the time , said the US “ deeply regretted ” the killings .
As Iran faces a hotly contested presidential election this month , the prospect of improved ties with the US looms large , if somewhat tempered by a long history of distrust and repeated comments from US officials saying they do n’t really expect negotiations with Iran to settle anything .
Still , for the first time in 30 years the possibility of somewhat normalized relations seems real .

The video I posted last year has been completely removed from the internet .

After the smashing success of some promotional Team Fortress 2 videos , we thought it was time to ' meet the movie - makers ' at Valve and see how far this thing is going to go .
Advertisement
Valve Software 's fans have long had a basic demand : make great games .
But these days , the Meet the Team animated shorts released since the launch of Team Fortress 2 and showcasing seven , so far , of the game 's nine characters , have fans asking for something else : Dear Valve , please make movies .
" The number of people at this point who want us going off and making full length movies and that sort of stuff has got to a point where it's hard to ignore , " an under - the - weather Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker said during a conference call interview with Kotaku late last week .
Advertisement
Yes , it 's come to dreams of movie - making for the seemingly can't - fail studio behind beloved gaming hits such as Team Fortress 2 , Half - Life , Portal and Left 4 Dead .
" We 're not ready to announce anything along those lines , but I do n't think there 's a person in this company that would n't love to see a full - length TF movie or even a 10 - minute movie , " Valve writer and TF2 video contributor Erik Wolpaw said .
He was on the call with Kotaku from the Valve 's office in Bellevue , Washington .
" I 'm not just being cagey .
I 'm a little bit removed from these kinds of things .
But they keep giving us a little bit more rope with which to hang ourselves , so who knows . "
Feature films might be a flight of fancy for now , but to even joke about such things shows how far Valve has come in the two years since the studio released Meet the Heavy , the first of what have been seven increasingly elaborate shorts .
The movies are so popular that even fake fan - made ones like an amateur take on the eventual Meet the Medic short has garnered 800,000 views on YouTube .
The shorts have added character and flair to a multiplayer shooter that could well have had far less background and texture .
The clips have their origins as audition scripts for the voice actors who played the likes of the Heavy , the Sniper and the rest of the characters in the game .
The first video in the series , May 2007 's Meet The Heavy , is almost word - for - word what Valve used to cast its actor .
That Heavy video was made on the heels of a Portal video used to promote the personality of that game .
Walker remembered his team 's headiness with that the Heavy video , thinking it " was the greatest thing we had ever seen . "
Advertisement
The videos proved not just fun for fans but influential for the designers .
" It helped everyone on the team get a little bit more in tune with who that particular character was , so we just kept knocking them out and they kept on being popular , " Wolpaw said .
As an example of how the videos influenced the design , Walker said that the Heavy 's first upgrade , his health - empowering sandwich " came almost directly out of the movie …
We felt the movie had justified and created a way for us to have a ' sandvich ' in the game and have that action [ of eating it ] make any kind of sense in our game world . "
Advertisement
Jarate , the martial art of Team Fortress 2 involving thrown jars of urine , also was birthed outside the game , a little through the Sniper 's movie and a Valve comic strip .
Walker said that its introduction to fans through those non-game projects set up a perfectly understandable context for his game design team to introduce a gameplay element they desired , a " short - range enemy de-buff . "
No need to invent something new for that .
Jarate was already in the fiction and ready to be implemented .
Walker sees this as one creative end of Valve helping build the work of the other .
" It 's the natural result of having other creative folks messing around in the same sandbox .
It 's really hard not to see what they come up with and want to use it . "
The videos also helped the game 's technology .
Valve used Meet the Heavy to test the facial animation system the studio was developing for TF2 .
According to Walker , the new system " allowed our characters to have a much greater range of expressions than we were able to do in Half - Life …
We wanted a test case for that . "
Ultimately , what they got to work in the Meet the Team videos is what would display for players running the game itself at its highest settings .
Walker recalled that team 's pleasure about " the expression on the Heavy at the end when he 's shooting and screaming . "
It was no fake .
" It was n't this thing that the coolest bit in [ the movie ] was something that would happen in the game . "

As they videos have progressed they 've drifted from their audition script source material .
The newest one , Meet The Spy , uses none of such scripts .
" We try be a little more ambitious with each one leading up to Meet the Spy , which was definitely the most ambitious , " Wolpaw said .
Two videos remain : the Pyro and the Medic .
Wolpaw denies that that 's due to any disdain for those classes .
The Heavy was a random selection for first video , as far as he can recall .
Collaborating with the animators — who he describes as " unsung heroes " who have done 95 % of the work to make these videos — concepts for all nine characters have been conceived .
When possible , the videos were synced to the introduction of character class updates .
" Personally the Pyro is my favorite , " Wolpaw said .
" It 's pretty much logistics .
As far as I know , nobody out there hates the Pyro . " ( Joked Walker : " We all hate the Sniper , not the Pyro . " )

Walker likens the evolution of these short movies to the iterative improvements Valve and other game studios make with their games , improving their systems , sharpening their talents and extending their ambitions with each release .
That 's the reason the first videos were so much simpler than Meet the Spy and why further progress is still assumed at Valve for Meet the Medic and Meet the Pyro : " We 're certainly not going to backslide at all , " Wolpaw said ..
" That 's our plan .
They may be elaborate in ways you 're not necessarily expecting . "
( The Meet The Medic rick - rolled video on YouTube , by the way , does not count as a " way you 're not necessarily expecting . " )
Advertisement
The popularity of the Meet the Team videos suggests that a strategy of supporting a game with post - release videos would benefit other games .
Walker said it would only make sense if it was part of a solid business plan .
" If we were just doing these movies for Half Life 2 two years after making the game it would n't make a lot of sense , " he said .
" It would be hard for us to justify the cost of producing them .
When we tie it to the strategy we have with TF2 of continually updating the service ... it makes a lot more sense . "
What the videos do , he noted , is give ways for people who do n't even have Team Fortress 2 yet to get some entertainment from the game .
And that may turn them into TF2 players and customers .
In addition to the Medic and Pyro videos , Valve is also expected to tap its team involved in the shorts to create a Team Fortress 2 comic .
Valve co-founder Gabe Newell announced that plan in February during his keynote of the DICE gaming summit , but those on the call with Kotaku said they were not ready to announce further plans yet .

As for when the Medic and Pyro videos are coming out : stay tuned , is all Valve will say .
The story :
As U.S. Rep .
Tom Perriello was considering how to vote on an important piece of climate change legislation in June , the freshman congressman ’s office received at least six letters from two Charlottesville - based minority organizations voicing opposition to the measure .
The letters , as it turns out , were forgeries .
“ They stole our name .
They stole our logo .
They created a position title and made up the name of someone to fill it .
They forged a letter and sent it to our congressman without our authorization , ” said Tim Freilich , who sits on the executive committee of Creciendo Juntos , a nonprofit network that tackles issues related to Charlottesville ’s Hispanic community .
“ It ’s this type of activity that undermines Americans ’ faith in democracy . ”
The faked letter from Creciendo Juntos was signed by “ Marisse K. Acevado , Asst Member Coordinator , ” an identity and position at Creciendo Juntos that do not exist .
The person who sent the letter has not been identified , but he or she was employed by a Washington lobbying firm called Bonner & Associates .
This moment is too important , the crisis is too grave , to let our debate be distorted by under the radar screen gutter moves – this one the most egregious example yet reported .
From carefully crafted message memos to Republican members of Congress on how to talk about climate change to well - funded think tanks whose sole purpose is to try to cast doubt on the iron - clad science of global climate change to specific attacks on people like Al Gore and others who step up to tell the truth , the campaign has been relentless .
But the facts are clear :
In the industrial era , atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen from 280 to 385 parts per million .
Scientists have drawn a red line at 450 ppm -- which represents a warming of 2 degrees Celsius .
Anything beyond that presents an unacceptable risk .
But unless we take dramatic action -- now -- we are actually headed to 1,000 ppm by century 's end .
The effects are already being felt .
The ice is melting in the Arctic , the glaciers in the Himalayas ( the source of the major rivers of China and India , home to billions of people ) are projected to be totally gone by 2030 , weather patterns around the globe are changing – and against all that , we get forged letters and phony science trying to block progress .
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll keep saying it until we win : we have to fight this .
I ’ll be doing everything I can , from highlighting instances like this , to working every day in the Senate to make sure the truth is out there to counter the falsehoods .
And I ’ll be working to empower you to spread the truth .
The Senate will be considering historic reform legislation to meet this challenge , and we need to get a real solution out of that process .
We all have an enormous stake in the outcome of this fight ; it ’s literally a fight for the future of our planet .
And we all need to do absolutely everything we can to win this fight .
update : storms up North today -- plane was delayed a long time so I 've had a chance to read through the comments and noticed lots of comments on health care , so quickly two things : first , you 're preaching to the converted ( or rather the baptized ) on the importance of a public option .
I 've been working for one for a long time , and I 'm not backing off .
But how we end up where we need to go - Ted Kennedy taught me a long time ago - often has a lot of twists and turns which brings me to : second , there 's still a lot more time in this fight .
We have to get a bill out of the Finance Committee , and it 's obviously a difficult committee ideologically speaking -- but then we can work with it on the floor of the Senate , marrying up the best of the Finance bill to the best of Teddy and Chris 's HELP bill -- and again reconciling the Senate bill with whatever the House comes up with .
In other words , getting the best possible bill outof Finance is a necessary but not sufiicient step for getting the product we need .
So , look , I 'm going to be fighting every step of the way to get us to a public option in this country , and also to get us to things like progress on long term care and kids ' health which clearly should be universal and a few other huge priorities -- and I would n't expect any of you to give up working for that , either .
The Obama Administration ’s 2010 Department of Energy ( DOE ) budget proposes cutting the federal hydrogen fuel cell research and deployment budget by more than two - thirds ( $ 130 million ) , eliminating funds for the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle program and market transformation programs .
( Earlier post . )
California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols met with US Energy Secretary Steven Chu in May and followed up that meeting with a letter , urging the continuation of funding to support research , development and deployment of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
Nichols is also requesting a follow - on meeting between ARB technical staff , DOE technical staff and the several automakers pursuing fuel cell vehicles to continue the “ dialog and investigation ” .
In an interview with MIT Technology Review , Secretary Chu made what has become known as the “ Four Miracles ” comment — essentially that issues with fuel cell durability and cost ; hydrogen production ; hydrogen storage ; and hydrogen distribution infrastructure all required significant development , resulting in “ four miracles ” that needed to occur before hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would be viable in transportation .
This assessment was the basis for his decision to apply the funding in that area elsewhere .
In ARB ’s analysis , most vehicles on the road in 2050 will need to be electric drive , or ultra low - carbon fuel vehicles — i.e. , electricity or hydrogen — by 2050 in order to achieve the required 80 % reduction in greenhouse gases .
Commercialization of those technologies must start in the next decade , noted ARB Executive Officer Tom Cackette in a presentation at the recent Advanced Automotive Battery Conference .
( Earlier post . )
In her letter to Secretary Chu , Nichols attached a summary response from ARB technical staff responding to each of the Four Miracles .
All promising low - carbon non-petroleum transportation options , including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , battery electric vehicles , and advanced liquid biofuels in combustion engines , face significant technical , resource , and market challenges .
Hydrogen and fuel cells show great potential and have met or exceeded nearly all of the technical milestones set out by US DOE .
Several major automakers are pursuing early market testing with consumers beginning this year and are expected to ramp up production to nearly 50,000 vehicles in california by 2017 .
Ultimately the market will decide which technologies are the winners , but given the critical importance to our long term climate and energy security goals , the best approach is to pursue and invest in a portfolio of the most promising options .

Fuel cell system costs .

Cost .
Fuel cell system durability has improved and costs have been reduced through R&D , the ARB staff noted .
In volume production , FCVs are expected to be cost competitive with other advanced vehicles , and are approaching the cost of advanced hybrid system even with current designs and high costs of materials .
Recent Department of Energy - sponsored cost analyses have estimated an automotive fuel cell system based on today ’s design , including balance of plant , will cost $ 73 / kW at high volume ( $ 6,400 for an 80 kW system ) .
Improvements in system design , including lower catalyst loadings in the fuel cell , are expected to reduce this number further , according to ARB .
DOE ’s targets are $ 45 / kW by 2010 and $ 30 / kW by 2015 .
ARB staff cited a 2007 study by Kromer and Heywood at MIT that found that with minor improvements in system cost , a series - production fuel cell vehicle with a 350 - mile all - electric range would cost $ 3,600 more than a conventional car and $ 700 more than an advanced hybrid — a lower incremental cost than a plug - in hybrid with 30 - mile all - electric range ( $ 4,300 more ) and a full battery - electric vehicle ( more than $ 10,000 more ) .
ARB staff also noted that fuel cell durability has improved dramatically , including free - capable system lasting 1,900 hours in the field in 2008 ( up from 950 hours in 2006 ) and 7,300 hours in the lab .

Production .
A well - to - wheels analysis by DOE found that using hydrogen from natural gas — currently the primary production pathway — fuel cell vehicles emit 63 % fewer GHGs than today ’s gasoline vehicles , and 37 % fewer GHGs than natural gas vehicles .
FCVs using hydrogen from biomass emit 90 % fewer GHGs than current gasoline vehicles , and 63 % fewer GHGs than a plug - in hybrid running on cellulosic ethanol , with charging based on the national grid mix .
Storage .
While research work continues on developing storage materials with greater capacity , there are already 140 fuel cell vehicles which have accumulated more than 85,000 hours of operation and 1.9 million miles in real - world testing , ARB staff noted .
Honda ’s Clarity , with 350 bar compressed gas storage is achieving a 280 - mile range , and the 2009 Toyota FCHV using 700 bar storage has a state range of 480 miles ( on the 10 - 15 cycle ) .
A TIAX analysis of system cost presented at the DOE 2009 Merit Reviews earlier this year estimated a cost of $ 23 / kWh ( 700 bar , down 13 % form 2008 ) and $ 15.5 / kWh ( 350 bar , down 9 % from 2008 ) for hydrogen storage .
Current estimates of Li-ion storage cost are $ 1,000 / kWh , with DOE targeting a cost of $ 300 / kWh by 2014 .
Infrastructure .
The main question for hydrogen supply and refueling is how much public or private investment will be needed to achieve profitability , ARB staff noted .
When produced and distributed in high volume , hydrogen can be made efficiently from a variety of feedstocks including natural gas , biomass , and coal with sequestration at levelized costs of $ 3 - 6/ kg , which , when adjusted for the efficiency of the FCV , is comparable to $ 1.50 - %3.00 / gallon of gasoline in today ’s vehicles .
In assessing a transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , the National Research council estimated it would cost $ 2.2 million to build a hydrogen fueling station that could support 1,500 FCVs , or $ 1,500 per vehicle .
ARB staff cited an Idaho national Laboratory estimate that the average cost of adding a home 120V , 20A circuit to charge one PHEV would be $ 878 / vehicle , and a 240V circuit needed for a PHEV - 30 or PHEV - 40 would costs $ 1,500 - $ 2,100 per vehicle .
The NRC estimated that it will cost less than $ 600 million per year for all public and private R&D costs plus total vehicle and hydrogen supply costs to sustain hydrogen and fuel cells as a viable option through 2014 , ARB staff noted .
Separately , three organizations representing health , environmental and energy policy interests joined four national trade associations in calling on the US Congress to restore funding for the federal hydrogen and fuel cell research and deployment program to FY 2009 levels .
The seven groups are the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers ( AAM ) ; American Lung Association ( ALA ) ; Electric Drive Transportation Association ( EDTA ) ; Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) ;
The Stella Group , Ltd ; the National Hydrogen Association ( NHA ) ; and the US Fuel Cell Council ( USFCC ) .

- The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution
Late last night , a report was released about the Congressional investigation of unprecedented domestic spying and wiretapping programs secretly implemented by the Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks .
For any human being concerned about privacy , information security , U.S. history and constitutional law , the revelations are hair raising .
One of the cardinal virtues of a psychotherapist is privacy .
We have a duty and an ethical responsibility to safeguard the private information revealed to us in our practices .
There are a certain limitations to a blanket level of secrecy ( signed release from a patient , court order of records , disguising in conversations for teaching / training / supervision , co-ordination with health care providers during a life - threatening emergency , and the duty to warn appropriate authorities when we have information that a patient proposes an imminent threat of harm to self or others ) .
But generally , what happens in , stays in therapy .
Just like Vegas ...
... except that just before January 2004 , what happened in Vegas did NOT stay in Vegas .
In mid-2007 , FRONTLINE aired a program titled " Spying on the home front " .
The program is available to view free online , and I highly recommend watching it .
The report detailed how the Bush administration yielded unprecedented executive authority to obtain warrantless collection of information without due process about American citizens with no probable cause for criminal activity .
For example , following a hunch on same vague chatter about Al - Qaeda having " a possible interest " in Las Vegas in for the 2004 New Year 's celebration , the FBI confiscated hotel , airline , rental car , casinos and more on every single person who visited Vegas at the time .
Were you visiting then ?
The FBI had your number .
The Congressional report issued last night revealed that wiretapping and datamining programs such as this were extensive , were carried out without Congressional oversight at the National Security Agency , were drafted through the White House Office of Legal Counsel ( with Justice Department lawyer John
Yoo overwriting more Constitutional law than a whole bench full of " activist " supreme court justices ) , and were not effective in yielding actionable intelligence .
Again , I 'd urge you to check out the Frontline report ( Frontline yielded some incredibly fascinating and informative programming during the end years of the Bush administration ) , but here 's an abbreviated tour through the history of Government privacy protections :
Let 's have a tea party !
Way back around the 1750s ... like way back before they had iPhones and people mostly had to use Walkmens and stuff ... the British monarch King George II had a habit of writing orders to have his lackeys poke into your stuff to try and get more tax money off you and maybe even take some of your stuff away if you did n't pay that money .
But then the King died and his grandson King George III had to re-sign those orders or else they would expire .
A few folks had a problem with this ( I think they did n't want officers checking under their white wigs or something ) and made a law to ban the king 's direct orders unless a judge or legal authority decided that there was a good legal reason for these searches and seizures .
That law was overturned , however , because it 's good to be the King , and if King George , who was quite the decider , says so ... it must be done .
Around then , a lot of people in Boston started to get a little cranky ( maybe the weather was bad ... it was getting closer to winter ... in Boston ! ) .
They were n't thrilled with George III 's grand - daddy George II , but this George III was just unbearable .
Even though these Bostonians were angrier than when the Yankees are in town , they were still civilized folk .
So they banded together in general bonhomie , and threw themselves a nice Tea Party .
A few years later , they wrote up this set of laws called a Constitution ...( writing laws was how they told other people about stuff before blogs , facebook , and twitter ) including the Fourth Amendment which went along the effects of " thou shalt not search for , nor drink my beer without proper legal recourse , and if thou is allowest access to said beer , only for a specific and limited amount of time " .
The gambler who used pay phones ( because they 're kinda like slot machines )
Almost 200 years later ( but still before YouTube ! ) , a guy named Charles Katz of California was arrested for illegal gambling .
His Blackberry Storm must not have been working because he used a pay phone to place bets across the country ( some of those bets were in Boston ... shout out to Beantown again ! ) .
The FBI had used wiretaps on those phone booth calls as evidence to arrest him .
In Katz v. United States 1967 , the Supreme Court overturned Katz 's conviction on the ground that the FBI wiretaps constituted illegal search and seizure .
The justices made three major points : the fourth amendment covers a " reasonable expectation of privacy " ; the fourth amendment protects the privacy of people and not places so your electronic communication is protected ; and that warrants must be obtained for wiretapping or search / seizure which are sufficiently limited in scope or duration .
Nixon was just trying to get a Frosty and cheeseburger from Watergate
Then there was this guy Richard Nixon , who became President of the United States .
He was kind of a paranoid sort , always worried that people were out to get him .
He was a guy who wanted to keep his friends close and keep a close ear on his enemies .
Of course , he believed that many of his enemies were n't just foreign powers , but people actually living inside the United States .
He made a lot of tape recordings and had the CIA and FBI do a lot of spying etc. , etc .
It turns out that Nixon 's room service at the Watergate hotel was not very good , so the Senate opened up the Church Committee ( led by Sen. Frank Church ) to investigate the CIA 's and FBI 's intelligence gathering methods .
The then director of the CIA , William Colby , was brought in to testify about CIA activities in front of Congress .
Colby felt that the CIA should be accountable to the legislative branch , even though a number of former Nixon staff tried to block his testimony .
Donald Rumsfeld , not surprisingly , was one of these players trying to keep Congress out of the President 's business .
The Church committee decided that the U.S. needs to have security on two fronts .
First , we need to be safe from foreign powers and enemies , some of whom have agents in the U.S. Second , we need to be safe from ourselves ; we can't sacrifice too many of our own personal freedoms under the banner of homeland security .
To hold this difficult balance , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) was created .
Also , William Colby was replaced as head of the CIA by .... George H.W. Bush .
If you thought your VISA terms were complicated , wait until you see FISA
FISA created a " secret court " ... sort of like you did in that backyard clubhouse with your friends as a kid .
This secret FISA court makes rulings about whether or not the U.S. is authorized to conduct surveillance on foreign enemies both abroad and in the U.S.
Since we are on the web here , let 's talk about electronic surveillance ... this means phone calls , emails , electronic records , etc .
The terms have many different scenarios built in , but the main thrust of the FISA code is that the President may authorize warrantless electronic surveillance for the period of up to one year if it is certified by the Attorney General , if the surveilled is directly related to a foreign power , and IF " there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party " , or it is only for the first fifteen days of a war declared by Congress .
Otherwise , the FISA court must issue a warrant for such surveillance .
When all is said and done , United States law seems to spell out that a sustained blanket surveillance of United States citizens ' electronic communication without a court order is a violation of Fourth Amendment rights .
Then came George the Fourth
After 9/11/01 , United States government changed drastically .
Essentially , the US adapted an act first , ask later stance .
We went from due process trials to enemy combatant prisons .
We went from prosecuting crimes to trying to prevent them .
From defense to pre-emptive strike .
Our goal became to " stop this from ever happening again " .
Trauma creates hypervigilance .
After a event , people try to observe and control their circumstances to prevent from ever being harmed again .
But we cannot constantly prevent all harm , and eventually this intensely active vigilance fueled by traumatic fries neurons and saps energy , leaving one more vulnerable to attack than ever before ... and thus trauma cycles on .
As exemplar , on December 16 2005 , the New York Times reported :
" Months after the Sept. 11 attacks , President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court - approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying , according to government officials . "
From yesterday 's report we learned that those eavesdropping programs were widescale , had little oversight , and were of little value in preventing terrorist activities .
Paul Wachtel is a psychologist who describes mental illness as a cyclical pattern that is maintained through anxiety .
In essence , people are often tragic figures who serve as their own worst enemies .
For example , a man so afraid of being left by his romantic partner excessively seeks reassurance , becomes at any separations , and is of time spent apart .
Such a person is hardly a great boyfriend , his overbearance leading his loved one to pull away .
Her withdrawal raises his anxiety and fuels a vicious cycle of greater anxiety , rejection and abandonment .
Shakespeare 's work is famous for writing these kind of tragic characters as seen in public figures and political leaders .... King Lear , Richard III , Othello , Julius Caesar .
This country 's greatness is founded on a set of precious freedoms from tyranny and oppression .
In the methods we seek to maintain these freedoms as a country , we must not become the tyrannical , intrusive , and oppressive enemies of ourselves .

What Matthew Weigman and his cohorts did went so far beyond " pranks " -- or even hacking -- as to leave little room to question the sentence he received yesterday .
From an IDG News Service story on our site :
Matthew Weigman , 19 , was part of a group of telephone hackers that met up on telephone party lines and was associated with more than 60 " swatting " calls to 911 numbers across the country .
Weigman , known as " Little Hacker , " became involved in telephone hacking around age 14 and continued to operate until last year .
Swatters make prank 911 calls , but they use spoofing technology to make it appear as though the call is being made from a victim 's house .
The idea is to harass their targets , preferably by having police show up at their door , guns drawn .
The details make clear once again the dangers of caller - ID spoofing -- which remains legal in most of the country -- as we 've written about here , here and here .
Lawmakers in New York and Louisiana have recently taken steps to control the practice .
Two years ago I wrote a post scoffing at members of Congress who were pushing legislation to outlaw caller - ID spoofing .
I was wrong ; they were right .
People who abuse caller - ID need to know they 're breaking the law .
Recently there was a job posted on Careerbuilders for a publisher position with a Ventura county book publisher .
I read through the twenty or so qualifications and requirements , and it matched almost perfectly with my over ten years experience in the publishing business .
I was about to apply for this job , until I read the last requirement under education and experience which read : # 3 ; A strong Christian commitment is required , and again # 5 A bona fide occupational qualification of this position is to have a Christian commitment .
Although I have a great deal of experience in marketing and publishing , I 'm not a Christian and , as such , do n't have a “ strong Christian commitment ” .
With the renewed media attention placed on employment discrimination cases brought about by the nomination of Sotomayor and her decision in the Ricci case regarding race , and sex - discrimination class - action lawsuits filed against Wal - Mart and State Farm and age discrimination in the case of Pittsburgh - based PPG , it seemed that this job requirement could lead this publisher wide open for possible litigation .
While someone of the Jewish , or Muslim , or Buddhist faiths can certainly have an educated knowledge of different biblical texts , and an ability to work with companies of different faiths , but no matter their education and publishing experience , it is impossible for anyone but a Christian to have a “ strong Christian commitment . ”
In other words , anyone of a different faith need not apply .
There is another side to this issue which , as a libertarian minded individual , I have to support .
I firmly believe that any employer should have the right to decide who they employ without the government forcing them to hire those whom they do not wish to work with ; be that women , old people , fat people , those of a different religion , or a different skin color .
Which is a very noble position to take , except when it pertains to finding employment yourself , and you are not given the job because you are a fat , old , African - American Jewish woman !
( Obviously , I 'm being sarcastic ) .
So , where do we draw the line ?
Affirmative action has been debated on both sides , but there is no argument that when one person is given a job , a promotion , or a college education because they qualify as a “ minority ” , someone else loses that opportunity .
The more government tries to legislate morality , and dictate employer 's hiring decisions , or regulates cities ' promotion criteria , the more our society loses .
With unemployment reaching record setting numbers , employers are being inundated with resumes , and on - line job applications , are finding it a great deal easier to weed out those individuals who they might not want to employ , and discriminate on matters of race , religion , or sex , by just simply responding , if they respond at all , they hired someone else .
If employers were free to post who they really want , or do n't , and not have to adhere to the “ EOE ” rules , many job seekers would take their experience and qualifications elsewhere .
Customers and clients who are against discrimination would take their business to a competitor and the company would either have to change their hiring practices , or go out of business .
This would be a much easier and less costly way to enforce “ affirmative action ” than in a court room .
As a Libertarian , I feel the company has every right to hire only those who follow Christian doctrine , and as someone looking for employment , I am free to apply elsewhere .
In a rush to stimulate the economy , the Obama administration is touting various visionary  plans to make the American economy more progressive , more innovative , and more forward - looking by subsidizing politically motivated projects like green technology .
These hands - on policies will be ineffective .
Recent research suggests that a much more effective way to accomplish the same goals would be to eliminate intellectual monopoly and to reduce the regulatory burdens on innovators .
According to conventional wisdom in economics , temporary monopoly rights patents are necessary to give people incentives to come up with newer , better ideas .
After all , if people who came up with new ideas could see those new ideas copied without cost by competitors , why bother spending the time and energy ?
Hence , we have patents .
But the conventional wisdom is wrong .
In their 2008 book Against Intellectual Monopoly , economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine dropped a bombshell that will , I hope , overturn the consensus about rights to ideas .
Using carefully developed theory and a host of real - world examples , they show how patents actually reduce , rather than encourage , innovation .
Innovators like steam engine pioneer James Watt , devoted enormous amounts of time and energy to defending monopoly rights rather than to creating new value .
Innovation and growth proceeded apace once the patents expired .
In Boldrin and Levines opinion , this delayed the onset of modern economic growth .
As these authors argue , intellectual monopoly is an unnecessary evil .
Further , it is a relic of medieval and early - modern mercantilist regulations whereby kings and nobles granted efficiency - reducing monopoly privileges to favored constituents .
Eliminating intellectual monopoly would reduce the incomes of the intellectual monopolists , but it would unleash new creative energies throughout the economy .
In his recent book The Gridlock Economy , legal scholar Michael Heller argued that intellectual monopoly reduces the pace of innovation .
He notes that innovative rap music , like Public Enemys initial work , was an early casualty of intellectual monopoly .
Demands that artists pay royalties for borrowed music sharply restricted rap musicians ability to innovate .
While some people might not care about innovative rap music , many care about access to life - saving new medical technologies .
Heller explains how this industry is particularly susceptible to the tragedy of the anti-commons  created by intellectual monopoly .
If an invention requires multiple patented innovations to be implemented , then every individual holder of one of the necessary patents can block further innovation .
This slows the pace of economic progress .
Consider another example .
Would Britney Spearss artistic output fall if her intellectual monopoly rights were rescinded ?
I doubt it .
Ms. Spears is much wealthier than she would be in the absence of intellectual monopoly , but her wealth is largely what economists refer to as economic rent : income in excess of her opportunity cost .
Eliminating her intellectual monopoly very likely would not cause her to choose another occupation , but it would lead to an increase in net creative output .
Progress is also slowed by the regulation of food and drugs , which requires years of extensive and expensive testing before a drug can be approved for sale .
This means that some lives are saved because people are restricted to hyper - safe drugs , but the lives saved come at the cost of lives that are lost because the appearance of these drugs on the market is delayed .
Further , other drugs that would be useful but might carry greater risks never make it to the market to begin with .
White House Chief - of - Staff Rahm Emanuel suggested that the Administration should not waste the opportunities presented by the present economic and political crisis .
Right now , the administration has the opportunity to make a bold move that will stimulate the economy for generations to come .
By eliminating intellectual monopoly and by liberalizing markets , we can encourage further innovation and greater prosperity .

Two baby flamingoes being hand - reared at London Zoo are causing surprise among staff because of their aversion to the colour pink .
Keepers found that the chicks , called Little and Large due to their size , dislike pink after introducing them to a pink sock puppet .
The pair run away from the puppet and anything else pink - coloured including the tray they splash about in .
Keepers have been forced to use a specially sourced yellow tray instead .
Keeper Alison Brown , who is looking after the chicks , said : " They just do n't seem to like the colour .
" Birds see in different colour spectrums to humans - so there 's no logical reason for them not liking pink .
" We are hoping to get them used to it before they turn pink themselves - else they will be in for a shock ! "
Flamingoes are often seen standing on one leg , which is thought to keep the hidden leg warm among their feathers .
PROVIDENCE , R.I .
The chief emerges from his tent to face the leaden morning light .
It had been a rare , rough night in his homeless Brigadoon : a boozy brawl , the wielding of a knife taped to a stick .
But the community handled it , he says with pride , his day ’s first cigar already aglow .
By community he means 80 or so people living in tents on a spit of state land beside the dusky Providence River : Camp Runamuck , no certain address , downtown Providence .
Because the two men in the fight had violated the community ’s written compact , they were escorted off the camp , away from the protection of an abandoned overpass .
One was told we ’ll discuss this in the morning ; the other was voted off the island , his knife tossed into the river , his tent taken down .
The chief flicks his spent cigar into that same river .
There is talk of rain tonight .
Behind him , the camp stirs .
Other tent cities have sprung up recently around the country , but Rhode Island officials have never seen anything like this .
A tea kettle sings .
A host of respected technology blogs have reported that several Microsoft executives have flown to Silicon Valley to hammer out the final details of the deal which would see Microsoft take charge of Yahoo !'s search engine business .
The winning image of a figure at the window of a Scottish castle
An eerie picture of a figure in period costume at the window of a Scottish castle has won a competition to find the world 's most convincing " ghostly image " .
The picture , taken in May 2008 , appears to show a man or woman wearing a ruff , looking through a barred window at Tantallon Castle in North Berwick , East Lothian .
No mannequins are used at the castle , and there are no costumed guides .
Three photographic experts have confirmed that the photograph was not manipulated .
Christopher Aitchison , a visitor who took the photograph said : " I was not aware of anyone or anything being present in my picture , only noticing the anomaly when I got home .
I did not notice any nice old ladies wearing ruffs walking around the stairs !
" Some people have suggested it 's just light reflecting on rocks , and one person suggested it may be King James V of Scotland . "
Detailed examination of the picture shows it was not manipulated Psychologist Professor Richard Wiseman , who has made many studies of the supernatural , launched the investigation a month ago .
He asked members of the public to submit ghostly images for experts to analyse .
More than 250 pictures were received from all over the world , and there was then a public vote on which people thought were the most convincing photos .
Camera shy Professor Wiseman , himself a confirmed ghost sceptic said that the importance of faces to our lives means our brains are programmed to see them even where they do n't exist : " I suppose it could be another visitor looking a bit strange .
Perhaps someone will come forward . "
The study is part of the Edinburgh International Science Festival , and will be discussed at a one day public festival called " Hauntings " which will examine the evidence for the existence of ghosts .
Co-organiser Dr Caroline Watt from Edinburgh University said : " " Even though we had the public submit their most mysterious photographs , the images we received do n't provide compelling evidence for spirits .
If ghosts are out there , it seems they are somewhat camera shy . "

Grassoline it ain't .
After a jury ordered a leading cellulosic biofuel company to pony up millions for defrauding investors , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will likely come in 60 million gallons shy of its 100 million gallon target next year .
Late last month , a federal court in Mobile ordered Cello Energy of Bay Minette , Ala. , to pay $ 10.4 million in punitive damages for fraudulently claiming it could produce cheap diesellike fuel from hay , wood pulp and other waste .
Cello's owner , Jack Boykin , allegedly built a sham facility and lured pulp producer Parsons & Whittemore Enterprises to invest $ 2.5 million in an ownership stake in 2007 .
In court , Parsons & Whitmore CEO George Landegger said he was unimpressed with the company 's facilities , and a string of expert witnesses testified that fuel samples were derived from petroleum sources .
Neither Boykin nor his attorney , Forrest Latta , returned calls for comment , but in statements to the press following the trial , Latta has indicated that Cello 's technology has " global potential . "
Another defendant , Khosla Ventures , a California firm that invested $ 12.5 million in Cello in 2007 , was unavailable to comment .
Although it 's no surprise that investors might be dazzled in the rush to hop on board the biofuels bandwagon , the EPA appears to have been duped as well .
Cellulosic biofuel technology is still in its infancy , and the agency and Congress required gasoline blenders to purchase and sell just 100 million gallons next year , less than 1 percent of the nation 's proposed renewable fuel mandates .
To encourage biofuel producers to meet that demand , the government would establish a credit scheme to set a floor on the wholesale price of $ 3.00 per gallon — about twice that of corn - based ethanol — if production fails to reach the 100 million gallon mark .
But David Woodburn , an analyst at ThinkEquity Partners in Chicago says that the agency had pinned its hopes on Cello and has not put in place the cellulosic biofuel credit system required to maintain that price point .
" EPA was supposed to have prepared it in late June , " he says , " In the EPA 's eyes , they only need to implement that system if they see a shortfall coming ....
Up to now on paper they 've totally ignored this credit system . "
As reported in earth2tech , Woodburn first realized the EPA would fall short of its target when it released its draft regulatory impact analysis in May .
This document listed firms that were to make cellulosic biofuel , and most were on the hook to produce one million or two million gallons by the end of 2010 .
Cello Energy , however , claimed that its Bay Minette facility would pump out 20 million gallons .
The agency also had Cello down for new plants that would produce another 50 million gallons .
Woodburn says he grew skeptical of the company after calls and e-mails to the company for verification were never returned .
EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn says Cello estimates were " derived based on commercialization plans from the company .
They never gave us volume — only size of the facilities and planned timeline . "
So , what 's the chance that Cello can still meet its target ?
" It seemed extremely unlikely three weeks ago before this jury verdict , " Woodburn says .
" It seems extremely unlikely today .
How can you create three additional plants and have them producing in 2010 when ground has n't been broken yet ? "
Woodburn adds that Cello also faces another hurdle , which is that it has no distribution agreements : in other words , no one has promised to buy their biofuel .
In the best - case scenario , he says , the nation will produce 39 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel next year and blenders will be on the hook to pay the government a $ 600 million or more for biofuel credits through a program that still does not exist .
Alternatively , the EPA could lower the cellulosic biofuel target when it finalizes the contentious renewable fuel standards in the fall , a decision that would defeat the whole idea of the goal in the first place .
Milbourn says the EPA is " continuing to assess the viability of not only Cello , but also the various other technologies and companies in supplying cellulosic biofuel . "
For George Huber , the University of Massachusetts Amherst chemical engineering professor who wrote Scientific American 's July cover story about cellulosic biofuels , Cello is a lesson to be learned .
" There are no magic processes for conversion of biomass into liquid fuels , " he says , " If something sounds too good to be true , it probably is not true . "
MANY male victims of domestic violence are too ashamed to report the abuse .
Carl Brown talks to a man who is willing to break his silence in a bid to raise awareness of the widespread , but often ignored , problem .
“ I was on the bus with my ex-partner when she started to attack me , the police arrived and immediately wanted to arrest me . ”
For a year David Hyatt suffered the misery of regular violent attacks at the hand of his ex-partner .
Despite the problem being widespread , he believes policy makers , domestic violence charities and wider society are not addressing the issue .
According to Home Office statistics , one in five men have experienced domestic abuse since they were 16 .
The figure for women is one in three , but the figures also show nearly half of all victims are men .
“ There is always an assumption that the man is the perpetrator of violence but it is not true , ” Mr Hyatt said .
Mr Hyatt is concerned about plans to create a register of abusive partners , fearing it will include male culprits but not violent women .
He also believes the charity Women 's Aid is too influential and publishes “ anti-male ” propaganda .
The charity insists women are more likely to experience repeated and more severe forms of violence , including sexual abuse , and are more likely to suffer sustained physical , psychological or emotional abuse .
It says all domestic violence should not be tolerated but support services for men should be provided separately from that for women for safety reasons .
Mr Hayatt says he was so embarassed by the abuse that he could not seek help .
He said : “ A couple of hours a month for a whole year she would beat me , and then when I held her wrists , kick me until my legs were black and blue , spit in my face and kick me in the groin .
“ The rest of the time she was affectionate , so I would stay with her - exactly the same as female victims .
“ My life was made a misery but I did not report it because of the stigma and humiliation attached to it . ”
Mr Hyatt believes the Government is focusing too heavily on tackling abuse against women and children , at the expense of protecting male domestic abuse victims .
He is concerned about plans to create a register of abusive partners , fearing it will include male culprits but not violent women .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Domestic violence must be regarded as a serious crime irrespective of gender or ethnicity .
It impacts across all communities but we recognise that women are much more likely to suffer domestic violence .
" Nevertheless the government takes the issue of male victims extremely seriously .
" The Home Office funds the Men 's Advice and Enquiry Line ; we also support the work of the men's coalition . "

Police Officer Tases Great Grandmother
A police officer used a Taser on a 72 - year - old during a speeding stop .
June 10 , 2009  --
A feisty 72 - year - old great - grandmother was tasered after a police officer pulled her over for speeding .
The Travis County , Texas dashboard camera captured the altercation between officer Chris Bieze and Kathryn Winkfein that happened last month .
Bieze said Winkfein was physically " non-complaint " after he pulled her over for driving 60 mph in a 45 mph speed zone on her way to Austin , Texas .
What the DashCam Shows
The video , which was released this week , shows Winkfein refusing to sign her speeding ticket .
She then got out of her pick - up truck and then the confrontation got nastier .
" Give me the f -- king ticket now , " she said .
" Get over here now , " Bieze replied .
Bieze then shoved the woman .
He said it was to keep her out of traffic whizzing by .
" You 're gonna shove me ?!
You 're gonna shove a 72 year old woman , " Winkfein said .
But Bieze would do more than just shove Winkfein .
" If you do n't stand back , I 'm gonna tase you , " he tells Winkfein .
" Go ahead , taser me , " Winkfein replied .
" Stand back or you 're going to be tasered !
Put your hand behind your back , " Bieze warns Winkfein .
After warning Winkfein a half dozen times , Bieze makes good on all of those threats .
" Get on the ground !
Get on the ground , " Bieze can be heard yelling as Winkfein screams .
" Now put your hands behind your back . "
" Put your hands behind your back or you 're going to be tased again , " Bieze continued .
While , Winkfein was not seriously injured and was taken to jail , when she got out , she told reporters the officer made up lies in this police report .
" I was not argumentative .
I was not combative .
All of this is a lie .
Every bit of this is a lie , " Winkfein said .
Then the tape was made public and the once - feisty great grandmother clammed up .
Winkfein reportedly hired an attorney and she may need one .
She was charged with resisting arrest .
But the officer is n't in a bit of trouble .
His boss said he did everything by the book .
" My mother is 77 .
If she conducted herself in such a way , I 'd say ' Mom , you do n't argue with the police . '
You just don't , " said Sgt. Major Gary Griffin of the Travis County Constable 's Office .

Today , Lowe is the director and screenwriter at iBase Entertainment .
He also maintains an active connection with his fan base through his website and email list .
We are privileged to have this exclusive opportunity to speak with the funnyman and gaming icon .
In the interview , Lowe speaks of his history with Sierra On - Line , his design philosophy behind Leisure Suit Larry , his present views of adventure games , his brief retirement life , and his current game project — Sam Suede : Undercover Exposure .
Check out our exclusive new photo of Lowe !
Al , thank you very much for the opportunity to interview you .
You 're welcome .
I 'm glad to have the chance to chat with you .
Let me begin the interview by asking you about the early days of your career .
Before your career as a game designer started at Sierra On - Line , you were a music teacher .
What were the circumstances that led to Ken Williams inviting you to join his company back in 1982 ?
What designing and programming experiences did you have prior to that time ?
I had a degree in music education and was a professional musician from age 13 .
I was always a geek , although I did n't know it then .
I was the guy interested in electronics .
I was the kid who set up the PA system and fixed the movie projector when the teacher could n't .
I guess you could describe me as a Paleolithic geek .
Why and how did I get into computer games ?
It was simple .
I saw games , I tried games , I enjoyed playing games , I wanted to make games , so that 's what I did : I sat down and made some .
I made three games and published them myself before I ever met Ken Williams .
When Ken saw them , he liked them , probably because they looked a lot like Roberta 's games , since she made the games I enjoyed playing and therefore , that was the kind of games I ended up writing .
When he and Roberta saw my games , they suggested that , rather than for me wasting my time copying floppy disks and putting them in plastic baggies and printing up sleeves and all that other non-creative stuff that is publishing , I could just dump all that , create more games , and let Sierra handle the dirty work .
So I did .
My training was zero .
I bought an Apple II in the very early days , about 1978 - 9 .
I just messed around with it , using it to further my work as a music teacher .
I had no classes in programming because there were no classes in PC programming .
Sure , there were classes in Fortran and Cobol , but nobody taught how to write games or entertainment software or software to do your job .
So , my class work and my formal training was zilch .
But I had a lot of desire .
I read a lot of books , studied and practiced a lot .
I began with small steps and eventually got to the point where I thought I could create a game .
And that 's what I did .
While working fulltime , I wrote 3 games in 3 months .
Of course , back then , games were small .
Because my college degrees were in education , my first game was an educational game for children , written for my son who was then 4 years old .
He and I played it together because I was trying to teach him to read .
And that 's my pre-Sierra background as a programmer .
Let us talk a bit about Leisure Suit Larry .
The character Larry had undergone many face lifts , both physically and metaphorically , through the 7 ( or rather 6 ) games in the series .
By the way , Al , I am still looking for my missing floppy disks for Leisure Suit Larry 4 : The Missing Floppies !
Me too !
Having said this , what were the most significant changes you made to Larry 's character as the series matured ?
I think the biggest way Larry grew was that he fleshed out not only physically ( he got a little fatter as we went along ) but also that he grew in depth as a character .
As I wrote the first game , I was n't quite sure of who or what this guy was , although he had more personality than most other games at the time .
It took me the second and third games before I really had enough disk space , money , and time devoted to flushing out his character to make him have a real personality .
That was by default because most games had zero , so by Larry having a little , he had more than most .
People always ask , " Are you Larry ? " I 'm not , although I am in the games .
I 'm the narrator .
When Larry asks some dumb question and the narrator responds with some smart ass remark , that 's me .
Al , about the weight issue : I think all men ( including both you and me ) eventually suffer from weight problems !
< laughs >
What design elements of Larry had you originally in mind that were subsequently rejected during the games ' development ?
What aspects of Larry would you have wanted to develop further if there had been another sequel ?
Physically and graphically , his look changed the most over time .
When we started , we had 320 - pixel resolution and 16 colors .
That is not a lot .
In today 's world of big monitors and high resolution , that 's a window the size of a postage stamp .
As the machines ' graphics capabilities advanced , we could add more detail to Larry 's look .
One reason he had a huge nose was because , in the original game , if he was going to have a nose at all , it had to be huge .
It was exactly one pixel , so either it was huge or it was zero !
But the most fun was growing his character , finding more and more ways to humiliate this guy .
That was the real fun for me , so the aspects I would develop in another sequel are more laughs and more ways of involving you the player in the action .
How had changes in game technology ( such as interface , graphic , music , storage ) impacted on your design philosophy in Leisure Suit Larry over the years ?
What were some of the major developmental hurdles in the early years of Leisure Suit Larry ?
The biggest hurdle in the first game was figuring out how to handle all the space available because , once I passed the " one floppy disk limit " and became a two floppy game , I had a whole 360 KB of extra memory to fill !
Think about that : all of the original Leisure Suit Larry fit in 700 KB of disk space — not 600 megs , but 600 KB !
That 's 1/1,000th of a CD or 1/5,000th of a DVD .
That 's about the same storage as one small camera phone photo today .
Just think of that : one photo or an entire game — all the code , the text , the backgrounds , the animation — everything !
The most fun was to be able to add more content to every succeeding game , to make the graphics clearer , to improve the interface , to provide more detail , more music , more sound effects , more animation .
One of the biggest changes was when we figured out how to add MIDI music to replace the horrible PC tweaker .
And then with Larry 7 , we replaced MIDI music with real musicians .
For me , as a musician , that was a wonderful treat .
To be able to actually hire live musicians , set them up in a studio , record the soundtrack , and then play it back directly in the game was a big kick .
The big hurdle in the early days was the difficulty we had developing the tools .
Few people realize that all our early games were developed before Photoshop .
That 's like saying before telephones !
Who can imagine doing a game today without photo and graphic tools , sound editors , animation packages ?
Sierra had to build its own tools .
We had toolmakers who built the programs that allowed the creative types to create the backgrounds , the " 3 - D " graphics , the sounds , the animation , everything .
They made the first games that had images that could pass behind other images in real time .
They did it all with just 12 planes of depth and 4 planes of significance .
Those four enabled us to do many things , like put backgrounds behind doors so when you opened the door another scene appeared behind it .
An example is the dog that randomly appeared in Larry 1 .
It could wander anywhere , even behind a light pole .
We did n't need special graphics that had to be perfectly aligned .
The software made the dog a lower plane than the pole and the dog appeared to be behind it .
These are things that are taken for granted today .
I purposely designed Leisure Suit Larry 2 to be a series of areas , strung like stones on a necklace , because I could only fit one region on a floppy disk .
I wanted you to be able to finish one complete area before moving on to the next , then finish that entire area before you went onto the third level , and so forth .
That was designed strictly to make it convenient for people who were still playing from floppy disk back in 1988 .
Indeed , it was quite a technological marvel that you were able to create such a rich game environment with such limited storage space in the early years .
For the first game of the series , Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards , how much of it was based on Softporn Adventure that was produced by On - Line Systems which later became Sierra On - Line ?
More interestingly , what was the decision process within Sierra On - Line that ultimately agreed to develop Leisure Suit Larry , especially given that the company had already distanced itself from its former image of having once produced an R - Rated game title ?
An interesting point .
When I first brought an Apple II , one of the first games I had was Softporn , because everybody I knew had it .
It was the talk of computers , the hot thing , even though it was a text - only game .
At a time when there were only 100,000 Apple II computers on Earth , Sierra had sold 25,000 copies of Softporn — and everybody I knew had a pirated version !
That game had pretty much a 100 % market share .
Everyone wanted to play it — so much so that when Time magazine produced its first column ever on home computers , it included Softporn and its cover photo in the article .
It was a hot title , the Halo of its day .
Later , when Sierra obtained the rights to the Disney characters , Disney was n't excited to have Mickey Mouse share the same catalog as Softporn .
But by that time Softporn had died out , so Ken let the Softporn game die and focused on Disney titles .
A few more years passed and we lost the rights to the Disney characters .
We were looking for new game ideas and I remembered Softporn 's success .
What if we " updated " it with our new game engine and added graphics ?
I replayed the game and realized that , 6 years later , it was really dated .
Not only was the technology bad , but everything about it was lame .
I told Ken , " There 's no way I can do this as a serious game .
It 's so out of it that it should be wearing a leisure suit . "
I added , " But if you let me mock it , I might be able to do a spoof of it . "
There were almost no comedy games available back then .
( That 's still true today ! )
So we decided to try something more adult in nature , with a comedic aspect to it .
Frankly , for me , it was a real risk ; I had zero experience as a comedy writer .
I tried to make it as funny as I could , but I was n't really sure how funny that would be .
So I took Softporn Adventure and threw out every line of text and every part of the game , except for the puzzles and locations .
Since SA had no central character , I invented Larry and made him the butt of the jokes .
I added most of the silly stuff in the game because I was n't confident enough in my sense of humor .
I wanted people to really get their money 's worth .
Another first for Leisure Suit Larry was beta -testing .
It was the first Sierra game to use testers outside the company .
I was nervous about how well I could handle typed input , so I created a routine that stored every line a tester entered that was not handled correctly by the game .
Then I collected all those mistakes , and wrote a line to cover every one of them .
When the game was ready to ship , Sierra got scared ; their big retailer at the time was Radio Shack , which sold 30 - 40 % of all Sierra products sold .
Their management was very conservative and not interested in a game with themes like Larry's .
So when it shipped , it was a terrible seller .
In its first month , it sold 4,000 copies — the worst sales of any game in Sierra history .
I thought , " I 've blown it .
Wasted six months of my life . "
Of course , every month sales doubled , until a year later , it was finally a big hit .
Ironic , is n't it ?
Today , if a game does n't sell well the first week , it gets discounted and thrown into the bargain bin .
Sierra really changed direction and outlook from the early days through the Disney years and into the Larry years .
It was not just the game we all liked about Softporn Adventure but also the racy picture of Roberta on the game 's front cover !
I do n't know how many people know that , but it 's true .
The cover of the game was a photo of three people in a hot tub and one of them was Roberta Williams .
Of all the Leisure Suit Larry games you created , which games did you receive the most and least feedbacks from fans ?
What were the most surprising comments you had received ?
This may seem odd , but , in a period before email , few people took time to write a letter , put it in an envelope , put a stamp on it , and mail it .
So I did n't receive a lot of feedback .
I heard through sales people , retailers , friends , but for the most part , I had very little feedback about any of my games until I built my own website , www.allowe.com.
Then , suddenly , it was as if I opened a floodgate .
I received tens of thousands of emails telling me how the game had affected people , even to the point of changing their lives .
Many fans got into computers because of Larry or the other games I wrote .
Many ended up with careers in technology .
My site has provided amazing feedback , but while I created the games , I did n't see more than a few dozen letters total .
You had been quite vocal with your opinion on Leisure Suit Larry : Magna Cum Laude , a game which you had not been involved in the development .
However , you had been in contact with Eric Hayashi ( executive producer for the game ) in October 2003 and with Cary Okamin ( writer for the game ) in April 2004 about this " supposedly " sequel .
What were discussed in these exchanges ?
When did the conversation with Vivendi Universal Games stop ?
The easiest answer to this is to visit my website and read the whole long story of Magna Cum Laude at www.allowe.com/Larry/MCL.htm and my off and on relationship with Sierra during its development .
While that game was in development , Sierra was in a death spiral , losing employees , changing management , going through multiple owners , and coming apart at the seams .
It was an interesting mix .
I had conversations with several people ( may be 6 or 8 ) over the two years of that game 's development about Magna Cum Laude .
Most of them said , " Oh , yeah , Al , you really should be involved .
Are you interested ? "
And each time I would say , " I 'd love to .
I 'm very interested .
I 'm sitting at home with nothing to do .
Call me ! "
And then I 'd not hear anything for months until someone else would ask me , " Al , why do n't you get involved in this ? "
And I would say , " Hey , I love to . "
And again , nothing would happen .
The details are too long to go into here , but basically Vivendi wanted to be sure the game changed direction and was not like the old games .
That they accomplished .
Unfortunately , they did n't find the right direction to go .
I rather admire their decision to involve not Larry Laffer in the new title but rather his nephew .
It was a good move that I would have been proud to have thought of .
The problem was with the execution of the game .
It was very uneven .
I think Cary Okamin 's writing was good , but the game was so schizophrenic .
A lot of it felt like Cary had nothing to do with it , but it had been written by a producer or somebody from down the hall .
It did not hold together .
Worse , it did n't satisfy the people who wanted another adventure game , it did n't satisfy the people who wanted an action game , it did n't satisfy the people who wanted a platformer , and those lame mini - games satisfied no one .
In retrospect , how bitter were you about your experience with Vivendi Universal because of that game ?
I had very mixed emotions while playing that game .
I had to go to the store just like everyone else and buy it for full list price when it came out , they did n't even send me a free copy .
When I played it , it was like receiving a ransom video from my son's kidnappers : on one hand , it was nice to know he was still alive , but oh God , look what they 've done to him !
That 's the way I felt .
I was sorry that I was n't involved , but also lucky because , if I had been involved I think there was no way I could have saved it .
Thankfully , my name was n't anywhere associated with it and that 's the way I want to keep it .
It was entirely understandable that you had mixed feelings about that game .
On the other hand , Leisure Suit Larry 8 : Lust in Space was meant to be the true sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 7 : Love for Sail ! for the franchise .
How far had the game development gone when the project was sacked in February 1999 ?
Aside from a 3 - D Larry , what other new ideas had you originally planned for this game , particularly in gameplay ?
That was an interesting time at Sierra .
Management had changed ; Ken Williams was no longer involved in the company .
Sierra had been taken away from him and he was shunted aside in favor of new managers with backgrounds in accounting or business or even oil .
People with no background in gaming were in charge .
It was obvious that things were going to be vastly different .
It was also obvious that adventure game sales were plummeting .
Larry 7 was one of the last adventure games that sold really well , selling 750,000 copies plus many more in the various Larry collections .
After Larry 7 , Grim Fandango came out and did n't do very well , as did other titles that should have been successes .
Gamers were looking for something new ; the business was looking for something new .
Put that together with Sierra 's new management and I did n't have a lot of faith that a new game would sell .
Management wanted to renegotiate my contract and suggested that I " get started on the next game and we 'll work something out . "
My response was " Let 's work something out and then I 'll get started . "
We did this little dance of death for months while I sketched out ideas .
I knew the overall shape of the game , what it would be , and where it would take place , but I refused to design the details of the game until I had a signed contract and that contract never came .
We did do some preliminary development with 3 - D tools because the game would definitely have been in 3 - D. 2 - D game sales are pretty much dead .
I had ideas for gameplay , but after seeing what happened with King 's Quest VIII , I knew that killing everything that moves does n't mix well with adventure games .
Who wants to hack - and - slash your way through an entire level so that when you are done you can the play the adventure part of the game .
That did n't make the hack - and - slash people happy and it did n't make the adventure gamers happy .
I would n't have done that .
But my intuition was correct — Sierra 's subsequent management decided to drop all adventure games .
I was thankful that I did n't spend lots of time working on it !
Aside from Leisure Suit Larry , your other major works included Freddy Pharkas , Frontier Pharmacist and Torin 's Passage .
The characters in these games were very different from Larry Laffer .
Creatively speaking , how different was the writing experience for these games compared with Leisure Suit Larry ?
What aspects of these games were you most and least proud of ?
I looked at those games as a chance to " cleanse the palate " between courses of Larry . < grin >
I enjoy a wide variety of interests , so to do other games between Larry 's , we decided to work our way through all the movie genres .
I started with a Western game ( Freddy ) , then a family title ( Torin ) , to be followed by a spy game and so forth .
I started with Freddy .
I was proud of how well I hid Freddy 's very linear plot from players .
To make it story intensive , the plot advanced throughout the game .
I think most people were never really aware they were on a linear path because the town felt wide open since you could roam around and do many things .
I was least proud of Freddy 's " snail puzzle . "
I assumed it was common knowledge that you could catch snails with beer .
Evidently , I was wrong !
I did n't add enough clues to help people through that puzzle .
Back then , before the Internet , you could n't easily find walkthroughs or get online help .
Although we sold a lot of hint books because of that puzzle , let me assure you it was unintentional !
As to Torin 's Passage , Ken felt that there was an audience for a game like King 's Quest that was n't King 's Quest .
Because I had the most experience with King 's Quest ( having programmed two and written music for others ) , I really wanted to try it .
I wrote Torin's Passage for adults to play with a child .
I got the idea when I took my kids to see Mrs. Doubtfire ( the Robin Williams movie ) .
During that film , I noticed that the audience laughed in two different pitches .
Many lines were aimed at adults ; you 'd hear a deep " Ho , ho , ho " laughter .
But then there were other lines geared for kids that produced tittering high laughs .
During that film , I thought " Why are n't there games like this ?
Why is n't there a game I can play with my daughter where the two of us would have fun together , laughing at some of the same things , but also laughing at different places individually while solving puzzles together ? "
That was my inspiration .
I like variety .
I enjoy the challenge of not writing the same type of game over and over .
Al , do not forget the phone lines that fans can dial in to get the hints !
That 's right !
Sierra had those 900 numbers , did n't they ?
Another source of revenue erased by the Net. Good riddance !
You had worked with many talented people during your career as a game designer .
Who were the top 3 people with whom you most enjoyed working ?
What made these experiences most memorable ?
There were a lot more than 3 !
I 'm not sure who the top 3 were .
I guess Ken and Roberta Williams would have to be 2 of them .
Roberta 's work inspired me to create her kind of games .
Ken 's faith in a music teacher with no programming training and his pushing me to learn assembly language made me realize I actually could code .
We had a great working relationship that became a friendship that endures to this day .
I doubt that people are aware that Sierra nearly folded back in 1983 - 4 .
They had a disastrous Christmas where they issued lots of products for the Atari 2600 that no one bought .
After Christmas , they had millions of returns .
The company had trouble making payroll , let alone funding new games .
They laid off people until there was only a few programmers left .
We actually created The Black Cauldron game in the game room of Ken 's house .
Mark Crowe ( who later worked on Leisure Suit Larry with me ) , Scott Murphy ( who later created the Space Quest series with Mark ) , and Ken himself sat at a big table writing code .
I owed a lot to the Williams .
And then there was Josh Mandel , who has gone on to a certain amount of fame in the game biz .
It was wonderful working with him on Freddy Pharkas , Frontier Pharmacist .
Much of the humor in that game was Josh's .
We had a wonderful time creating that story .
And do n't forget Jim Walls , creator of the Police Quest series .
Most people probably do n‘t know that I was lead programmer on Police Quest I . I worked many long , hard hours with Jim and had a ball doing it .
Bob Heitman was a genius programmer , the man who wrote many of Sierra 's tools .
And Jeff Stephenson , who created the languages that we used , AGI and SCI .
And Mark Siebert who did much of the pioneering work in MIDI music ; Mark later became a producer and produced Torin 's and Larry 7 with me .
There were many really smart people at Sierra in those days and they all were fun to work with .
Maybe that 's why the games were fun to play ?!
That was a lot more than just 3 people !
I 'm sorry .
I failed .
I just could n't do it !
Mature or adult oriented humor is often a difficult element to be incorporated successfully into a game .
Where did you draw the line when deciding what jokes or satires to be included in Leisure Suit Larry ?
How worried were you that the media might find the contents excessively raunchy or offensive to unfairly boycott your games ?
I think the line that I drew was late night television .
I tried to stay current with the U. S. networks in the level of the humor and raunchiness .
I was a Saturday Night Live fan and studied the late night talk shows .
As that humor got more broad and pointed , so did Larry 's humor .
Basically , my " line " was always " Can I go home and tell my wife Margaret about this ? "
If I could n't , I 'd take it out .
If she would n't like it , other women would be offended as well , so I just did n't put that in .
Margaret was my guidance and her influence was important to me because she is a sensitive and modern , liberated woman .
If she thought it was funny , it was funny .
But if she found it too raunchy , it was too raunchy .
I think using your spouse as a measuring stick is always a good idea .
Do you agree ?
Of course !
Successful marriages are built around that .
How do you think I 've kept her for 38 years ?
< grin >
Ken and Roberta Williams had once said that " Sierra had the fortune to be born at ‘ just the right time . ' "
Would Leisure Suit Larry have existed at all if you had got into the industry today ?
How different was the commercial market and gaming culture of yesterdays compared to nowadays that would have influence the popularity of your series ?
Wow , that 's a heavy question !
I promise that the questions get lighter !
Well , okay .
Here goes .
I think the commercial marketplace today is suffering from the same problems that the big Hollywood studios once suffered from .
Hollywood was only interested in making big successful movies that pleased everyone and offended no one .
There was a fear of doing something different .
The business became " follow the leader : " if giant blockbusters sell , let 's all do giant blockbusters .
If special effects movies sell , let 's all do SFX movies , etc .
It was self - defeating because as the films got more repetitious they also got more boring .
But then there was a backlash and small independent films appeared .
They were successful because they were refreshing and different , with interesting , original ideas .
I think that 's where the game business is today .
The big publishers , rightfully so , must play it safe .
If you 're going to spend $ 10 - 20 million making a game , it 's got to sell huge numbers .
Therefore , it must be like another game that 's a big hit .
But if the only way you determine whether to fund a game is compare it to current games , that guarantees you 'll never get anything new .
I was so happy to see Will Wright 's new game which has similarities to other games and yet is totally different .
I think it will be an excellent test .
Will has a lot of power these days , but a person coming into the business now would never get to start a new type of game let alone a series like Leisure Suit Larry .
You could n't start many series today because the publishers are so skittish , afraid of doing anything different .
While I understand their logic , it is difficult to watch .
I 'd love to see games that are unique , unlike anything else out there , and that would only have to sell a few hundred thousand copies to be successful .
I only know of one : Katamari .
It was a cheap game to produce , and while it did n't sell millions , it did make money and so they are going to do a sequel .
But if we were starting out today , it would be really tough to do something original .
Let us talk about what you have done since Sierra On - Line .
What other game projects had you been approached with since your departure from Sierra On - Line in 1999 ?
What would it take for you ( aside from money , of course ) to get involved again with making another game , particularly given the current difficult commercial market for adventure games ?
Many people approached me to do a fan game for fun , like " Hey , Al , why do n't you write a game and I 'll do the programming ? " but I am not interested in that .
Once you have been at the top of the hill , had the best tools , the best artists , and the best programmers at your disposal , it does n't sound fun to start over with nothing .
I lived through the " bearskins and stone knife " period of games .
That no longer interests me .
But , that said , I would love to do another game .
I doubt it would be an adventure game , though .
For some reason , the adventure game market did not continue to grow and evolve as computers became more powerful .
Instead , it shrank .
It is a difficult world out there for a pure adventure game these days .
While Syberia is a good exception to that rule , there are not many others .
So if not an adventure game , what ?
I 'd love to do a game that is a hybrid with aspects of the game genres I love — more action , more platforming , more exploration , but not so much fighting , and in full 3 - D , of course .
I love to have a chance to bring humor to a new type of game .
Who knows ?
Maybe some day I 'll find someone willing to fund it .
It would be fun , would n't it ?
You fans would be disappointed to hear that you might not be interested in doing adventure games anymore !
While I 'd be interested in doing another adventure , I 'm just not certain that there are enough sales to warrant development of new adventures .
That 's the problem .
Your site 's title is an indication of that itself : " Adventure Classic Gaming . "
By adding the word " Classic " you admit that this is something of a certain era .
I agree completely .
I 've said before that adventure games were perfect for their time because back when adventure games were most popular you had to be a puzzle solver .
In order to play DOS games , to set up config.sys files , to alter autoexec .
bat files , to add sound drivers , video drivers , and all that , you had to be a problem solver !
I think that 's why problem - and puzzle - solving games were popular .
And you had to be a typist .
In DOS , you had to type everything through the command line .
That went away with Windows , so the point - and - click adventures fit that new era .
So , there you go .
No offense intended .
No offense taken !
Thank you for plugging our site in your answer !
In 1999 , you launched Al Lowe 's Humor Site .
PC Magazine , in 2004 , named it as among the " Top 100 Sites You Didn't Know You Could n't Live Without . "
What was your motivation or inspiration for creating such a site ?
Along with the site , you had also maintained a free daily email subscription called CyberJoke 3000 ™ .
How did you come up with this name and your seemingly endless source of materials ?
Is that actually a question ?! < grin >
When I started the site , I had no idea what I was going to do with it .
All I knew was I had always collected jokes and humor from the very first time I got online .
My first online experience was in 1978 on a 110 baud ( not 110 Kb ! ) acoustic coupler modem , the kind where you stick the telephone receiver into two rubber cups .
Even then , people always traded jokes with me , which I collected and saved in a continually growing file .
These jokes were always around when I was writing games , so I often added a comedy club to disseminate them .
When I retired , I started a joke mailing list .
It needed a name and since CyberSniff 2000 got a lot of laughs in Larry 7 , I called my joke list " CyberJoke 3000 ™ . "
Over six years and 3,000 + jokes later , it 's bigger and stronger than ever and is now self - supporting .
By that I mean , its members send me enough jokes to keep it going every day .
I 've always enjoyed sharing jokes ; now I get to do it every day , online .
My web site was different .
I was n't sure what I wanted to do with it .
I just knew I wanted to share the humor I loved .
Little did I know !
There 's the old saying about " as ye sow , so shall ye reap . "
That 's what happened .

iBase Entertainment , a development studio which you co-founded in 2005 , just announced the development of Sam Suede : Undercover Exposure at this year 's E3 ( Electronic Entertainment Expo ) .
Without giving too much away , what is this game about ?
What is " Ecstasy Island Mystery Week " ?
The short and thorough answer is to visit www.iBaseEntertainment.com where we post everything about the game .
But in a nut shell , the game is the story of an average guy who signs up for a week 's vacation at a fantasy camp for mystery and detective story lovers called Mystery Week on Ecstasy Island , a lush tropical resort .
While there , a real murder takes place and Sam is called upon to help solve the crime .
During the course of the game 's many plot twists and turns , he turns from a wannabe into a real detective .
As the director and screenwriter , you described Sam Suede : Undercover Exposure as an " action comedy " but not an adventure video game .
What kinds of gameplay ( such as puzzles ) and character interaction can gamers expect from this game ?
It 's not an adventure game in the classic sense of the word , like King 's Quest or Leisure Suit Larry were , although anyone who played Leisure Suit Larry 7 : Love for Sail ! will recognize the way we handle character conversation with dialog topics and trees .
Picture the common action game , but with humor instead of violence .
There will be plenty of puzzles even without inventory manipulation .
For what platforms is Sam Suede : Undercover Exposure being developed ?
How far along is the development at present ?
It 's planned for " next generation " consoles and PC , but will also be available on current general consoles .
We anticipate another year of development , so we 're saying " sometime in 2007 . "
That is just great !
One last question , Al .
What can we look forward to from you over the next 5 years ?
Gosh , my perfect answer would be : a new game in a new genre that would still make people laugh .
Thank you so much for the opportunity to interview you , Al .
All your fans and I are eager to hear more about you and Sam Suede : Undercover Exposure in the near future .
Thank you .
It 's been a pleasure for me , too .
In closing , I 'd like to encourage your readers to drop by www.allowe.com and subscribe to CyberJoke 3000 ™ before I give up on that " double your money back " guarantee !
It was a fine June day in 2007 when a senator from Illinois , then a long - shot for the presidency , stood beside the pumps at Conserv Fuel in West Los Angeles and congratulated the heroes of the biofuel revolution .
Conserv Fuel was one of the first fueling stations in the country to offer biofuel at the pump , and Barack Obama was looking to establish himself as an alternative - fuel - friendly candidate .
He railed against the Bush administration ’s oil - centric energy policy .
He commended Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for establishing a low - carbon fuel standard .
He described the man who brought biofuels to Conserv Fuel , Kris Moller , as a fearless warrior for the planet who went to work while Washington fiddled .
“ Folks like Kris are part of a grass - roots movement that ’s making American greener right now , ” Obama concluded .
“ He ’s way ahead of Washington . ”
Oh , how long ago that day seemed last month when I drove my diesel - powered 2002 Volkswagen into the Conserv Fuel station for a fill - up .
I bought the little green Bug four years ago to run exclusively on biodiesel .
The fuel , made from vegetable oil or animal fat , works in diesel engines just as well as diesel made from petroleum , and it requires no modifications to the machine .
I ’d been a regular at Conserv Fuel ever since I bought the car , but on that June day , the station attendant tried to head me off : “ No more !
No more ! ” he shouted , waving his hands .
When I got closer , I saw what the fuss was about :
The biodiesel pump had a shiny new sign on it : “ Diesel # 2 . ”
Advertisement
The man pointed at a letter taped to the inside of the window .
It said that Conserv Fuel would no longer sell the sweet - smelling , cleaner - burning fuel on which I ’d come to depend .
My local fueling station ’s flirtation with biodiesel was over .
I put enough stinky fossil - fuel diesel in my tank to get home and drove off , shamefully chugging soot all the way .
Conserv Fuel ’s abandonment of biodiesel grew out of a June decision by the State Water Resources Control Board to begin enforcing laws against storing biodiesel underground .
As commercial fueling stations have no economical way to hold fuel in tanks on the surface , the ruling forced most of the state ’s retail biodiesel pumps to switch to petroleum or close .
I ’m all for caution when it comes to storing chemicals in the ground , and California ’s regulators want to avoid another underground - storage fiasco like the one in which the gasoline additive MTBE migrated into drinking water .
What ’s better for the air is n’t necessarily better for the ground , which is why green fuels get no special treatment .
“ Everything that ’s going to be stored underground has to be tested by an independent authority , ” water board spokesman William Rukeyser says .
The problem is that getting a new fuel tested can take up to three years .
And the board ’s concerns would make a lot of sense were biodiesel a new , foreign substance .
But it ’s not .
Several studies have found that biodiesel in its pure form is less toxic than maple syrup ; it degrades faster than sugar .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found its exhaust does no harm to human health .

The water board has said it is less worried about the fuel itself than about substances added to biodiesel .
One agency official claimed biodiesel comes in as many as 1.5 million different formulations .
That ’s a wild exaggeration -- by law every batch of fuel conforms to a chemical standard .
But it ’s true that some manufacturers add preservatives to the fuel to extend shelf life .
Others add a small amount of petroleum so that vendors can take advantage of a tax incentive that the federal government grants to sales of blended fuels .
But none of those additives are necessary , says Eric Bowen , chairman of the California Biodiesel Alliance .
“ Only if it ’s traveling over long distances and in storage for a long time does biodiesel begin to degrade , ” he says .
“ There ’s no practical reason for adding anything to local , sustainable biodiesel . ”
Regulators have already made a temporary exemption for the underground storage of blends up to 20 % biodiesel and 80 % petroleum , just to keep the industry afloat until independent certification comes through .
Why not make the same allowance for 100 % home - grown biodiesel from local producers ?
Such a ruling could help foster the state ’s hoped - for green economy by encouraging ever - more sustainable biofuels .
It could also help us biodiesel users assure our cynical friends that we are n’t destroying rain forests to fuel our cars .
In the meantime , many of us who wanted to reduce the environmental impact of our driving remain helplessly shackled to petroleum , our green dreams thwarted by California ’s inconsistent energy policy .
State agencies pass laws to clean up the air and pledge to address climate change , then allow industry pressure to kill the electric car and throw up obstacles to alternative fuels .
It makes you wonder , were Obama campaigning today , where in California he ’d deliver his defiant speech on energy policy .
It seems unlikely , right now , that he ’d pick California at all .
OTTAWA–Any Canadian citizen who has lived outside the country can legitimately run for the country 's top job , Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged yesterday .
Pressed repeatedly on whether the negative Conservative party ads slamming Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff for his time out of the country represent his own view , Harper dodged a direct answer four times in a Halifax television interview .
Harper defended the campaign 's claim that Ignatieff is " Just Visiting , " saying the source for the ad material is " strictly Mr. Ignatieff 's own words and own record , so he 's the one who has to answer questions on that . "
CTV host Steve Murphy asked Harper a fifth time about his personal view .
" Do you think that he is in any sense disqualified from aspiring to be prime minister because he has been out of the country ? "
Harper stammered , and reluctantly disavowed the main thrust behind his national ad campaign , which just ended its broadcast run .
" Every , every , every , obviously every Canadian citizen 's eligible to run for office , " Harper said .
" But obviously our records , motives , statements , all these things will be under scrutiny , they always are , of all party leaders in an election campaign . "
Asked if he thought the ads " were working , " Harper said " that 's really for party officials who worry about that , " but he suggested the ads had at least one desired effect .
" To the extent that I think the ads have made the Liberal party think twice about having an election , I think that 's been a good result , " he said .
The Conservative party ads attack Ignatieff for " Just Visiting " after spending more than 30 years outside the country as a professor , journalist and author .
The overt message is Ignatieff is running for his own interests , not those of the country .
The Harper interview was conducted by the same TV host who last fall broadcast a campaign interview with then - Liberal leader Stéphane Dion in which Dion stumbled over an awkwardly phrased question about the economy .
The network 's decision to air that interview was recently criticized as unfair by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council .

A few weeks ago , we talked about the future of food and what you can do about it .
With the rise of genetic modification and its threat to biodiversity , saving seeds is more important now than it has ever been .
Not only do we need plants for food , we rely on them for everything from clothing to medicines to the air we breathe .
We could n’t live without plants , and the Kew Milennium Seed Bank is working to archive 10 % of the world ’s most threatened flora by 2010 .
Ten percent may not sound like much , but it ’s actually a huge undertaking .
The project costs around £ 10 million per year to stay up and running , and they ’ve saved over three billion seeds since they launched .
The seed bank is currently having a hard time getting sufficient funds because of tough economic times and the London Olympics .
They ’ve received a £ 2 million bailout from the British government , but the Millennium Seed Bank needs more support .
If you ’re able , you can help out the Seed Bank by making a donation .
To learn a little more about the seed bank , what they do , and why it ’s so important , check out this amazing TED Talk from Jonathon Drori :
The Millennium Seed Bank has partners all over the world that are collecting and preserving native species of plants .
According to their website :
There are over 270,000 plant species on this planet .
One quarter of those plants now face the threat of extinction .
Our mission is to protect the seeds of as many of those plants as possible .
Working with 100 partner organisations in 50 countries , we are aiming to improve the quality and quantity of seed conservation .
Time is of the essence .
Right now , local experts such as botanists and conservationists are hard at work targeting species which urgently need saving .
The Millennium Seed Bank is n’t the only one working to preserve the plant world ’s biodiversity .
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic Circle has been saving food plant seeds since 2008 .
St. Petersburg is home to the very first seed bank : NI Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry , which has been studying and archiving seeds since 1894 .

NASA 's Fermi Finds Gamma-ray Galaxy Surprises
Francis Reddy
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center
Back in June 1991 , just before the launch of NASA 's Compton Gamma - Ray Observatory , astronomers knew of gamma rays from exactly one galaxy beyond our own .
To their surprise and delight , the satellite captured similar emissions from dozens of other galaxies .
Now its successor , the Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope , is filling in the picture with new finds of its own .
" Compton showed us that two classes of active galaxies emitted gamma rays -- blazars and radio galaxies , " said Luigi Foschini at Brera Observatory of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Merate , Italy .
" With Fermi , we 've found a third -- and opened a new window in the field .
" Active galaxies are those with unusually bright centers that show evidence of particle acceleration to speeds approaching that of light itself .
In 1943 , astronomer Carl Seyfert described the first two types of active galaxy based on the width of spectral lines , a tell - tale sign of rapid gas motion in their cores .
Today , astronomers recognize many additional classes , but they now believe these types represent the same essential phenomenon seen at different viewing angles .
At the center of each active galaxy sits a feeding black hole weighing upwards of a million times the sun 's mass .
Through processes not yet understood , some of the matter headed for the black hole blasts outward in fast , oppositely directed particle jets .
For the most luminous active - galaxy classes -- blazars -- astronomers are looking right down the particle beam .
Using Fermi's Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) , Foschini and his colleagues detected gamma rays from a Seyfert 1 galaxy cataloged as PMN J0948+0022 , which lies 5.5 billion light - years away in the constellation Sextans .
Splitting the light from this source into its component colors shows a spectrum with narrow lines , which indicates slower gas motions and argues against the presence of particle jet .
" But , unlike ninety percent of narrow - line Seyfert 1 galaxies , PMN J0948 also produces strong and variable radio emission , " said Gino Tosti , who leads the Fermi LAT science group studying active galaxies at the University and National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Perugia , Italy .
" This suggested the galaxy was indeed producing such a jet . "
" The gamma rays seen by Fermi's LAT seal the deal , " said team member Gabriele Ghisellini , a theorist at Brera Observatory .
" They confirm the existence of particle acceleration near the speed of light in these types of galaxies . "
The findings will appear in the July 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
" We are sifting through Fermi LAT data for gamma rays from more sources of this type , " Foschini said .
" And we 've begun a multiwavelength campaign to monitor PMN J0948 across the spectrum , from radio to gamma rays .
" Another case where Fermi sees something new involves NGC 1275 , a massive Seyfert galaxy much closer to home .
Also known as Perseus A , one of the sky 's loudest radio sources , NGC 1275 lies at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies about 225 million light - years away .
The Compton observatory 's high - energy EGRET instrument never detected gamma rays from NGC 1275 , although it was detected by another instrument sensitive to lower - energy gamma rays .
But Fermi's LAT clearly shows the galaxy to be a gamma-ray source at the higher energies for which EGRET was designed .
" Fermi sees this galaxy shining with gamma rays at a flux about seven times higher than the upper limit of EGRET , " said Jun Kataoka at Waseda University in Tokyo .
" If NGC 1275 had been this bright when EGRET was operating , it would have been seen .
" This change in the galaxy 's output suggests that its particle beam was either inactive or much weaker a decade ago .
Such changes clue astronomers into the size of the emitting region .
" The gamma rays in NGC 1275 must arise from a source no more than two light - years across , " said Teddy Cheung at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " That means we 're seeing radiation from the heart of the galaxy -- near its black hole -- as opposed to emission by hot gas throughout the cluster .
" The Fermi team plans to monitor the galaxy to watch for further changes .
The results of the study will appear in the July 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
NASA 's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is an astrophysics and particle physics partnership mission , developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and important contributions from academic institutions and partners in France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Sweden , and the U.S. Related Links :
Now that Duke Nukem Forever developer 3D Realms appears to have become little more than vapor itself , the unreleased fruits of the game 's art staff have been posted online , ready to be picked over .
In - game screen shots from Duke Nukem Forever art director Tramell Isaac and artwork from concept artist Layne Johnson have been uploaded to their personal blogs .
Both are looking for new employment , should you have use for their technical and artistic skills .
Some of the pieces , characters , enemies and environments may look familiar to those following the DNF development soap opera ; others may not .

Internetsperren verhindern keine Straftaten , aber Strafverfahren Marita Wagner
Die Regierung versucht , eine Zensurinfrastruktur auf der Basis fadenscheiniger Argumente zu etablieren
Während die Diskussion bei den Fachleuten durchaus weiter geführt wurde , schalten die Regierungsparteien bis heute auf stur .
Es wurden nur halbherzig einzelne Argumente der Zensurgegner aufgegriffen , wobei diese auch nicht in ihrer Tragweite vollends verstanden bzw .
vorsätzlich von den Befürwortern ignoriert wurden ( siehe auch : Strafverfolgung oder Internetsperren ? ) .
Dabei zeigt der Bundesrat , dass man durchaus eine inhaltlich vernünftige Stellungnahme erarbeiten kann - wie sie eigentlich vom Familienministerium hätte ausgearbeitet werden sollen .
Er weist darin unter anderem auch darauf hin , dass die Beschaffung , der Besitz und die Verbreitung von Kinderpornografie bereits strafbar ist und , dass man bevor man weitere Maßnahmen ergreift , prüfen sollte , “ ob die bestehenden Möglichkeiten der Strafverfolgungsbehörden tatsächlich unzureichend sind und wie sie effektiver umgesetzt werden können ” .
Sperren statt Löschen ?
Kritiker der Sperren äußerten die Befürchtung , dass Kinderporno - Angebote lediglich gesperrt würden , ohne dass überhaupt ein Versuch zur Löschung unternommen werde .
Die Angebote wären damit weiterhin verfügbar für jeden , der die Sperre umgehen kann .
Darauf ging die Regierung ein und verwies darauf , dass das BKA angewiesen werden solle , die Seiten sofort löschen zu lassen .
Erst wenn dieser Löschversuch fehlschlagen würde , solle überhaupt gesperrt werden dürfen .
Diese Vorschrift bestand in anderen Ländern aber auch und wurde dennoch ignoriert .
Tatsächlich wurde dort teilweise nur gesperrt , aber nicht gelöscht .
Die Frage , wie man das BKA etwa daran hindern könnte , auch so zu verfahren , wurde mit einem " unabhängigen Gremium " , welches aber bisher noch gar nicht definiert wurde , beantwortet .
Dieses Gremium , egal wie es nun aussehen mag , ist allerdings nach wie vor keine echte Kontrollinstanz .
Und rechtlich gesehen bringt es auch keinen Fortschritt , dass immer noch kein Richterentscheid der Sperre vorgestellt wurde .
Dieser wurde von Frau von der Leyen mit dem Hinweis darauf abgelehnt , dass dies bei dem Umfang an kinderpornografischen Sichtungen gar nicht realisierbar sei .
Eine Behauptung , die vor dem Hintergrund fehlender Zahlen zum Thema Kinderpornografie im Internet allerdings bis zur Unkenntlichkeit verblasst .
Die Regierung musste gerade zugeben , sich bzgl .
des Themas in keinster Weise informiert zu haben : weder über die Länder , die angeblich keine Strafgesetzgebung bzgl .
Kinderpornographie hätten , noch über den Umfang der inkriminierten Angebote .
Man kann sagen , die Regierung wurde damit „ in flagranti “ bei ihrem Versuch erwischt , eine Zensurinfrastruktur auf der Basis fadenscheiniger Argumente zu etablieren .
Sperren verhindern weder Straftaten noch Straftäter , aber Strafverfahren
Es wurde von den Kritikern bereits darauf hingewiesen , wie schwierig die Beweissituation ist , wenn das BKA Sperren etabliert .
Auf dieses Problem ist erst gar nicht eingegangen worden .
Vermutlich liegt dies in dem Missverständnis begründet , dass Sperren ja Straftaten wie Kinderporno - Konsum ohnehin verhindern würden .
Davon ist allerdings aus verschiedenen Gründen nicht auszugehen .
Ein Kinderporno - Konsument ist kein Gelegenheitstäter , und er wird auch nicht " angefixt " , wie das etwaige Vergleiche aus dem Familienministerium suggerieren sollen .
Jemand , der Kinderpornografie konsumiert , besitzt eine paraphile Neigung .
Nach derzeitigem Kenntnisstand kann man sagen , dass viele Paraphilien schwer zu charakterisieren und zu umreißen sind .
Insbesondere in diesem Bereich kann man davon ausgehen , dass die Paraphilie nicht heilbar ist und seit der frühen Jugend besteht .
Damit ergibt sich ein ganz fundamentaler Unterschied zu anderen Gruppen wie etwa Drogenabhängigen , die auf Entzug gehen können .
Ein Kinderporno - Konsument kann das nicht .
Diese Erkenntnis steht auch hinter Projekten wie dem der Berliner Charite , das als Anlaufstelle für Menschen mit pädophiler Neigung ins Leben gerufen wurde .
Ein Kinderporno- Konsument wird den Konsum nicht einstellen , wenn man ihm den Zugriff auf Material erschwert .
Er kann in jedem Fall weiterhin bereits privat gesichertes Material konsumieren und auf Kanälen beschaffen , die nicht von der Sperre betroffen sind bzw .
gar nicht über das Internet verlaufen .
Und er kann dieses Material auch weiterhin verdeckt verbreiten .
Selbst wenn er seine Neigung vor sich verbirgt , wird er Sperren gezielt umgehen und damit seine Nachfrage aufrecht erhalten - koste es , was es wolle .
Würde er einfach nur auf eine Art " Stopp - Schild " geleitet , so führt das zu keinerlei Wirkung .
Nur die direkte Konfrontation über ein Strafverfahren oder eine entsprechende Therapie wird beim Konsumenten überhaupt dazu führen , dass er sich seinem Problem stellt .
Und es kann durchaus schlimmer kommen :
Wird diese Konfrontation dauerhaft vermieden , steigt die Gefahr von sexuellen Übergriffen - der Konsument droht die Schwelle zum Täter zu überschreiten .
Es ist für die Strafverfolgung essentiell , dass die Polizei diese Leute ermitteln und entsprechende Netzwerke aufdecken kann .
Wenn Ermittler allerdings vom BKA direkt von einer wichtigen Beweisquelle ausgeschlossen werden , dann ist dies nicht mehr möglich .
Das übliche Vorgehen , dass man ein Angebot erst einmal ermittlungstechnisch auswertet und dann umso effektiver löschen und weiter verfolgen kann , ist damit verwehrt .
Zensur ist keine Option
Damit ist klar , dass eine Zensur hier gar keine Option sein kann , denn in jedem Fall sind Ermittlungen / Strafverfahren einer Sperre vorzuziehen :
Steht das Angebot im Inland , so müssen möglichst viele Konsumenten ermittelt werden , um Maßnahmen ergreifen zu können , danach muss das Angebot geschlossen werden .
Steht das Angebot im Ausland , so ist es wesentlich effektiver , die Konsumenten zu erfassen und der Strafverfolgung zuzuführen , anstatt ihnen einfach nur ein Stopp - Schild vorzusetzen , das sie getrost ignorieren werden .
Eine Sperre kann und darf nicht die Schließung des Angebots im Ausland ersetzen .
Insbesondere sollte sich niemand damit von der Regierung abspeisen lassen , dass man Kinderpornografie im Ausland nicht strafrechtlich beikommen könne .
Es wird immer Mittel und Wege geben , an diese Angebote heranzukommen .
Zudem lässt sich vermuten , dass die Angebote zwar auf ausländischen Servern stehen , aber dennoch von Tätern geführt werden , die in Europa , den USA etc. operieren - also Täter , die sehr wohl der Strafverfolgung nicht entzogen sind , sondern sich mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit im Inland befinden .

We have no issues with Linux , other than that vendors often overlook the platform when it comes to drivers .
Luckily , The Geekess , also known as Sarah Sharp , has coded the first USB 3.0 driver for Linux .
Her efforts will not only make USB 3.0 compatible with Linux when the tech hits later this month , but will also earn Linux the title of " First ! " OS to support the USB 3.0 standard .
Nice !

Twenty years ago , the collapse of communism in Europe was proceeding smoothly .
Tiananmen Square threw this into confusion , writes BBC Diplomatic Editor Brian Hanrahan .
Although it was n't obvious , the Kremlin had given the nod to reformers in Eastern Europe and privately reassured them there would be no Soviet intervention to support the hardliners .
Poland and Hungary had already embarked on the path that would see them transferring peacefully from communist rule .
As tanks were rolling into Tiananmen square , Poland was voting the communists out of power .
Hungary continued to roll up the barbed wire of the Iron Curtain .
Gorbachev 's state visit emboldened Chinese protestors Just as reformers elsewhere in Eastern Europe were starting to take notice - and take heart - events in China threw everything into confusion .
For the old - guard communists , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was fast becoming the man you did n't want to come to dinner for fear of the trouble that a visit from him might provoke .
And so it proved in China .
The democracy movement was already campaigning against the government , but it was a state visit by Mr Gorbachev in May that emboldened its members to take over Tiananmen Square .
There , encamped between the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the walls of the Forbidden City , and the Great Hall of the People , they were a highly visible symbol of dissent right at the heart of China .
Night in the square
It could n't have come at a worse time for the Chinese leadership .
Beijing was full of journalists waiting for Mr Gorbachev to arrive .
I was part of a BBC contingent there in strength for a visit that was expected to be of unusual historic importance - an opportunity to establish a more balanced relationship between these two communist giants after years of antagonism and tensions .
Instead our focus switched to this unprecedented display of political opposition .
I rushed down to the square to view with astonishment the crowds of young people who marched in and camped there .
Moving in formed columns - waving black banners embossed with gold calligraphy - they looked like the vanguard of an approaching army .
And so they proved to be .
From a few tens of thousands on that first day they grew over the weeks that followed to a million strong .
I spent the night with them in the square fully expecting the Chinese police would move in and disperse them during darkness .
That was the Chinese way .
Instead we were still there at dawn when a pink sky showed tiny figures peering down at us from the top of the Great Hall of the People .
The Politburo had come to see for themselves before deciding what to do .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It was the beginning of a power struggle about how to treat the protestors .
The Communist Party general secretary , Zhao Ziyang , wanted to address their grievances .
But the old guard leaders would not tolerate anything which challenged the authority of the communist party .
They prepared to put down the demonstrations by force .
Zhao was removed from his position and placed under house arrest until he died in 2005 .
Only in the last few weeks has his account of events emerged .
( Prisoner of the State : The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang . )
There are striking parallels between what was happened in China and Eastern Europe .
The demonstrators had sympathisers inside the communist hierarchy who were willing to negotiate about their grievances .
The willingness of the army to shoot down protestors was in doubt .
There was unusual media coverage - in Europe it was a deliberate policy encouraged by Mr Gorbachev 's reforms - in China it was an accidental opening created by Mr Gorbachev 's visit .
I remember watching one banner being carried into Tiananmen Square congratulating the BBC on its coverage - evidence of how international coverage was influencing debate in China .
Political paralysis
Without their habitual control of the media , communist leaderships hesitated to take tough action for fear of the damage it would do both internationally and at home .
It 's an illuminating demonstration of how important propaganda was to maintaining communism .
In both Europe and China the mood of euphoria on the streets was matched by political paralysis .
But they were to play out very differently .
In China the elders of the party , under Deng Xiaoping 's leadership , decided to reassert traditional communist control .
They replaced supporters of the protestors , indoctrinated sections of the army to ensure their loyalty , and closed down as much of the international media coverage as they could before taking action .
Then they rode out the firestorm of international protest , despite the long - lasting damage it did to China 's image and its economy .
This option was n't available to Eastern European leaders .
They had neither the economic nor military weight to stifle reform in the same brutal fashion .
And as long as Mr Gorbachev remained in control of the Soviet Union , they could expect no political support from there .
But China 's actions served to hearten those who opposed reform in Eastern Europe .
It was reminder of how previous political challenges had been militarily suppressed in Hungary , Czechoslovakia , and Poland .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
And that autumn I found civic groups in East Germany were being threatened with the " Tiananmen Option " if they continued to bring people on to the streets .
It was a chilling but ineffectual threat so long as Mr Gorbachev ruled .
But his fall from power two years later demonstrated what a narrow window of opportunity there had been for Eastern Europeans to break free from Soviet domination .
What was now plainly on view were two different approaches to reform .
The Gorbachev way was to cede political power and be prepared to see communist control crumble .
The Chinese way made the supremacy of the Communist Party the overriding objective , and it alone would dictate the pace and scope of economic and social change .
China remains , 20 years later , an authoritarian state under the control of the Communist Party .

I ’ve just found this website that has the dubious honour of being delicately entrancing and beautifully crafted , and at the same time one of the worst examples of Unnavigatable Flash Crap .
http://www.ark-plus.com/#/En/main/
It takes a lot from dontclick .it , which I ’m a big fan of .
At the end of my visit , engrossed in drawing shapes and zooming around in their virtual environment thingy , I have no clue what the website is about or what they are selling .
thanks to hebiflux for the link .

A team of young Australian students has won gold at this year 's International Maths Olympiad ( IMO ) in Germany .
The six - member team won two gold medals and was placed 23rd overall out of 104 countries in the competition .
China and Japan took first and second place .
The two gold medals were won by 16 - year - old Sampson Wong of James Ruse Agricultural High School in Sydney and Andrew Elvey Price from Brunswick Secondary College in Melbourne .
It is only the second time Australia has won two gold medals at an IMO .
Sometimes I wonder if cooking is an art or science .
I guess it 's a bit of both .
Some types of cooking though are almost pure science .
Bread baking for example , especially when dealing with natural leavening or sourdough breads .
Making a pie crust or a delicate cake is rather scientific too .
Making soy milk ( to - nyuu 豆乳 ) and tofu（豆腐 ) feels more like a Mister Wizard experiment than cooking .
But it 's a lot of fun .
I have been making my own tofu and soy milk off and on for a while now , and each time it feels like a wonderfully geeky thing to be doing .
It is a bit of a production number , but if you like soy milk or tofu and strange liquids that foam up like you would n't believe , give it a try !
Most of the time I make soy milk for the purpose of turning it into tofu , but on occasion I do scoop off some of that milky , beany liquid to consume as - is .
Unlike the majority of East Asian people , I am luckily not lactose intolerant .
But soy milk is a healthy , vegan alternative to milk .
Freshly made soy milk smells and tastes so much better than the store bought kind , is preservative - free , and altogether nicer .
You can add just the amount of sweeteners or other stuff to your totally pure soy milk and feel awfully good about yourself .
Plus , you can select the soy beans you use .
The equipment and ingredients
1. Soy beans
Naturally you do need soy beans .
You need the white dried ones , not the green fresh ones ( aka edamame ) .
Nowadays you can get dried soy beans from many supermarkets and most health food stores .
Since one reason for making our own soy milk is because it 's ( we hope ) healthier , it makes sense to use organic , non-genetically - engineered soy beans ; a tad more expensive than ordinary soy beans , but worth it just for the ease of mind .
Be sure to get beans that are n't too old ; look at the sell by dates or production dates , and get your beans from a store with a high turnover .
2. 2 large pots , or one humongous pot
You will need a huge stockpot , or two normal - kitchen sized soup or pasta pots , for cooking the soy bean paste .
If you are using two pots , each pot must have at least a 16 - cup capacity , if not bigger .
You 'll see why later .
3 . A muslin , cotton , fine - mesh cheesecloth , or other fairly porous cloth bag
You need a bag made of a finely woven but still fairly porous fabric .
It should also be sturdy enough to stand up to washing , since you will want to use it over and over .
Cotton muslin works great for this .
To make the bag , take an approximately 40 cm x 50 cm or so ( 16 inches x 18 inches ) piece of cloth , fold it in half , and sew up the side and bottom .
If you want to make it neater you can hem the opening .
4 . A food processor or blender
This is to grind up the beans .
That 's all you need .
No need for special soy milk makers and such !
Let 's make soy milk
You will need :
1 bag ( 1 lb/450g or 500g depending on where you live ) organic soy beans
Water
Yes !
That little bag of soy beans is going to give you a big potful of soy milk .
Here we go .
Wash the soy beans , pick out any discolored bits , stones and broken beans .
Cover with plenty of cold water , and leave to soak for at least 8 hours , a maximum of 24 hours .
I find that oversoaked beans result in rather flavorless soy milk .
Change the water a few times during the soaking period , especially during the warmer months .
Sufficiently soaked soy beans should be soft enough to bite through easily .
Drain the soy beans and rinse .
In the meantime , put your two big pots on the range with 8 cups of water each in them , and start heating up .
Put about half of the soy beans in your food processor with the steel cutting blade , and add enough water to barely cover the beans .
Process for about 2 to 3 minutes , until the beans are very finely ground .
You may need to stop the processor halfway through to scrape down the sides .
Do the same with the remaining half of the soy beans .
At the end of this stage you 'll end up with a creamy , foamy goo looking like this .
Divide the mixture evenly between the two pots you prepared previously ( or into your one humongous stock pot ) .
The mixture should not come up more than halfway up the side of each pot .
Lower the heat to medium , and stir and watch the pots .
As the mixture heats , it will foam up a lot , and may threaten to boil over .
If the foam threatens to rise to the rim , sprinkle about a half cup of cold water over it and stir rapidly .
This should make the foam subside enough ( though I have to admit I 've been too late several times and the foam has spread all over the stovetop .
This is when I am glad I have a ceramic top range , though otherwise I wish I had a gas range .
But I digress . )
Here you see two pots of foamy yet under control soy liquid .
Continue to cook this for about 20 minutes , stirring frequently .
It will stop foaming as it cooks .
At the end , the liquid should look rather grainy , as in the picture below .
This means that the milk has separated from the fibrous part of the ground up soy .
Line a bowl with the cloth bag , and ladle in the cooked soy mixture a bit at a time .
Squeeze out the liquid , and put into another , clean pot .
It helps to have a very sturdy spatula to press down on the bag to extract as much of the liquid as possible .
Or , you can wear heat - resistant rubber gloves and squeeze the bag with all your might .
Dump out the fibrous stuff into yet another bowl .
You may need to dump it out a couple of times .
The filtered liquid is pure soy milk .
I like it just plain , but many people have a problem with the slightly grassy taste .
The easiest way to mask this is to add a bit of fruit and to whiz it up into a soy milk shake .
Just half a banana , or a few fresh or frozen strawberries , will do the trick .
You can also add about a tablespoon of honey , fruit juice , or even sugar .
The point is that you can choose what to put in rather than whatever commercial soy milk is sweetened with .
The glass below is a soy milk shake made with half a banana and a handful of frozen raspberries from last summer 's crop .
Now what about that fibrous stuff ?
Do n't just throw it in the garbage .
It 's called okara , and is maybe even more nutrious than the soy milk .
It 's very high fiber as you might expect , and full of protein .
At the very least , it makes a terrific addition to your compost pile .
You can keep fresh soy milk for up to 3 days in the refrigerator , but you should n't try to keep it too long .
Remember this is totally preservative - free .
Okara can be frozen , or spread out onto two baking sheets and dried in a low - temperature oven .
Dried okara will keep in airtight containers or bags for a while .

Nursing Homes and Medicare
Nursing homes … does that send a shiver up your spine ?
I recently became aware of a government Web site that actually ranks nursing homes .
It is the official Web site for Medicare .
I ’m glad I found it because I will qualify for Medicare next year .
http://budurl.com/d3am
Although some are run by the government and some are run by non-profit corporations , most are for - profit corporations .
A nursing home is a business and they must keep the beds occupied .
One of the worst experiences in my life was the day that my father was admitted into a nursing home .
He had been on a wait list , but there ’s no waiting once the bed opens up .
We were given just a couple of days ; mom was at once relieved that dad would get the care for Alzheimer ’s that she could no longer handle and anguished and distressed that she would be separated from a man she had been married to for over 50 years .
Dad never wanted to go into a nursing home .
Ironically , he ’d been on the board of directors of a related nursing home he was admitted to .
As we walked up to the entryway , he knew exactly where he was and he did n’t want to go in .
There was fear in his eyes .
The pain I felt can not be described .
He had to be coaxed in .
Just a couple of hours earlier , mom and I had taken him to the barber and we ’d taken him to lunch at a Chinese restaurant , trying hard to pretend that nothing was about to happen .
I do n’t remember the exact date he was admitted , but there were probably one or two more visits .
At the last visit , I told him I had to go back to Virginia ; I did not know that would be the last time I would see him .
He lasted for three weeks in the nursing home .
In checking out the nursing home he was in , Oahu Care Facility in Honolulu , Hawaii , I ’m glad to know that they received 5 out of 5 stars for their overall rating .
Goodwin House in Alexandria , VA seen in the picture above , also has the highest rating .
The model for many assisted living places now is to have graduated living facilities so that the nursing home would be available later on , should you need it .
In that way , it ’s not such a dramatic change to go from living in your own home to moving to a nursing home .
Such living arrangements make it easier for the spouse to visit .
Like my father , I do n’t think anyone would ever want to enter a nursing home , but it ’s good to know that if the need arises , the Medicare Web site makes it simpler to look at the choices .
Keep in mind , though , these numbers do n’t tell the real story .
They are simply numbers .
If you have the time , an extended visit to the nursing home is always the best option .
However , in many instances this is not always possible .
As always , I advocate taking high quality vitamins and nutritional supplements as well as eating well and exercising .
Taking good care of yourself should always be a top priority .
That ’s one way of staying out of a nursing home as long as possible .
Seems like a good option to me .
How about you ?

A top National Rifle Association official said the Obama administration is using the increased publicity surrounding drug cartels in Mexico as an opportunity to push for reinstating the ban on semi-assault weapons .
“ They ’re trying to piggyback this whole phony issue on the back of the tragedy in Mexico , ” said Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the gun-rights group , on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” on Sunday .
In a speech in Mexico last week , President Obama — who on the campaign trail called for the ban , which expired in 2004 , to be reinstated — said the prohibition made sense but the country should focus on enforcing existing laws for now .
White House senior adviser David Axelrod said the administration will “ monitor ” the issue , which is complicated by opposition from dozens of moderate Democrats .
“ If there ’s a consensus , we ’ll move on it , ” Mr. Axelrod said on the program .
“ We ’re faced with an enormous array of challenges , and we need to make some choices as to which to pursue first . ”
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , a Democrat , called on Congress to reinstate the prohibition after three Pittsburgh policemen recently were killed by a man with an AK - 47 .
He said he understands Mr. Obama ’s decision not to raise the matter now , with other major issues such as the economy and health care on the table .
“ But I think it has to be brought up in the near future , because every police organization in this country supports — virtually everyone supports banning assault weapons , ” he said , appearling alongside Mr. LaPierre .
Mr. LaPierre said that assault weapons are “ functionally no different than any other gun ” and that Mr. Rendell and other supporters of the ban are distorting the facts .
“ It was enacted … on the basis of saying these were machine guns .
That ’s a lie .
They were rapid fire .
That ’s a lie .
They made bigger holes .
That ’s a lie .
They were more powerful .
That ’s a lie .
It was lie after lie after lie , ” he said .
“ Congress found it out .
That ’s why they let it expire , and lies that are found out do n’t get re-enacted . ”
Mr. LaPierre also accused administration officials of mistating the percentage of guns that are smuggled into Mexico from the United States , challenging a popularly cited figure of 90 percent that Mr. Obama used in his speech .
He said there is no proof for the figure , which also has been referenced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
A recent Fox News analysis of the issue noted that the statistic covers only guns that were submitted by Mexico to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Of those 11,000 guns , 6,000 could be traced , and 5,100 of those were linked to the United States .
The 90 percent figure excludes the 5,000 guns that could not be traced , and also leaves out the 18,000 guns from Mexican crime scenes that were not sent to the United States because it was obvious the weapons came from somewhere else .
“ I challenge the president of the United States and the media to prove that 90 percent of the guns used by the drug cartels are being smuggled , ” Mr. LaPierre said .
Mr. Rendell did not address the statistic .
In the often tense debate , both men echoed traditional arguments for and against increased gun control .
“ There ’s absolutely no reason under the sun , no rational reason that we should allow people to legally possess these types of semi-automatic assault weapons .
They ’re made for one purpose .
They ’re not used in a duck line for hunting .
They ’re not used in the Olympics for target shooting .
They ’re used to kill and maim people , and most often it ’s police officers , ” Mr. Rendell said .
Mr. LaPierre argued that increased gun-control limits wo n’t deter murderers and other criminals .
“ Do n’t you get it ?
They ’re criminals .
They violate all your laws , ” he said .

OTTAWA–Elections Canada is scrutinizing almost $ 800,000 worth of expenses filed by Liberal candidates in last fall 's election campaign , The Canadian Press has learned .
The elections watchdog has asked the Liberal party to produce detailed invoices and documentation to prove that a mandatory riding services package was actually worth the $ 2,500 each candidate was required to pay for it .
Until Elections Canada is satisfied that the packages are n't really a thinly - veiled donation to party headquarters , the candidates wo n't receive their election expenses rebates , worth a total of about $ 3.5 million to the cash - hungry party .
" Until that 's resolved , then it 's holding the process up somewhat , " Liberal party national director Rocco Rossi confirmed in an interview Wednesday .
Rossi called the hold - up a " no more than a nuisance " and insisted it had no bearing on Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff 's decision to come to a deal with Prime Minister Stephen Harper to avert a summer election .
He said Elections Canada is simply being more rigorous than it used to be in demanding proof of expenditures , as a result of the so - called in - and - out scandal .
In that case , which is still being fought out in court , the Conservative party transferred cash into and out of local riding campaigns during the 2006 election , ostensibly to pay for national advertising .
Elections Canada maintains the scheme was designed to allow the party to skirt its national election spending limit and Tory candidates to claim rebates on expenses they did n't actually incur .
Rossi said he welcomes Elections Canada 's scrutiny .
" I 'm all for transparency .
Bring it on , " he said .
" We 've got nothing to hide .
There is no in and out here .
There were legitimate services provided to the riding associations that we can show the costing of . "
The riding services packages included buttons , posters , brochures , photos of the leader , and templates for lawn signs , websites and letterhead .
Elections Canada wants the party to account not only for the value of outside suppliers but also to break down the salary costs of party staffers who assembled the packages .
Rossi was somewhat less sanguine in an email sent earlier this month to all candidates ' official agents , obtained by The Canadian Press .
In that missive , Rossi referred to the " absurdity " of Elections Canada 's request .
" As an example , we feel that this request could be compared to the Canada Revenue Agency requesting a full breakdown , including copies of invoices from suppliers plus internal labour and design costs , from a vehicle manufacturer for the sale of a vehicle to an end user rather than accepting an invoice from a dealership , " he wrote .
Although the party has obtained " a legal opinion confirming the absurdity of this request , " Rossi wrote that it is amassing the documentation to comply rather than risk having Elections Canada deny all the riding services package costs claimed by candidates – which would total almost $ 800,000 .
Candidates are eligible for rebates of 60 per cent on valid campaign expenses .
Under Liberal rules , they must give half their rebates to party headquarters .
Hence , if the service packages were not deemed to be a valid expense , candidates would forgo about $ 460,000 in total rebates and the party itself would lose out on about $ 230,000 .
Rossi said the amounts involved are not significant enough to cause him " any anguish , " even though the Liberal party is struggling to close a huge fundraising gap with the cash - hoovering Conservatives .
Rossi blamed the unresolved riding services issue for the fact that only four of 307 Liberal candidates have so far received their expenses rebates – compared to 84 Conservatives , 47 New Democrats and 23 of 75 Bloc Quebecois candidates .
Nevertheless , he pointed out that all parties would have been missing most of their rebates had they been forced into an election this week .
They all would have had to borrow against their expected rebates , he said .
Elections Canada spokesman John Enright said the agency is on track for distributing rebates , which it hopes to have completed by the end of August .
The rate of reimbursements for last fall 's election is so far comparable to that after the 2006 campaign , he said .
As for the request for full documentation about the cost of the Liberals ' riding services package , Enright said that 's " not at all unusual . "
And he said all parties were warned before and during the campaign that all expense claims , including transactions between local and central campaigns , would have to be supported with documentation .

In case you have n't seen the OCC Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives for 2009 , I think you might be interested in seeing exactly what is being hidden off the balance sheets that most American are not aware of ..... try $ 47 Trillion dollars of derivatives backed by the government or rotting in some toxic pool that nobody wants anyone to know about , or more important wants you to know about .
I mean , it 's not like ' we ' the people get a copy of the OCC report in the mail lodged between our National Geographic and Vanity Fair Magazines ...... even if we are the ones that bailed all the crooks and liars out .
Nahhh , we gotta go looking for that little piece of information .
Here it is if you want to take a look at it .
http://www.occ.gov/...
Here is some of the basic information that you need to know for this discussion in general :
* The notional value of derivatives held by U.S. commercial banks increased $ 1.6 trillion in the first quarter , or 1 % , to $ 202.0 trillion , due to the continued migration of investment bank derivatives business into the commercial banking system .
* U.S. commercial banks generated record revenues of $ 9.8 billion trading cash and derivative .
* instruments in the first quarter of 2009 , compared to a $ 9.2 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
* Net current credit exposure decreased 13 % to $ 695 billion .
* Derivative contracts remain concentrated in interest rate products , which comprise 84 % of total .
* derivative notional values .
The notional value of credit derivative contracts decreased by 8 % during the quarter to $ 14.6 trillion .
And the Hall of Greedy Bastards from Hell who would kill their own mothers for a sub - prime loan deal ?
You 'll recognize the names of the absolute worst derivatives offenders :
1 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO .
$ 81,108,352
2 BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION $ 77,874,726
3 GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP , INC .
$ 47,749,124
4 MORGAN STANLEY $ 39,125,255
5 CITIGROUP INC .
$ 31,715,734
The OCC states that 'we the people '( or the Banks , or the FED ) have $ 47 friggin trillion dollars in bad toxic dept that these ' Addicted Gamblers ' deregulating ' profoundly irresponsible ' ( Obama 's words for them ) have jacked up .
I do n't know about you , but I sure have n't heard that ' little piece of news ' slipped into the media somewhere between Michael Jackson 's Toxic Drug Report and reading about the famous ' Oscar Meyer Weiner ' truck running into a house in Wisconsin .
$ 47 trillion dollars .... OMFG .
Why does that sound like all the money in all the world to me ............. and it 's all from those ' fake credit swaps mortgage crunching up bullshit David X. Li Fake economic theory from hell ' gambling crash that no one , I mean no one is ever going to be able to pay off .
Sigh .
Hitting my head again a brick wall feels good right now .
I wish I could put a curse on Hank Paulson and all these crooks to make their anuses itch ( in public ) all the time , 24/7 until they all just ends up in an ' anus itching mental hospital ' for the criminally insane .
Back to Goldman Sachs -
Why is this top dog investment ' team ' doing so well ?
As Robert Sheer puts it so well :
Well , because that was the plan , as devised by Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , a former CEO of Goldman Sachs .
Remember that Lehman Brothers , Goldman 's competitor , was allowed to go bankrupt .
The Paulson crowd would n't let Lehman change its status to that of a bank holding company and thus qualify for federal funds ; soon afterward , Goldman was granted just such a deal , worth a quick $ 10 billion .
Much is now made of Goldman paying back part of its bailout money , but forgotten is the $ 12.9 billion that Goldman got as its cut of the $ 180 billion AIG payoff .
That is money that will not be paid back .
Goldman is considered a very smart bank because it was early in reducing its exposure to the mortgage derivatives that in large part caused the meltdown .
However , it had done much to expand the market and continued to sell suspect derivatives to unwary buyers as sound investments , even as Goldman divested .
The firm still holds $ 1.85 billion in real estate and lost $ 499 million in the previous quarter on bad loans , but made up for it by playing the vulture role and issuing high - interest debt to governments and companies made desperate by the recession that the financial gimmicks of the banks brought on in the first place .
And Goldman was not just another bank .
Before Paulson ran the Treasury Department , another former Goldman head , Robert Rubin , pushed through the repeal of the Glass - Steagall controls on banking activity .
While some now play down the significance of this radical deregulation , not so Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein -- at least not back in June 2007 , when the markets were still doing well .
" If you take an historical perspective , " Blankfein told the New York Times by way of explaining his company 's spectacular success at the time , " we 've come full circle , because that is exactly what the Rothschilds or J.P. Morgan the banker were doing in their heyday .
What caused an aberration was the Glass - Steagall Act . "
That 1933 act was repealed in a law signed by President Bill Clinton at Rubin 's urging , and in the following eight years Goldman Sachs recorded a 265 percent growth in its balance sheet .
" Back then , " the Wall Street Journal reports , " Goldman was churning out profits by trading credit derivatives , speculating on currencies and oil and placing big bets [ on ] the roaring stock market . "
Big bets made in a casino designed by Goldman , which now makes money off loans to the victims .
High on the list of victims are state governments that have to turn to Goldman for money because the federal government that saved the banks wo n't do the same for the states , which have watched their tax bases shrink because of the banking meltdown .
As the WSJ noted , " issuing debt to ailing governments " is now a growth industry for Goldman .
Why did n't the federal government just lend the money to the states ?
Why was all the money thrown at Wall Street instead of needy homeowners or struggling school systems ?
Because the federal government works for Goldman and not for us .
Indeed , when it comes to the banking bailout , Goldman Sachs is the government .
So much so that last fall the New York Times ran a story , headlined " The Guys From ' Government Sachs , ' " that stated : " Goldman 's presence in the [ Treasury ] department and around the federal response to the financial bailout is so ubiquitous that other bankers and competitors have given the star - studded firm a new nickname : Government Sachs . "
One of those stars was Stephen Friedman , another former head of Goldman .
Friedman was both a director of the company and chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank when he helped work out the details of the Wall Street bailout .
The president of the N.Y .
Fed at the time , Timothy Geithner , now secretary of the treasury , requested a conflict - of - interest waiver that allowed Friedman to buy more Goldman Sachs stock , and Friedman ended up with 98,600 shares .
At market close on Tuesday that was worth $ 14,756,476 .
That 's nothing -- three years ago , the 50 top Goldman execs made $ 20 million each , and this year could be better .
They 're not hurting .
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...
Yes , Goldman Sachs and the their ' friends ' at the Federal Reserve .
No one knows how much the Federal Reserve has given them , and no one will , because guess what ?
That 's none of our business .
Hey , it 's only our money , it 's only our country , it 's only our government ....
Is n't it ?
But the tide is changing now .
No more ' conspiracy theory ' excuses from the likes of Goldman Sachs or the Federal Reserve .
The jig is up , and everyone knows it .
There is a growing huge bi-partisan support for both Bernie Sanders bill S604 and HR 1207 to put some Sunshine on Auditing the Federal Reserve who failed us miserably during the financial meltdown .
Alan Greenspan changed the interests rates 18 times to keep that real estate bubble going and that now leaves $ 47 trillion dollars in toxic dept floating around in our financial systems caused by a bunch of out of control Wall Street Banksta Ganstas , who are the ONLY ones hording the money that was literally stolen from us , and who continue , unabated , unashamed and ruthlessly raping the American people every chance they can and without a doubt will continue unless we stop them .
Let 's remember that Goldman Sachs is at the top of that list and their next blood bath is going to be the Cap and Trade business where they 've already got the inside track , as usual .
This video shows the wide support of the FED under Fire , and I urge all of you to call your representatives to support S604 and HR 1207 .
Many of your representatives may already be on the list of sponsors .
267 House members - 55 percent of the House are already signed up , and that list is growing .
$ 47 Trillion - wow what a party these assholes had and who in the hell do you think is going to CONTINUE to pay for it as they continue their rampage with no new regulations in sight ?
It is up to us to stop the insanity , because if we do n't do it , no body else will .
President Obama wants to make the Federal Reserve the ' all powerful Oz ' and god only knows what 's really behind that idea , since we the ' peasants and serfs ' and not allowed to see what is behind the curtain .
Pick up the phone and call this week .
The secrecy has got to end .
The Federal Reserve is not the CIA , ( or maybe they are the ' financial CIA ' ) but it has become very clear that what they are is a conduit for Wall Street and the idea of making them the new ' All Powerful Regulator ' is nothing short of complete capitulation to the Corporate madness and power that had brought our nation to where it is today .

Steve Ballmer woke up thinking this was going to be a good day ... For those of you wondering why Google has n't beenaggressive in its development of the already best - in - show Gmail platform via the integration of its diverse web app suite , the answer appears to lie in a forthcoming product called Google Wave , announced just an hour ago , that takes all - in - one , customizable webapp integration to the next level to consolidate all of your Google - based conversation , collaboration , gaming and geo-spatial interaction into discrete " waves " of information .
In other words , rather than continuing to build onto a focused and already successful email product , potentially 1 ) overcomplicating it for certain users and 2 ) remaining stuck in an old product frame , Google Wave will sit atop apps like Gmail , Chat , Status Messages , Docs , Widgets , Friend Connect , Blogger , Calendar , Reader , Maps , Earth and perhaps even Facebook competitor Orkut , allowing you to mix the info flows in one central location .
Here 's a snapshot of one version of the potentially revolutionary Wave interface :
It 's no accident that Google 's Wave announcement was made simultaneous to Microsoft 's unveiling of its new Bing search engine , which is getting " nice improvement , but I 'll stick with Google " reviews .
My bet is that Wave will mark a far more disruptive forward step in the web experience because of its focus on fundamentally better user : info interaction .
Google 's message rings loud and clear : " Microsoft , while you 're playing catch - up in search , we 're utilizing our already massive and debugged app suite to develop entire new products and integrated search data .
Spend all the money you want on Bing marketing , it 's going to take you years to develop the structured prosumer data necessary to meaningfully compete .
"
Of course , the message actually posted was far more Googly : Further adding strength to the oncoming Wave is the fact that it 's being released as an open model , similar to mobile phone OS Android ( 18 different Android phones will be released in 2009 , others are using it for netbooks ) and Chrome ( already superior in speed and function to Internet Explorer ) , that developers can modify and integrate into their own sites .
By keeping its great googly eye on the information prize and relinquishing development sovereignty and near - term income , Google seems to be out - futuring its competitors on most fronts .
So what will Wave mean for you ?
I think it 's fair to assume that Steve Ballmer and a host of other social media execs are having a bad day .
Update : Here 's a solid description of the philosophy behind the service by Google 's Lars Rasmussen .
Update # 2 : TechCrunch has a great vid interview up featuring the founding Wave developer team .
Update # 3 : Google founder Sergei Brin , who 's working hands - on with Wave , believes the product will do very well , creating a new " benchmark for interactivity " .
The stickier it is , the better for the Big G .
COOPERSTOWN , N.Y. --
As the debate rages over whether a place should exist in the Baseball Hall of Fame for players whose names are linked to performance - enhancing drugs , former home run king Hank Aaron said Saturday that he 's willing to accept steroid users into the club .
But Aaron also believes players linked to performance - enhancers should have asterisks posted beside their career numbers .
And he 's convinced that some of his fellow Hall of Famers would walk off the stage in protest if a confirmed steroid user is ever inducted .
Hank Aaron , shown here at the 2008 ceremonies , believes a number of Hall of Famers would walk off the stage if a confirmed steroid user were inducted .

" The thing is , do you put these guys in , or do you put an asterisk beside their names and say , ' Hey , they did it , but here 's why ? ' "
Aaron told several reporters in Cooperstown .
" To be safe , that 's the only way I see that you can do it . "
Aaron is one of 50 Hall of Famers in attendance for the induction of Rickey Henderson and Jim Rice this weekend .
The steroid issue is particularly hot in the aftermath of Manny Ramirez 's 50 - game suspension ; Alex Rodriguez 's admission that he used performance - enhancing drugs while with the Texas Rangers from 2001 to 2003 ; and a recent New York Times report that Sammy Sosa flunked a drug test in 2003 .
Aaron , 75 , held baseball 's career record with 755 home runs until he was passed two years ago by Barry Bonds , who has pleaded not guilty to lying to a federal grand jury investigating BALCO .
Bonds , who has n't played since 2007 , finished his career with 762 homers .
Although Aaron is not as vehement in his stand against performance - enhancers as some of his fellow Hall of Famers , he believes the gargantuan power numbers amassed in the past decade should be viewed rightfully with skepticism .
" I played the game long enough to know , and it is impossible for players -- I do n't care who they are -- to hit 70 home runs , " Aaron said .
" It just does not happen .
I think that 's one reason why people 's eyes started opening up and they said , ' How can this guy do this ? '
" It 's hard to say the reason you hit a home run is because you 're on steroids .
I do n't believe that .
I believe your body can recuperate quickly to come back on the field .

On his radio show today Lou Dobbs got it all wrong when he praised Jon Stewart of The Daily Show for accurately reporting his Obama citizenship comments .
The problem is that Stewart was making fun of Dobbs , not reporting what Dobbs was saying .
Here is the audio of Dobbs and the video of Jon Stewart .
Here is the audio of Dobbs from Media Matters :

Dobbs said , “ The only news organization to report what I said besides Bill O’Reilly ’s show was Jon Stewart to report that I said he ’s a citizen .
I believe he ’s a citizen .
Listen to what Jon Stewart did , he had a lot of fun with that and , but he did it with wit and humor , and I ’ve got all the respect in the world for Jon Stewart because what he does , he does intelligently , unlike The Huffington Post I mean all these left wing screwballs who are in advocacy groups and the left wing media . ”
Here is the video from The Daily Show of Stewart deconstructing Dobbs ’ argument :
As you can see Stewart was not reporting anything , he was exposing Dobbs ’ for what he is , a birther .
Stewart was mocking Dobbs , yet Lou either does n’t get it , or is pretending not to .
Jon Stewart has said repeatedly in interviews that he does a fake news show , and he practically begs his audience to not rely on his program as a factual source for information .
Yet , here we have Lou Dobbs , who is so desperate for validation that he plays a piece of a comedy segment , which by the way is about who is the bigger right wing douche , to somehow validate his claims of left wing media bias .
I think this move clearly establishes Dobbs as the biggest right wing douche of all .
I know it is tough to put anyone ahead of Glenn Beck and his claim that the half white Obama hates white people , but I think that Dobbs wins by a nose .

[ shal ] Ubisoft [ / shal ] CEO
Yves Guillemot spoke with CNBC on the future of gaming , and touched upon two topics : gaming services , and production budgets , the latter of which Guillemot expects to rise significantly .
“ The next generation is going to be so powerful that playing a game is going to be the equivalent of playing a CGI movie today . ”
Guillemot expects next - gen video game budgets to average $ 50~60 million , which is a little over double what the average retail [ shal ] PS3 [ / shal ] and [ shal ] Xbox 360 [ / shal ] game costs to make .
The forthcoming [ shal ] OnLive [ / shal ] service , which applies the concept of cloud computing to games , was also discussed .
Ubisoft currently supports the service , and Guillemot believes that the success of OnLive may push console manufacturers to release the next round of hardware earlier than expected .
OnLive had a big showing at GDC , but barely made an appearance at E3 .
The service faces a lot of potential issues , including network bandwidth , hardware fees on the provider ’s end , and ability to handle the number of users .
Consoles still have a major advantage over cloud computing because they do n’t fully rely on a user ’s internet connection speed / quality , but with small upfront costs OnLive still has the potential to become a major contendor .

Hank Paulson ’s testimony yesterday was informative , if only because it illustrated that he himself still understands little about the origins and nature of the global crisis over which he presided .
Perhaps his book , out this fall , will redeem his reputation .
A fundamental principle in any emerging market crisis is that not all of the oligarchs can be saved .
There is an adding up constraint – the state cannot access enough resources to bail out all the big players .
The people who control the state can decide who is out of business and who stays in , but this is never an overnight decision written on a single piece of paper .
Instead , there is a process – and a struggle by competing oligarchs – to influence , persuade , or in some way push the “ policymakers ” towards the view :
My private firm must be saved , for the good of the country .
It must remain private , otherwise this will prevent an economic recovery .
I should be allowed to acquire other assets , opportunities , or simply market share , as a way to speed recovery for the nation .
Who won this argument in the US and on what basis ?
And have the winners perhaps done a bit too well – thinking just about their own political futures ?
On who must be saved , we see the new dividing line .
If you have more than $ 500bn in total assets , post - Lehman , you make the first cut .
If you ’re below $ 100 bn ( e.g. , CIT ) , you can go bankrupt .
On remaining private , the outcome is more complicated .
Citigroup had the best political connections in the business , but turned out to be so poorly managed that the state essentially had to take over – in a complicated and ultimately unsatisfactory way .
Bank of America ’s relatively weak political connections meant that the impulse purchase of Merrill Lynch could go very badly – and also led to a bizarre form of government takeover .
The prevailing idea and organizing principle for this new sorting is not Lloyd Blankfein ’s “ we ’re the catalyst of risk ” – investment banks are peripheral , rather than central , to nonfinancial risk taking and investment in this country .
It ’s Jamie Dimon ’s idea : just do n’t demonize the competent bankers , let us take things over and we ’ll smooth it all out .
The problem with this approach is its “ success ” , from the point of view of the remaining bankers – their market share is up so sharply that it ’s embarassing .
Of course , they can still argue that banking is a global industry with many competitors ( some of which are even bigger , with more state assistance , promising much craziness in the years ahead ) .
But the real issue now is concentration in the political marketplace .
Hank Paulson dealt with a dozen big banks / similar institutions with deep connections to Capitol Hill and a very powerful small banking lobby .
Tim Geithner is looking at just a couple of big banks that are still independent .
Probably we should start to divide our big banks into the “ nationalized ” and the “ nationalizers ” .
The small banks still have clout – and you ’ll see them in force on the regulatory reforms debate this fall – but they know now that they do n’t get bailouts , and access to contigent state capital - on - amazing - terms is the ironic basis of modern financial power .
We are looking at a concentration of political power in the US banking system that we have n’t seen since the 1830s : Shades of Andrew Jackson vs. the Second Bank of the United States .
We put up with a lot from our banking elite in this country , but historically we draw the line at financial power so concentrated it can confront the power of the President .
The logic for reform and for breaking up the big banks begins to build .
Bank of America ’s fall was , in some senses , a fortunate accident for Goldman and JP Morgan .
But it has also given them an excessive and unsustainable degree of political power .
Of course , you also have to ask :
Who can break that power , when , and how ?

In the Wall Street Journal 's oped pages today , John Steele Gordon explains why headline - driven politicians simply can't run businesses .
He writes :
The Obama administration is bent on becoming a major player in -- if not taking over entirely -- America 's health - care , automobile and banking industries .
Before that happens , it might be a good idea to look at the government 's track record in running economic enterprises .
It is terrible .
No , that 's not really true :
The first indication that Gordon historical analysis does n't have history on its side is that he has no contemporary examples of failed government - bailout or takeover .
He provides two examples and they are both about a century old : a government - run steel plant from 1913 and a telephone nationalization from 1917 .
I understand that these quasi - wartime nationalizations did not go swimmingly , but really , there are has been quite a bit of history since the Treaty of Versailles .
Are there no good examples younger than the Suffrage Amendment ?
As I wrote yesterday , the government 's bailout record for struggling organizations ( that are not banks ) is surprisingly effective .
As as for banks , recent world history suggests that nationalization can work .
It 's a bit surprising to read an article about nationalization and US banking policy and not hear about Scandinavia .
So if Gordon wo n't make the point , I will : Sweden nationalized its own struggling bank systems quite successfully in recent history .
All she wants is the rain water that lands on her roof .
She lives with her husband and two children in a solar - powered home in rural San Miguel County .
Committed to promoting sustainability , Kris Holstrom grows organic produce year - round , most of which is sold to local restaurants and farmers markets .
On a mesa at 9,000 feet elevation , however , water other than precipitation is hard to come by .
So Kris did what thousands of farmers before her have done :
She applied for a water right .
Except instead of seeking to divert water from a stream , she sought to collect rain that fell upon the roof of her house and greenhouse .
To her surprise , the state engineer opposed her application , arguing that other water users already had locked up the right to use the rain .
The Colorado Water Court agreed , and Kris was denied the right to store a few barrels of rainwater .
If she persisted with rain harvesting , she would be subject to fines of up to $ 500 per day .
How could this happen ?
Like other western states , Colorado water law follows the prior appropriation doctrine , of which the core principle is “ first in time , first in right . ”
The first person to put water to beneficial use and comply with other legal requirements obtains a water right superior to all later claims to that water .
The right to appropriate enshrined in Colorado ’s Constitution has been so scrupulously honored that nearly all of the rivers and streams in Colorado are overappropriated , which means there is often not enough water to satisfy all the claims to it .
When this happens , senior water - right holders can “ call the river ” and cut off the flow to those who filed for water rights later , so - called “ juniors . ”
Overappropriated rivers are not unique to Colorado .
Most of the watercourses in the West are fully or overappropriated .
Yet other western states allow or even encourage rainwater harvesting .
The obstacle for aspiring rainwater harvesters in Colorado is not the state constitution .
It speaks only of the right to divert the “ unappropriated waters of any natural stream . ”
The problem arises because Colorado ’s Supreme Court has given an expansive interpretation to the term “ natural stream ” and coupled that with a presumption that all diffused waters ultimately will migrate to groundwater or surface streams .
And because most streams are overappropriated , collecting rainwater is seen as diverting the water of those who already hold rights to it .
How is a roof a “ tributary ” ?
Applying this legal fiction to Kris Holstrom ’s effort to grow food at home , the state engineer argued that her roofs were “ tributary ” to the San Miguel River .
Because the San Miguel River is “ on call ” during the summer months , Kris ’s rain catchment would , the state engineer argued , “ cause injury to senior water rights . ”
The court agreed , even though there was no proof that the water dripping from Kris ’s roof would ever make it to the river .
If Kris wanted to collect rainwater for her gardens , she ’d have to pursue an augmentation plan and convince the state engineer and water court that she could replace 100 percent of the precipitation captured .
Not only did she have to return to the stream every drop of rain she collected , she would have to pay for a complex engineering analysis to prove that her augmentation water would return to the stream in a timeframe mimicking natural conditions .
She did n’t even try .
“ The farm does n’t make enough money to pay for an engineering analysis , ” she said .
Indeed , it ’s difficult to imagine a situation where it would make financial sense to harvest free rainwater that has to be replaced with another source of water .
The notion that you ca n’t utilize the rain falling on your roof might be easier to accept if you really were interfering with senior water rights , but in many situations it just is n’t true .
In Kris ’s case , most of the rain she collected would have evaporated or been transpired by native vegetation long before it ever reached the San Miguel River .
Hardly a drop in the bucket
A recent study commissioned by Douglas County and the Colorado Water Conservation Board has confirmed that very little precipitation that falls on an undeveloped site ever returns to the stream system .
The study focused on an area in northwest Douglas County , where the average annual precipitation is 17.5 inches .
In dry years , 100 percent of the annual precipitation is lost to evaporation and transpiration by vegetation .
In wet years , a maximum of 15 percent of the precipitation returns to the stream system .
On average , just 3 percent of annual precipitation ever returns to the stream .
Despite this hydrological reality , Colorado law requires anyone wanting to use rainwater catchment to send to the stream an amount of water equivalent to 100 percent of all precipitation harvested .
That is , in effect , a gift to prior appropriators paid for by folks trying to live more sustainably .
An effort to address this problem stalled in the Colorado legislature this past session .
A bill by state Sen. Chris Romer , D - Denver , would have allowed rural residents not on a municipal water system to store rainwater in cisterns up to 5,000 gallons .
The bill also would have authorized 10 pilot projects where new housing developments could collect rainwater from rooftops and other impermeable surfaces .
But even this tepid effort to update water law was sent to committee for further study .
The committee should use this study period to produce a bill that takes a more aggressive approach to water sustainability .
The first thing is to make sure the benefits of rainwater harvesting are not dissipated into oversized yards filled with water - guzzling bluegrass .
A serious effort would limit harvested rainwater to food production and Xeriscaped yards .
A resource down the drain
Even greater benefits could be achieved by promoting wide - scale rainwater harvesting in developed areas .
Traditional land development practices typically direct runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces to pollutant - laden streets and parking lots , and then toward storm drains .
Both of these problems would be ameliorated if all buildings were equipped to catch rainwater for later use .
Additional benefits could be realized if the water collected from rooftops was brought inside for nonpotable uses .
Rainwater that would otherwise be lost to evaporation or storm drains could be used in toilets and washing machines , and then sent to the treatment plant , thereby bringing more water into municipal water systems .
Colorado is expecting 3 million new residents by 2035 .
At the same time , climate change may be conspiring to exacerbate the water woes of all of the states served by the Colorado River .
Rainwater harvesting is no panacea to deal with water shortages , but it should be part of a multifaceted approach to a looming crisis .
Fully utilizing precipitation where it falls reduces the demand on other water resources , leaving more water in streams or aquifers .
The most important benefit of a legal change stimulating wide - scale rainwater harvesting may be its fostering of a new water ethic .
People who make a personal effort to collect and utilize rain are less likely to waste water or tolerate public policies that allow waste by others , such as inefficient irrigation or inappropriate residential landscaping .
When people are maintaining gutters and cisterns to flush their toilets or grow their gardens , they are more likely to appreciate the importance and scarcity of water .
They might finally say no to headlong growth that shows no regard for long - term availability of future water supplies .
Colorado should embrace rainwater harvesting .
The legal fiction that all rain is tributary to a stream should be abandoned .
Others should not be allowed to own the rain that falls on your roof before you can use it for reasonable domestic uses .
Fats Are Good And Essential For You
Hi .
Today we shall take a look at fat from a different perspective .
I say ‘ different ’ because fat 9 times out of 10 is written about with a tone of shedding , burning , losing and the like as though it is a non-requirement by the body .
We are given some fat content in our bodies for a reason else evolution would have done away with it .
Look at the functions fat in our body performs :
1. Production of blood lipids
2. Production of cell membranes
3. Essential in the production of bile ( the fat emulsifier )
4. Necessary for energy production ( in combination with glucose )
5 . It helps produce Vitamin D for calcium metabolization , and
6 . Fat triggers the release of mild levels of body steroids
Fat is necessary for survival .
Diets with no fat in them cause several body and organ malfunctions .
Here is what you could be risking if you tune into extreme diets :
1. Erratic ( alternating between very low and close to normal ) blood pressure
2. Continued blood flow from injuries
3 . Severe constipation
4. Immune system malfunction
So , what are the types of fats you should aim to include in your diet everyday and how much of it is okay ?
Fat types Good / Bad Sources Acceptable Quantity Monounsaturated Fats Good Olive oil , Avocados , Canola , Peanut oil , Nuts , Wholegrain , Sunflower , Sesame and Safflower oil etc 15 grams a day .
Polyunsaturated Fats Good Salmon , Tuna , Sardines , Walnut , Flax seed oil etc 20 grams a day Saturated Fats Bad Red meats , Whole milk , Cheese , Sour cream , Ice cream , Butter , Coconut oil and milk , Palm oil , Lard etc
Not more than 15 grams a day .
Lesser if you do not workout .
Hydrogenated or Trans Fats Bad processed and fast foods , margarine , cake mixes , soups , cookies , donuts , pound cakes etc Less than 1 % of total energy requirements in a day
Until next week , eat right , stay healthy ..

Advertisement Texan cattle rancher Mike Baca seems an unlikely evangelist for the American green revolution .
When he voices a visceral dislike of the " Washington liberals " there seems to be little hint of the environmentalist beneath the cowboy hat and saucer - sized belt - buckle .
But Mike is proof that renewable energy now unites the partisan debate on climate change .
Many Republicans sceptical of climate science support a major expansion of renewables to ease their nation 's dependence on foreign oil .
In Mike 's case , the tantalising prospect of pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars from wind turbines on his ranch proves an extra incentive .
The sprawling ranch lies in the Texas panhandle on the high plains near Amarillo .
Mike will not say how much land he owns but it stretches way beyond the horizon in all directions .
These high plains were considered low - grade land until engineers developed the fan - shaped wind pump to suck water from the shallow Ogallala aquifer and create cattle country .
Donny Allred says this is the " perfect marriage " of two industries
The aquifer is running dry but engineers have again harnessed the wind to bring income to the relatively small number of people who own these vast empty spaces .
Mike is one of them .
His nearest neighbours are miles away .
From the porch of his ranch - house - Tuscan with a Texan twist - at the floor of a verdant canyon he can sip bourbon and watch the giant blades turning a perpetual profit .
" I like them .
And I like the cheque that comes with them , " he says .
" I could do with a few more of them .
We have to be concerned about what the world will be like for our grandchildren .
If the turbines get noisy I can just switch on the fountain . "
Texas utilities are planning a high voltage loop around the Panhandle to carry the power to the population centres of Dallas - Fort Worth and Houston .
For Mike , the wind turbines turn a perpetual profit Donny Allred , the local county judge , is lobbying to lure the power lines to Amarillo .
" This is the most perfect marriage of two industries - wind and cattle ranching , " he says .
" They were made for each other . "
The power lines will carry about 50 % wind power and 50 % from coal and gas to ensure security of supply .
The great river of wind that flows from Texas to the Canadian border is one of the finest renewable energy reserves in the world and the American Wind Energy Association estimates that it could power America twice over .
Ranch land is plentiful and the cows do n't protest that their view is being spoiled - in fact they shelter in the shade of the turbine towers .
The profits are so easy that while energy investments have been plummeting worldwide , the high plains have been distracting the footloose energy giants from their planned offshore wind projects in the UK .
The Obama administration is now working with American utilities nationally to create interconnectors to get the power where it is needed to the great cities on the coasts .
The cows do not protest about the turbines
Some of the " wind states " have passed local laws stipulating the use of wind energy but some have been slow to capitalise .
The Waxman - Markey Climate Bill going through Congress would mandate a minimum 20 % renewables target for all states by 2020 .
The proposal has been watered down from 25 % renewables in 2025 .
It is resisted by some politicians in south - eastern states where there is high dependence on Appalachian coal and less plentiful wind or solar power .
The US energy secretary Steven Chu told BBC News that the 20 % target was easily achievable .
But environmentalists oppose it for that very reason .
They say many states are on track to achieve more than 20 % renewables by 2020 .
At a rally in Amarillo there were views from both sides of the political divide Jennifer Layke from the World Resources Institute in Washington told BBC News : " I think that we could do more with the emissions targets on the renewables front .
" I think this is a political compromise to manage issues associated with specific geographical concerns for the southern part of the United States and other areas . "
" As such , I think it creates the floor for action .
That 's a big improvement .
It does not necessarily create the exponential scale - up of renewable technology that we need to combat climate change . "
Either way , the renewable revolution has widespread support .
At a rally of the Goldwing Road Riders in Amarillo we met bikers from both sides of the political divide .
They were united over wind .
Biker Wayne Jones said : " Oh lord !
Climate change .
I think that the wind is better than oil .
It is a whole lot cleaner .
Mother nature has given you the wind .
It is free energy . "
Deborah Jones , another biker at the rally , told BBC News : " We need to be self - sufficient .
As a nation , we need to rely on the United States . "

Intel is expected to update its processor lineup with the introduction of more affordable Nehalem derivatives later this year .
Although the official launch is n’t planned until sometime around September or October , we know samples have already been sent to partners , and now it appears that the very first pictures and benchmarks of a so - called Core i5 part have made their way onto the web .
The aforementioned details were made public in a recent post on Asian hardware site Xfastest , which included 3DMark Vantage scores and results from the suite of CPU tests in Everest Ultimate Edition .
Tests were performed using a reference Intel motherboard , where the 2.66GHz Core i5 part seemed to yield better results than a Phenom II X4 955 running at 3.2GHz .
The Phenom II X4 955 currently sells for around $ 245 , while the Core i5 is expected to cost $ 196 .
Performance differences were n't that large , though , and seeing that these are the first benchmark results made public , we should probably hold judgment until we can perform our own tests or a more thorough review of the chip is leaked online .
Also , by the time Intel officially takes the wraps off its Core i5 processors , AMD is expected to have several new 45 nm quad - core models in the market .
The word netbook may soon vanish into irrelevance , but the products that resulted from the category are not going away any time soon .
Indeed , they 're on the verge of injecting their DNA into a broad swath of the PC market .
Despite their shipments slowing down in the first quarter of 2009 , inexpensive and low - powered netbooks are poised for rapid growth as their feature sets continue to mature .
Research company International Data Corporation forecasts that the netbook market will more than double by the end of 2009 .
" The mini notebook is doing what the notebook did , " said Richard Shim , an analyst with IDC .
" It went from a very targeted niche into something that appeals to a greater audience with specialized configurations ....
The industry gradually changed and moved away from ' performance is king , ' and now they want a more personalized experience .
Now , customization is king . "
Netbooks — 8 - to 10 - inch notebooks that typically cost between $ 200 and $ 500 — saw a boom in 2008 when manufacturers shipped 11.6 million units worldwide .
Last year , netbooks were considered some of the hottest gadgets in the tech industry , with several major manufacturers including Toshiba , Dell , HP and Samsung rolling out offerings in this device category .
Some analysts say the poor condition of the economy was the primary factor driving the success of netbooks .
However , netbook sales have already slowed down in 2009 , and shipments are falling below manufacturers ' expectations .
Taiwanese manufacturer Asus , for example , expected to ship 1 million netbooks in the first quarter of 2009 , according to a report in DigiTimes .
But IDC 's tracking indicates Asus shipped only 700,000 units that quarter .
Shim noted , however , that first - quarter numbers are generally low compared to the rest of the year for any tech manufacturer ; most sales come from the holiday and back - to - school seasons .
Also , companies are beginning to shift focus onto a category called " consumer ultralow - voltage notebooks " — notebooks with 12 - or 13 - inch screens containing the same low - powered , inexpensive guts as netbooks .
These devices compensate for some of the shortcomings of netbooks — cramped keyboards and small screens — while offering impressive battery life and a light weight of about 3 pounds for a modest price range of $ 500 to $ 700 .
( See our review of Samsung 's $ 550 , $ 12 - inch NC20 notebook as an example . )
If CULV notebooks are considered in the same device category as netbooks , then the netbook category is on track for massive growth .
Shim clarified IDC 's definition of a mini notebook : 7 - to 12 - inch notebooks powered by an Intel Atom processor , capable of running a full operating system such as Windows XP .
IDC forecasts manufacturers will ship 26.5 million " mini notebooks " by the end of 2009 , or more than double the 11.6 million units shipped in 2008 .
The mini notebook category has claimed roughly 17 percent of the worldwide notebook market , and IDC expects this number to remain consistent over the next few years .
Michael Gartenberg , a technology strategist at Interpret , has high expectations of these new notebooks .
He explained that the more netbooks ' capabilities increase , the more people will buy them .
And bigger screens and full - size keyboards definitely add to capability , he said .
The notebook space will get very interesting once CULV notebooks drop to $ 300 or $ 400 , Gartenberg added .
One could say the netbook is " failing " if one does n't consider a CULV notebook to be a netbook — but it 's purely semantics at that point .
The least that everyone can agree on is that CULV notebooks evolved from netbooks .
" We may just be beginning to see the end of the pure ' netbook ' era , as vendors start bringing devices to market with 12 - inch screens , full - size keyboards and larger hard drives , " Gartenberg said .
" The concept of the netbook is beginning to vanish as a thing itself .
By the end of the year it 's just going to be called a cheap PC . "
At the recent All Things Digital tech conference , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called netbooks " revolutionary " devices .
But perhaps they would be more accurately described as evolutionary .
In addition to CULV notebooks , netbooks are inspiring other product types as well , said Brad Linder , owner of Liliputing , a blog devoted to compact notebooks .
For example , some manufacturers are experimenting with the concept of the " smartbook " : netbook - like devices that run smartphone operating systems such as Android .
Given the little power required to run a smartphone OS , the smartbook concept could lead to even thinner notebooks than the ones we see today , as well as incredibly long battery life .
" Netbooks will probably stop being called netbooks at some point :
The lines [ between netbooks and notebooks ] are becoming less distinct as the days go by , and there 's going to be a continuum , " Linder said .
" What really happened in the last year or so is [ manufacturers ] delivered good - enough computing at low cost .
And It 's what a lot of people have been waiting for . "

He returns to the U.S. on Aug. 8 .
A majority of peoples around the world want their governments to put action on climate change at the top of the political agenda , a new global public opinion poll suggests .
Unfortunately for Barack Obama though , who has put energy reform at the top of his White House to - do list , Americans are not necessarily among them .
Only 44 % of Americans thought climate change should be a major preoccupation for the Obama administration , the survey co-ordinated by the University of Maryland 's Programme on International Policy Attitudes said .
The only other two countries unwilling to see their governments make climate change a top focus were Iraq and the Palestinian territories .
In 15 other countries though there was strong support for governments to do more to deal with climate change .
Britons were among the most enthusiastic supporters for greater government intervention , with 77 % urging officials to do more .
Germans , however , think their government has already done enough .
Some 83 % think their government has already adopted climate change action as a top priority ; 27 % would like the government to turn its attention elsewhere .
" The public is pulling for more — a lot more , no , but a bit more , yes .
There is definitely political capital there to move the ball forward and that is pretty much universal , " said Steven Kull , the director of the survey which drew on data gathered by academic and marketing polling organisations in the respective countries .
Overall about 73 % of those polled believe governments should make climate change a top priority .
The poll , which sampled the opinions of 18,578 people in 19 countries , found broad popular support for making climate change a top priority extended even to those countries whose governments have yet to commit to global action .
In China there was overwhelming support — 94 % — for the government to keep climate change on the front burner .
And in India , which is also rapidly emerging as one of the world 's leading producers of global warming pollution , 59 % of the public wanted their government to make climate change a top priority .
That defies the hard line taken by the country 's environment minister , Jairam Ramesh , earlier this month against putting any cap on its greenhouse gas emissions .
Around the globe , the public was unconvinced their governments were assigning high enough priority to climate change .
The disconnect suggests that there is greater public support for action on public change than elected officials realise , Kull said .
" There is a tendency among policy makers to underestimate people 's readiness for action . "
Only four countries — Germany , Britain , China , and Indonesia — considered that their governments were focused on climate change .
But , that did not necessarily satisfy the demand for even greater action .
Although the majority of Britons , 58 % , credit the government with making climate change a major priority , even greater numbers , 89 % , believe there is room for the government to do even more .
John Yoo : Professor of Law at Boalt Hall School of Law in Berkeley , California ( UPDATE : Chased out of Berkeley and now at Chapman ) , ( but a lawyer with the Pennsylvania bar from which he should be debarred and would be if enough people demanded it ) counseled the White House on how to get away with war crimes , wrote this memo promoting presidential power to launch aggressive war , and claimed the power to decree that the federal statutes against torture , assault , maiming , and stalking do not apply to the military in the conduct of the war , and to announce a new definition of torture limiting it to acts causing intense pain or suffering equivalent to pain associated with serious physical injury so severe that death , organ failure or permanent damage resulting in loss of significant body functions will likely result .
Yoo claimed in 2005 that a president has the right to enhance an interrogation by crushing the testicles of someone 's child .

Anything for a homie !
In an interview Friday on “ The Early Show , ” Keith Lewis , the co-director of the Miss California Pageant , admitted to helping Prejean get the breast job .
“ We assisted when Carrie came to us and voiced the interest in having the procedure done , ” Lewis told “ Early Show ” co-anchor Maggie Rodriguez .
Here are some excerpts from the interview :
LEWIS : Well , we would never encourage her to go that route , but “ …
RODRIGUEZ : But why not discourage her ?
LEWIS : “… it ’s a personal choice .
Well , I think that it ’s about how a woman feels about herself .
In terms of , for me , it ’s not a personal choice that I would recommend .
But at the same time , I know so many women that have done the procedure and feel better about themselves and the way they present themselves .
But “…
LEWIS : But there ’s plenty of ways of getting to more proportion without doing breast implants .
RODRIGUEZ : Well , but if “ …
LEWIS : Many of the girls use chicken cutlets .
RODRIGUEZ : “… if you have a flat chest , what are you supposed to do ?
LEWIS : You use chicken cutlets .
You use tape .
You use anything that you can to enhance the line .
There ’s lots of tricks of the trade .
Whoa .
Wait , what ?!
They ’re stuffing their bikini tops with pieces of chicken ?
Free range , we assume .
Oh , never mind .
The Internet tells us these are silicone pads that are shaped like chicken cutlets .
Carry on .
" TELL THE COPS I KNOW ALL MY RIGHTS ! "
' He looks like a Jackson , acts like a Jackson , can dance like a Jackson , ' Joe Jackson says of the aspiring rapper .
Just a day before the custody of Michael Jackson 's three children is to be determined , the singer 's father , Joseph Jackson , gave an interview claiming that the self - proclaimed King of Pop had sired a fourth child .
The Jackson family patriarch spoke to NewsOne.com about his son's alleged love child , a 25 - year - old aspiring rapper from Norway named Omer Bhatti , who was seated in the front row with the Jackson family at the memorial service for the pop star .
" Yes , I knew he had another son , yes I did , " Joe Jackson said .
" He looks like a Jackson , acts like a Jackson , can dance like a Jackson .
This boy is a fantastic dancer , " he added .
The strangest part of the revelation is that Bhatti has reportedly already denied its veracity .
The English tabloid the Daily Mail reported recently that Bhatti said he was nothing more than a " best friend " to the singer , though the story did not appear to have any direct quotes from Bhatti , who is since said to have returned to his native Norway .
Omer moved to Jackson 's Neverland Ranch with his family in 1996 when he was 12 , where his mother served as a nanny and his father a driver for the singer , and he frequently traveled with Jackson .
Much has been made of his resemblance to Jackson and the singer 's youngest child , Prince Michael II , and Jackson is said to have initially been drawn to Bhatti due to the youngster 's classic - era MJ dance moves .
The aspiring musician was living at Neverland in 2003 when police descended on the ranch looking for evidence of child molestation against Jackson and was initially on a witness list ; the singer was acquitted of molestation charges two years later .
Bhatti is reportedly seeking a DNA test to determine whether Jackson is his father .
Jackson 's brother , Jermaine , recently told the Daily Mail that " if Omer 's his son , he 's his son .
...
We wo n't deny it .
We are going to give him the same love and care that we give to Prince and Paris and Blanket . "
Bhatti's birth was reportedly the result of a one - night stand Jackson had with a Norwegian fan in 1984 .
If the story is true , then Bhatti would become Jackson 's fourth child , after Prince Michael , 12 ; Paris Michael , 11 ; and Prince Michael II ( a.k.a. Blanket ) , 7 .
Asked if maybe Bhatti , whose stage name is O - Bee , is the musical future of the family , Joe Jackson said , " I do n't know .
I can't say that yet until I see it happen . "
MTV News was unable to reach Bhatti for comment .
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) --
Tens of thousands of people converged Thursday on a park to mark the 20th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square .
A man holds up a candle in honor of the Tiananmen victims at the Hong Kong candlelight vigil .
Organizers estimated that 150,000 people attended the candlelight vigil , while Hong Kong police put the number lower , saying there were 63,000 .
The gathering , which marks the sole commemoration on Chinese soil of the protest , was organized by the Hong Kong Alliance .
The candlelight vigil was held as authorities in mainland China stepped up controls on media and Internet news and social networking sites .
They also hindered attempts by CNN reporters to film at Tiananmen Square on the eve of the anniversary .

Hong Kong is known for having a tolerant attitude to protests , and the vigil has been held in the southern Chinese enclave 's Victoria Park for years .
Thomas
Yau , a 75 - year - old originally from Beijing , said this was the first time he had been to a vigil honoring lives lost in Tiananmen Square , despite moving to Hong Kong 30 years ago .
Asked why he was attending Yau told CNN : " To feel the whole atmosphere , to feel what it 's like in Hong Kong about this whole Tiananmen incident and tell my friends who have spent their whole lives in China that actually we can do it and spread the idea that we should fight for democracy . "
The Hong Kong Alliance , which put on the vigil , also held a march in the city over the weekend that included a former Tiananmen student leader making his first trip back to China after fleeing 17 years ago .
" It 's just like a copy of 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstration .
It 's not only a copy , it 's more , more than that ...
It reminded me of everything 20 years ago , " Xiong Yan , now a U.S. Army chaplain in Alabama , said of the hours - long march last Saturday .
" If we take action , we can make change , we can do something .
...
We have power right now , I mean peaceful power . "
Xiong
Yan 's presence was the first time a former Tiananmen student leader was able to come to Hong Kong to address a crowd , said Lee Cheuk Yan , vice chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance .
Authorities in China are " almost systematically eliminating the memory of June 4th itself , " he said .
" So by coming out , our generation as a witness is trying to tell our next generation it 's important to pass the torch onward -- that China has not yet democratized and not yet vindicated June 4th .
So , we need to struggle onward for democracy . "
Yau King Chi , a 19 - year - old university student of social work in Hong Kong , went with about 10 classmates to Victoria Park .
They held handwritten signs calling for democracy in China and better education about the Tiananmen chapter in Hong Kong schools .
" The Chinese government still has not recognized that they have done the killing in June 4 , 1989 , so we hope that through this candlelight ( vigil ) we can urge the government to say that they have actually done this massacre and take up the responsibility , " he said .
The organizers were aiming for a crowd of 100,000 , many from mainland China .
At the 15th anniversary commemoration , 82,000 people had turned out .
A little more than 20 years ago , students gathered in Tiananmen Square to memorialize the recently - deceased Hu Yaobang .
He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xiaoping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward " bourgeois - liberal ideas " and tolerating student protests .
The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause .
On June 4 , Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square .
Fact Box Annual June 4 survey of Hong Kongers
69 percent say the Chinese government did the wrong thing ; 13 percent say they did the right thing
61 percent say there should be a reversion of the official stand on the incident ; 22 percent say there should not
56 percent say the Beijing students did the right thing 19 percent say they did the wrong thing

The soldiers , on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city 's main thoroughfare .
Along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them .
When the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead .
Relatives of victims renew their hopes every year that Beijing 's leaders will reverse the verdict that the protests were a counter - revolutionary rebellion that had to be put down .
" My son was innocent , he committed no crime , he did n't steal , he did n't kill anyone , he was just a child , " said He Fengting , whose son Liang died during the 1989 protests .
" How can they be so cruel ? "
A University of Hong Kong survey found that more than 60 percent of Hong Kong residents support a revision of the official stance on the Tiananmen uprising .
But a change does not seem likely since that would require a political consensus .
Conservatives would view such a move as undermining the party 's legitimacy and tarnishing the legacy of Deng Xiaoping .
Others , like Xiong Yan , hope that one day China will move to democracy .
" We hope China have a big change , peacefully , and that the point is , that we hope in China people can enjoy freedom , " he said .
CNN 's Jaime FlorCruz in Beijing contributed to this report .

The aqueduct is one of the region 's most popular tourist attractions A 200 - year - old aqueduct near Wrexham has been crowned as one of the heritage " wonders " of the world .
Pontcysyllte aqueduct was added to the list of World Heritage Sites by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( Unesco ) .
The structure , built by Thomas Telford and William Jessop , is the longest and highest aqueduct in Britain .
There are about 900 such sites including Stonehenge , the Great Wall of China and Taj Mahal .
' Over the moon '
The aqueduct is regarded as one of Telford 's greatest civil engineering achievements .
A cast iron trough on top of 18 stone piers carries the Llangollen canal 126ft above the River Dee .
Dr Dawn Roberts , economic development manager for Wrexham Council , said : " We are absolutely over the moon .
Please turn on JavaScript .

On June 16th the FDA issued a warning advising consumers not to use Zicam Nasal Gel or Nasal Swabs because of reports that it can damage the sense of smell , a condition called anosmia .
This event highlights some problems with current regulations of health products .
There have been 130 cases reported to the FDA of decreased sense of smell following the use of one of these Zicam products – sometimes after a single use , sometimes after repeated use .
All of these cases were reported by patients or their doctors ; none were reported by the company , Matrixx Initiatives .
According to reports , the FDA has asked Matrixx to turn over 800 consumer complaints regarding to Zicam .
There is a 2007 law that requires company to report such complaints to the FDA , although the FDA has not said whether Matrixx violated this law .
Anosmia is a serious medical condition .
The senses of smell is one of those things we take for granted until it is gone .
People who lack a sense of smell cannot tell if milk has gone sour or if their food is bad .
They can not smell smoke to warn of a fire , nor can they smell a gas leak .
The FDA fears that some of the cases of anosmia associated with Zicam use may be permanent .
Correlation does not prove causation , but there is reason to think that the anosmia in some of these cases may have been caused by the zinc in these Zicam products .
As the FDA reports , viral upper airway infections can also cause anosmia , but the anosmia that results from zinc is associated with burning and is much more rapid in onset .
Apparently some of these cases had features suggestive of zinc - caused anosmia .
Further , it has already been described in the literature that decreased smell ( hyposmia ) or loss of smell ( anosmia ) can result from the intranasal use of zinc .
There is some evidence that zinc preparations may reduce the severity or duration of the common cold if used within 24 hours of onset .
This review of the literature concludes :
Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms .
Additional clinical and laboratory evaluations are warranted to further define the role of ionic zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms through which zinc exerts its symptom - relieving effects .
Therefore , intranasal zinc products may have a modest effect in reducing the symptoms of a cold , but come with the risk of permanent damage to the sense of smell .
Since the common cold is a self - limited illness that typically lasts about 7 days , this would not seem to be a favorable risk vs benefit ratio .
How , then , did these Zicam products make it onto the market in the first place ?
The FDA regulates , among other things , drugs .
They require adequate evidence for both safety and effectiveness before a drug can be placed on the market and sold to consumers .
They also determine the level of regulation for each drug – can it be sold over the counter , with prescription only , and it is a controlled substance , like a narcotic .
There are two important exceptions to this general rule .
The first is an exception that was carved out for homeopathic products in 1938 .
The FDA states :
The Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act ( the Act ) recognizes as official the drugs and standards in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States and its supplements ( Sections 201 ( g ) ( 1 ) and 501 ( b ) , respectively ) .
Until recently , homeopathic drugs have been marketed on a limited scale by a few manufacturers who have been in business for many years and have predominantly served the needs of a limited number of licensed practitioners .
In conjunction with this , homeopathic drug products historically have borne little or no labeling for the consumer .
Homeopathy was much more popular early in the 20th century in the US , and the homeopathic lobby was sufficient to gain legitimacy under the FDA .
Specifically , Senator Royal Copeland of New York , a physician trained in homeopathy and a principal author of the FDCA , pushed for the inclusion of homeopathy as approved drugs .
Homeopathic remedies are classified as “ drugs ” by the FDA , which means they fall under FDA oversight , but at the same time they are granted automatic approval as long as they appear in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia .
What this means is that the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United State , the non-governmental agency that writes the homeopathic pharmacopoeia , only has to add an agent to their list and it is granted automatic FDA approval .
Homeopathic remedies are typically diluted beyond the point where any active ingredient remains .
Therefore , in practice there is no difference between any one homeopathic preparation and any other – or just plain water .
( Here is a recent overview I wrote about homeopathy . )
The biggest problem with this regulation is that it amounts to official government recognition of pseudoscience .
The FDCA should be amended to remove homeopathy completely .
But there is also a problem with definition .
While most homeopathic remedies are diluted to the point that they are indistinguishable from water , that is not a requirement .
Lesser dilutions may contain small amounts of active ingredient .
If a “ homeopathic remedy ” contains a biological active amount of a drug as an active ingredient , is it not a regular drug ?
This is relevant to Zicam because these products are regulated as homeopathic drugs – which means they were allowed on the market without having to provide any evidence for safety or efficacy .
The homeopathic exception allowed the manufacturer to simply bypass the usual requirements , even though Zicam is not really homeopathic but contains biologically active levels of zinc .
But because homeopathic remedies do fall under FDA regulation the FDA has the power to decide that a product poses a safety risk to the public and therefore can demand evidence for safety .
In this case the FDA has requested that Matrixx Initiatives “ submit a new drug application to demonstrate safety and efficacy . ”
( I confirmed this over e-mail with the FDA . )
The second exception to the FDA regulation of drugs was created by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA ) .
This law allows botanical drugs to be sold as supplements , with no requirement to prove safety or efficacy .
While with products marketed as homeopathic “ drugs ” the FDA can step in if they feel there is a safety concern , with supplements under DSHEA the FDA bears a high burden of proof to show that a product is harmful before it can take action .
So far it has only done this for one ingredient – ephedra .
Here , too , we see a significant problem with definition .
Why is a botanical drug or herb regulated like food rather than a drug ?
A more science - based regulatory system would eliminate homeopathic agents altogether .
They are a relic from the past .
Further , any substance meant to be consumed or taken internally for its pharmacological activity is a drug and should be regulated like a drug .
This could still leave room for subcategories of drugs , as we have now ( for example , over the counter vs prescription only ) .
But regulating herbal drugs as food has only opened the flood - gates for dubious products with even more dubious claims .
The June issue of Gregor.us Monthly , The Scholarship of Collapse , addresses several views of economic and systemic collapse from the works of Jared Diamond to Joseph Tainter , and then goes on to apply these views to the United States–and to its biggest state , California .
Frankly , it ’s not much fun to suggest that another leg down in housing is on the way .
Or , that California is unlikely to see its GDP exceed its previous peak for quite some time .
But without the two industries that characterized post - war growth in the US , housing and automobiles ( and the financial industry that squatted on top of these ) it ’s hard to see how California–and the US by extension–does not become a permanently smaller economy .
Ouch .
Permanently smaller economy !?
Are you kidding me ?
The United States ?
Yeah , I know .
The growth paradigm since WW2 is so firmly entrenched in the record ( and in the psyche ) that mere mention of US economic stasis seems outlandish .
To suggest , as I am , that this condition will carry on for years sounds impossible .
However , that is my call .
I now foresee zero , net physical infrastructure or housing growth in California for at least another 5 years .
If housing units go up somewhere in California , they ’ll be bulldozed someplace else .
If new roads or highways are erected , they ’ll be discontinued or dismantled somewhere else .
Without California , there will be no sustainable US GDP growth .
Peak autos is another favored theme of mine .
Via the crushing blow of high energy prices , the price mechanism has tried for a second time in 30 years to send the signal that an economy run on cheap gasoline does n’t , actually , work .
Given the loathsome state of America ’s presently collapsed economy , I would venture the country needs gasoline at 50 cents –right now –to return to its busy post - war arbitration of cheap transport and energy inputs , in service of earnings and output .
That ’s not going to happen .
The reason : the United States no longer controls the price of oil via the mechanism of its own demand .
An interesting exercise when looking at previously collapsed economies and societies is to ask when a certain , initial terminus was reached , before the overshoot phase began .
This could be the point , for example , when the Anasazi have denuded their local forests of wood , and have to start traveling farther afield for supply .
The population will hardly be declining at this stage .
In addition , the economy will be merrily carrying onward to a higher level of complexity .
I call this the hidden terminus .
The crossover point where resources were harder to attain , but , the techniques of the economy kept advancing ( to some extent masking the the underlying countertrend in resources ) .
It now seems likely the United States reached this point in the year 2000 .
That ’s when the ability to grow the economy , without a large acceleration in debt , appears to have crossed a threshold .
From my June newsletter :
In my opinion the United States economy passed its hidden terminus with the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000 .
All of the power and thrust in the economy since 2000 was provided by nothing more than an expansion of credit via two , typical vehicles : War and Domestic government spending ( Guns and Butter ) , and , artificially low interest rates provided by the central bank .
This concept can be extremely difficult to accept among people working in highly innovative , highly productive areas like technology , venture capital , engineering , and other globalized product and service industries .
What ’s important to understand , however , is that the economy we made in the United States needs to serve 300 million people .
If a good portion of that population is living off the housing and automobile economy , unsustainable at high levels , it matters little to the problem of a fundamentally unsound economy that Google , SunPower , and Honeywell are indeed doing wonderful things in technology , solar energy , and engineering .
Moreover , it seems quite likely now that the expansion of credit post 2000 was in many ways a collective attempt to replace the trailing loss of our manufacturing economy .
Yes , the US remains a hotbed of the best innovation but the acceleration of the financial and financial product economy was very likely an overshoot , past the hidden terminus in the structure of our system .
To use a phrase that was once somewhat unfairly said about California by Gertrude Stein , we have discovered that there was no there , there in the US economy .
The United States , just like California , now sits astride massive , gargantuan post - war infrastructure that was built with cheap energy and leveraged with cheap energy , for over 50 years .
Many parts of the US right now are actually experiencing something closer to a depression , and yet oil is above 60 dollars a barrel .
A price that was considered ridiculous just 5 years ago , when even 40 dollars a barrel was viewed as unsustainable .
The United States has been in an inflationary recession since the start of the decade , which now threatens to become an inflationary depression .
To make matters worse , the federal government is in the midst of one of the largest policy mistakes in US history as it has chosen to make enormous new investments in car companies , cars , biofuels , roads , and highways to the exclusion of public transport .
This is a classic , textbook example of the sunk cost effect in decision making and is a hallmark of the collapsed societies of antiquity .
The choices the US makes from this point forward will likely have more of an effect on how the decline is mitigated .
As I wrote in my newsletter , we do not view the post - war decline of Britain as a human tragedy , and there ’s no reason to see the US decline as either shocking , or unexpected .
However , it is indeed regrettable that we did not face up appropriately to the changes that unfolded , at the start of this millennium .

Set the controls for the heart of the Sun
The JET fusion reactor looks more like the lair of a Bond villain than an extraordinary British experiment that might save the world .
This is the view inside the doughnut - shaped JET reactor , the largest fusion device on Earth .
During a reaction , nuclear fuels are held away from the walls by electromagnets , and reach temperatures more than ten times hotter than the core of the sun
The highly compacted core of the sun is a very hot place indeed .
In the star 's burning heart , hydrogen atoms collide at immense speeds .
This welds them together and turns them into helium atoms , which each release a burst of energy that escapes into the solar system as light .
It is a nuclear furnace , responsible for fuelling all life on Earth , that consumes a lot of hydrogen ( 600 million tons every second ) at very high temperatures ( over 15 million degrees C ) .
As such , it 's the second - hottest place in the solar system .
The hottest place ?
Surprisingly , that 's rather closer to home : to be precise , the small English village of Culham , a few miles down the A4074 out of Oxford .
Here , in an innocuous building similar to a Seventies - style concrete university campus , one of the most important experiments in the history of mankind is taking place .
If all goes well - and things are going very well - it will solve the problem of meeting the world 's energy needs .
More power will flow into the world 's grids than we 'll ever need .
The superheated plasma at the Culham Science Centre
To step into its heart , I don a hard hat and head towards a distant thunder .
To enter the mechanism , I have to pass through a metal turnstile and an airlock that says , ' Ensure all doors are sealed before entering reactor chamber . '
A guard hands me a radiation badge .
' It will come up with a reading of zero , but we must check , ' says Dr Francesco Romanelli , head of the JET ( Joint European Torus ) reactor .
Then we step inside .
The hall within is a Star Wars - style array of towers , pipes and antennae feeding into a 30 ft - tall circular machine lined with carbon tiles and surrounded by electromagnets that can generate a magnetic field 100,000 times stronger than Earth's .
The machine is the shape of a torus , or doughnut .
Even now , when the reactor is n't burning , you can't enter the chamber itself without a radiation suit .
When components inside need replacing , robot arms are used - so sophisticated their operators can ' feel ' through the metal fingers .
Platforms and stairs surround the central core ; on second thoughts , it 's less Star Wars and more Moonraker .
Although any sci- fi analogy would do ; the experiments being done here have actually been a staple of science fiction for decades , since this type of fusion reactor , the tokamak ( see box ) , was invented by Soviet scientists in the Fifties .
And they employ a technology the US planned to use to shoot down nukes as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative - or ' Star Wars ' - programme .
After more than half a century , all these grand schemes are becoming reality .
The control room at JET
A view of the machine showing the beam - heating systems
The reactor inside the Culham Science Centre , which is managed by the UK's Atomic Energy Authority , recreates the reaction that occurs at the heart of the sun , only more intensely .
Here , less than a gram of hydrogen is used , but it 's heated to 200 million degrees C by high - energy beams that are among the most powerful and lethal heating devices on Earth .
On start - up , when two 50ft white towers aim their barrel - sized particle cannons into the reactor , will it explode into a fireball and swallow our planet like a lump of coke in a blast furnace ?
Happily , no .
When the reactor burns , the hydrogen becomes so hot that no physical container can cool or hold it ; so the intense magnetic field holds the swirling vortex of superheated hydrogen in place .
The reacting material is completely invisible - it radiates energy at frequencies the human eye can't see - but as the reactor heats , sections of the wall become so hot that the tiles glow red .
' This is save - the - world science .
This is the energy holy grail '
Meanwhile , the incredibly intense particle beams consist of uncharged atoms flying at more than ten million metres per second .
They would instantly vaporise anyone who stood in front of them .
Even metal components melt in microseconds if they get in the way of the beams .
So the towers are cooled with liquid helium , as well as water - 4,000 cubic metres are pumped through the system every hour .
And what 's it all for ?
Simply , the experiments at JET could pave the way for a scientific achievement on a par with putting a man on the Moon .
JET has been able to initiate nuclear fusion at the touch of a button for decades - but the energy put in has always outweighed the energy harvested from the reactor .
Now , though , it 's being used as a test bed for a new reactor , ITER , which will generate electricity from fusion , using fuel found in ordinary seawater .
Just one cubic kilometre of seawater contains enough deuterium - used as a nuclear fuel by JET - to generate more power than the world 's entire oil reserves .
An employee operates the robot arms used to replace internal components ( left ) while another examines the far infra-red lasers
When a fusion plant eventually manages to return more energy than is put in , wind and solar energy will become almost irrelevant .
Countries whose power and wealth are built on reserves of fossil fuels will find themselves in a very different situation .
It might sound too good to be true - and even the most optimistic fusion physicists accept that working fusion power stations are at best more than three decades away .
But by then supplies of oil and gas may have run out altogether .
For a species whose appetite for energy shows no sign of abating , this reactor might be the only hope .
Does the answer to all Earth 's power problems lie inside this machine ?
Britain is , effectively , an 80 - gigawatt appliance - that 's what it takes to fuel us .
But finding the required energy is getting harder .
In ten years ' time , we 'll have to import up to 90 per cent of our gas , compared to 30 per cent two years ago , and ageing power plants that currently supply a third of our electricity will have to be shut down .
Three years later , all but one of our nuclear plants will have been decommissioned .
By 2050 , most forecasts say the world 's oil reserves will have been exhausted , with gas and coal running out shortly after .
While wind and solar power are mooted as solutions to the energy crisis , it 's by no means clear they can supply energy reliably at national - grid level - ever .
On the plus side , we are planning to build new nuclear power stations , but they can only give us 20 gigawatts .
The centre is located near Oxford
The last time things looked so bleak was in the Seventies -- coincidentally , another period when nuclear fusion was in vogue .
' There is an interesting study -- the amount of resources devoted to researching fusion is related to the price of oil , ' says Dr Romanelli .
' When the price of oil goes up , they spend money on fusion ; when the price of oil goes down , they tend to forget about other energies .
In the Seventies , during the two oil crises , there was investment in fusion - that was why JET was built .
' In the Eighties , it decreased .
The energy market in Europe is worth 700 billion euros a year .
The amount spent on energy research is two billion a year - almost nothing .
Overall , 0.01 per cent of the global energy budget is spent on fusion research .
More money is spent researching new cars . '
Now JET is laying the groundwork for the new reactor , ITER , to be operational by 2018 .
ITER has become the biggest joint science project since the International Space Station .
It will cost ten billion euros and Britain has committed almost half of its energy - research budget to the programme .
One of the towers that fires neutral particle beams into the reactor
Currently , every nuclear reactor operating on Earth is a fission reactor - using energy released when heavy atoms such as uranium decay into smaller atoms , a process similar to the one used in the first nuclear weapons .
A fusion reactor works in the opposite way , harvesting the energy released when two smaller atoms combine , releasing a fast moving subatomic particle .
This reaction is used in hydrogen bombs , triggered by setting off a normal fission - based bomb of the sort dropped on Hiroshima - but it 's uncontrolled , and over in an instant .
In a working fusion reactor , the reaction will be sustained , and safe .
The fast - moving particles released by the hydrogen will be ' caught ' in a blanket of liquid lithium , which will heat up , in turn boiling water and driving steam turbines as found in a conventional nuclear or coal power station .
But there are several huge differences .
No carbon dioxide is emitted from a fusion reactor .
The fuel is found in ordinary water - there are 25 ml of deuterium in every litre you drink .
And there 's no chance of a fusion Chernobyl .
The reaction is so difficult to sustain that it can't run out of control .
And while the reactor tiles become mildly radioactive , they 're far less toxic than the waste generated by normal fission reactors , and become totally safe in 100 years .
There is no weapons - grade fuel for terrorists to steal .
Remote handling practice with Jenga blocks ( left ) and the button used to cut power to JET in an emergency
So far , JET , the most advanced and largest fusion reactor on Earth , is only efficient enough to return 65 per cent of the power put into it , and can only sustain the reaction for a few seconds .
But if Culham 's simulations are accurate , ITER will produce up to ten times the amount of energy put in , for periods of more than 400 seconds .
Dr Romanelli explains : ' The ITER machine is not that far beyond what we 've built at JET .
It will be about eight times the volume , and about three times the power - that makes us confident we will achieve what we want .
' Our goal is to reach a point of break - even , where the energy we get out is equal to the energy put in .
All our research , and our work with other reactors like this , has shown that it 's simply a matter of scale .
Our machine is now fully devoted to testing design choices for ITER .
' This October , we will shut down the reactor and remove its carbon tiles , to install new beryllium tiles on the wall and tungsten tiles on the floor , where most of the heat escapes from the chamber .
If we are able to demonstrate this works , ITER will perhaps begin being built at an earlier stage . '
John Parris of HiPER - another European project , which will investigate laser - driven fusion - says : ' This is save - the - world science .
Fusion is the only serious answer to future energy demands - this is the energy Holy Grail .
The human race has a massive , ravenous demand for power , and there is no other way to provide grid - level energy . '
Dr Romanelli's team have already proved man can recreate the centre of the sun on Earth .
If their calculations are correct , JET is the seed of an idea that will solve the energy crisis forever , halt global warming and ensure nations never have to battle over energy sources again .
The downside ?
It 'll take billions of pounds , and more than three decades , to find out .
Watch the JET Fusion Reactor in action
POWERING THE FUSION REACTOR
A tokamak fusion reactor ( the name is a loose transliteration of the Russian phrase ' TOroidal CHAmber with MAgnetic Coils ' ) heats two forms of hydrogen atoms - deuterium and tritium - up to temperatures far hotter than the centre of stars , containing the dangerous mixture in a circular magnetic field 100,000 times stronger than Earth's .
Both fuels are heavier forms of hydrogen - deuterium is found naturally in seawater , and tritium , which is mildly radioactive , is created as a by - product of fusion reactions , or inside fission reactors .
Just tiny amounts of the fuels - at JET , less than a gram - are used inside a tokamak , heated by neutral beams ( uncharged streams of atoms fired at more than ten million metres per second ) , microwaves and electrons until they reach around 200 million degrees C .
Electromagnets on the outside of the reactor contain the mixture in a doughnut shape - in the JET reactor , copper electromagnets are used , but in ITER , its European successor , liquid - helium - cooled superconducting magnets will be used , which allow electricity to circulate without losing any power .
At this temperature , the hydrogen forms a plasma - the fourth state of matter after solid , liquid and gas .
Plasmas are found everywhere on Earth inside neon lights , but inside a tokamak , the deuterium - tritium mixture is superheated and subjected to a huge electric current so that the natural repulsive forces between atoms are reduced .
When deuterium and tritium atoms collide in this state , they can form a helium atom - and release energy in the form of a single neutron moving at incredibly high speed .
Because the neutron is uncharged , it escapes the tokamak 's magnetic field and is ' caught ' in a blanket of lithium ( a light metal ) that surrounds the reactor .
The heat generated causes the lithium to heat up - and in a commercial reactor , this would in turn be used to boil water , which would then drive steam turbines and generate electricity , as in a normal nuclear fission or coal power station .
The by - product of neutrons striking lithium atoms is tritium - which , in a commercial reactor , will be recycled to be used as fuel .
Bird flu may not have become the threat to humans that some predicted because our noses are too cold for the virus to thrive , UK researchers say .
An Imperial College London recreation of the nose 's environment found that at 32 degrees Celsius , avian flu viruses lose function and cannot spread .
It is likely that the viruses have adapted to suit the warmer 40 degree environments in the guts of birds .
A mutation would be needed before bird flu became a human problem , they said .
Published in the journal PLoS Pathogens , the study also found that human viruses are affected by the colder temperatures found in the nose but to nowhere near the same extent .
It is certainly part of the explanation of why avian viruses , such as H5N1 , fail to transmit readily to humans
Professor Ian Jones , University of Reading
In effect , human viruses are still able to replicate and spread under those conditions , the researchers said .
Both viruses were able to grow well at 37 degrees - human core body temperature and equivalent to the environment in the lungs .
They also created a mutated human flu virus by adding a protein from the surface of an avian influenza virus .
This virus - an example of how a new strain could develop and start a pandemic - was also unsuccessful at 32 degrees .
Mutations Study leader Professor Wendy Barclay said it suggested that if a new human influenza strain evolved by mixing with an avian influenza virus , it would still need to undergo further mutations before it could be successful in infecting humans .
" Our study gives vital clues about what kinds of changes would be needed in order for them to mutate and infect humans , potentially helping us to identify which viruses could lead to a pandemic . "
She added further research could point to warning signs in viruses that are beginning to make the kinds of genetic changes for them to jump into humans .
" Animal viruses that spread well at low temperatures in these cultures could be more likely to cause the next pandemic than those which are restricted . "
She said swine flu - which was spreading from person to person , seemingly through upper respiratory tract infection - was probably an example of a virus which had adapted to cope with the cooler temperatures in the nose .
Key protein role Professor Ian Jones , an expert in virology at the University of Reading , said : " This work confirms the fact that temperature differences in the avian and human sites of influenza infection are key to virus establishment .
" It is certainly part of the explanation of why avian viruses , such as H5N1 , fail to transmit readily to humans . "
He added that the research also showed that the proteins on the outside of the virus were key to its function at different temperatures .
" This helps the monitoring of avian flu as it indicates which changes to look out for . "

Britain's most senior military commanders have warned Gordon Brown that unless he sends more troops to Afghanistan Britain will lose credibility with its American allies , The Independent has learnt .
Senior generals are bemused that the Prime Minister has turned down the advice of his own Defence Secretary , John Hutton , that a larger force should be sent to Afghanistan following the withdrawal from Iraq .
Now they have warned Number 10 that the reputation of the armed forces will suffer in the eyes of senior American commanders unless Mr Brown authorises an autumn surge in troop numbers .
Such a surge , they say , would signal Britain 's intent to " pull its weight " in the Afghan conflict by plugging the shortfall in the multinational force .
On Saturday , two more British troops died in Helmand , bringing to 165 the total number killed in the conflict so far – just 14 fewer than the total number of British soldiers who died in Iraq .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Brown has until now turned down , on cost grounds , the generals ' proposal to send 2,500 extra troops in support of the projected US - led " surge " against the Taliban .
Instead , he has authorised a deployment of 700 temporary troops to cover the period of the forthcoming elections in that country .
But The Independent has learnt that defence chiefs have persuaded the Government to review the situation in the autumn .
Even then , any increase is likely to be in the hundreds rather than in the numbers that the Army believes are needed .
In a sign of the private concern felt by senior military personnel over the Government 's stance , General Sir Richard Dannatt , the head of the Army , has publicly warned that Britain 's strategic alliance with US is at risk unless British forces are seen to be pulling their weight in Afghanistan .
In a speech to the international relations think - tank Chatham House he said : " Britain 's calculation has long been that maintaining military strategic ' partner - of - choice ' status with the United States offers a degree of influence and security that has been pivotal to our foreign and defence policy .
But this relationship can only be sustained if it is founded on a certain ' military credibility threshold ' .
" Credibility with the US is earned by being an ally that can be relied on to state clearly what it will do and then does it effectively .
And credibility is also linked to the vital currency of reputation . "
General Dannatt added that " unfairly or not " British performance in Iraq and Afghanistan has already been called into question by some in the US administration .
" In this respect there is recognition that our national and military reputation and credibility , unfairly or not , have been called into question at several levels in the eyes of our most important ally as a result of some aspects of the Iraq campaign , " he said .
" Taking steps to restore this credibility will be pivotal , and Afghanistan provides an opportunity . "
This view has been backed up Col David Kilcullen , a former Australian army officer who helped plan General Petraeus 's surge in Iraq and acted as an advisor to Condoleezza Rice .

He told The Independent : " It is true that the British have received some criticism in the US , and some of it has been unwarranted .
The Americans too made mistakes in Iraq , but they subsequently tried to rectify that .
" The British have a great opportunity to win back the credibility they have lost with the Americans and enhance it in Afghanistan . "
Col Kilcullen , who remains close to senior figures in the US military , said that in his opinion the British General Sir David Richards , who is due to take over from General Dannatt as head of the Army , was " one of the best ever " head of Nato forces in Afghanistan .
He added : " No one doubts the professionalism and bravery of the British , and we accept that they already have a large force in Afghanistan .
But we are coming to a crucial time in the campaign there , and I am sure more British help will be welcome . "
The US is dispatching up to 17,000 troops to southern Afghanistan , with many of them going to Helmand , which is the centre of UK operations in the war .
British commanders are convinced that after three years of committing resources and lives to the mission , reinforcements are essential to maintain the British footprint on the ground .
President Barack Obama is believed to have discussed additional troops for Afghanistan with Mr Brown .
US commanders have also expressed disappointment at the shortfall in the troops being sent , especially after redeploying 4,000 troops from Baghdad to Basra to make up for the UK withdrawal from Iraq .

In Part I the long struggle to get beyond the fallacious saturation argument was recounted in historical terms .
In Part II , I will provide a more detailed analysis for the reader interested in the technical nitty - gritty of how the absorption of infrared really depends on CO 2 concentration .
At the end , I will discuss Herr Koch ’s experiment in the light of modern observations .
The discussion here is based on CO 2 absorption data found in the HITRAN spectroscopic archive .
This is the main infrared database used by atmospheric radiation modellers .
This database is a legacy of the military work on infrared described in Part I , and descends from a spectroscopic archive compiled by the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory at Hanscom Field , MA ( referred to in some early editions of radiative transfer textbooks as the " AFGL Tape " ) .
Suppose we were to sit at sea level and shine an infrared flashlight with an output of one Watt upward into the sky .
If all the light from the beam were then collected by an orbiting astronaut with a sufficiently large lens , what fraction of a Watt would that be ?
The question of saturation amounts to the following question :
How would that fraction change if we increased the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere ?
Saturation refers to the condition where increasing the amount of CO 2 fails to increase the absorption , because the CO 2 was already absorbing essentially all there is to absorb at the wavelengths where it absorbs at all .
Think of a conveyor belt with red , blue and green M&M candies going past .
You have one fussy child sitting at the belt who only eats red M&M’s , and he can eat them fast enough to eat half of the M&M ’s going past him .
Thus , he reduces the M&M flux by half .
If you put another equally fussy kid next to him who can eat at the same rate , she ’ll eat all the remaining red M& M’s .
Then , if you put a third kid in the line , it wo n’t result in any further decrease in the M&M flux , because all the M&M ’s that they like to eat are already gone .
( It will probably result in howls of disappointment , though ! )
You ’d need an eater of green or blue M&M ’s to make further reductions in the flux .
Ångström and his followers believed that the situation with CO 2 and infrared was like the situation with the red M& M’s .
To understand how wrong they were , we need to look at modern measurements of the rate of absorption of infrared light by CO 2 .
The rate of absorption is a very intricately varying function of the wavelength of the light .
At any given wavelength , the amount of light surviving goes down like the exponential of the number of molecules of CO 2 encountered by the beam of light .
The rate of exponential decay is the absorption factor .
When the product of the absorption factor times the amount of CO 2 encountered equals one , then the amount of light is reduced by a factor of 1/e , i.e. 1/2.71282 … .
For this , or larger , amounts of CO 2 , the atmosphere is optically thick at the corresponding wavelength .
If you double the amount of CO 2 , you reduce the proportion of surviving light by an additional factor of 1/e , reducing the proportion surviving to about a tenth ; if you instead halve the amount of CO 2 , the proportion surviving is the reciprocal of the square root of e , or about 60 % , and the atmosphere is optically thin .
Precisely where we draw the line between " thick " and " thin " is somewhat arbitrary , given that the absorption shades smoothly from small values to large values as the product of absorption factor with amount of CO 2 increases .
The units of absorption factor depend on the units we use to measure the amount of CO 2 in the column of the atmosphere encountered by the beam of light .
Let ’s measure our units relative to the amount of CO 2 in an atmospheric column of base one square meter , present when the concentration of CO 2 is 300 parts per million ( about the pre-industrial value ) .
In such units , an atmosphere with the present amount of CO 2 is optically thick where the absorption coefficient is one or greater , and optically thin where the absorption coefficient is less than one .
If we double the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere , then the absorption coefficient only needs to be 1 / 2 or greater in order to make the atmosphere optically thick .
The absorption factor , so defined , is given in the following figure , based on the thousands of measurements in the HITRAN spectroscopic archive .
The " fuzz " on this graph is because the absorption actually takes the form of thousands of closely spaced partially overlapping spikes .
If one were to zoom in on a very small portion of the wavelength axis , one would see the fuzz resolve into discrete spikes , like the pickets on a fence .
At the coarse resolution of the graph , one only sees a dark band marking out the maximum and minimum values swept out by the spike .
These absorption results were computed for typical laboratory conditions , at sea level pressure and a temperature of 20 Celsius .
At lower pressures , the peaks of the spikes get higher and the valleys between them get deeper , leading to a broader " fuzzy band " on absorption curves like that shown below .
We see that for the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration , it is only the wavelength range between about 13.5 and 17 microns ( millionths of a meter ) that can be considered to be saturated .
Within this range , it is indeed true that adding more CO 2 would not significantly increase the amount of absorption .
All the red M&M ’s are already eaten .
But waiting in the wings , outside this wavelength region , there ’s more goodies to be had .
In fact , noting that the graph is on a logarithmic axis , the atmosphere still would n’t be saturated even if we increased the CO 2 to ten thousand times the present level .
What happens to the absorption if we quadruple the amount of CO 2 ?
That story is told in the next graph :
The horizontal blue lines give the threshold CO 2 needed to make the atmosphere optically thick at 1 x the preindustrial CO 2 level and 4 x that level .
Quadrupling the CO 2 makes the portions of the spectrum in the yellow bands optically thick , essentially adding new absorption there and reducing the transmission of infrared through the layer .
One can relate this increase in the width of the optically thick region to the " thinning and cooling " argument determining infrared loss to space as follows .
Roughly speaking , in the part of the spectrum where the atmosphere is optically thick , the radiation to space occurs at the temperature of the high , cold parts of the atmosphere .
That ’s practically zero compared to the radiation flux at temperatures comparable to the surface temperature ; in the part of the spectrum which is optically thin , the planet radiates at near the surface temperature .
Increasing CO 2 then increases the width of the spectral region where the atmosphere is optically thick , which replaces more of the high - intensity surface radiation with low - intensity upper - atmosphere radiation , and thus reduces the rate of radiation loss to space .
Now let ’s use the absorption properties described above to determine what we ’d see in a typical laboratory experiment .
Imagine that our experimenter fills a tube with pure CO 2 at a pressure of one atmosphere and a temperature of 20C .
She then shines a beam of infrared light in one end of the tube .
To keep things simple , let ’s assume that the beam of light has uniform intensity at all wavelengths shown in the absorption graph .
She then measures the amount of light coming out the other end of the tube , and divides it by the amount of light being shone in .
The ratio is the transmission .
How does the transmission change as we make the tube longer ?
To put the results in perspective , it is useful to keep in mind that at a CO 2 concentration of 300 ppm , the amount of CO 2 in a column of the Earth ’s atmosphere having cross section area equal to that of the tube is equal to the amount of CO 2 in a tube of pure CO 2 of length 2.5 meters , if the tube is at sea level pressure and a temperature of 20C .
Thus a two and a half meter tube of pure CO 2 in lab conditions is , loosely speaking , like " one atmosphere " of greenhouse effect .
The following graph shows how the proportion of light transmitted through the tube goes down as the tube is made longer .
The transmission decays extremely rapidly for short tubes ( under a centimeter or so ) , because when light first encounters CO 2 , it ’s the easy pickings near the peak of the absorption spectrum that are eaten up first .
At larger tube lengths , because of shape of the curve of absorption vs. wavelength , the transmission decreases rather slowly with the amount of CO 2 .
And it ’s a good thing it does .
You can show that if the transmission decayed exponentially , as it would if the absorption factor were independent of wavelength , then doubling CO 2 would warm the Earth by about 50 degrees C instead of 2 to 4 degrees ( which is plenty bad enough , once you factor in that warming is greater over land vs. ocean and at high Northern latitudes ) .
There are a few finer points we need to take into account in order to relate this experiment to the absorption by CO 2 in the actual atmosphere .
The first is the effect of pressure broadening .
Because absorption lines become narrower as pressure goes down , and because more of the spectrum is " between " lines rather than " on " line centers , the absorption coefficient on the whole tends to go down linearly with pressure .
Therefore , by computing ( or measuring ) the absorption at sea level pressure , we are overestimating the absorption of the CO 2 actually in place in the higher , lower - pressure parts of the atmosphere .
It turns out that when this is properly taken into account , you have to reduce the column length at sea level pressure by a factor of 2 to have the equivalent absorption effect of the same amount of CO 2 in the real atmosphere .
Thus , you ’d measure absorption in a 1.25 meter column in the laboratory to get something more representative of the real atmosphere .
The second effect comes from the fact that CO 2 colliding with itself in a tube of pure CO 2 broadens the lines about 30 % more than does CO 2 colliding with N 2 or O 2 in air , which results in an additional slight overestimate of the absorption in the laboratory experiment .
Neither of these effects would significantly affect the impression of saturation obtained in a laboratory experiment , though .
CO 2 is not much less saturated for a 1 meter column than it is for a 2.5 meter column .
So what went wrong in the experiment of poor Herr Koch ?
There are two changes that need to be made in order to bring our calculations in line with Herr Koch ’s experimental setup .
First , he used a blackbody at 100C ( basically , a pot of boiling water ) as the source for his infrared radiation , and measured the transmission relative to the full blackbody emission of the source .
By suitably weighting the incoming radiation , it is a simple matter to recompute the transmission through a tube in a way compatible to Koch ’s definition .
The second difference is that Herr Koch did n’t actually perform his experiment by varying the length of the tube .
He did the control case at a pressure of 1 atmosphere in a tube of length 30 cm .
His reduced - CO 2 case was not done with a shorter tube , but rather by keeping the same tube and reducing the pressure to 2/3 atmosphere ( 666 mb , or 520 mm of Mercury in his units ) .
Rather than displaying the absorption as a function of pressure , we have used modern results on pressure scaling to rephrase Herr Koch ’s measurement in terms of what he would have seen if he had done the experiment with a shortened tube instead .
This allows us to plot his experiment on a graph of transmission vs. tube length similar to what was shown above .
The result is shown here :
Over the range of CO 2 amounts covered in the experiment , one does n’t actually expect much variation in the absorption — only about a percent .
Herr Koch ’s measurements are very close to the correct absorption for the 30cm control case , but he told his boss that the radiation that got through at lower pressure increased by no more than 0.4 % .
Well , he wouldnt be the only lab assistant who was over - optimistic in reporting his accuracy .
Even if the experiment had been done accurately , it ’s unclear whether the investigators would have considered the one percent change in transmission " significant , " since they already regarded their measured half percent change as " insignificant . "
It seems that Ångström was all too eager to conclude that CO 2 absorption was saturated based on the " insignificance " of the change , whereas the real problem was that they were looking at changes over a far too small range of CO 2 amounts .
If Koch and Ångström had examined the changes over the range between a 10 cm and 1 meter tube , they probably would have been able to determine the correct law for increase of absorption with amount , despite the primitive instruments available at the time .
The design of the ID cards that British citizens will carry has been unveiled today .
Each card will have a photograph of a face and will contain the name , date of birth and signature of the holder .
The ID card was unveiled by home secretary Alan Johnson today in Manchester and London .
It will hold similar information to that currently contained in the UK passport but will also a feature biometrics , with a photograph and fingerprints stored on a secure electronic chip .
Alan Johnson said , " Given the growing problem of identity fraud and the inconvenience of having to carry passports , coupled with gas bills or six months ' worth of bank statements to prove identity , I believe the ID card will be welcomed as an important addition to the many plastic cards that most people already carry .
He added that its use for travel in Europe is also an advantage .
The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
We 've all heard it before ; since the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation , our games ' color palettes have moved towards desaturated tones .
I 'll try to explain why this has happened , and focus on one of the less obvious reasons .
Since textures are now of higher resolution , dirty surfaces such as rusty metal , rocks , muddy grounds , damaged concrete , etc. , can look pretty good .
On top of that , using specular highlights implies metallic or wet materials .
Dynamic lighting coupled with normal maps leads us to make environments where surfaces are not flat ; we 're more likely to make damaged or rocky surfaces to get that extra detail in our environments now that our shaders allow us to , and metallic surfaces to make specular highlights and normal maps more apparent as the lighting moves over the surfaces .
So by default , the new tech leads us in a certain direction .
We could make some nice looking clean world , but it would imply new challenges to overcome .
Imagine you were to look at a painting of a person .
You know it 's not real , hence there are various errors that might subconsciously bother you , even though you would n't have noticed them if those same apparent errors were edited into a photo .
You might not be able to pinpoint what 's wrong with it , but instinctively your mind noticed something was n't right .
Video game worlds are by their very nature artificial .
There 's all sorts of factors that we would normally not be bothered by that will simply feel wrong when seen in a video game .
A very clean hallway will look unfinished and a perfectly straight edge will look like it lacks detail .
So we can tell that already , the artistic direction has been influenced by the development of the tech we can now use , and that the video game medium makes it easier for the viewer to doubt what he sees .
But why desaturated colors ?
There is one thing that our current consoles are terrible at ; lighting .
Our current lighting solutions are improving , but for the moment we have much difficulty simulating indirect lighting , especially in real - time .
In the previous generation , graphical quality was not high enough for us to be bothered by the lack of indirect illumination in our saturated environments , but once again , as graphical quality rises , so does our expectations of how the world should be presented .
Just as wonky animations will shatter immersion , so will poor lighting .
To hide this problem , we tend to instinctively desaturate everything .
The mere presence of saturated colors unbalances the rest of the image .
Since we often have some form of ambient occlusion in our environments , this visual effect makes the game look more visually convincing .
The lack of indirect illumination , or more specifically the lack of radiosity , brings this level of believability off balance .
Here is an image that illustrates the problem :
The top image does n't look bad , ambient occlusion ( the dark edges around the areas where the different surfaces are close to one another ) works well to add quality to the image .
But the lack of radiosity does n't feel right .
Imagine if this scene was actually a colorful sunlit living room in a penthouse .
The lack of bouncing colors would really cheapen the quality of the image .
Here 's the same image as above , but in black and white :
Now that the radiosity can't really be perceived , the visual quality does n't go off balance .
The game Mirror 's Edge used some nifty tech to simulate indirect lighting , which was really vital to the game 's visual quality .
It simply could not have been set in a clean white city with brightly saturated surfaces if it was n't for this tech ; it would have made the game look cheap , fake , and not immersive at all .
Gears of War on the other hand had an artistic direction developed around the idea of using the new graphical developments to their full extent , so Epic went for dark environments with bumpy rocks and dirty metallic surfaces which would allow them to light the scenes up with multiple dynamic lights , allowing them to get the most out of their normal maps and specular highlights .
Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves has an even more saturated palette than Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune because their lighting solution has vastly improved since and can be showcased rather well in colorful environments .
They also use saturated colors to make certain objects stand out so as to guide the player throughout the level , it 's subtle but it works well .
Uncharted 2 will probably be even more of a trend setter than Mirror 's Edge since it manages to pull off the gritty look while still using a unique color palette .
It really allows the game to set itself apart from the competition .
As our lighting solutions unify and become more dynamic - oriented , we can expect the next - generation games to have a much wider variety of color palettes as real - time translucency and indirect illumination become easily achievable .
Expect saturated colors to be the new brown .

" In a world where more and more borders are being opened up it is tragic to see walls still being erected , " Pope Benedict XVI said on Wednesday afternoon in his visit to the al - Aida refugee camp in the West Bank .
" How earnestly we pray for an end to the hostilities that have caused this wall to be built , " he said .
Defending Benedict Vatican rejects criticism of pope Ronen Medzini ' The pope was never in the Hitler Jugend … and he should not have to apologize for being forced to wear Wehrmacht uniform , ' says Vatican spokesman in terse defense of Benedict XVI following tepid reception to much - anticipated speech at Yad Vashem Vatican rejects criticism of pope
The wall , he said could be taken down , if Israelis and Palestinians could remove the walls around their hearts .
" Overshadowing much of Bethlehem , the wall that intrudes into your territories , separating neighbors and dividing families …
Although walls can be easily built , we all know that they do not last forever , they can be taken down .
First , though , it is necessary to remove the walls that we build around our hearts , " he said .
" On both sides of the wall , " he said , " great courage is needed if fear and mistrust is to be overcome . "
The pope called the wall a " stark reminder of the stalemate that relations between Palestinians and Israelis seemed to have reached . "
He also urged young Palestinians to " have the courage to resist any temptation to resort to acts of violence or terrorism . "
Addressing the assembled crowd , the pope said it was understandable that Palestinians feel frustrated .
" Their legitimate aspirations for permanent homes , for an independent Palestinian state , remain unfilled , " he said .
The pope also used his platform in Bethlehem to endorse the establishment of a Palestinian state .
Standing next to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the pope said : " Mr. President , the Holy See supports the right of your people to a sovereign Palestinian homeland in the land of your forefathers , secure and at peace with its neighbors , within internationally recognized borders . "
Abbas ' presence at the ceremony in Bethlehem , as well as that of Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad also gave both a brief respite from the political turmoil in Ramallah over the formation of Fayyad 's new government , which was scheduled to have been sworn in yesterday but Fatah officials failed to bridge the existing gaps in time .
' We have 11,000 Shalits '
Residents of the refugee camp presented the pontiff with keys , a recurring Palestinian icon intended to symbolize the homes left behind in 1948 .
Two young girls , one Christian and one Muslim , who both have relatives jailed in Israel also presented the pope with a letter on behalf of 11,000 Palestinian prisoners .
" Israel has one Shalit , we have 11,000 Shalits , " the host of the ceremony said , referring to captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit .
Local residents said that they believed that the pope , as a German native , should be particularly sensitive to the issue of separation fences .
A spokesman for the committee charged with preparing the ceremony for the pope 's visit said that he hopes today 's media coverage raises awareness of the refugee issue around the world .
During his visit to the Palestinian Authority the pope donated 70,000 euro to the residents of the al - Aida camp .
Karen AbuZayd , commission - general of UNWRA , said that the money would be invested in building classrooms at the refugee camp 's school for boys .
The pope also said that he prayed for Israel to remove the blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip since Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave from Fatah .
Why was the Industrial Revolution British ?
Robert Allen
It is still not clear among economic historians why the Industrial Revolution actually took place in 18th century Britain .
This column explains that it is the British Empire ’s success in international trade that created Britain ’s high wage , cheap energy economy , and it was the spring board for the Industrial Revolution .
Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in eighteenth century Britain and not elsewhere in Europe or Asia ?
Answers to this question have ranged from religion and culture to politics and constitutions .
In a just published book , The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective , I argue that the explanation of the Industrial Revolution was fundamentally economic .
The Industrial Revolution was Britain ’s creative response to the challenges and opportunities created by the global economy that emerged after 1500 .
This was a two step process .
In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries a European - wide market emerged .
England took a commanding position in this new order as her wool textile industry out competed the established producers in Italy and the Low Countries .
England extended her lead in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by creating an intercontinental trading network including the Americas and India .
Intercontinental trade expansion depended on the acquisition of colonies , mercantilist trade promotion , and naval power .
The upshot of Britain ’s success in the global economy was the expansion of rural manufacturing industries and rapid urbanisation .
East Anglia was the centre of the woollen cloth industry , and its products were exported through London where a quarter of the jobs depended on the port .
As a result , the population of London exploded from 50,000 in 1500 to 200,000 in 1600 and half a million in 1700 .
In the eighteenth century , the expansion of trade with the American colonies and India doubled London ’s population again and led to even more rapid growth in provincial and Scottish cities .
This expansion depended on vigorous imperialism , which expanded British possessions abroad , the Royal Navy , which defeated competing naval and mercantile powers , and the Navigation Acts , which excluded foreigners from the colonial trades .
The British Empire was designed to stimulate the British economy–and it did .
The growth of British commerce had three important consequences .
First , the growth of London created a shortage of wood fuel that was only relieved by the exploitation of coal .
Figure 1 shows the real price per million BTUs of energy in London from wood and coal in this period .
In the fifteenth century , the two fuels sold at the same price per million BTU ’s which meant that the market for coal was limited given its polluting character .
As London grew after 1500 , the price of wood fuels rose and by the end of the sixteenth century , charcoal and firewood were twice the price of coal per unit of energy .
With that premium , consumers began to substitute coal for wood .
Instead of a wood burning hearth in the middle of a large central room , houses were built with narrow fireplaces and chimneys to burn coal .
The coal burning house was invented .
It then paid to mine coal in Northumberland and ship it down the coast to London .
The coal trade began .
On the coal fields ( in Newcastle , for instance ) , Britain had the cheapest energy in the world .
Energy was more expensive on the European continent and particularly expensive in China ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 1 .
Figure 2 .
Second , the growth of cities and manufacturing increased the demand for labour with the result that British wages and living standards were the highest in the world .
Figure 3 shows the wages of labours in leading cities in Europe and Asia from 1375 to 1875 .
The wages have been deflated by a consumer price index so that they show the purchasing power across space as well as over time .
A value of one means that a labourer employed full time , full year could earn just enough to keep his family at a subsistence standard of living of 1940 calories per adult male equivalent per day .
The budget used to define the consumer price index is set so that most of the spending is on food and most of that is on the cheapest carbohydrate available ( oatmeal in northwestern Europe , polenta in Florence , sorghum in Beijing , millet chapatis in Delhi ) .
Only tiny quantities of meat , oil , cloth , fuel , and housing are included in the budget .
After the Black Death in the mid-fourteenth century , the standard of living of workers everywhere was high ; they typically earned three or four times subsistence .
In the ensuing centuries , population growth in Europe and Asia led to falling real wages , so that most workers ended up in the eighteenth century earning just enough to purchase the subsistence standard of living .
The only countries to avoid that fate were Britain and the Low Countries .
Their populations , in fact , grew more rapidly than those elsewhere , but this effect was offset by the booms in their economies due to international trade .
Workers in London and Amsterdam did not , however , buy four times as much oatmeal as they needed for subsistence .
Instead they upgraded their diets to beef , beer , and bread , while their counterparts in much of Europe and Asia subsisted on quasi-vegetarian diets of boiled grains with a few peas or lentils .
Workers in northwestern Europe also had surplus income to buy exotic imports like tea and sugar as well as domestic manufactures like books , pictures , watches , and better clothes .
Figure 3 .
Third , the growth of cities and the high wage economy stimulated agriculture .
The strong demand for food and particularly meat , butter , and cheese led to the conversion of arable to pasture , convertible husbandry , and the production of fodder crops ( beans , clover , turnips ) , most of which raised soil nitrogen levels and pushed up the yields of wheat and barley .
The urban demand for labour led to the amalgamation of small holdings into large farms , which employed fewer people per acre , a development also entailed by the conversion of ploughed land to grass .
Agriculture was revolutionised because cities expanded , rather than the reverse as historians have often maintained .
Success in international trade created Britain ’s high wage , cheap energy economy , and it was the spring board for the Industrial Revolution .
High wages and cheap energy created a demand for technology that substituted capital and energy for labour .
These incentives operated in many industries .
Pottery , for instance , was manufactured in both England and China .
The design of the kilns differed greatly , however .
English kilns were cheap to build but very fuel inefficient ; much of the energy from the burning fuel was lost through the vent hole on the top ( Figure 4 ) .
The typical Chinese kiln , on the other hand , was more expensive to construct and , indeed , required more labour to operate .
Figure 5 shows how heat was drawn into the chamber on the left and then forced out a hole at floor level into a second chamber .
The process continued through many chambers until the air , by then denuded of most of its heat , finally exited up a chimney .
In England , it was not worth spending a lot of money to build a thermally efficient kiln since energy was so cheap .
In China , however , where energy was expensive , it was cost effective to build thermally efficient kilns .
The technologies that were used reflected the relative prices of capital , labour , and energy .
Since it was costly to invent technology , invention also responded to the same incentives .
Figure 4 . English kiln
Figure 5 . Chinese kiln
The famous inventions of the Industrial Revolution were responses to the high wages and cheap energy of the British economy .
These inventions also substituted capital and energy for labour .
The steam engine increased the use of capital and coal to raise output per worker .
The cotton mill used machines to raise labour productivity in spinning and weaving .
New technologies of iron making substituted cheap coal for expensive charcoal and mechanised production to increase output per worker .
These technologies eventually revolutionised the world , but at the outset they were barely profitable in Britain , and their commercial success depended on increasing the use of inputs that were relatively cheap in Britain .
In other countries , where wages were lower and energy more expensive , it did not pay to use technology that reduced employment and increased the consumption of fuel .
The French government was very active in trying to promote advanced British technology in the eighteenth century , but its efforts failed since the British techniques were not cost effective at French prices .
James Hargreaves perfected the spinning jenny , the first machine that successfully spun cotton , in the late 1760s .
In 1771 , John Holker , an English Jacobite who held the post of Inspector General of Foreign Manufactures , spirited a jenny into France .
Demonstration models were made , but the jenny was only installed in large , state supported workshops .
By the late 1780s , over 20,000 jennies were used in England and only 900 in France .
Likewise , the French government sponsored the construction of an English style iron works ( including four coke blast furnaces ) in Burgundy in the 1780s .
The raw materials were adequate , the enterprise was well capitalised , and they hired outstanding and experienced English engineers to oversee the project .
Yet it was a commercial flop because coal was too expensive in France .
Since the technologies of the Industrial Revolution were only profitable to adopt in Britain , that was also the only country where it paid to invent them .
The ideas embodied in the breakthrough technologies were simple ; the difficult problem was the engineering challenge of making them work .
Responding to that challenged required research and development , which emerged as an important business practice in the eighteenth century .
It was accompanied by the appearance of venture capitalists to finance the R&D and a reliance on patents to recoup the benefits of successful development .
The Industrial Revolution was invented in Britain in the eighteenth century because that was where it paid to invent it .
The success of R&D programs in eighteenth century Britain depended on another characteristic of the high wage economy .
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the growth of a manufacturing , commercial economy increased the demand for literacy , numeracy and trade skills .
These were acquired through privately purchased education and apprenticeships .
The high wage economy not only created a demand for these skills , but also gave parents the income to purchase them .
As a result , the British population was highly skilled ( by international standards ) , and those skills were necessary for the high tech revolution to unfold .
The Industrial Revolution was confined to Britain for many years , because the technological breakthroughs were tailored to British conditions and could not be profitably deployed elsewhere .
However , British engineers strove to improve efficiency and reduced the use of inputs that were cheap in Britain as well as those that were expensive .
The consumption of coal in steam engines , for instance , was cut from 45 pounds per horse power - hour in the early eighteenth to only 2 pounds in the mid-nineteenth .
The genius of British engineering undermined the country ’s technological lead by creating ‘ appropriate technology ’ for the world at large .
By the middle of the nineteenth century , advanced technology could be profitably used in countries like France with expensive energy and India with cheap labour .
Once that happened , the Industrial Revolution went world wide .
Although Greenland is the size of Europe , it has only nine conifer forests like Mr Bjerge 's , all of them cultivated .
It has only 51 farms .
( They are all sheep farms , although one man is trying to raise cattle .
He has 22 cows . )
Except for potatoes , the only vegetables most Greenlanders ever eat - to the extent that they eat vegetables at all - are imported , mostly from Denmark .
But now that the climate is warming , it is not just old trees that are growing .
A supermarket is stocking locally grown cauliflower , broccoli and cabbage this year for the first time .
Kenneth
Hoeg , the region 's chief agriculture adviser , says he does not see why southern Greenland cannot eventually be full of vegetable farms and viable forests .
Farther north , Greenland 's great ice sheet , a vast white landscape of 1.8 million square kilometres covering 80 per cent of the island 's land mass , is melting rapidly , alarmingly , with repercussions not only for the traditional way of life on an island of 56,000 people , but also for the rest of the world .
The more the ice melts , the higher sea levels will eventually rise .
But in the subarctic south - a land of icy water , forbidding mountains , rocky hills , shallow soil , sudden winds and isolated communities slipped in , almost apologetically , along a network of glacier - studded fiords , the changes are more subtle and carry more promise .
" The limiting factor for human survival here is temperature , and there 's a lot of benefits with a warmer climate , " Mr Hoeg said .
" We are on the frontier of agriculture , and even a few degrees can make a difference . "
Climate is a delicate matter in a place like this .
A degree more of warmth here , 25 millimetres less of rain there ; these can have serious repercussions for a farmer scraping a living raising sheep on the harsh terrain .
But while temperatures in the south dipped in the 1980s , they have risen steadily since .
Winter is coming later and leaving earlier .
That means there is more time to leave sheep in the mountains , more time to grow crops , more time to work outdoors , and more opportunity to travel by boat , since the fiords freeze later and less frequently .
As if visiting the zoo , people come from all over to gape at the varieties of grass in the fields and to see what is growing .
Hans Gronborg , a Danish horticulturist , plucked a head of cauliflower from its nest of leaves .
It had a rich , almost sweet flavour - the result , he explained , of slow growth , long summer days of 20 hours of light , and wide swings in temperature from day to night .
" It 's small , but it means you get all that flavour concentrated in one - third the size of a regular cauliflower , " he said .
" Greenlanders are hunters , and it takes time to change their way of living and being .
But I am confident that things can grow in south Greenland . "

If a passport , driver 's licence , OHIP card and citizenship certificate are not enough , Suaad Hagi Mohamud is ready to give fingerprints to prove who she is .
The Toronto woman jailed in Kenya after being told she no longer looks like her four - year - old passport photo says proving her identity is easy .
" When I applied for Canadian citizenship , they took my fingerprints , " the Somali - born woman said yesterday by phone from Nairobi , where she is out on bail pending trial .
" They can match them . "
She has already tried to prove her identity using all her other photo ID , plus credit and bank cards as well as a Humber River Regional Hospital user card .
Her ex-husband , 12 - year - old son , dozens of neighbours and her local MP – former immigration minister Joe Volpe – have all vouched for her in Toronto .
But the Canadian government does not believe her .
Last week , Ottawa issued a single terse sentence : " Following an extensive investigation , officials at the Canadian High Commission in Nairobi have determined that the individual arrested by Kenyan authorities is not Ms. Suaad Mohamud Hagi . "
For reasons stubbornly not explained , a doubt raised by a Kenyan airport official as the woman prepared to fly home after a visit has somehow escalated into Canada 's rejection of her identity .
Canadian officials have refused to answer questions central to the mystery :
Is the real Suaad Mohamud missing ?
Who is the arrested woman ?
Why does Canada disbelieve her story ?
Why can't fingerprints be taken ?
In the sole departure from the official line , Canadian High Commission first secretary Liliane Khadour last night requested a meeting tomorrow , Mohamud phoned yesterday to report , though the purpose of the meeting was not explained .
The stranded woman was preparing to leave Kenya on May 17 after a two - week visit with her mother .
Airport officials stopped her , jailed her and after eight days released her when a friend posted $ 2,500 ( U.S. ) bail .
African - born travellers commonly offer airport officials money to avoid hassles , a practice that might explain her problems , Mohamud said in one of several phone interviews this week .
" I am Canadian and I refused . "
But Nairobi police also stop people on the street to inspect identification papers , expecting a bribe , she said .
" Since I got out of jail , I have been stopped seven times and I have paid every time . "
Frustration among Toronto Somali immigrants over the case is mounting , said Kawnayn Hussein , host of the popular Somali - language weekly radio show Midnimo ( Unity ) on AM530 .
" I told my listeners , ` This could happen to you . ' "

Toronto friends recognize the phone voice from Nairobi as genuine and fear either jail in Kenya or deportation to Somalia , said Shukri Abdi , a neighbour who agreed to look after Mohamud 's son for two weeks and is still caring for him after nine weeks .
" I can bring together 50 people to identify her , " Abdi said .
" She is outgoing .
She has a job ( at an ATS courier warehouse ) .
Everybody knows her . "
Kenyan high commission officials in Ottawa did not return repeated calls over two days .

Canada 's biggest wireless companies are calling on Ottawa to slash the licensing fees they pay to access public airwaves , but there 's little indication that any savings will be passed along to subscribers – particularly when it comes to the controversial " system access " fees that show up on wireless customers ' monthly bills .
In documents filed with Industry Canada , the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association argues that the nearly $ 130 million in spectrum licensing fees handed over to the federal government each year far exceeds the estimated $ 3.8 million it costs Ottawa to manage the public resource , putting the Canadian wireless sector at a competitive disadvantage .
The fees , calculated to give a " fair return to the Canadian public , " are over and above what the carriers pay for the spectrum licences themselves .
" There 's an impact on the costs to the carriers , and any impact on costs reduces the available money for investment or driving down prices , " said Keith McIntosh , director of regulatory affairs for the association , in an interview yesterday .
He said a better approach would be for Ottawa to adopt a cost - recovery model such as the one used by regulators in the United States .
Bell Canada Inc. went a step further in its submission and requested a " spectrum fee holiday . "
Rogers Communications Inc. disclosed that it pays $ 50 million annually in licensing fees , adding that higher fees translate into higher prices for customers .
Telus Corp. , meanwhile , said any savings would likely be put toward network investments .
But there was no word yesterday on whether any of the carriers would consider scaling back the system access fees they charge to subscribers , which range from $ 6.95 to $ 8.95 per month and have been previously justified , in part , by the need to offset the licensing fees collected by Ottawa .
The fees were implemented during the early days of the industry , when the government required cellphone users to pay to access the airwaves – a practice aborted long ago .
The rationale for maintaining the fees varies from carrier to carrier , but generally includes the need to offset the costs of operating and maintaining a wireless network , including technology upgrades and the cost of buying and owning spectrum .
But critics note that such expenses are merely the cost of doing business in the wireless sector – no different than paying employees or leasing office space .
" It 's a misleading charge , " said John Lawford , a lawyer with the Public Interest Advocacy Centre , noting that such add - on fees allow cellphone companies to advertise lower prices .
Bell spokeswoman Julie Smithers said it was too early to say what impact a change in government policy would have on Bell 's customers , but noted there has n't been a direct link between the company 's $ 8.95 wireless system access fee and federal spectrum licensing fees for years .
Officials at Telus and Rogers declined to comment .
A 2004 class action lawsuit estimated that the industry collected about $ 800 million annually from the extra charges , with the figure now pegged closer to $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.5 billion .
The suit , certified two years ago by a Saskatchewan court , alleges that Rogers , Bell and Telus , among others , falsely led subscribers to believe their system access fees were required by federal regulators .

In fact , Industry Canada put in place rules five years ago that prohibited wireless companies from referring to the fees as a government charge .
Over the past year , the threat of increased competition in the $ 12.7 billion Canadian wireless sector has prompted Rogers , Bell and Telus to remove or waive system access fees for customers of their discount brands .

Back in September , Google launched its Chrome browser .
With advanced features like website task managers , visual histories , individual browser memory management , and even the ability to re-open tabs that you accidentally closed , Chrome promised to reshape the browser , offering new abilities and capabilities that went beyond the status quo .
Windows users got immediate access to those capabilities , but Google has yet to release Chrome for OS X and Linux .
That 's not to say that Google been hiding its development progress behind closed doors .
Chromium is the open source project that , like its metallic namesake , is used to make Chrome .
The Chromium source code repository has remained available and updated since the September 2008 Chrome introduction .
Since there has n't been any really big news or progress updates , Chromium for OS X and Linux has basically dropped off the radar for the past few months .
But that does n't mean that progress is n't being made .
We recently checked out the latest iteration of the Chromium source , and we talked to some of the Googlers behind the project to get a sense of where the Chrome OS X port is , and when Mac users might have something functional in our hands .
A Cocoa interface goes live
Just before Valentine 's Day , Google 's Mike Pinkerton , a Staff Software Engineer , posted several Mac Chrome screenshots on the mozillaZine blog .
Immediately , the Mac - loving portion of the web universe perked up and started taking notice .
Chrome ?
For OS X ? Everyone wanted to know how close Google was to a initial OS X release .
The answer then was " Not very . "
Pinkerton 's post made it quite clear that things remained preliminary on the OS X front .
" Now mind you , clicking does n't work , and the renderers crash like nobody 's business , " he wrote while gushing about finally getting a Cocoa UI operational , " but the other great thing is that the user interface stays running even if they do . "
When web denizens complained about the primitive state of the release , Pinkerton responded , " That 's exactly why we have n't released it , but it 's absolutely moving forward . "
As you can see from this video walk - through of the release at that time , there was not much to look at :
February Chromium Walk - through
That was then , and this is now .
A month later , Chromium has made huge leaps forward .
You can load web pages , follow links , and work ( somewhat ) with tabs .
There 's no support for plug-ins , and the browser remains fairly unstable , leaving as it did a wake of hung processes which I could follow using Leopard 's Activity Monitor .
As this second video shows , many features remain unimplemented , and basic features ( like closing windows ) may fail .

Follow - up on the ' Firefox v3.5 fiasco ' Saturday , July 11 , 2009
( Follow up to : The Firefox 3.5 fiasco )
I 'd like to inform the audience that the people over at NSS , the sub - system which is responsible for the disk - trashing behavior of Firefox 3.5 ( and the accompanying delays on startup ) on some systems , has worked on a fix for this which appears to be scheduled for FF 3.5.1 .
You can read the discussion by starting here ( which lands in the middle of the bug comments , but the comments above the one linked are basicly bickering comments over what to do to the symptoms instead of really fixing it at the root )
It 's good to know that the NSS folks finally listen in and will use CryptGenRandom when available ( it 's a windows subsystem method ) and will only revert to disk - based entropy collecting when CryptGenRandom is n't believed to be as solid as it is on ' modern ' OS - es like Windows XP and up .
I still think that MS has patched Win2 k 's kernel code enough to make CryptGenRandom ( which is essential for the TCP stack as well ) solid enough , but it 's their call ( IMHO , people should make choices based on evidence based arguments , but as Win2 K is rather old and no longer supported by MS anyway , it 's not such a big deal )
Let 's see whether this patch will turn out to be as good as it looks today .
I 'm glad Mozilla is keen on fixing this pronto , as FF 3.0 is scheduled to be non-supported software starting in January 2010 .
So what can be learn from all of this as a developer ?
In my opinion , the true lesson to learn here is that no - one is perfect and that it's key to keep listening to what our users experience when using the software we wrote , so problems can be solved better and choke points can be dealt with .
It 's all too easy to simply close the eyes and ignore problems reported by perhaps a minority of the users by cooking up excuses for not dealing with them , but that 's not the solution : the problems wo n't go away by ignoring them , the vocal minority might actually be representing a big non-vocal group or worse : a big non-vocal groups of ex-users .
That 's not to say that every problem ever reported by a user should immediately be fixed : unless you have unlimited time and resources , it 's practically not doable to achieve that , but we should at least try and investigate whether these reports might cover bigger problems , might affect bigger groups than a sole individual .

Part of the problem may be related to the uncanny valley ; we can only accept something as cute so long as it does n’t look too human .
Cross some invisible line and we no longer see a cartoons as a simplified caricature , but as an actual human being .
The result can be startling , though it is n’t always .
Shown above is Jessica Rabbit , who made a relatively graceful transition into the third dimension thanks to Pixeloo .
Homer Simpson made a much more startling real - world transition in the hands of Pixeloo .
Photoshop wizard mateloneBR capably recreated Bevis and Peter Griffin as actual humans .
Deviant artist mateloneRJ brings Simpson ’s character Hans Moleman into TRW .
Though I have n’t done a statistical analysis , I think it ’s clear that Simpson ’s characters are much more likely to be untooned than any other cartoon .
Above of course is Mr. Burns , also done by mateloneRJ .
Such is the state of video game graphics that the real - world version of Grand Theft Auto ’s Niko Bellic , created by the aforementioned Pixeloo , looks not much different from his Rockstar Games counterpart , shown below .
One final real - world version by Pixeloo — the frighteningly bulbous - nosed Mario — really should have accompanied my Sacred Heart of Mario post .
Well , thanks in part to Portland ’s Nate “ @xolotl ” Angell that dream of Twitter and iPhone and hide - and - seek goodness has become a reality .
Get ready to play hideNtweet .
[ HTML2 ]
If you ’re like me , you love a good game of hide - and - seek .
Or hide - n- seek .
And like me , you may also be a big fan of the iPhone .
Perhaps even — and this would be the trifecta — you , like me , may have spent a minute or two on Twitter .
If so , you may be thinking what I ’m thinking .
What ’s that ?
Well , I ’m always thinking , “ If only could I combine my affection for the iPhone and Twitter with the joy of hide - and - seek ?
If only … . ”
Well , thanks in part to Portland ’s Nate “ @xolotl ” Angell , some ghost naming from Heather “ @twigz ” Angell , and illustrations by Brett Forman of a novel design — and of course tons of brilliant coding by John Ellis who does n’t happen to be in the Silicon Forest … yet — that dream of Twitter and iPhone and hide - and - seek goodness has become a reality .
Get ready to play hideNtweet .
hideNtweet is new game that let ’s you bring back the fun of schoolyard hide and seek in the real world , playing with friends or solo with our scary ghosts , using your iPhone ’s interactive map to find your way , its camera to tag other players and touch home , and Twitter to communicate with other players .
That ’s right .
Just like when you were a kid .
Base .
Tagging .
All that stuff .
But you get to use your iPhone .
Which means that really fast kid who always got away from you ?
That kid does n’t stand a chance .
Try and outrun the iPhone camera there buddy .
So where does Twitter come into play ?
Well , you can taunt your opponents through Twitter , send out updates about your progress , or let them know when you ’ve reached base .
You could also use it call “ Ollie ollie oxen free ! ” which actually has absolutely nothing to do with hideNtweet .
I just like saying “ Ollie ollie oxen free ! ”
I got the chance to play this game while it was in beta one day at Beer and Blog .
Aside from being entertaining , it ’s a really impressive application in terms of the iPhone features it taps .
GPS , embedded maps , camera , texting , geotagging .
They ’re all in play to make the game work .
What ’s that ?
You do n’t have any friends who love hide - and - seek , Twitter , and iPhones as much as you .
Or you do , but they ’re not around ?
That ’s a sad story my friend .
But you can wipe away that tear , little camper .
Because you can play hideNtweet by yourself — against ghosts .
Ghosts ?
Oh yeah .
For those of you with no friends one to play with , hideNtweet offers four ghost players — Calaboose , Pleat , Scuffle , and Vetch — who will wander around near home base waiting for you to catch them .
That ’s right .
Play hide - and - seek by yourself .
And — as an added bonus — get the chance to exact all of your Pac - man revenge fantasies on surrogate Blinky , Pinky , Inky , and Clyde .
No power pills needed .
And you ’ll finally get the chance to show those ne ’er do wells who were constantly destroying your cool factor and stealing your hard earned quarters .
Oopie .
I might have over shared a bit there .
From like 1982 .
Let ’s get back to the app .
I ’m consistently impressed by how much is going on with the hideNtweet app — and how much it makes it feel like a good old fashioned game of hide - and - seek , albeit over a much larger geographical region .
And I ’m also impressed by what I assume to be a great deal of hoop - jumping taking place under the hood of hideNtweet .
I mean , you take a photo of home base .
It ’s geotagged .
And then there are ghosts running around nearby — I mean , not that I ’m playing alone .
I ’ve got friends .
Maybe .
The app is currently free .
You can download hideNtweet from the App Store , follow hideNtweet on Twitter , or you can get more information by visiting hideNtweet .

PRA releases new study , Toxic to Democracy
“ Tools of fear ”
build structures of violence , says Berlet
BOSTON – Charged with the fatal shooting of abortion provider Dr. George Tiller in a church in Wichita , Kansas , last Sunday morning , Scott Philip Roeder is a regular consumer of conservative talk radio , television , and websites .
But did Bill O’Reilly , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Glenn Beck — or any other commentator whipping up an audience with overheated demonizing rhetoric — actually help pull the trigger ?
It ’s not that simple , explains Chip Berlet , senior analyst for the independent think tank Political Research Associates ( PRA ) , in a new study entitled Toxic to Democracy : Conspiracy Theories , Demonization , and Scapegoating .
“ They are not legally culpable for the assassination of Dr. Tiller , says Berlet , “ but they must share some portion of moral responsibility for creating a dangerous environment . ”
According to Berlet :
Right - wing pundits demonize scapegoated groups and individuals in our society , implying that it is urgent to stop them from wrecking the nation .
Some angry people in the audience already believe conspiracy theories in which the same scapegoats are portrayed as subversive , destructive , or evil .
Add in aggressive apocalyptic ideas that suggest time is running out and quick action mandatory and you have a perfect storm of mobilized resentment threatening to rain bigotry and violence across the United States .
Demagogues and conspiracy theorists use the same four “ tools of fear , ” which Berlet identifies as 1 ) dualism ; 2 ) scapegoating ; 3 ) demonization ; and 4 ) apocalyptic aggression .
The basic dynamics remain the same no matter the ideological leanings of the demonizers or the identity of their targets .
Meanwhile , our ability to resolve disputes through civic debate and compromise is hobbled .
The study focuses on the history and dynamics of conspiracism , but argues that it is the combination of demagogic demonization and widespread conspiracy scapegoating that is so dangerous .
In such circumstances , “ angry allegations can quickly turn into aggression and violence targeting scapegoated groups , ” writes Berlet .
Conspiracy theories are widespread among right - wing populists in the Patriot Movement , which spawned the armed citizens militias and the Freemen in the 1990s — networks from which Roeder seems to have emerged .
Tracing the roots of conspiracism throughout U.S. and European history , Toxic to Democracy challenges it as a form of political analysis .
Modern conspiracism is rooted in bigotry , especially antisemitism and racism .
Conspiracy theories encourage demonization and scapegoating of blameless persons and groups — distracting society and would - be agents of change away from the real causes of social and economic injustice .
It ’s practiced by demagogues on the Right and on the Left — and both inside and outside the corridors of power .
What Richard Hofstadter famously described as the “ paranoid style ” in American political rhetoric can quickly move far beyond the conscious intent of those who practice it .
“ People who believe conspiracist allegations sometimes act on those irrational beliefs , and this has concrete consequences in the real world . ” writes Berlet .
Thus the tools of fear pointed to Dr. Tiller , and what happened is now tragic history .

Author Berlet and Public Eye magazine contributor Fred Clarkson speak about the murder on this Democracy Now video .
James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , last night dealt a ­monumental blow to Gordon Brown 's chances of ­holding onto office when he dramatically announced he was quitting the cabinet and asking Brown " to stand aside to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election " .
His statement , in effect declaring Brown unelectable , will further weaken the prime minister 's waning authority and takes the challenge to his leadership to a dangerous level .
Purnell made his sensational move after polls closed in the local and European elections - in which Labour was subsequently decimated across the board , informing Brown by phone last night .
It prompted a furious reaction in Number 10 with ministers saying Purnell was profoundly mistaken .
Brown had no inkling that Purnell was going to quit , since the work and pensions secretary shrouded his move in secrecy in order to prevent
No 10 mounting a pre-emptive strike against him , or seeking to challenge his motives .
A spokesperson for Purnell said : " He feels Gordon should now stand aside to give the party a fighting chance of winning the next election .
He is not seeking the leadership nor acting with anyone else .
This is not about jobs or careers . "
The source added : " He [ Purnell ] has made the decision in the last few weeks – he's always been very loyal , but he now feels he can no longer go out and defend the prime minister .
That is why he has taken the difficult decision to resign . "
No 10 said it was disappointed Purnell had chosen to tell newspapers before telling the leader of the Labour party .
Liam Byrne , the cabinet office minister said Purnell was profoundly mistaken .
He warned : " Let us remember one thing if there is a debate , if there is a leadership contest , if there is a change of leader is the British public really going to wear the Labour party carrying on in office , is it not going to ask for an immediate general election .
Having just put on not our most united front , that election will not be good for the Labour party . "
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , told the BBC last night he would not be resigning from the cabinet and that he did not agree with Purnell 's decision .
Despite that Purnell 's move is a blow to Brown because No 10 believed it was succeeding in isolating the cabinet - level rebellion after Hazel Blears , the ­communities secretary , quit on Wednesday in a badly timed move that alienated many party activists since it was taken only 48 hours before yesterday 's elections .
Purnell , a confirmed moderniser , decided , in contrast to Blears , that he would wait until polls closed last night before making his announcement so that he could not be accused of damaging Labour 's chances in the elections .
Unlike Blears , Purnell criticised Brown 's electability in his resignation .
Purnell , seen as a possible future ­leadership ­candidate , said he would not be seeking the leadership if it became vacant .
Alan Johnson , the health secretary , remains favourite to succeed Brown if the prime minister is toppled , but Purnell gave no indication of his preference as to who should succeed Brown , or how that could be achieved .
He emphasised he was acting wholly alone and not in concert with any other cabinet ministers .
But his decision to resign means there is a serious likelihood that other members of the cabinet will break ranks .
Conservative leader David Cameron denounced the " appalling , shambolic " state of the Government and called for an election .
" In a deep recession and political crisis we need a strong Government .
Instead we have a Government falling apart in front of our eyes .
Britain deserves better than this , '' he said .
" With this resignation the argument for a general election has gone from being strong and powerful to completely unanswerable .
" For the sake of the country Gordon Brown must take the one final act of authority left open to him , go to the palace today and call the general election we have been demanding . "
Brown 's allies battled last night to limit the damage , portraying Purnell as misreading the public mood as one of opposition to Brown when it was really disenchantment with the political class .
Brown was given a boost when Caroline Flint , the Europe minister , said she was remaining loyal to Brown , despite her friendship with Blears .
Two senior backbenchers , Barry ­Sheerman , the chairman of the education select committee , and Graham Allen broke cover to demand Brown stand aside .
Sheerman called on Brown to allow a secret ballot of Labour MPs on Monday while Allen said Brown " has a decision to make overnight and should take the ­honourable decision to quit . "
In a sign that something close to a civil war was ­breaking out another Labour backbencher , Geraldine Smith , said she was disgusted by Purnell 's " self - indulgent disloyalty " and insisted most Labour MPs were sticking by the prime minister .
But Downing Street will be aware that other ministers will undoubtedly assess their personal positions as the poll results come in over the next three days , and could be emboldened to resist new ­cabinet posts or quit altogether .
One former cabinet minister said the test would be whether Labour avoids third place in the polls , adding he would be expressing his views on Sunday night .
Brown 's opponents in the party always said the reshuffle would be a crucial test of his authority , and that if he could not assemble a credible government , power would seep away from him .
Purnell 's move is also likely to strengthen the secretive backbench revolt which is gathering steam and was reported to have about 75 members .
Earlier in the week it is understood that Brown , in a sign of the respect he has for Purnell , offered him the post of children 's secretary , the position currently held by Ed Balls .
The fact that he made the offer suggests that the prime minister has been planning to move his close ally , Balls , to the ­Treasury in a controversial move that would see the risky ousting of Alistair Darling .
Darling has been resisting being shifted from the Treasury , saying he had played a difficult hand over the recession as well as could be hoped .
Brown 's allies had earlier disclosed that the prime minister would next week be putting forward a policy prospectus as " an alternative to a damaging leadership contest " .
They had also said his policies would extend New Labour 's reforms .
But clearly Purnell , a former culture secretary , had lost confidence in Brown 's ability to develop a sufficiently clear domestic policy .
He had also become disenchanted with Brown 's interest in constructing political dividing lines with the Tories , arguing that such politics alienate the electorate .
In 2001 , Henri Cartier - Bresson reflected on the long moment in the early 1940s when he had briefly considered turning from photography to film - making .
" If it had not been for the challenge of the work of Walker Evans , " he wrote , " I do n't think I would have remained a photographer . "
It 's this quote that provides the epigraph for Photographing America 1929 - 1947 , a fascinating book that focuses on these two masters of 20th - century photography .
Intriguingly , Evans 's photographs span the years of the book 's title , while Cartier - Bresson 's were all taken between the spring of 1946 and the summer of 1947 .
It is tempting , if not altogether true , to say that Evans is essentially an American photographer ( the American photographer ? ) while Cartier - Bresson is essentially a European one ( the European one ? ) who , for a brief but illuminating period , trained his outsider 's eye on America .
Cartier - Bresson arrived in America from the newly liberated France in May 1946 to prepare for his first big American exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
That show did not actually open until the following February because the curators , believing that Cartier - Bresson had been killed by the Nazis while attempting to escape from a prison camp , were actually planning a posthumous retrospective when he showed up on their doorstep .
In the interim , Cartier - Bresson took two working road trips to the American Deep South .
On the first , undertaken just after he arrived in America , he was accompanied by Truman Capote for Fortune magazine , who would later memorably describe the French photographer " dancing along the pavement like an agitated dragonfly , three Leicas winging from straps around his neck , a fourth one hugged to his eye … clicking away with a joyous intensity , a religious absorption " .
Unconsciously or otherwise , Cartier - Bresson was following in the footsteps of Walker Evans , who had roamed the American south back in the summer of 1936 , when he was on assignment for Fortune with the journalist James Agee .
Their story of the plight of three tenant farming families in Alabama during the Great Depression was rejected by Fortune – they thought it too bleak – but , in 1941 , in extended form , it became the acclaimed book , Let Us Now Praise Famous Men .
Evans 's photographs have since become iconic images of the time .
Cartier - Bresson travelled south again in April 1947 , this time spending 70 exhausting days with a friend of Capote 's , a young American poet called John Malcolm Brinnin .
It was Brinnin who brought along a copy of Walker Evan 's American Photographs .
That book , published in 1938 to accompany the Moma show of the same name , had precipitated a revolution in American photography .
A move away from straight photojournalism and the still - predominant notion of the beautiful image , it was the most influential photography book of the time and remains a seminal work .
Ironically enough , Evans had been influenced by a Cartier - Bresson show that he had seen in Julien Levy 's small New York gallery in 1933 .
The photographs in the show were taken on a lightweight Leica and , as Evans later acknowledged , they revealed to him the liberating potential of a hand - held camera that shot at high speed .
" The photograph is the blade which seizes the dazzling instant from eternity , " Evans later wrote , anticipating Cartier - Bresson 's famous definition of a great photograph as the freeze - framing of " the decisive moment " .
Photographing America - the book is the English version of the French catalogue for a touring show that was exhibited at the Cartier Foundation in Paris in December of last year - shows how each influenced the other , and how their separate approaches , and their subject matter , overlapped most when the great European photographer turned his gaze on an America that the older American had already made his own .
Saratoga Springs , New York ( 1931 ) – a rain - soaked , wintry , tree - lined urban landscape shot from above – looks like a Cartier - Bresson photograph of a European city but is , in fact , by Evans .
Cartier - Bresson 's portrait of a partially - sighted hobo , entitled San Antonio , Texas ( 1947 ) , looks like it might belong in Evans 's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men .
Elsewhere , however , their differences are striking .
Cartier - Bresson liked movement and , although there are several landscapes in the book , he tended to train his camera on people .
In Evans 's photographs , the people tend to be stationary .
Sometimes they 're looking stoically at the camera , at other times they are caught unawares , often sleeping or lying exhausted on the streets .
Though Evans would go on to define America through its vernacular topography – billboards , road signs , shop fronts , highways – the images here tend towards the kind of heightened socio- realism that characterised his pioneering reportage with Agee .
Two similar but revealingly different images sit side by side in this book : Cartier - Bresson 's Natchez , Mississippi ( 1947 ) and Evans 's Tupelo , Mississippi ( 1936 ) .
Both are photographs of wooden buildings in the American South .
In Cartier - Bresson 's photograph , the building is pristine , but another wooden structure has collapsed in front of it .
A telegraph pole stands in the foreground , dividing the image in half , and your eye is drawn immediately to a little boy on a bicycle in the right - hand bottom corner .
Here is the decisive moment , all right , but it is surrounded by myriad signifiers , both formal and social .
On the adjacent page , Evans 's wooden building sits slightly askew between two other rickety shacks , a plume of desolate smoke visible behind them .
The image is starker , its formal mastery altogether more understated .
It signifies poverty , pure and simple , even though there are no people present .
Nothing here distracts from the sense of quiet desolation ; everything here adds to it .
Cartier - Bresson's American images are among the bleakest he took .
Time and again , the people in his photographs seem lost or marooned on the city streets .
In Manhattan ( 1947 ) , a man lies unconscious , a broken bottle oozing alcohol like blood on to the pavement .
In another , Jackson Mississippi ( 1947 ) , a life - size dummy with a black face hangs from a tree beside a sign that reads " I may be hanging myself for paying such high prices for cars " .
Arthur Miller later wrote of the photographs that Cartier - Bresson took in America : " Since his is fundamentally a tragic vision , he reacted most feelingly to what in America he saw as related to its decay , its pain . "
Evans would surely have approved .
When The Decisive Moment was published in America in 1952 , Evans reviewed it for the New York Times , describing Cartier - Bresson simply but tellingly as " a true man of the eye " .
He could also , of course , have been describing himself .
Each of them , in their separate ways , reinvented photography , and although neither of them believed it to be as elevated as painting or writing , they helped make photography the art form it is today .

The original said that the Paris exhibition of the works discussed here was due to be held later this year .
This has been corrected , and the connection between the book and an earlier French exhibition catalogue clarified .
Geek - meister from Guadalajara , Guillermo del Toro *
Photo : Art Streiber *
Two years ago , few outside of fanboyland knew who Guillermo del Toro was .
Film geeks name - dropped him as one of the " Three Amigos , " a triad of up - and - coming Mexican - born buddies that includes Alfonso Cuarón ( Children of Men ) and Alejandro Gonzàlez Inàrritu ( Babel ) .
But del Toro was probably the nerdiest of the three — the pasty indoor kid behind Hellboy who doodled in his notebook and painted pewter dragons while his pals made " important " films with Clive Owen and Brad Pitt .
That changed with Pan's Labyrinth , his grimly vivid coming - of - age fable set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War .
Nominated for six Oscars and winning three ( including Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction ) , Labyrinth instantly elevated the talented schlock - meister from geek totem to critically beloved prophet .
He was handpicked by Peter Jackson to helm the two - part prequel to The Lord of the Rings and took on a slew of projects that will keep him in the spotlight for years .
His plate is now piled high with a Frankenstein adaptation , revisionist Dickens , loyalist Vonnegut , and more .
Suddenly , we 're looking down the barrel of the Del Toro Decade .
But do n't worry :
While he 's poised to succeed Spielberg and Lucas atop Blockbuster Mountain , the 44 - year - old kid from Guadalajara is still a talented schlock - meister .
Who but a committed nerd would carve out time between making Hellboy II and developing The Hobbit ( with executive producers Jackson and Fran Walsh , as well as scribe Philippa Boyens ) to cowrite splattery vampire novels ?
( The Strain , a sort of modern reply to Bram Stoker 's original Dracula and the first volume in an epic bloodsucker trilogy , is due out June 2 . )
Del Toro is tight - lipped about his three - year Hobbit odyssey — the screenplay is n't finished , and casting has yet to be announced formally .
But he 's more than ready to hold forth on vampires , his creative process , and the future of movies .
Hint :
They 'll be more than just films — and you , dear reader , will be in them .
If you dare .
__Wired : __
You 're pretty busy these days .
What made you want to write vampire - themed horror novels ?
__Guillermo del Toro : __ I originally wrote a very long outline for a TV series I wanted to do called The Strain .
And then the network president at Fox said to me , " We do want something with vampires — but could you make it a comedy ? "
Obviously , I responded , " No thank you " and " Can I have my outline back ? "
__Wired : __
So you turned a TV show into a novel , which you cowrote with best - selling crime author Chuck Hogan .
Why a collaboration ?
__del Toro : __ I 've written short stories in Spanish and English .
I 've written screenplays .
But I 'm not good at forensic novels .
I 'm not good at hazmat language and that CSI - style precision .
When Stoker wrote Dracula , it was very modern , a CSI sort of novel .
I wanted to give The Strain a procedural feel , where everything seems real .
__Wired : __ But " real " for you is so ... unreal .
You set The Strain in New York .
In the past , your depictions of the city , from Mimic to Blade II to Hellboy , have had a fabulous aspect .
__del Toro : __
It comes from my first trip to New York as a child .
I was walking around Central Park , and I saw one of these expensive apartment buildings .
At the top was a Gothic tower , and I said to my mother , " A vampire lives there . "
I was n't being metaphorical .
Then we went into the subway and — wow !
For a guy from Guadalajara , the subway is mythical .
The underground of the city is like what 's underground in people .
Beneath the surface , it 's boiling with monsters .
Nerd 's Labyrinth : Guillermo del Toro inside his monstrous LA lair .
Photo : Art Streiber __Wired : __ With Pan's Labyrinth , you proved you can indulge your love of monsters and seek artistic credibility at the same time .
Do you still get push - back from an industry that believes the science fiction / fantasy genre and " serious filmmaking " do n't mix ?
__del Toro : __ People think because you love genre you do n't know anything else .
It 's condescending .
If the emotion is provoked and the goals are achieved , what does it matter ?
Is Thomas Pynchon a more worthy read than Stephen King ?
It depends on the afternoon .
And I love Kurt Vonnegut .
He threads the profane and irreverent with the profound and soul - searing .
Coming Soon : The Del Toro Decade
Guillermo del
Toro is slated to write , direct , or produce at least 11 movies in the next decade .
He 's got the chops , but he 's only human .
The two Hobbit flicks alone will take roughly three years , which leaves just seven for the rest .
Here 's a rundown , with our projected odds of their hitting the big screen .
—Scott Pierce
= How much we want to see it
= How likely it is to happen
The Hobbit
With a reported $ 300 million total budget , del Toro is in New Zealand preparing to shoot his back - to - back prequels to The Lord of the Rings , set for release in 2011 and 2012 .
Would n't it be so cool if Bilbo had eyes on his palms ?
Hellboy III
A $ 237 million worldwide gross for this franchise will likely mean a trilogy .
Del Toro could step in as a producer to sell tickets , but there 's probably not a snowflake 's chance in Hellboy he 'll be directing .
We 'll still see it for Ron Perlman .
Drood
Charles Dickens as a killer ?
Del Toro was all over Dan Simmons ' revisionist novel well before it was published earlier this year .
Drood is just one of the projects in del Toro 's multiyear first - look deal with Universal .
Targeted for a 2012 release .
Pinocchio
Del Toro hopes to produce this film , possibly in stop-motion , based on Gris Grimly 's dark 2002 novelized reimagining of the classic tale .
But with Henry Selick 's Coraline and Wes Anderson 's upcoming Fantastic Mr. Fox , we say , no mo ' stop-mo !
Slaughterhouse - Five
Another film for Universal .
Del Toro plans to stay true to Kurt Vonnegut 's novel — unlike a certain Hugo - award - winning movie from 1972 .
We can't wait to see how he 'll update our all - time favorite tale of World War II and alien abduction .
At the Mountains of Madness
Another Universal endeavor , this one is a big - screen adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft 's mythic tale .
Universal , however , appears to be sharing the Lovecraft , with another H. P.- related project reportedly in the pipeline — with Ron Howard behind the lens .
Frankenstein
Del Toro is eager to direct his longtime passion project .
But after Kenneth Branagh 's disappointing 1994 effort ( Robert De Niro , what were you thinking ? ) , we need another Frankenstein reboot like we need two bolts in the neck .
The Witches
The blogosphere says that del Toro will direct his own stop-motion treatment of this Roald Dahl fantasy .
A script is in the works , but another stop-motion ?
It 's doubtful that del Toro has time to play with figurines .
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
With scores of film adaptations out there , we 're of two minds on another redo of the classic novella .
Still , del Toro has expressed interest in making it a portrait of addiction — and one installment in a series of grisly , Victorian - era horror films .
Doctor Strange
Del Toro and Neil Gaiman discussed an adaptation of the obscure Marvel character .
But with dueling schedules ( including Gaiman 's Graveyard Book — a children 's fantasy novel — and his screenplay for The Road to En - Dor ) , this one is purely fiction .
__Wired : __
Is that what attracted you to Slaughterhouse - Five ?
__del Toro : __ Of course .
Enormous truths can be revealed with a sense of humor and whimsy .
With Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil 's Backbone , which is a less well - known film , I was trying the same thing , in a way .
And with my first feature , the vampire fable Cronos , too .
I tried to take genre premises and explore them obliquely , where the fantastic is either tangential or illuminates reality in a different way .
__Wired : __
The movies you 've booked will keep you busy for another decade or more .
They will also make you the dominant fantasist for this period , which promises profound tech - driven upheavals in both content and distribution .
What will we see ?
__del Toro : __
In the next 10 years , we 're going to see all the forms of entertainment — film , television , video , games , and print — melding into a single - platform " story engine . "
The Model T of this new platform is the PS3 .
The moment you connect creative output with a public story engine , a narrative can continue over a period of months or years .
It 's going to rewrite the rules of fiction .
__Wired : __
It sounds like you 're talking about an entirely new form of storytelling .
__del Toro : __
Think about the way oral tradition became written word — how what we know about Achilles was written many , many years after it made its way around the world with different names and different types of heroes .
That can happen when you allow content to keep propagating itself through different kinds of platforms and engines — when you permit it to be retold with a promiscuous form of mythology .
You see it when people create their own avatars in games and transfigure their game worlds .
__Wired : __ How is that interactivity going to change Hollywood — and the way directors like you make movies ?
__del Toro : __ [ Legendary B- movie producer ]
Samuel Arkoff once told me there are only 10 great stories .
That 's where the engine and promiscuity come in .
Hollywood thinks art is like Latin in the Middle Ages — only a few should know it , only a few should speak it .
I do n't think so .
__Wired : __
So how will the public story engine tell those same 10 stories differently ?
__del Toro : __
We are used to thinking of stories in a linear way — act one , act two , act three .
We 're still on the Aristotelian model .
What the digital approach allows you to do is take a tangential and nonlinear model and use it to expand the world .
For example :
If you 're following Leo Bloom from Ulysses on a certain day and he crosses a street , you can abandon him and follow someone else .
__Wired : __
You 're describing a model that 's more like a videogame .
Is the merger of movies and games the first step ?
__del Toro : __ Unfortunately , I 've found in my videogame experience that the big companies are just as conservative as the studios .
I was disappointed with the first Hellboy game .
I 'm very impressed with the sandbox of Grand Theft Auto .
You can get lost in that world .
But we 're using it just to shoot people and run over old ladies .
We could be doing so much more .
__Wired : __
But these nonlinear , hybrid storytelling forms involve gaming tech , which could trap them in a geek ghetto .
What 's going to bring down that wall ?
__del Toro : __
Go back a couple of decades to the birth of the graphic novel — I think we can pinpoint the big bang to Will Eisner 's A Contract With God .
Today , we have very worthy people doing literary comics .
I think the same thing will happen on the Internet - gaming side .
In the next 10 years , there will be an earthshaking Citizen Kane of games .
__Wired : __
Are you going to create it ?
__del Toro : __ I 'll be trying to make it .
But I wo n't be trying until after The Hobbit .
__Wired : __ Seems like you 're pulling an Obama on us : doing everything at once .
That 's an interesting strategy .
__del Toro : __ Look , the fact that I have a simulacrum of a career is a wonder .
To paraphrase John Lennon , a career is what happens when you 're making other plans .

OREGON CITY -- Carl and Raylene Worthington told detectives that they never considered calling a doctor , even as their 15 - month - old daughter deteriorated and died .
" I do n't believe in them , " Carl Worthington said of doctors .
" I believe in faith healing . "
Raylene Worthington said that her religious beliefs do not encompass medical care and that she would not have done anything different for her - daughter , who died at home of pneumonia , a blood infection and other complications .
In Clackamas County Circuit Court on Wednesday , prosecutors played videotaped police interviews with the Worthingtons , who are accused of criminal mistreatment and manslaughter for failing to provide medical care for their daughter .
Ava Worthington died March 2 , 2008 , after her parents and other members of the Followers of Christ tried to treat her with faith healing .
Ava 's father , who goes by Brent , his middle name , described what happened :
Ava came down with what appeared to be a cold or the flu on a Tuesday .
By Saturday , her breathing became labored and the family turned to its traditional faith - healing rituals , praying , fasting , anointing the body with oil , administering diluted wine and laying on of hands .
By Sunday , Brent Worthington said he thought there was " a possibility " his daughter was so sick she could die .
Then , after a final session of laying on of hands at about 5 p.m. , " she perked up , " he said .
She grabbed her bottle and " took some food . "
" She was peaceful ; she was rested , " Worthington said .
Two hours later Ava was dead .
The interviewers , Detectives Michelle Finn and James Rhodes of the Clackamas County Sheriff Office 's child - abuse unit , asked pointed questions , and Brent Worthington provided details about his , his family 's and his church 's beliefs and practices .
He said no one in his immediate family has ever been to a doctor or used prescription or over - the - counter medicine .
" It 's not something we believe in . "
The detectives also asked about the growth on Ava 's neck , which swelled during the last days of her life .
Prosecutors allege the lump -- a benign cystic hygroma -- impeded her breathing .
The soft lump became more noticeable two months before Ava died and started to get " tight " the day before her death , according to the Worthingtons .
Brent Worthington said he had ultimate responsibility for Ava 's care .
" I 'm the head of the house ; it falls to me .
The wife follows the husband . "
He said he confers with his wife but did not consult with anyone else about treating Ava 's illness .
Raylene Worthington did not dispute the decision to rely on spiritual healing , he said .
Asked if she would have taken Ava to a doctor if she knew her child was dying , Raylene Worthington said , " I do n't know . "
Brent Worthington said that forgoing medical treatment is probably difficult for outsiders to understand .
For him , medical treatment " is not a question .
It 's not even thought . "
When the detectives told Worthington that the law requires a parent to provide adequate medical care , he said he had provided care .
" I did everything I could do for her , " Worthington said .
" What I was doing was working , " he said .
" She was getting relief . "
Dr. Christopher Young , the deputy state medical examiner who conducted the girl 's autopsy , disagreed .
" The absence of action led to her death , " said Young , who testified after the jury saw the interviews .
Ava 's cyst first appeared when she was a few months old .
By Christmas 2007 , the cyst was swollen and likely interfered Ava 's with breathing , Young said .
" That 's the time when a reasonable parent " would have taken a child to a doctor , he said .
Ava 's various medical conditions were easily treated , and antibiotics and a simple medical procedure could have saved her right up to the day she died , Young said .
The cyst could have been drained with a needle , providing temporary but instant relief , Young said , and antibiotics could have dampened the infections .

Mozilla is set to release its new Firefox 3.5 browser as early as next week after a year of development .
The new release will include a number of new features , but do n't expect to see many features that were inspired by the new arrival of Google on the Web browser scene with its Chrome browser .
Google introduced Chrome in September 2008 and included numerous new browser features like closer search engine access from the address bar and automatic updates .
Firefox 3.5 , which is currently at its third release candidate stage does not include those features and is n't likely to anytime soon , either .
The difference between the two browsers highlights the different views that Mozilla and Google have on what users want from their browsers .
Awesome Bar versus Omnibox
Firefox 3.5 improves on the " Awesome Bar " address bar design that Mozilla rolled out with Firefox 3 .
By default , it does not enable full search engine queries -- instead , Firefox ( as well as Microsoft Internet Explorer ) offers a separate search box in the browser .
But , as it turns out , some form of search is accessible through the Awesome Bar .
" What a lot of people do n't know is that if you type something into the location / Awesome Bar and no [ location ] matches come up , if you hit Enter , we run a Google search for that , " Mike Beltzner , Mozilla 's Director of Firefox , told InternetNews.com .
" The reason why it is architected that way is we do n't think that people expect that when they type something into their location bar that those words are being sent to a search engine . "
Google integrates search into its the address bar , creating a location bar design it calls the Omnibox .
While the Omnibox may behave like the familiar Google.com search box , the features have inspired some worries over privacy , with concerns about Google logging entries from users -- even if they never actually hit the Enter key to send a search to Google -- have been around since Chrome 's first release .
Google 's privacy policy on Chrome states that , " some Google Chrome features send limited additional information to Google . "
One of those features is the Google Suggest feature that helps users with their search query in Chrome .
Google blogged at the time of Chrome 's release that logged data like IP addresses are captured by Google for only 2 percent of requests .
Mozilla 's Beltzner , however , still has concerns .
" What you 're seeing with our competitors is they are sending [ address bar entries ] off to their search engine and we think that is violating a privacy boundary that some people might not expect , " Beltzner said .
" We just want to make sure that it 's clear .
So we keep search on the Internet where you are sending things out , in the box on the right and local search in the smart location bar . "
Google spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment by press time .
Privacy and updates
Another key change from the status quo in Google Chrome is that it does not require users to manually update the browsers themselves .
When a user installs Chrome , they also install the GoogleUpdate .
exe application that runs in the background of a user 's system to keep Chrome up to date .
It 's a feature that enables Chrome users to be updated faster than users of other browsers , according to a recent study in which Google was involved .
The study found that that after 21 days of a Google Chrome release , 97 percent of users were updated to the latest version .
Mozilla Firefox had 85 percent of users updated within 21 days .
But Mozilla said it prefers a different approach to rolling out updates .
" Chrome takes the philosophy that software should be like the Web and change and become better over time , " Beltzner said .
" I think what they 'll find it is that it pens them in from making radical changes in their user interface .
Unless those changes are announced , unless users have some warning that a change will happen , the general response you 'll see is shock and fear . "
Beltzner added that in Mozilla 's view , users want to feel as though they have more control over their own software .
With Firefox , users receive an update notification that they must click on in order to install a new version of the browser .
" We want to make security and stability updates painless to install for the user and we keep updating our mechanism to that end , " Beltzner said .
Beltzner added that Firefox 's developers want to inform users that Mozilla has made an update not because they want to pat themselves on the back , but because it feels wrong to change software on a user 's computer without telling them why .
" This machine is a user 's machine , and my right to put software on it , I think , stops at the point where they decide to take the software from me , " Beltzner said .
" I want to ship them a security update but I want them to understand why I 've done it -- that 's the philosophical difference . "
Three live performances are included in the Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 box set , two of which were actually released in 2008 .
Of course , that does n’t include live video footage you can find in hidden tracks and the video log , usually tucked underneath track listing screens , throughout the set .
If you pre-ordered the set , you also received another previously released concert on DVD / CD , Sugar Mountain Live At the Canterbury House 1968 , which I wrote about back in December in this post .
Also in that piece , I mentioned a bit about one of the other discs , Live At Massey Hall 1971 , which I picked up last year .
Live At The Fillmore East 1970 with Crazy Horse and Live At The Riverboat 1969 are the other two performances in the set .
Suffice to say Massey Hall is Young ’s best overall performance of these discs .
He appears to have fully realized himself as a solo performer by this time despite touring with a rather serious back injury and playing in a brace .
But he had found the perfect balance between polished performer and humorous and engaging stage personality .
As is revealed in an Archives meeting elsewhere in the set , he intended to release a live acoustic album from this tour at the time but it was ditched when sessions for the Harvest album began in February 1971 .
On both Sugar Mountain and Riverboat his performances are excellent and the song selections feature some of his earliest solo work and tunes from Buffalo Springfield , not material he revisits that often as a solo artist today .
The Fillmore disc , which I did n’t purchase on release , is also very good but my least favorite .
I like Crazy Horse , particularly during the Danny Whitten phase , and they are perfectly suited to Young , a rocking , raucous and loose outfit that plays well together if slightly frayed around the edges .
I can dip in and out of the disc but it ’s not one I will listen to beginning to end .
That disc has no audio hidden tracks I could find but it does have some excellent photos from the concert .
The material is from the Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere album along with Winterlong , Wonderin ’ and Come On Baby Let ’s Go Downtown .
I particularly like the slow , lazy rendering of Everybody Knows and both Down By The River and Cowgirl In The Sand .
That brings us to Riverboat , which is much like Canterbury but maybe even more engaging .
It was recorded in a very small club in Toronto and Young is in his extended rap mode , which kind of startled me on the Canterbury disc , since I ’ve seen him and never found him that chatty in concert .
Evidently , he was much more so in his early days .
All the raps are amusing and interesting , including an extended one on a visit to a doctor , the most “ incredible doctor ” he ’d ever been to who “ put his hand right inside me .
I ’m not kidding , underneath the skin .
And he changed me around . ”
Raps are included in between just about every track , including one that ramblings on about audiences , dope songs and ’60s band names and another in which he cites Robin Hood minstrel Allen A - Dale as being “ better the Clapton . ”
In my piece on the Blu - Ray preview disc I received , I trashed the early demo of Sugar Mountain from Disc 0 The Early Years as one of the worst versions I had heard of this seemingly overplayed tune .
As an opener on Riverboat , it ’s one of the best , if not the best , performance of this Young staple .
He takes it to places I had n’t heard before , particularly in his approach on acoustic guitar .
And although nearly six minutes , it ’s not in the slightest overlong .
The rest of the repertoire is all from one my favorite eras of Young ’s career with The Old Laughing Lady , I ’ve Loved Her So Long and The Last Trip To Tulsa from his first solo album .
Four Buffalo Springfield tunes , On The Way Home , Broken Arrow , Expecting To Fly and Flying On The Ground Is Wrong are included .
Just as on Canterbury , hearing the two songs from the Springfield ’s second album Again played acoustically is a real treat .
Also included is a little comical ditty called 1956 Bubblegum Disaster .
The highlight of these may be Flying On The Ground , which Young did n’t sing in favor of Richie Furay on the Springfield ’s first album .
The treatment here is delicate and accomplished .
Hearing
Young sing it brings out the beauty of the melody more than other renditions .
The disc includes nine hidden tracks , more examples of the loquacious Young , under the Archive listing in the main menu .
These are raps from another Canterbury gig from 1969 , a year later than Sugar Mountain .
Entertaining but it would have been nice if at least some of these included the performances of some of the songs he ’s talking about or that they precede .
That ’s a little curious .
Live At Massey
Hall has several video extras that include Young ’s performances of Needle And The Damage Done and Journey Through The Past on the early ’ 70s Johnny Cash TV show , a clip from a Dutch Documentary filmed at his Broken Arrow Ranch in California with the fellow he wrote about in the song Old Man and an Archives meeting .
There ’s also a radio interview with Redbeard about recording A Man Needs A Maid with the London Sympony Orchestra .
But the most interesting and my favorite live performance is n’t on any of these discs .
It ’s a hidden track on the timeline of Disc 6 Topanga 3 .
Here we find Young in June 1970 at the back of a small club in New York , the Feenjon Cafe , playing an acoustic version of The Loner that melds into Cinnamon Girl and is finally edited into the end of the song from an acoustic performance at the Fillmore East .
In addition , the clip ends with Young walking through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village , where he is stopped by a long - haired musician carrying what looks like a Gibson Jumbo acoustic guitar and asks Young if he ’ll show him how to play Cinnamon Girl .
At first reluctant , Young tunes the axe down to D mode and briefly shows his student where to find the opening chords .
An excellent sequence .
This segment , among many others on the set , shows that , although The Archives are expensive , have been endlessly delayed , beset by some problems on release and are housed in a small fortress , it ’s a project and concept far ahead of the curve and will be the standard for future career - spanning box sets .
Asylum - seekers have become early victims of the squeeze on government spending in the face of the economic crisis .
Allowances for people who claim refuge in Britain will be cut or frozen in the autumn in an effort to reduce the size of the asylum budget .
The " penny - pinching " reductions provoked fury last night with ministers facing accusations they were penalising some of the most vulnerable members of society .
They were also warned that the reductions would force refugees into destitution .
Under the moves , the subsistence allowance paid to single asylum - seekers aged 25 and over will be slashed from £ 42.16 to £ 35.13 a week in October .
The cash is intended to cover their living costs while they wait for their claims to be assessed .

In future , single asylum - seekers – the majority of applicants – will be expected to exist on just £ 5 a day .
Under government rules they are not allowed to increase their income by working .
The revised rates will apply to new asylum applicants rather than those already in the system .
The allowances paid to lone parents will be frozen at the current level of £ 42.16 .
Asylum support payments have traditionally been raised in line with the rate of inflation in the previous September , which would have entitled claimants to an increase of more than 5 per cent this year .
But the Home Office has ruled that such increases cannot be afforded this year .
In a letter seen by The Independent , the UK Border Agency tells asylum groups that the 5.2 per cent rate represented a " significant annual peak " .
It says : " You 'll appreciate that this review has taken place in a difficult economic climate and that our asylum support budget presents a significant financial challenge to the Agency .
" In this context , we have considered a number of different factors in setting the support rates for the coming year to ensure that the essential living needs of asylum - seekers are met within current budgetary constraints . "
Support for failed asylum - seekers who are awaiting removal – a process that can take years – is also being frozen at £ 35 a week .
Sandy Buchan , the chief executive of the charity Refugee Action , said : " Everyone is aware we are facing difficult economic times , but we cannot understand why the Government would seek to penalise the poorest in this way .

" Those seeking sanctuary are already the most vulnerable members of society , and to target them , especially lone parents with dependent children , seems unjustifiably harsh .
" It is also difficult to see how the spectacle of ever greater numbers of asylum - seekers sleeping rough or begging on our streets will assist community cohesion or increase public confidence in ministers ' management of housing and immigration policy . "
Asylum - seekers who have nowhere to live when they arrive in Britain are dispersed to accommodation around the country .
Originally they were issued with vouchers to cover the cost of food .
But the scheme was scrapped in the face of accusations that it was stigmatising asylum - seekers .
It was replaced with cash payments from post offices .
The payments have been uprated in line with the level of the Consumer Price Index in September , which was 5.2 per cent last year .
Refugee groups learned of the revised rates , which will be introduced on 5 October , earlier this month .
They have protested over the move in meetings with Home Office officials .
The over - 25 single person rate is being reduced to bring it in line with allowances paid to asylum - seekers aged 18 to 24 .
Refugee Action claimed single people over 25 would have had an increase of £ 2.19 a week if allowances had been put up by 5.2 per cent .
Instead the support offered to new claimants is being trimmed by £ 7.03 .
A 5.2 per cent rise would have also boosted allowances for single parents by £ 2.19 .
Instead their support is being frozen .
Last night the UK Border Agency pointed out that some rates – such as that to support couples and asylum - seeking children – was being raised by 5.2 per cent .
But it explained that it did not believe asylum applicants aged over 25 needed larger allowances as they did not have housing costs , or water , gas or electricity bills because they lived in accommodation provided for them .
But Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Many asylum - seekers are already left destitute by the Government 's incompetence and these penny - pinching cuts will make life harder still .
" Britain 's proud record of providing sanctuary to the oppressed is undermined by forcing people to get by on £ 35 a week .
The easiest way to cut the asylum budget would be to let asylum - seekers work to support themselves .
It is ridiculous that the Government wo n't even consider this for people who have waited months for a decision .
" Ministers have managed to create a system that is both inefficient and inhumane . "
Case study : ' We did n't know where to go '
Sysay Tedros , 26 , from Eritrea , fled to the UK with her mother and younger sister in 2000 aged 17 , after her father was arrested and imprisoned in Ethiopia .
She has since been granted refugee status and now lives in Manchester with her young daughter .
In 2003 she discovered that her father had died after he was beaten in prison , but she still does not know where he is buried .
" Three months after we arrived in the UK we were put on a bus and sent to Manchester .
We were given some paperwork and some vouchers rather than money – it took 10 hours to get to our house .
We arrived in a car park and a man picked us up in a car and took us to a house in Moston .
" He gave us some milk , cornflakes and bread and butter and went .
We did n't know how to use the cooker and for four or five days we just ate cold food .
We just knew we were somewhere in England and did n't know where to go .
There was no electricity or heating or anything .
We spent all our money calling the landlord , who never came .
There was water coming through the ceilings , under the door and damp everywhere .
My mother got £ 25 worth of food vouchers and £ 10 in cash .
At the time there were only a few shops where you could use the vouchers .
You could n't use them in markets where you could get cheap fruit and vegetables , and when you took them out , people changed their view of you .
It was hurtful .
" I used to walk to and from college every day for over a year , because we could n't afford to spend any of the cash on transport .
I was a teenager , but I could n't go into town or the cinema or do any of the things a 17 - year - old girl might do .
" It was hard for my mother , because she was illiterate and had left her husband and her whole life behind .
She did n't have enough money to call her family , so she could n't find out where her other children were , which made her feel extremely guilty all the time .
" Now , I work to support myself and do n't have a problem , but lone parent asylum - seekers only get £ 43 per week .
It 's very difficult to survive on this as a single mum with children under five , especially during a recession .
I see families who are struggling all the time . "
Gerardine Botte , an Ohio University professor , sees the liquid as a solution thanks to the particular composition of its major component , urea .
Its make - up , a 2 - to - 1 ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen , is convenient because hydrogen can be extracted from nitrogen using much less electricity than that needed to , say , pull apart hydrogen and oxygen .
( It 's a matter of 0.037 Volts versus 1.23 Volts , if you really need to know . )
According to The New York Times , Fox News host Glenn Beck has become “ one of the most powerful media voices for the nation ’s conservative , populist anger . ”
Extremist rhetoric wo n't rebuild GOP
Watching Fox News ’ new sensation Glenn Beck is not for the faint of heart .
It is a disquieting entree into the feverish mind of a conspiracy theorist who believes , among other things , that the government wants to remotely control our thermostats , that the relaxing of the ban on stem cell research — as well as efforts to prevent global warming — is reminiscent of Nazism , that the Federal Emergency Management Agency might be setting up concentration camps and , finally , that the country is on the path to socialism or possibly fascism but definitely some “ - ism ” that should be avoided .
Yet for all of his conspiracy - addled and occasionally tear - filled declarations , Beck has become the new darling of the conservative right .
His show is a regular stomping ground for Republican congressmen and party pooh - bahs like Karl Rove , Sarah Palin and Michael Steele , and his ratings rival those of Fox stalwarts Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly .
According to The New York Times , Beck has become “ one of the most powerful media voices for the nation ’s conservative , populist anger . ”

Populist agitators such as Beck are nothing new , particularly in times of economic instability — and they are n’t restricted to the right .
During the Bush years , liberal anger over the administration ’s policies bred bizarre conspiracy theories of its own , like accusations that the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job .
However , Beck ’s paranoid style is seeping into the discourse of conservative politics , which should be of concern to Republicans .
The charge that President Barack Obama is a socialist , first raised in the 2008 campaign , has become a de rigueur epithet heard not only on talk radio but in the halls of Congress .
Calls by China to consider replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency have been met by bizarre warnings from congressional Republicans that the Obama administration wants to scrap the greenback for a new global currency .
Thirty - four House Republicans have even signed on to a constitutional amendment that would prevent this from occurring , though no such proposal is being considered .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has joined in , decrying the Obama administration ’s proposed changes to charitable tax deductions as a “ clear ” effort to “ replace people ’s right to worship together with a government - ­dominated system . ”
The Republicans find themselves caught between two countervailing forces : the need to craft a policy agenda that appeals to middle - class Americans and the need to maintain the support of an angry base of voters that is alienated from , and suspicious of , the new president .
Beck , who with no sense of irony favorably compares himself to Howard Beale , is taking the latter course — with a vengeance .
While Democrats have sought to tie Republicans to Rush Limbaugh , his attacks are tame compared with those of Beck , who spoke recently of creeping fascism as visuals of Nazi rallies played behind him .
His occasionally unhinged attacks of strung - together nonsequiturs about the evils of Big Government provide little in the way of constructive solutions to the country ’s vast problems .
But this is also true of what we are hearing from Republican leaders .
Over the years , the GOP scored political benefit by playing on the resentments and fears of voters , but after the wreckage of the Bush years , Americans seem more interested in solutions than scapegoats .
Conspiracy - laden rhetoric is unlikely to resonate far beyond the party ’s core base of supporters .
Moreover , it ’s hard to imagine many Americans trusting a party so deeply influenced by its most extreme fringe .
If anything , catering to the far right risks becoming a millstone — a cheap way to score political points without having to do the critical spade work necessary to rebuild the party .
As the GOP ’s much - derided recent budget submission ( which continues the party ’s mantra of tax cuts , good ; government spending , bad ) demonstrates , there is still significant work to be done .
Republicans need to make a decision :
Are they going to cater to the paranoid fears of self - styled “ truth tellers ” like Beck , or are they going to present a substantive policy alternative to Democratic rule ?
For the good of the party , and the country , let ’s hope it ’s the latter .

Question for Customer Care ?
North Korea is making its first documentary about leader Kim Jong - il 's life , it emerged last Wednesday .
A similar documentary about his father Kim Il - sung was made in 1993 , a year before his death .
The official KCNA news agency and Korea Central Broadcasting said the Korea Scientific Documentary Film Studio had produced the first installment of a documentary about Kim Jong - il 's life .
North Korean media reported that the multi-part film will commemorate Kim's " immortal achievements " in the " military - first revolution . "
The first part seems to cover his childhood and youth until graduation from college .
But Korean Central TV did not air the film that day but only showed a rerun of Kim 's on - the - spot guidance tours in February .
A South Korean official said , " North Korea airs quarterly documentaries about Kim 's on - the - sport guidance tours , meetings with foreign dignitaries , and his attendance at major events , but th is apparently the first time the North has made a documentary about his life . "
A researcher at a government - funded think tank said there seemed to be a link between the film and rumors that Kim 's health is deteriorating and the succession has been decided .
But an intelligence officer said there were no reports of any imminent change in North Korea .
Introduction
To understand how these two operating systems are linked , their ancestry must be known .
Are the similarities coincidence , a migration of ideas or do Windows NT and VMS stem from some common source ?
What is VMS ?
Today , VMS is little known of outside of computer science circles , and rarely used by anyone other than diehard fans .
However , in the 70s , VMS was probably UNIX 's main competitor .
Before DEC produced VMS , it was famous for creating the PDP series of computers , most notably , the PDP - 11 architecture .
As well as creating the hardware , DEC also produced a range of 10 OSes for the PDP - 11 .
One of these operating systems was called RSX - 11 M , which was developed under the direction of a budding software engineer Dave Cutler .
It was because of his success in creating RSX - 11 M that Cutler was chosen to lead the development of a unified operating system for DEC 's new architecture , the VAX .
It was this OS that would become known as VMS .
Version 1.0 of VMS was released in 1977 , and was quickly accepted as a capable , scalable and backwards - compatible operating system .
It was chosen as the OS of choice for a multitude of applications , from desktops to servers .
Cutler continued to develop VMS for four years , until 1981 , when he became dissatisfied with the resources DEC were making available to him .
Realizing what a valuable asset a man like Cutler is , DEC bent over backwards to accommodate him , setting up a new development center in Seattle , putting a massive team of hardware and software engineers at his disposal .
His new task was to create a next generation CPU architecture and associated operating system to win a share of the massive PC market for DEC .
However , in 1988 , DEC axed Cutler 's project and made many of his members of staff redundant .
Unsurprisingly , Cutler was livid , and was thinking about leaving DEC once and for all , as he had threatened in 1981 .
Bill Gates was quick to learn of Cutler 's disillusionment , and worked hard to try and get the software engineer to defect to Microsoft .
Finally , in October 1988 , Cutler decided to leave DEC to go and lead Microsoft 's new NT project .
What is Windows NT ?
In the late 80s , Microsoft , in conjuction with IBM , were developing a new operating system , which was called OS / 2 .
Initial releases were not well accepted , and soon , a follow - on was started , trying to remedy some of the problems OS / 2 had had .
This project was called NT OS / 2 ( the NT standing for " New Technology " ) .
This is the project Bill Gates managed to persuade Cutler to come and lead , bringing many ex-DEC employees with him .
It 's main objectives were :
Out of these requirements , the POSIX compliance , portability and extensibility would be the hardest to implement .
As such a wide range of functionality had to included , Cutler decided to adopt a highly modular , layered approach for the OS , with a true microkernel .
In this way , Windows NT is very similar to MACH , a flavour of UNIX .
The compatability requirement demanded that many separate APIs were presented to userspace programmes , all abstracted away from the kernel mode device drivers and HAL ( Hardware Abstraction Layer ) .
Because of the layered design , any use of the user - visible APIs would involve drilling through many levels of internal abstractions .
This made all the above requirements relatively easy to implement , as new elements could simply be `plugged in ' to the existing framework , but performance suffered .
In April 1990 , Microsoft launched Windows 3.0 , which was a massive success .
In fact , this success made Gates realize that his company could easily produce and distribute NT OS / 2 totally independent of IBM .
In due course , the two companies split from the joint venture , IBM taking the code that formed the basis of OS / 2 and Microsoft taking the code that would become Windows NT .
Cutler no longer had to adhere to the OS / 2 API , and instead created a new API that would become known as Win32 .
Windows 3.0's massive success had more effect than this on Cutler 's project .
It was decided to rename NT OS / 2 as Windows NT in order to associate the new product with the established market leader .
Also , emphasis was placed on interoperability between the two emerging flavours of Windows , so Cutler included a Win16 API compatability mode alongside the new Win32 API and sidelined POSIX and OS / 2 APIs .
Initial releases of Windows NT were very poor indeed .
The strict microkernel approach taken meant that the system was very bloated and slow and despite portability being design aim , the OS was still not available for most architectures .
Cutler 's response was to push many of the abstracted layers into the kernel , notably the graphics rendering code .
This violated the clean and attractive modular design , but performance improved dramatically .
As I write this , the cutting edge Windows NT incarnation is Server 2003 .
Although there have been many cosmetic changes and new additions to the NT system , as Cutler said in an interview in 2000 , " The basic , internal architecture has not changed , except for Plug and Play " .
Cutler 's influence
Quite apart from the similarities in VMS and Windows NT , there a number of striking coincidences between what Dave Cutler did during his time at DEC and Microsoft .
It is almost as if he had a couple of goes at making an OS at Digital , then left and had another go for a different company .
When Cutler was creating his first true operating system , RSX - 11 M , he had to decide how to distribute the memory between the kernel and user 's applications .
It was decided that memory should split in two , with the top half of the addresses for kernel use only and the bottom half for other programmes .
This feature survived into VMS , where addresses 0 - 7FFFFFFF is mostly user - mode accessible only and addresses 80000000 - FFFFFFFF is mostly kernel - accessible only .
After moving to Microsoft , when Cutler was organising the memory management of Windows NT , he again had to work out how to distribute memory addresses , and again he used this same scheme - a half and half split down the middle .
One of the reasons DEC felt the need to produce a new architecture , the VAX , was to increase the number of address bits .
On the PDP - 11 , it was only 16 , which put an impenetrable ceiling on the size of memory , and hence , the effectiveness of the computer .
DEC 's competitors had already started this transition , so one of their demands of Cutler was that his new VAX / VMS system must have 32 address bits , while retaining backwards - compatability .
Back at Microsoft , one of Cutler 's main tasks was to reconcile the 16 - bit Windows 3.x API with his new 32 - bit system .
Obviously , he was well equipped to do this .
VMS was n't a perfect operating system .
One problem was that it was written almost entirely in VAX assembler , which meant code maintenace and revision was very difficult .
In 1993 , Cutler said " The biggest mistake we made in VMS was not writing it in a high level language " .
In contrast , Windows NT was written entirely in C and C ++.
Had Cutler been given another chance to implement VMS , but in a high level language as he so desired ?
One of the distinguishing features of VAX / VMS was the level of backwards compatability it offered to RSX - 11 M programmes .
With absolutely no adjustment whatsoever , binaries designed to run in another operating system , on another CPU could be loaded and run in VMS .
That 's like seamlessly running GNU / Linux PowerPC binaries in Windows on an x86 !
In Windows NT , interoperability was again required of Cutler , who had to make his operating system present POSIX , OS /2 , Win16 as well as Win32 APIs .
However , it 's not just what was asked of Cutler that was similar .
What he did to acheive those things , and how he accomplished a lot of tasks in the Windows NT project bear more than a passing resemblance to decisions he had made more than a decade before .
An overview of the similarities
The I/O Manager
Windows NT has a very distinctive and unique I /O manager .
Actually , it 's not quite unique , because it the same as the VMS manager .
Unlike many other systems , VMS and NT I/O is packet based and asynchronous .
To communicate with the outside world , a programme asks the kernel to send some information to a device , and potentially return the reply .
This is when the kernel uses the I/O manager .
As well as being asynchronous , the manager is distinctive in that it consists of a number of dynamically loadable and stackable layers , through which each packet must pass on its way to or from a device .
This means that the OS is very extensible ( as required ) ; new device drivers just slot into place inside the I/O manager .
In this diagram , packets flow from the top , through of the drivers stacked on the right , then through to the HAL .
When replies are received , they must propagate up through the driver stack and back out of the manager .
+---------+ | I/O | | Request | | Packet | +---------+ | | +--------------+
V | Driver Stack | +---------+
+--------------+ | | <==> | File System | | I/O | +--------------+ | Manager | < == > | Intermediate | | | +--------------+ | | <==> | Device |
+---------+
+--------------+ | | V +----------+ | Hardware | +----------+
Memory management
The description above could be used for both VMS and Windows NT , with the different terminology and different structures above and below the I/O manager .
As mentioned above , NT , VMS and even RSX - 11M , VMS 's predecessor , split the memory in two - half for the kernel and half for the user .
However , the similarities go deeper than this .
As RSX - 11 M was expected to work on such a small machine ( the PDP - 11 ) , its memory management was very efficient and sophisticated .
One of the ideas that it , and VMS , used were `working sets ' ; every process had one .
What a working set did was define the upper and lower limit of the amount of physical memory allocatable to that process .
This system ensures that one process using large amounts of memory will not squash other , smaller processes into smaller and smaller amounts of memory .
Windows NT 's memory manager also uses working sets , along with all the other optimizations , algorithms and methods used by RSX - 11 M to get the most out a computer 's memory , no matter how small .
As well as this , Windows NT has the same method of demand - paged virtual memory as VMS and both operating systems rely heavily upon memory - mapped files .
The terms " Paged Pool " , " Nonpaged Pool " and " Look aside List " all refer to exactly the same things and all perform the same task on both operating systems .
Kernel and Executive subsytem
VMS and NT both maintain levels of abstraction inside the OS called the executive .
This consists of various client / server systems including an " Object Manager " , " Process Manager " , " I/O Manager " and " Cache Manager " .
This prevents the kernel from becoming bloated and monolithic , and aids extensibility and portability .
In NT and VMS , these managers operate in privileged mode ( they can use the kernel 's memory ) although they still communicate to the hardware through the kernel and device drivers .
Interrupt handling
Passive level
VMS : Asynchronous System Trap ( AST ) , NT : Asynchronous Procedure Call ( APC )
VMS : Fork , NT : Dispatch
I/O Response Packets IRPs
Hardware maintenance : Power failure , timer , etc .
`HIGH_LEVEL '
I/O in general
Although the ranks of interrupt s are called Interrupt Priority Levels ( IPLs ) on VMS and Interrupt Request Levels ( IRQLs ) on Windows NT , they represent exactly the same thing .
In both operating system s , there are 32 such levels , all of which correspond to equivalent priorities between VMS and NT .
Here are a few of them , from low priority to high :
Although there are striking similarities in the I/O manager , the other structures necessary for I/O in the two operating systems also share some notable coincidences .
The only real difference is the names used to refer to the various entities , and the explicit Object - oriented approach that NT takes .
The following list gives the names of certain I /O - based elements that perform the same task in NT and VMS :
In VMS , the I/O manager receives I/O Request Packets , as it does in Windows NT .
VMS : Unit Control Block ( UCB ) , NT : Device Objects
VMS : Channel Request Block ( CRB ) , NT : Controller Objects
VMS : Adapter Control Block ( ADP ) , NT : Adapter Objects
VMS : Function Decision Table routines ( FDT routines ) , NT : Dispatch Routines
VMS : EXE$ QIODRVPKT , NT : IoStartPacket
VMS : StartIO routines , NT : StartIO routines
VMS : Fork routines , NT : Deferred Proceedure Call routines ( DPC routines )
VMS : Asynchronous System Trap ( AST ) , NT : Asynchronous Procedure Call , ( APC )
Again , NT and VMS share a distinctive feature : the scheduler .
The most obvious similarity is that they use hybrid static and dynamic priorities , split so that priorities 0 - 15 are variable and priorities 16 - 31 are fixed .
For threads with dynamic priorities , VMS and NT share a number of `priority boosting ' mechanisms .
when a thread requests I/O , with an IRP , its priority is increased by a driver specific amount .
there is a boost for GUI threads awaiting input : current priority boosted to 14 for one quantum ( but quantum also doubled )
if a priority is boosted , it decays by one after every completed quantum .
all threads have a base and a current priority .
The current value is increased by a boost , but never decays below the base priority .
In order to highlight just how different this system is from other systems , I 'll quickly look at UNIX scheduling .
In UNIX ,
the priorities range from 0 - 127
0 is the highest priority , 127 is the lowest
scheduling is done on a round robin basis within priorities
priority is based on usage and the nice value ( a user controlled value from - 20 to 19 ) in the following way : CPU j ( i - 1 ) P j ( i ) = Base j +
--------- + 2 * nice j 4 where 2 * load j CPU j ( i ) =
--------------- CPU j ( i - 1 ) + nice j ( 2 * load j ) + 1
Clearly , this is a vastly different system , from the basics all the way up to the general idea .
Miscellaneous
There are various operating system components scattered around that share some striking similarities , such as both VMS and NT representing the system 's resources as objects , under the control of an object manager .
Also , both VMS and NT implement security measures by associating an Access Control List ( ACL ) with every object and NT 's administrative utilities Performance Monitor and NT Backup are clones of VMS 's MONITOR and BACKUP tools .
Counter Arguments
Although it is hard to argue that Windows NT is an entirely new operating system , that is not to say that Microsoft 's software engineers have simply ported VMS to new architectures and rewritten it in C .
Not at all .
Microsoft have managed to create a good , new filesystem with NTFS , a new API : Win32 as well as a new GUI and ports to a wide range of architectures .
Also , some would argue that NT cannot be VMS because NT 's not good enough !
Microsoft products are infamous for their unreliability and insecurity , and although the NT series is better than 3.x , no one could claim it is secure compared to other OSes if they had any idea what they were talking about .
And it 's not like VMS is an insecure OS .
At DefCon 9 , a meeting of many of the best hackers in the world , a VMS box open to attack , running all the services an ISP would , was never compromised , while all the other OSes were dropping like flies !
As of July 2003 , the new incarnation of VMS , OpenVMS , has never been infected by a virus and has not been affected by a worm ( since the internet worm of 1988 ) .
Compare this to the track record of Windows NT .
Almost every , if not all , major virus , worm or trojan over the past five years has exploited Windows or software running on Windows , and most Windows boxes are n't even offering services such as a HTTP or FTP server .
How could an OS derived from VMS be so insecure , especially with the security subsystem copied across almost intact ?
Another argument many people would present is that VMS looks nothing like Windows NT , it has a different GUI and API , and is less ` point - and - click ' , especially nowadays .
However , the similarity I am talking about here is not the API , GUI or whatever , it 's the system internals , the jobs the kernel and executive deal with , the parts of an OS that make it good or bad .
The Windows trademark `look and feel ' might be how a normal user would identify an OS , and in this way , NT and VMS are very different .
However , under the hood is where an OS 's identity truly is .
The X windows environment ported to Windows NT is still Windows NT , it just looks better .
Conclusion
Obviously , DEC were n't happy with the apparent similarity of Windows NT and their product , VMS .
In fact , when DEC 's engineers noticed the problem , and brought their concern to the senior management , suing Microsoft for intellectual property violation was a possibility .
Instead , there was an out of court settlement with Microsoft .
As a result , ` Affinity for OpenVMS ' , a scheme to train DEC 's technicians and promote NT and OpenVMS as complimentary pieces of a networking solution was announced in summer of 1995 .
Plus , Microsoft promised to maintain NT support for the DEC Alpha processor and paid DEC up to $ 100 million .
I 'd say Bill Gates got off quite lightly .
An argument often provided to support the point of this writeup is that WNT shifted backwards in the alphabet gives VMS .
However , as NT was so named before Dave Cutler joined Microsoft , and before any major design decisions would have been made , I think this is a funny coincidence , and nothing more .
Major announcements from Google , Microsoft , and Apple in the last few weeks have techies flipping out about the awesomeness coming to our browsers , pockets , and desktops in the very near future .

Windows is making a much - needed comeback from the flop that was Vista , and it 's called Windows 7 .
Sure it 's cool to knock Microsoft for past sins , and we 're not saying that Windows 7 is the end - all and be -all of all operating systems — but it 's a marked improvement , and it 's ready for the future .
Windows 7 adds visual features to your desktop that you need now as well as lays the groundwork for a tomorrow filled with multi- touch devices and tiny netbooks .
Win7 is faster and smaller , able to run on a less powerful netbooks , and ready for your new touchscreen monitor or tablet .
( We have n't tried Win7 's multi - touch capabilities and for the record , some say that it 's only half - baked so far .
The road to the future is a long one . )
Current widescreen and dual monitor users will love Windows 7's taskbar and Aero Peek features for multi-tasking , previewing , and managing several windows .

Windows 7 will be available in stores on October 22nd , but unlike any other item on this list , the release candidate is available as a free download right now for anyone to install and try out , no invites required .
If you do , be sure to check out out our Guide to Upgrading to Windows 7 RC .

While it wo n't offer the same " ooh shiny ! " visual makeover that Windows 7 does , Apple is also battening down the hatches and getting Mac OS X future - ready .
The next version of the operating system , 10.6 , is a cheap $ 29 , and is revamped , enhanced , and retuned .
Snow Leopard takes up half the disk space of its predecessor , starts up and shuts down faster , and includes totally re-written default applications with 64 - bit computing support which means your Mac can more efficiently address and use more memory .
Snow Leopard 's also making tracks into the corporation with Microsoft Exchange support and taking a page from the iPhone book with location awareness .
And not to be left behind by Windows 7's new taskbar and Aero Peek , Snow Leopard adds Exposé to the Mac Dock to make managing and clearing away windows on your desktop as easy as possible .
While Snow Leopard is light on the user - facing features , here 's what you will notice when you upgrade this fall .

i Phone 3GS and the All - Out Smartphone War

Is it irritating ( and hard on the wallet ) that every single year there 's a newer , better smartphone on the market to lust after ?
Yes , ma'am .
Is stiff competition between companies to manufacture the tiny and powerful computer we walk around with in our pockets awesome ?
Yessiree .
Apple still leads the smartphone pack with the iPhone ( and the new iPhone 3GS unveiled this week ) , but the Palm Pre and HTC 's line of Android phones are also in the game , and that means better phones for all of us .
When you step back and think about all the devices a good smartphone can be to us : phones , email terminals , GPS devices , e-book readers , iPods , cameras , video capture and editing devices , and pretty much anything else an app can make them , it blows the mind .
Like Snow Leopard , the iPhone 3GS is light on the features ( save the better camera and compass ) but heavy on the speed and performance increases .
Expect this war to rage on , and spawn even more devices .

JOHNS COUNTY , Fla . -- A 20 - year - old man has been arrested for misusing 911 after asking police to escort him to a concert in Miami .
Deputies say Michael Kruse of Jacksonville initially called 911 because he felt sick on June 21 .
The call went into the 911 call center in St. Johns County .
Kruse 's speech was slurred and the dispatcher had difficulty understanding him .
Dispatch : " Are you sure you have n't taken something sir ?
Because you 're not making a whole lot of sense . "
Caller : " I 've been smoking marijuana . "
Dispatch : " You 've been smoking marijuana ? "
Caller : " Yes . "
Dispatch : " Do you want a deputy to come and take you to jail ? "
Caller : " Why ? "
Dispatch : " You just told me on a taped line you just got done smoking marijuana . "
Caller : " Awww .
Are you serious ? "
Sgt. Chuck Mulligan , spokesman with the St. Johns County Sheriff 's Office , said deputies located Kruse , took him to a family member , and gave him a stern lecture about 911 .
Hours later on June 22 , Kruse called 911 again .
This time he was driving on I - 95 .
He told the dispatcher he wanted a police escort to see the rapper , Lil Wayne , in concert in Miami .
Dispatch : " You want a police escort to take you to Miami ? "
Caller : " Or , you have a helicopter ? "
Dispatch : " We do n't just send helicopters up for rappers . "
Caller : " Well , I 'm driving there right now .
I just wanted the fastest way to get there .
I did n't want to get pulled over on the highway . "
The dispatcher had Kruse pull off the interstate and deputies arrested him for misuse of 911 .
You kind of have to see it to believe it .
If people could only get along so kindly , eh ?

Police charged James Richard “ Ricky ” Thompson , from the Austin area , with two counts of capital murder in the July 21 shooting deaths of Stacy Marie Barnett , 22 , and John Forest Goosey , 21 , a young Houston couple that had just earned degrees from UT .
Police said Sunday that it appears Goosey had been dealing marijuana for at least three years , and that Thompson owed him a substantial amount of money for drugs he had been given to sell .
“ Thompson felt like he was at the end of his ability and , sadly , he felt like this was the only avenue of escape he could utilize , ” said Lt. Mark Spangler , head of the violent crimes unit .
Goosey is the son of prominent Houston eye surgeon Dr. John D. Goosey .
His mother is Claire Goosey , a breast cancer survivor known for her volunteer work in the community , said attorney and longtime family friend Gary Tidwell .
The couple — whose parents live blocks from each other in West University — will be buried today in a joint funeral service at 10 a.m. at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church at 6802 Buffalo Speedway .
“ We are relieved that a suspect in the murders of our children has been taken into custody .
While we understand the public 's interest in this case , we are in the process of burying our children , so please respect our privacy , ” Tidwell said .
Friends and family said the mood was somber Sunday night when the couple were remembered at a private vigil and viewing at a Memorial - area funeral home .
“ They had a few friends come up and share their personal experiences with them , ” said Colleen Rejcek , a friend of the Goosey family , who called the shooting tragic and shocking .
Others said the standing - room - only service — which closed with the Beatles classic Here Comes the Sun — was beautiful .
While the couple grew up nearby and attended Lamar High School together , Barnett and Goosey did n't meet until they went to Austin .
They had been dating nearly three years .
Relatives have characterized Goosey as being spontaneous and gregarious .
He was an exemplary student with a great sense of humor , friends said .
Barnett , who planned to return to Houston to pursue a career in interior design , loved traveling , art , music and literature .
The couple shared a love of poetry , friends said .
Barnett , who lived with Goosey , appears to have become a victim solely by being home when Thompson arrived , police said .
There is no evidence that Barnett was involved in marijuana dealings or that she used marijuana , Spangler said .
Relatives became worried about the couple when they did n't show up in Houston for a family celebration as expected .
Friends discovered the bodies when they went to check on them .
Cell phones smashed
Thompson , whose parents live on Lake Travis near Austin , became acquainted with Goosey three years ago through drugs , police said .
Goosey appears to have been a mid-level player in a distribution system , police said .
According to Thompson 's arrest affidavit , the couple were killed with a . 22 - caliber handgun .
The affidavit states that an acquaintance of Thompson 's told police that Thompson said he shot Goosey and Barnett in the head , retrieved shell casings and then smashed their cell phones .
Thompson told his acquaintance that he smashed the phone so that investigators could not trace a call he'd made to Goosey earlier that day , according to the affidavit .
Police found records of the call , which was placed near the couple 's home and just before the killing , between 10 and 10:15 a.m. , according to police .
An anonymous tip confirmed to police that they were on the correct trail , Spangler said .
A search warrant was executed on Thompson 's residence Friday , and he was initially charged with marijuana possession , police said .
During interviews with police , Thompson admitted that Goosey had “ fronted ” him substantial amounts of marijuana to sell and that he did not have the money to repay him , Spangler said .
Goosey was “ pressing ” him to pay up , police said .
Police refused to give any additional details — other than that the victims were shot — about the killings .
They 're continuing to investigate the case , including looking at people who may have provided a gun and transportation to Thompson .

彼氏ができたら一緒に手を繋いで外を歩きたいと思うのは女性の夢です。
しかし不倫カップルにはその自由はありません。
不倫をしていることは二人以外に誰も知られてはならないのです。
誰にも知られてはいけない禁断の関係にスリルを感じるのは最初のうち、段々と辛く感じてきます。
この関係はいつまで続くのか、最終的に成就するのか、不安にになったら不倫占いをしてみましょう。
誰にもバレずに相談できる
不倫をする上で一番恐れているのは 「 バレる」ということです。
もしバレてしまえば相手もあなたも社会的に制裁を受けることになるでしょう。
不倫というのは決定的証拠がなくても、女性のカンにより発覚してしまうものです。
ちょっとした 「 ここだけの話 」 「友人の話なんだけど」が、いつかは自分の首を絞める危険性があります。
それでもこの辛い思いを何とかしたい、そんな時には不倫占いに限ります。
占い師はあなたとも相手とも全く面識がなく、顔を合わせる必要もありません。
ですからあなたが不倫をしているということは誰にもバレずに済むのです。
そして今の辛い悩みを解消することができるのですから、安心でしかも先が見える方法なのです。
相手の気持ちを推測できる
不倫占いで一番気になるのは 「 彼は離婚して私と結婚してくれるのか？」という点です。
直接彼に訊いても 「今は無理だけどきっとするから」と言うのみの場合、本当に信用して良いものでしょうか。
彼の気持ちがどうしてもはっきりしないけれども、それ以上詰め寄って嫌われたくない、そんな人は不倫占いで彼の気持ちを知りましょう。
彼のあなたに対する気持ちや本気度を知ることで、彼を信じて待つか、思い切って行動するか決められます。
不倫は相手の奥さんの問題もあるので自分一人では解決することは難しくなります。
しかし相手の気持ち次第であなたが有利になり、略奪愛を成就させられるかも知れません。
これから二人の関係がどの様に変化していくのか、不倫占いならばすぐに教えて貰えます。
相手の心を動かすタイミングや、円満に解決できる時期を占ってもらい、よりスムーズな解決を目指しましょう。
自然に気持ちを切り替えることができる
不倫の相談を友人にすると、温かく応援してくれる人よりも「一刻も早くやめなさい」と言う人の方が多いものです。
確かに社会的に許される行為ではないので仕方がないのですが、こちらとしても悩み抜いた末に相談しているのに非難されては余計に辛く感じますよね。
しかし分かっていても別れられないのが不倫であり、本人も十分傷ついているのです。
知っている仲では心配してくれる分口調もきつくなりますが、不倫占いならばただ「やめなさい」と言うだけではありません。
占いですから将来的に二人が成就する可能性はあるのか、どうすれば良いのかまで教えて貰えます。
また、二人の将来がうなくいかないという時にも「どの様な結末が訪れるのか」まで結果を出して貰えます。
頭ごなし に 「別れなさい」と怒られるのではなく、結果に基づいてアドバイスをしてくれますので、受け入れ易いのです。
急に分かれることは無理であっても、少しずつ自然に気持ちを切り替えていくことができるでしょう。
不倫占いではあなたの人格を否定する様なことを言われる心配はありません。
今のあなたの気持ちに寄り添い、これ以上精神的に追い詰められることなく解決できる様にアドバイスしてくれるのです。
不倫は大きなリスクを伴いますので、なるべく早く解決策を見つけることが大切です。
周囲を巻き込んだり修羅場になることを避けたいと思ったら、すぐにでも適切なアドバイスを受けましょう。
不倫占いで今のあなたの悩みを解決して、一日も早くスッキリとした気持ちで過ごせる様にして下さい。
不倫体験 談
憧れの上司が今では私の不倫相手
以前から職場でいいなと思っていた上司がいました。
仕事もできるし優しいし、人望もあるし、顔も…、私としてはすごく好みです(笑)
そんな上司と接していくうちに、いつしか上司に惹かれていきました。
私はどちらかと言うと、そういう想いを抱えたままでも平気なほうなのですが、今回の場合は違ったんですよね。
上司と部下という関係だけじゃ満足できない…という想いをずっと抱いていました。
でも、上司は既婚者です。
いくら私が上司のことを好きでも、不倫はやっぱりいけないことだからとずっと自分に言い聞かせていたんです。
ただしばらくすると、 「もしかして上司は私に気があるのかも」と思うような出来事が結構起きてくるようになったんです。
仕事中目が合うことが多くなったとか、ボディタッチが増えたとか、そういう程度ですけど。
ボディタッチは女性側が嫌だったらセクハラかもしれませんけど、私の場合はそれでドキドキしてしまっていました。
このままだったら上司と不倫関係になれるんじゃ？という良からぬ期待で、今度は胸が苦しくなっていきました。
でも、事が事なので、親しい友人にも相談できません。
そこでは私はメール占いを利用したんです。
電話占いも考えてみたんですが、私の場合は電話だと伝えたいことが伝えられなそうだったので、今回はメール占いを選びました。
メール占いはおろか、占い自体も初めての経験でしたが、以前からタロットに興味があったのでいい機会だと思いました。
メール占いには 「 あなたが叶えたいことはきっと叶います。」というような内容が書いてありました。
どうやら恋愛面での運気が好調らしく、今がチャンスとのことでした。
その結果を踏まえ、私は思い切って上司にアプローチしてみました。
上司と二人っきりになったときに、「私、上司が好きです。」と自分でもびっくりするくらいストレートに告白したんです。
幸いその告白が上手く行き、今ではその上司と不倫関係を築いています。
不倫という絶対にバレてはいけないことをしている身ですが、それでも上司とそういう関係になれたことは嬉しく思っています。
喜んでいいのかわかりませんが、上司は最近奥さんと上手く行っていないようです。
だから奥さんのことでたまに相談に乗ることもありますが、そんなとき上司は決まって「こんなことお前にする話じゃないよな、ごめん。」と言ってくれます。
私は別に構わないので、どんどん相談してほしいですね。
こんな風に上手く行ったのも、思い切ってメール占いを利用してみたおかげですね。

霊視占いで不倫が成就できたわたし
不倫や略奪愛に悩む女性は多くいますが、やはり内容的に批判されてしまうことが多いために誰にも相談できず、孤立してしまうケースもたくさんあります。
友人や同僚でもわかってくれない悩みをどうしたらいいのか。
ただ一点愛している彼と幸せになりたいだけなのに。
そんなあなたにそっと寄り添ってくれるのが、占いです。
どうしても直接会って占いを受けるのは心理的に辛いという方は、今では便利なメール占いや電話占いがあります。
不倫や禁断の恋愛に効果があるとされる占いのひとつに、霊視占いがあります。
なぜ強いのか ？
それはわたしたちの世界にあるすべてのものとの関係は、遠い過去の祖先や血縁者との縁とは切っても切れないからなのです。
その複雑に絡み合ってグチャグチャになってしまった関係を優しく解きほぐすように仕向ける占い。
あなたを守護してくれているひとを霊視してみつけるのが、霊視占いです。
また霊視占いの占い師は、
不倫で悩むあなたをさらに追い込むようなことはしません。
あなたがこれからどうすれば辛い恋を変えることができるのか、よく理解しているからです。
わたしが経験したのはネットでみつけたとある占いサイトでした。
不倫に悩む女性に…というタイトルに吸い寄せられて、まずメール占いを試してみたのです。
そこで受け取った占いの結果は意外な物でした。
「 彼とあなたは確かに強い運命の糸で結ばれている」
「 しかし、その糸の存在を彼はまだよく理解していない。つまりこれからの展開を強く牽引していくのは彼でも、彼の奥様でもなくあなたなのです」
衝撃を受けました 。
今まで彼との恋愛をそんな風に考えたことがありませんでしたから。
わたし自身がいつまでも動き出さないから、この不倫はこう着状態だったのです。
それを教えてくれたのが、霊視占いによって導き出されたわたしの祖先の方だったのです。
さらに深くアドバイスをもらうために電話占いで続きをききました。
それによると恋愛は世界のある法則にのっとって行われます。
もしその法則にのっとらない恋愛があるなら、それはうまくいきません。
わたしと彼との不倫関係はその法則を外れて始まってしまったために、うまくいかず苦しい気持ちにもなっていたのです。
この占い師さんは他にも不倫を成就させることに成功した案件を何件ももっていらっしゃいました。
不倫の恋からその法則を正して幸福へ導く霊視占い。
興味のある方はわたしのようにメール占いからスタートしてみるとよいでしょう。

The following are some files that I wrote in 1996 and which some people still look for , so they should find them now that I 'm back on the Net .

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Researchers have discovered a new sub-species of monkey in a remote part of the Amazon rain forest , a U.S. - based wildlife conservation group said on Tuesday .
The newly found monkey was first spotted by scientists in 2007 in the Brazilian state of Amazonas and is related to the saddleback tamarin monkeys , known for their distinctively marked backs , the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) said .
The small monkey , which is mostly gray and brown and weighs 213 grams ( 0.47 pound ) , has been named the Mura ’s saddleback tamarin after the Mura Indian tribe of the Purus and Madeira river basins where the new sub-species was found .
It is 240 millimeters ( 9.4 inches ) tall with a 320 millimeter ( 12.6 inch ) tail .
“ This newly described monkey shows that even today there are major wildlife discoveries to be made , ” Fabio Rohe , the lead author of a study confirming the new discovery , said in a statement released by the WCS .
The study found that the monkey is threatened by development projects in the region , including a major highway through the forest that is being paved and which could fuel deforestation .
“ This discovery should serve as a wake - up call that there is still so much to learn from the world ’s wild places , yet humans continue to threaten these areas with destruction , ” Rohe said .

BBC Panorama , Tehran
Sixteen years after visiting Iran to report for BBC's Panorama , and just as President Barack Obama makes overtures to the Islamic world , Jane Corbin returned on the eve of presidential elections .
Rapper ' Nobody ' tackles God and nationalism in his music
She found a country with a burgeoning underground music scene , a love of cosmetic surgery and an internet savvy young electorate eager to make their own mark 30 years on from the Islamic Revolution .
After so many years , the Tehran I discovered was a capital of contrasts , reflecting a true - and deepening - divide in this nation of 72 million people .
People here told me that while they remain committed to the values of the Islamic Revolution , they are hungry for all that modern life has to offer .
On the streets , many push the limits of Islamic dress code , despite the lurking presence of the morality police , at the ready to arrest those deemed to have gone too far .
At the moment , that fashion is for brightly coloured silk headscarves and big sunglasses .
Instead of conservative black head coverings and flowing robes , many women today are sporting a shock of dyed blonde hair pushed out provocatively from under their headscarves .
The trends extend to the popularity of plastic surgery , with surprising numbers of people - both women and men - walking the streets with post - surgical bandages on their faces .
View Panorama's Iran archive Tehran , it turns out , is the plastic surgery capital of the Middle East .
Perhaps even more surprising in a country where homosexuality is banned and gay people can be hanged , sex change operations are sanctioned by religious decree .
It is with this younger , more liberal Iran that Britain , America and Europe hope to connect .
This nation is one of young people - 60 % of the population are under 30 - a reality that worries religious and political authorities .
Controlling this post - revolution generation is not easy .
Tight lid
The conservative government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tries hard to keep a tight lid on the country .
Indeed , it is one of the hardest places to film and to find people willing to open up and tell you what they really think - especially when it comes to politics .
Repression remains and while there is some freedom of expression , saying the wrong thing can - and does - land Iranians in jail .
But thanks to the youthful make - up of today , there is also a thriving underground scene of musicians , artists and bloggers .
These are the people who are changing Iranian society in ways which are beyond the reach of those who control the political arena .
Some of us have to be pioneers and later the rest of the people will join us to shape change .
We have no other option we 're going through a time of transition and I really hope it will bear fruit soon
Asieh , underground women 's rights blogger
In a basement flat , where I was carefully regarded through a spyhole before being allowed in , a powerful wave of sound hit me immediately .
It is produced by one young man fighting back against censorship .
He is a rapper called ' Nobody ' and his music , although American in origin , is very much Iranian in content .
' Nobody ' raps about God and nationalism along with social commentary .
He has even written a rap in defense of Iran 's right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
' Western , decadent '
The authorities regard ' Nobody 's ' music as western and decadent and he is banned from performing and forbidden to travel .
Yet his music and his messages are performed at night on rooftops in the city and downloaded by young Iranians in defiance of the ban .
" The Islamic Revolution was a big thing and it was good , " ' Nobody ' explained .
" But it was the older generation who made it and our generation has to build everything from within - rather than going backwards we must try and go forwards . "
Asieh 's internet savvy generation easily circumvent blocked sites Information is spread here in ways which are difficult for the Islamic authorities to stop .
Television is state - controlled but at least a third of Iranians have satellite dishes , offering glimpses of the world beyond its borders .
The government is nervous about the BBC 's popular new Persian Service , beamed in from outside .
Thanks to home computers , rather than the internet cafes of a decade ago , monitoring of the internet is largely beyond the reach of the authorities .
The government still tries .
It recently blocked Facebook for a couple of days because the opposition was using it to campaign successfully among young supporters in the upcoming presidential election .
Asieh , a smiling young mother in a bright orange scarf , ushered us quickly and discreetly into her flat .
A campaigner for women 's rights Asieh uses her blog to expose and publicise cases of stoning and execution .
She showed me grim pictures - graves she had discovered and pictures of a girl in red curled up lifeless on a floor .
Officially , such executions are no longer approved by the government , but some judges still pass death sentences for adultery .
Internet savvy
When Asieh attempted to show me her website it was blocked by the authorities - a normal occurrence .
But , just like her computer savvy Iranian audience , she is a step ahead .
She uses filter busters to easily reach her latest posting .
" Some of us have to be pioneers and later the rest of the people will join us to shape change , " said Asieh .
" We have no other option we 're going through a time of transition and I really hope it will bear fruit soon . "
Many young Iranians say they are not interested in politics and that their society will change regardless of their leaders , even if it is a slow process .
But the reformist candidates in Friday 's elections - Mir Hossein Mousavi is seen as the biggest threat to Mr Ahmadinejad -- hope that young people who have never bothered to vote before will embrace their message of change and attempts to secure better relations with the West and turn out at polling stations in large numbers .

Bush Personally Ordered Visit to Ashcroft ’s Hospital Bed
Created : July 10 , 2009 17:43 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
One warrantless surveillance mystery solved .
My friend Marcy
Wheeler beat me to this : George W. Bush personally ordered White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andy Card to visit an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft in the hospital in March 2004 after Ashcroft ’s deputy Jim Comey refused to certify the warrantless surveillance program .
Just look at this profile in courage :
According to notes from Ashcroft ’s FBI security detail , at 6:20 p.m. that evening Card called the hospital and spoke with an agent in Ashcroft ’s security detail , advising him that President Bush would be calling shortly to speak with Ashcroft .
Ashcroft ’s wife told the agent that Ashcroft would not accept the call .
Ten minutes later , the agent called Ashcroft ’s Chief of Staff David Ayers at DOJ to request that Ayers speak with Card about the President ’s intention to call Ashcroft .
The agent conveyed to Ayers Mrs. Ashcroft ’s desire that no calls be made to Ashcroft for another day or two .
However , at 6:45 p.m. , Card and the President called the hospital and , according to the agent ’s notes , “ insisted on speaking [ with Attorney General Ashcroft ] . ”
According to the agent ’s notes , Mrs. Ashcroft took the call from Card and the President and was informed that Gonzales and Card were coming to the hospital to see Ashcroft regarding a matter involving national security .
Jack Goldsmith remembers that after a seriously - ill Ashcroft told Gonzales and Card to follow Comey ’s legal advice , Goldsmith seriously thought Ashcroft might actually die right then and there .
Ashcroft earns himself a place in the patriot ’s pantheon just for that .
I truly ca n’t wait to see how Bush ’s presidential library treats this incident .

Dear Colleagues :
In a recent interview , Peter Singer makes a number of statements that , in my view , indicate just how sharp the difference is between the new welfarist or protectionist approach and the abolitionist approach .
First , he states :
I ’m very pleased to say that there have been a lot of changes , especially in Europe , but also some in the US and other countries .
In Europe , all the worst and most abusive forms of factory farming are being modified .
I disagree with Singer ’s claim in several respects .
It is not accurate to say that there have been a “ a lot of changes ” and that “ all the worst and most abusive forms of factory farming are being modified . ”
As I pointed out in at least two other essays ( 1,2 ) on this site , and in my 2008 book , Animals as Persons : Essays on the Abolition of Animal Exploitation , the supposed welfare improvements in Europe about which Peter is so excited are worse than useless in that they provide little if any increased protection for animal interests and they make humans feel more comfortable about consuming animals , which facilitates continued consumption .
Second , on veganism , he states :
The vegan diet , especially buying organically produced plant foods , does solve more of the ethical problems about eating than any other .
But I admit that it is not for everyone , and it will take a long time before it becomes widespread .
So I do n’t want to give the impression that it is the only thing one can do to eat ethically .
Just avoiding factory farmed products is a big step in the right direction , even if you continue to eat a moderate quantity of organically produced , pasture raised , animal products .
Once again ( see , e.g. , 1,2 ) , Singer repeats the notion that being a “ conscientious omnivore ” is a “ defensible ethical position . ”
If the so - called “ father of the animal rights movement ” ( supported by almost all of the large new welfarist groups ) claims that it is a morally good thing to consume “ happy ” meat and animal products , that is likely to become the moral baseline .
And that is precisely what has happened .
Veganism is viewed as “ extreme ” precisely because of comments like this ; “ happy ” meat is considered the “ ethical ” choice .
To see the speciesism here , substitute some form of human exploitation .
If someone said that a “ moderate ” amount of “ humane ” rape was a “ big step in the right direction , ” we would be outraged .
But Singer tells us that eating a “ moderate quantity ” of “ happy ” meat and animal products is a morally good thing .
It may be good in the same way that beating your slaves 5 times a week is better than beating them 10 times a week , but it ignores the fundamental moral question at stake .
Asked about whether it is possible to be ethical without becoming “ fanatics , ” he states :
It is absolutely possible !
The thing to remember is that the world is imperfect , and we want to make it better , so any changes in the right direction help , and the more we do , the better it is .
But this is not a religion , it is not a question of personal purity , so we do not have to worry about our own moral perfection .
We just have to do our best to minimize the adverse impact we are having on animals , the environment , and workers .
And then , enjoy our food !
Once again , Singer equates the abolitionist approach , which has veganism and nonviolent vegan education as its moral baseline , as “ purist ” or “ fanatical ” because abolitionists maintain that we cannot justify any animal use .
Does Singer regard as purist an absolutist position on issues such as rape or pedophilia ?
That is , is the position that we cannot justify any rape or pedophilia , irrespective of the circumstances , purist or fanatical ?
If not , and if he regards it permissible or even obligatory to take an absolutist position on those issues , is he not merely begging the question about the abolitionist approach as applied to nonhumans and assuming that animal exploitation is less morally problematic than human exploitation ?
I suppose that he is making that assumption , which is not surprising given that he regards nonhumans as having less moral value than humans .
In any event , it is very disappointing that Singer is telling people to go and enjoy their happy meat .
But then , despite the notion that “ animal people ” are one monolithic group , there are very distinct differences between the abolitionist approach and the new welfarist approach .
Singer ’s interview illustrates just a few .

Along the way , venues , set lists , clothing and instruments will replicate the band 's rise to fame , represented in The Beatles ' touring period from 1963 to1966 and their studio days from 1966 to 1969 .
The gameplay with place you at the band 's earliest days at The Cavern Club in Liverpool , England .
Gamers will then travel across the Atlantic to experience the band 's unforgettable 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show , the sold - out concert at the , now demolished , New York 's Shea Stadium in 1965 , and conclude at The Beatles ' memorable concert at Budokan in Tokyo , Japan in 1966 .
If you ’re a Star Trek fan , you ’ve surely considered the differences between the captains in the various series , even if you do n’t have a favorite .
And , while Sisko , Janeway , and even Archer have their fans , the quintessential Star Trek debate has been , since TNG premiered nearly 22 years ago , who ’s the better captain : Kirk or Picard ?
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
I wrote earlier this month about ten ways , and then ten more ways , to provoke a geek argument , and lots of people mentioned the Kirk vs. Picard conflict in the comments .
The only reason I chose not to list it is that you never can tell which way any given geek is going to swing on this topic , unless they happen to be wearing a t - shirt that reveals their preference .
You could say “ Jim Kirk is nothing more than an arrogant , womanizing jerk , ” and they might agree with you !
Or you might say “ Jean - Luc Picard is a Frenchman with a British accent — how ridiculous is that ? ! ” and they might raise their fists and shout “ Yeah ! ”
So , who ’s really better ?
There have been countless articles and lists written on the subject , so I ’m not sure how much new territory there is to cover here .
What I will try to do , then , is distill the argument down to five key subject areas , then compare and contrast Kirk and Picard ( I ’m only considering the original , William Shatner , Kirk here , incidentally , because otherwise this gets way too complicated ) :
1. Leadership Style – Kirk is brash ; Picard is contemplative .
Kirk takes bold actions that frequently result in him getting captured ;
Picard takes sometimes bold , sometimes subtle actions that occasionally result in members of his command staff getting captured .
Kirk listens to Spock ’s advice , but nobody else ’s ; Picard listens to lots of people — though only occasionally his barber .
While Picard could sometimes use some of Kirk ’s boldness , it seems to me that his style is , if I were staffing a starship , more like what I would want than Kirk’s .
Advantage : Picard .
2. Difficulty of Success – I mean this from a character point of view : Captain Kirk only had to deal with being compared with Dr. Robinson from Lost in Space and captains from old sci- fi movies ; Captain Picard had to handle being compared with Kirk .
On the other hand , Picard would never have existed if it had n’t been for Kirk ’s ( eventual ) success as a character .
Advantage : Kirk .
3. Acting – William Shatner is a lot of fun as an actor , but nobody can deny he ’s a ham ; Patrick Stewart is an experienced Shakespearean actor who manages not to pause after every third word he utters .
Yeah , I know it ’s kind of obvious , but really , the only line of Picard ’s that ’s regularly parodied is “ There are four lights ! ” whereas Kirk ’s very style of speech is so often parodied it ’s become cliché .
Advantage : Picard .
4. Number of Lives Saved – I ’m sure somebody , somewhere , has taken the time to calculate the rough number of lives each captain has saved , but if so I do n’t know the figures they arrived at .
Since they each saved whole worlds on a fairly regular basis , though , I ’m going to go by the amount of time they ’ve spent on screen : Kirk was in 79 TV episodes and six - plus movies ; Picard was in 176 TV episodes ( two of which were double - length ) and four movies .
Even if you count the Animated Series , Picard is way ahead here .
Advantage : Picard .
5. Story Quality –
This may not seem like a fair comparison , because it ’s a cinch that the number of talented writers wanting to work on TNG was much higher than the number who wanted to work on TOS .
But it goes to watchability , and , while there are plenty of lousy TNG episodes , none are as unwatchably bad as “ The Way to Eden ” or “ Spock ’s Brain . ”
And while TNG certainly had some pretty unsubtle messages in many of its episodes , none were as hit - you - over - the - head obvious as “ Let That Be Your Last Battlefield ” or “ A Taste of Armageddon . ”
Advantage : Picard .
So , yes , I ’m going to have to go with Picard .
I love Captain Kirk , do n’t get me wrong , and I ’m sure a less interesting character would never have engendered the kind of devotion Trekkies have had for over forty years .
But there ’s a reason why , when TNG was being created , they wrote the character of Riker to be a lot like Kirk and made him the First Officer instead of the Captain .
Now , I ’m sure you have your opinions on the subject , so please respond to the poll below , and leave a comment if you feel the need to express yourself further .
And please come back next week for the next Great Geek Debate !

Consumers , financial institutions , and most importantly regulators did not understand the risks being taken in the financial markets .
That was one of the main causes of the current financial crisis according to the Government white paper , Reforming the financial markets , released last week .
It is clear to all players in the financial market that they need to make more accurate assessments of the risks they and others are taking .
But will they be able to take the more scientific approach needed for a deeper understanding of financial risks , when they were so easily bewitched by unproven claims that you can turn financial lead into gold ?
Rather than being seen as helping the market understand risk , mathematics has been identified as part of the problem , with Lord Turner 's review of financial regulation blaming a " misplaced reliance on sophisticated mathematics " .
Is this justified ?
Chris Rogers from the University of Cambridge , sums up the view of many academics working in financial maths : " the problem is not that mathematics was used by the banking industry , the problem was that it was abused by the banking industry " .
However , mathematicians have been part of the industry , and so must have been part of the problem .
But how much responsibility do they bear ?
To understand the role of maths in the credit crunch you need to have an idea of what was going on .
The root of the current crisis goes back to recovery from the Great Depression .
The US Government wanted to encourage private home ownership and created a system where mortgages were fixed - rate , long - term contracts with no early redemption penalties on the borrower .
This led to the lenders carrying a risk ; if the interest rates went up , they lost out , while if the interest rates went down , the borrowers would cancel their existing agreements and take out new loans at the lower rate , and the lenders lost out .
The solution , developed in the 1970s , was for the lenders to sell the loans on for a fixed price ( removing the uncertainty ) to investment banks , who repackaged them as mortgage backed securities and , in turn , sold them on to investors .
Essentially the investment banks were acting as scrap metal dealers , collecting scrap and separating out the high , medium and low value material .
The idea was that pension funds would pay a good price for the high value stuff and speculative investors would pay a low price for the risky assets .
This business model appeared to be so successful , transferring risks around the markets , that mortgage backed securities evolved into securites backed by any asset .
These Asset Backed Securities ( or ABS ) , such as the now infamous Collatorallised Debt Obligations , could be based on almost any cashflow including credit card payments , personal loans , and even royalty payments .
The problem for the investment banks was the fundamental problem in finance : how do you price these assets ?
A market only really works where there are many sellers and buyers trading in identical assets , but each ABS is unique , and so they did not really have a market price .
To get around this problem , the banks resorted to mathematics and priced the ABSs using models .
Pricing an ABS is an interesting problem .
We have a collection of thousands of loans , each generating a different cashflow and each can default , randomly .
As a first guess , a mathematician might identify the key issues as the probability of default of an individual loan , the correlation of defaults between loans , and , how homogeneous the collection of loans was .
Given half a chance most scientists involved with ABSs would have gone on to develop sophisticated models to price the products .
This is not what happened .
Generally , the pricing models were characterised by specifying a single , constant , default probability for all loans and a single correlation between default probabilities .
The banks were under - pricing the risk , but why did they do this ?
A well respected academic , in a submission to the Science Minister , Lord Drayson , explained that , for complex financial products , " investors will not buy a product if they are uncertain of the risks involved " .
Therefore , although banks have an incentive to provide such information to buyers , it is also in the banks interest to show a pricing model that makes their product appealing .
" Telling investors that there are other models that could be used and they all give different answers is bad news for sellers since they do not remove the uncertainty in the minds of investors .
Therefore , there was an incentive for the banks to suppress anything beyond one apparently ' good ' model . "
Like one of Sir Alan 's naive apprentices , the banks pursued turnover because their models told them the business was highly profitable .
As Rogers remarks : " [ they built ] models which fitted the market prices .
Now if the market prices were way out of line , the calibrated models would just faithfully reproduce those whacky values and the bad prices get reinforced by an overlay of scientific respectability !
The standard models , which were used for a long time before being rightfully discredited by academics and the more thoughtful practitioners , were , from the start , a complete fudge ; so you had garbage prices being underpinned by garbage modelling . "
Rogers then explains how competition between institutions pushed prices down further .
Consequently , the institutions did not have enough reserves to cover their liabilities .
The first consequence of this was the liquidity crisis in 2007 that led to the failure of Northern Rock , but fundamentally , the banks were insolvent , their liabilities exceeded their assets , and the government had to nationalise them .
Developing a sophisticated model was not going to deliver a clear - cut price .
The banks were not so interested in understanding the nature of the products they were developing , but rather they wanted to present the image of precision and accuracy that simple models gave them .
It was a fundamentally unscientific approach .
Should the mathematicians , physicists and engineers working in the banks have intervened ?
This is easier said than done , not least because they would have to bridge the gap in understanding between what Lord Turner would describe as " sophisticated maths " and the mathematics of the quickest profit .
This aversion to adopting a scientific approach permeates the industry in the UK ; the Treasury is the only UK Department of State that does not have a Senior Scientific Advisor .
This approach is not sustainable .
If the UK financial services industry does not innovate , it will die .
To be successful , innovation has to be based on a scientific approach , not on a belief in bankers as alchemists , who have a magical ability to transform base metals into gold .

1949 : Sixty years ago today , Nineteen Eighty - Four is published .
It 's official :
In the face of the monolithic state , the little guy has no chance at all .
George Orwell 's dystopian novel , one to stand alongside Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World as a towering work of futuristic pessimism , posits a grim society where the government is all powerful and all knowing and the individual spirit has been effectively extinguished .
Big Brother , a seemingly benevolent but terribly vengeful ruler who may or may not exist , is the personification of the state .
To keep the masses docile and pliant , books are banned , surveillance is everywhere and all information is closely guarded by the state .
( Huxley envisioned a different future , one which perhaps more closely mirrors our present :
In Brave New World , there is no reason to ban a book , since people are too busy pursuing their hedonistic distractions to bother picking one up . )
Nineteen Eighty - Four is told through the eyes of Winston Smith , a minor civil servant in the Ministry of Truth whose job it is to rewrite history for the totalitarian state of Oceania .
His spirit has n't been entirely quashed , though , and he chafes under the yoke , eventually joining a rebellion against the state .
He is soon betrayed , arrested and tortured .
In the end , Smith wins his freedom by accepting the assertion that 2 + 2 = 5 .
The book yielded a bounty of new coinages : " Thought Police " , " doublethink , " the aforementioned " Big Brother " and the especially sinister " Newspeak " all entered the language through Nineteen Eighty - Four .
Even the author 's pseudonym ( his real name being Eric Arthur Blair ) became a chilling adjective : " Orwellian " is applied to any characteristic display of totalitarian might .
* Nineteen Eighty - Four * is often described , mainly by conservatives , as an attack against socialism .
Orwell , who called himself a socialist although contemporary scholarship suggests his political philosophy was ambiguous and fluid , disputed this .
He made it clear on at least one occasion that his novel was aimed squarely at totalitarianism , which he considered a perversion of socialism .
His 1944 novel , Animal Farm , was a pointed attack against the Soviet system , which Orwell believed had betrayed socialism 's true spirit .
In any case , Orwell did n't live to see the long - range social impact of his work .
He had been in poor health for years and died in January 1950 , only 46 .

A colleague of the former BART police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man early New Year 's Day testified Wednesday that the victim would still be alive if he and his friends had cooperated with police .
" If they would have followed orders , this would n't have happened , " said Officer Marysol Domenici at a preliminary hearing in Oakland for former Officer Johannes Mehserle , who is charged with murder .
Domenici and Mehserle were among seven BART officers who responded to Oakland 's Fruitvale Station at about 2 a.m. in response to reports of a fight aboard a Dublin - Pleasanton train .
Five young men , including 22 - year - old Oscar Grant of Hayward , were detained .
Domenici and other BART officers testifying for the defense have described Grant and the others as belligerent .
Domenici said Wednesday that if the men had followed police instructions and cooperated , " they probably would have just been cited ( arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor ) and released . "
Attorneys for Mehserle , 27 , say he meant to fire his Taser stun gun rather than his pistol as he and another officer were trying to handcuff Grant for allegedly resisting arrest .
Grant was killed by a single shot to the back .
Domenici , who has been on the BART force for four years , was called by defense attorneys to talk about what she described as a chaotic situation on the train platform .
She said she had no regrets about her actions that night .
Domenici said she did not see Mehserle shoot Grant because she had been facing the other direction .
Immediately after the shot was fired , she said , some train riders were so angry that she started thinking about using her gun .
" I said to myself , ' Oh , Jesus Christ , if I have to , I 'm going to have to kill somebody , ' " Domenici said .
But she also said she did not push an emergency button on her police radio that would have allowed her to call for backup .
Prosecutor David Stein conducted a long and sometimes aggressive cross-examination , and he suggested that Domenici was exaggerating the danger she had faced from Grant and others .
Stein and Domenici clashed sharply at times .
When Stein asked her how long she remained on the platform after the shooting , she refused to estimate .
She agreed with Stein that it was " less than 24 hours . "
Asked by Stein whether she was saying the shooting was Grant 's fault , Domenici did not answer directly .
Instead , she repeated statements she made earlier - that Grant refused at times to sit down against a station wall and forced her , at one point , to push him into the wall .
Domenici said the push was captured on one of several pieces of video that BART passengers recorded .
Stein appeared stunned and questioned whether such footage existed .
" You never pushed Oscar Grant up against the wall , did you ? "
Stein asked .
" Yes , I did , " Domenici responded .
Outside court , Grant 's mother , Wanda Johnson , said she was disturbed by Domenici 's testimony - particularly her assertion that she would not have done anything differently during the incident .
" She had no regard for human life , for my son 's life , " Johnson said .
As the fifth day of the preliminary hearing ended , Officer Tony Pirone was beginning his turn on the witness stand .
Pirone - the officer who first detained Grant , made the decision to arrest him and helped Mehserle try to handcuff him - is scheduled to continue testifying June 3 after a week - long break .
Pirone , Domenici and the other officers who were on the train platform at the time of the shooting are on paid administrative leave while a private law firm conducts an internal affairs investigation for BART police .
After the hearing , Judge C. Don Clay of Alameda County Superior Court must decide whether to send Mehserle to trial for murder .
US Energy Secretary Steven Chu answers questions during the Reuters Energy Summit in Washington , June 1 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Even though he is 15th in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency , Energy Secretary Steven Chu still thinks he ’s a nerd .
And some in Washington would n’t argue with his assessment .
While many of President Barack Obama ’s cabinet secretaries zoom around the nation ’s capital in black sedans , Chu will occasionally pull into Energy Department headquarters on his bike , with his security detail pedaling close behind .
In his commencement address at Harvard University on Thursday , the Nobel Prize - winning scientist admitted he may not be as exciting as previous speakers like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and “ Harry Potter ” author J.K. Rowling .
“ Today , you have me .
I am not a billionaire , but at least I am a nerd , ” Chu said at the beginning of his speech .
Chu went on to talk about the threat of climate change and ended his talk with a line that could have been conjured up by an obsessed adult “ Star Trek ” fan .
“ May you prosper and help save our planet , ” Chu said .
While not the exact words so often spoken by Mr. Spock , it was close enough .
About six months after Israel 's attorney general publicly announced an effort to criminalise dissent , state authorities have upped the ante in their " war " – as the daily Ha'aretz called it last September – against Israel 's youth and against the broad , grassroots protest movement of young Israelis who avoid serving their compulsory time in the military – slandered by officials as " draft shirkers " .
On 26 April , a day before Israel 's Memorial Day , Israeli police produced an absurd piece of political theatre – as Dimi Reider first reported here last Thursday .
As if facing down dangerous organised criminals , they raided the homes of six activists in different parts of Israel , who were then detained for interrogation .
Exploiting the emotions roused on a day of mourning for military dead , the police action singled out and branded anti-military activists as outside the legitimate Israeli community .
At the time of writing , police have summoned 10 additional activists for interrogation .
The activists targeted are members of New Profile , a feminist movement working for over a decade to reverse the militarisation of state and society in Israel .
I have been a member since its inception .
New Profile intends to uphold the right to open discourse on the crucial issues young people face and we work to change the militarised thinking holding us , all the residents of Israel and Palestine , hostage .
Our activism may enrage some , but our activities are totally legal .
The reality is that rising numbers of young Jewish Israelis – as well as the Druze minority who are also subject to conscription – find themselves unwilling to accept the Israeli dictate " There 's no other choice " .
Four generations and over six decades of failed " military solutions " have engendered a broad social movement of young people who have severe internal struggles when asked to serve in the military .
Israeli law offers virtually no legal provision for conscientious objectors and Israel 's courts – both military and civil – class the reason for refusing service as " political " , " psychological " and only very rarely " conscientious " .
The soul - searching brought on by deciding to serve has caused many young people real distress .
In recent years , Israeli soldiers ' suicides have accounted for more deaths than all the other types of military casualties combined .
According to Ha'aretz , the criminal investigation of New Profile is motivated by " growing concern at the defence establishment of a growing trend of draft evasion " .
It is not New Profile that is worrying them , we are just an easy scapegoat through which they hope to sow fear and intimidate future draft dodgers .
The state has thus declared a war against the many thousands who resist the draft and refuse to place their bodies , their minds , and their morality at the disposal of visionless politicians .
For years now , the army has regularly been exempting tens of thousands from service without difficulty .
In fact , several years ago the military and the ( very same ) defence minister declared a downsizing programme , towards creating " a small , smart army " .
Their worry today is rather the popular vote of no -confidence in their easy use of the lives of soldiers – an anger no longer limited to alienated , impoverished parts of society but spreading deep into the middle class as well .
The growing legitimisation of the draft resisters in the Israeli mainstream is also evidence of the weakening of the hold fear has on our society .
Those in power , both the right and the so - called " left " , are struggling to keep in place this longstanding means of obscuring political corruption and of feeding the notion of " national unity " in the form of " the people 's army " .
Tragically , this war on New Profile is part of a broader programme of state repression of political dissent .
Palestinian citizens of Israel were detained by the hundreds for protesting at Israel 's attack against Gaza last January .
Many remain in detention still , without charges , trial or due process .
Activists taking part in non-violent protests against the land - gobbling dragon of Israel 's separation wall are regularly attacked with lethal fire .
Just weeks ago Bassem Ibrahim Abu Rahma was killed by soldiers in Bil'in .
Dozens of activists , both Palestinians and Jews , are detained at demonstrations and incarcerated for varying periods .
In most cases , the repressive measures applied to Jewish activists still bear no comparison , in terms of their arbitrariness and brutality , to the means employed against Palestinians .
However , the political theatre of repression being played out against New Profile is of great importance .
Every act of repression is important and should be resisted , and when it is applied to a group of relatively privileged , middle - class , and largely middle - aged feminists , such repression may be more visible to mainstream Israeli society .
This will more easily expose the state 's fabric of lies and ludicrous , trumped - up charges , and allow decent but uninformed people a concrete grasp of the reality of the situation .
In the balance yet again lies the future of freedom and rights for everyone in Israel and the Palestinian territories , because what is at stake are the lives of Israeli youth against whom the state is waging this war .
What we are struggling for is the future of a democratic , civil society .

Most people will tell you that Windows 7 is snappier than Vista , even though the raw numbers say otherwise .
But it 's not in your head .
Windows 7 is more responsive than Vista .
Here 's why .

I meant to post this a few days ago , but it fits in really nicely with our benchmark testing to explain what 's going on under Windows 7's hood .
Microsoft obviously focused a lot on the user experience in Windows 7 , so a lot of work went into improving desktop responsiveness — smoothing out the little snags or hangs up that made people feel like Vista was too slow .
Which is apparently a hard thing to do , since a million different things can cause slowdown .
But the most frequent cause of hangups is a bottleneck caused by one graphics device interface application — an app that taps your graphics card — waiting on another GDI app that 's being all slow and crappy .
In Vista , this could happen because the way the GDI was designed , a single app could hold a system - wide global lock , so apps running simultaneously constantly jockey for the lock in order to render on the screen , and if one asshole app does n't let go , it screws every other app waiting in line .
So Microsoft re-designed the way this stuff is orchestrated , so multiple apps can " reliably " render at the same time , meaning less bottlenecks .
Besides improving reliability , the redesign actually improved performance with multiple GDI apps running simultaneously on multi-core processors , so you 'll see real benefits from going multi-core , which no doubt makes Intel 's Craig Barrett happy .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Oh yes , they also reduced the memory footprint , but anybody running Windows 7 already noticed this .
So yes , Windows 7 really is more responsive , even if run -of - the - mill benchmarks can't exactly measure how that is .

It 's a blockbuster admission that we already knew :
The health care insurance industry was petrified that Americans would see Michael Moore 's Sicko and realize that government - run health care was something that would be good for citizens and lead to better health outcomes .
CIGNA Public Relations
Chief turned whistleblower Wendell Potter said the words to Bill Moyers that no insurance company wanted said out loud in this country :
BILL MOYERS : You were also involved in the campaign by the industry to discredit Michael Moore and his film " Sicko " in 2007 .
In that film Moore went to several countries around the world , and reported that their health care system was better than our health care system , in particular , Canada and England . [..]
So what did you think when you saw that film ?
WENDELL POTTER : I thought that he hit the nail on the head with his movie .
But the industry , from the moment that the industry learned that Michael Moore was taking on the health care industry , it was really concerned .
BILL MOYERS : What were they afraid of ?
WENDELL POTTER :
They were afraid that people would believe Michael Moore .
Of course , we knew this .
We 've been screaming it for years .
Still , it 's difficult to pierce through that Beltway bubble to those politicos that are still hemming and hawing as the insurance industry insiders fill their campaign coffers .
The full episode ( which I cannot recommend highly enough ) is available on PBS.com .
More from Moyers :
I 've always had a soft spot for the Rinoas out there , and this one is especially good .
Not only does she look the part , she 's got that great replica of the pinwheel strapped to her wrist !

Last month , EFF got an email from software developer Duane Fields of Exact Magic , asking if he could use our logo on an iPhone application that exclusively displays content from EFF 's RSS feed .
Sounded like a great idea to us , as long as it was clear that the app was n't an EFF - sponsored product .
But this morning Apple rejected the app .
Why ?
Because it claims EFF 's content runs afoul of the iTune 's App Store 's policy against " objectionable " content .
Apparently , Apple objects to a blog post that linked to a " Downfall " parody video created by EFF Board Chairman Brad Templeton .
The parody casts Hitler in the role of entertainment industry executive , ranting about the failure of DRM and the continued popularity of fair use .
The parody includes the fleeting appearance of the f-bomb in a subtitle .
Now , Apple may find EFF " objectionable " for any number of reasons ( here 's just one . )
But surely linking to a video that includes a " bad word " can't be one of them .
After all , the YouTube app that Apple includes on every iPhone that ships will let you watch exactly the same video , bad word and all .
And you can use the Safari web browser that ships with every iPhone to access EFF 's website , as well as millions of web sites that include much more extreme language .
This is just the latest example of the failings of Apple 's iTunes App Store approval process , which has been revealed to be not just anti-competitive , discriminatory , censorial , and arbitrary , but downright absurd .
Just last month , Apple was widely criticized when it rejected the Eucalyptus e-book reader because it could access the public domain translation of the Kama Sutra ( Apple quickly reversed course on that one ) .
Let 's be clear : we are not saying that Apple has to carry apps it does n't like in its App Store .
But iPhone owners who do n't want Apple playing the role of language police for their software should have the freedom to go elsewhere .
This is precisely why EFF has asked the Copyright Office to grant an exemption to the DMCA for jailbreaking iPhones .
It 's none of Apple 's business if I want an app on my phone that lets me read EFF 's RSS feed , use Sling Player over 3G , or read the Kama Sutra .
UPDATE : Apparently , Apple has changed its mind and has now approved the EFF Updates app .
This despite the fact that the very same material is still linked in various EFF posts ( including this one ! ) .
Just one more example of the arbitrary nature of Apple 's app approval process .
If only the other manufacturers of diesel - powered vehicles had their act together as well as Audi , we ’d be in a better situation here in the United States .
Diesel is cleaner , diesel is cheaper .
We ’d be saving money as families and as a nation .
We ’d lower our dependency on foreign oil – because there ’s hardly anything easier and cheaper to produce than biodiesel .
Yet , new biodiesel refineries are closing because of underutilization .
If you know anyone with a diesel - powered vehicle – who has tried biodiesel – they ’ll tell you their critter ran better and cleaner with the veggie product than the stuff refined from petroleum .
Yet , almost every manufacturer who sells a diesel - powered car or small truck somewhere else in the world – is afraid to market it in the United States .
Something else we can thank General Motors for – the crap diesel cars they sold decades ago ruined the market for the fearful .
Of course , like Toyota did with the hybrid , manufacturers like Audi [ and Volkswagen ] have the smarts and cojones to get the jump on everyone else and establish themselves as the source for clean , powerful , economical diesel - power ahead of all the others who could be doing the same .

With 663,000 more jobs disappearing from the American economy last month , swelling the total number of jobs surrendered to the recession beyond five million , the government ’s response to the downturn is being put to a strenuous test .
When drafting plans in January to spend roughly $ 800 billion to stimulate the deteriorating economy , the Obama administration operated on the assumption that the unemployment rate would reach 8.9 percent by the end of the year — without the extra federal spending .
Three months into the year , the unemployment rate has already soared to 8.5 percent , from 7.6 percent , the highest level in more than a quarter - century .
Between January and March , more than two million jobs were lost , according to the Labor Department ’s employment report , released Friday .
The severity and breadth of the job losses in March — which afflicted nearly every industry outside of health care — prompted economists to conclude that an agonizing plunge in employment prospects was still unfolding .

It 's not much of an existence , but I like to think he makes the most of it .
" There is no record of the incident in the system so it seems the gentleman was just spoken to by the officer and the matter not taken any further . "
As an apprentice farmer hoping to strike off on my own sometime soon , I ’m pretty much always asking myself , “ where should I farm ? ”
Should I return to Georgia , where I have family and friends ?
Stay in Massachusetts , with its farmer - friendly state government and affordable health insurance ?
I hear Pennsylvania has a great climate for tree fruit …
Recently I asked my current farm boss , Don , if he thought that the market near Williamstown could support another CSA farm .
“ That depends on whom you ask , ” he noted after some thought .
“ There are farmers who hear of a new farm in the area and worry that the extra competition will hurt their own business ; others view a new farm as an asset , an additional resource when you ’ve got problems or questions , as well as another reason for townsfolk to buy local . ”
His answer stuck with me .
And since I received it , I ’ve begun to notice more and more the ways that the farmers I know support and assist one another .
There ’s Cricket Creek Farm , the raw milk dairy down the road , which provides us with milk all winter long in return for a share of veggies come spring .
Or Hand Hollow Farm , a fledgling CSA 20 minutes in the opposite direction , founded by one of Don ’s former apprentices ( we call her the Prodigy Farmer ) .
With Don ’s help , she spent her spare time in the fall of her apprenticeship planning the following spring on her own farm , and she has n’t looked back since .
I saw this spirit of mutual support more clearly than ever on Monday , when I and about 30 other apprentices visited Indian Line Farm for one of our bimonthly lectures and tours through the CRAFT ( Collaborative Regional Alliance for Farmer Training ) program .
Indian Line is a farm with a story , by virtue of its having been the first CSA farm in the country .
In between that founding in 1985 and the present day , the farm passed through several manifestations before settling into the capable hands of its present farmer , Elizabeth Keen .
Elizabeth and her husband
Al had only apprenticed for one year when the opportunity to take on Indian Line presented itself for them in 1997 .
With only a single shared apprenticeship between the two of them , their learning curve was steep , as they related to us .
So steep , in fact , that for Elizabeth ’s second and third seasons at Indian Line , she took on off - farm work in the mornings — working for Martin Stosiek of Markristo Farm down the road .
After two seasons of farming in double - time , Elizabeth made Indian Line her single focus , though the close ties between Indian Line and Markristo remain strong .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
As the tour led us into the basement of the barn , Elizabeth spoke to us about her decision to opt out of the USDA organic certification process .
While USDA certification can certainly be a boon to supermarket consumers , many of the farmers I know consider the associated paperwork and fees a headache not worth the cache of the organic label .
Indian Line concurred with this perspective , but had sought a way to convey to customers at market the sustainability of their growing practices .
Their solution , to join the farmer - based non-profit “ Certified Naturally Grown , ” perfectly suited the thread of cooperation and farmer community that runs throughout their operation .
Certified Naturally Grown is grassroots alternative to the USDA , through which farmers audit one another for sustainable practices .
Certified Naturally Grown is neither costly ( the program requests a donation of $ 50 - 150 annually , though the exact amount is left to an individual farmer ’s discretion ) , nor overburdened with paperwork , thus allowing small farmers to devote their energies to farming , rather than to proving themselves to strangers via a mountain of forms .
Though a Certified Naturally Grown farm leaves less of a paper trail than a Certified Organic one , all CNG records are openly available online .
Growers clearly state their growing practices and sign a statement that they have abided by all of the CNG regulations ( which are essentially the same as certified organic ) .
So what ’s the difference ?
Besides price and time , the auditors are other farmers and are allowed offer advice as they walk the fields , talk to the grower , and evaluate the farm ( USDA certifiers , on the other hand , are not allowed to offer any suggestions during an audit ) .
To avoid conflict of interest problems , you are not allowed to audit the farmer who audited you .
In addition , every year , CNG randomly selects farms for pesticide residue testing , at no cost to the farmer .
Could someone cheat this system ?
CNG admits that “ no one can ever really know what may or may not be happening on an isolated farm at 5 AM on a Sunday morning , ” but they believe that their combination of deterrents ( random testing ) , community support ( audits by other farmers ) , and a transparent , easily navigated process to certification create a system that is uniquely accessible to small farmers and informative for consumers .
From my perspective , probably the most striking example of farmer collaboration I see is the CRAFT program itself .
The exposure to varied farming models and practical agricultural information is priceless , but I imagine that the greatest benefits will only become visible over time .
Through CRAFT
I ’m interacting with 40 other apprentices , most of whom seem eager to grow their own farms as soon as they can scrounge together a few packs of seeds and a flat patch of earth .
We probably seem a motley crew–drinking from mason jars , traipsing uphill and down in thick rubber boots and manure - stained work pants — but we are a passionate crowd , full of questions , ideas , and dreams of good food .

According to Werner Herzog Klaus Kinski threatened to abandon the film entirely at one point during the shooting over Herzog 's refusal to fire a sound assistant .
Herzog says he threatened to kill Kinski and then turn the gun on himself if Kinski left - and later declared he was quite prepared to do so , knowing that the authorities would write it off as a hunting accident .
Kinski stated in interviews that Herzog wielded a pistol to emphasize the threat , but Herzog denies this .

What is a heatmap ?
According to Wikipedia , a heatmap is a " graphical representation of data where the values taken by a variable in a two - dimensional map are represented as colors " .
What this means is that the data we are using - in our case , Sentry Gun data from popular TF2 maps - is represented as a hot - to - cold color map , based on how often a person builds or gets a kill with a Sentrygun .
Simply put , the more red or " hot " an area is , the more popular or attractive of a build or kill location it is .
What is the TF2 Sentrygun Heatmap Project ?
This project is a data study based on Sentry Gun build and kill data from Team Fortress 2 .
This data is gathered in real - time from the participating server communities , which tracks basic Sentry information - locations built , locations where they get kills , and locations where they are destroyed .
Originally I set this up because like any good Engineer , I am always looking for the most efficient way of defending a map .
While I originally did this for my own benefit , an interesting side effect was finding out what areas in what maps are far more defensible than others .
For example , we all know that when Egypt was originally released as an Official Valve map , the first stage was nearly impossible to win as the Offensive team .
When I saw this trend represented in my Heatmaps , I quickly forwarded the information to Valve and the creator of Egypt .
Shortly thereafter , an updated version of Egypt was released with the first stage being modified to be more friendly to the Offensive team .
A similar thing happened with Hoodoo and the second stage .
My heatmaps were showing an extremely " hot " area near the 2nd cap on the 2nd stage where it was almost impossible to break a stalemate , and after a few weeks an update came out for this map as well with the area in question being changed .
While I do n't have any evidence or statement from either map author saying they updated their maps based on my heatmaps , I can still tell myself that they did !
What exactly are these maps I am looking at ?
There are 3 types of maps that I have generated here :
Build Maps -
These are simple maps that show where a Sentry is built and how often .
The " hotter " an area is , the more Sentry traffic it gets .
These maps are useful for finding popular Sentry locations , though they may not accurately tell how " successful " a Sentry is .
- These are simple maps that show where a Sentry is built and how often .

These maps are useful for finding popular Sentry locations , though they may not accurately tell how " successful " a Sentry is .
Kill Maps -
Again these are simple maps that show where a Sentry gets kills at and how often .
The " hotter " an area , the more Sentry kills are gained in that particular area .
Keep in mind that the " heat " is from where the Sentry is located , not where the kill it gets is located .
These maps are useful for finding high - kill areas , however this may only mean they are moderately successful .
Building in these locations means you most likely will get some kills there .
- Again these are simple maps that show where a Sentry gets kills at and how often .

Kill - Placement Maps -
These are more intuitive maps , using both build and kill data .
The " hotter " an area is , the more a successful Sentry is built .
Like the Kill Maps , it gets hot when a Sentry gets a kill , however it only does it once per Sentry .
IE , a Sentry that gets 10 kills and a Sentry that gets 1 kill will show up the same here .
This is useful for finding consistently successful Sentry locations .
Why are some maps so empty ?
Why do n't you have my favorite map ?
I am only able to gather the data from the game servers running the plugin needed for this project to run .
When a map is empty , it means that map is not very popular on the communities that are participating in the project .
Good news though !
You can help out by talking to your favorite community 's admins and asking if they will participate in the project .
Tell them to contact me and let me know they are interested !

Texas billionaire Andy Beal is n't a household name .
He 's best known in some circles as the main subject of the book The Professor , The Banker and the Suicide King , which is about his quixotic $ 100,000 - per - hand poker match against many of the game 's top pros ( he got his clock cleaned ) .
Perhaps part of the reason he's an unknown is that even though he 's a banker , he retrenched his business during the credit boom , even going so far as to lay off employees .
But now that the bubble 's over , he 's stepping on the gas pedal , buying distressed loans , hiring and lending more than ever to businesses that have nowhere else to go .
Forbes : By September 2004 Beal Bank 's assets had climbed to $ 7.7 billion .
Then Beal stopped buying , letting his loans run off .
By September 2007 assets had shriveled to $ 2.9 billion , one - fifth of which was cold cash .
He was worried that consumers had taken on too much debt and money was being lent to companies for next to nothing .
" Every deal done since 2004 is just stupid , " Beal says .
He began by pulling back from home loans -- even those guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Beal thought the two quasi - government agencies were over - leveraged .
When staffers mentioned their guarantees in deal presentations he would fire back that these guarantees were " worthless . "
Not surprisingly , given the incompetence of regulators , it was his bank that drew suspicion .
In late 2006 he sold $ 74 million of preferred stock although he had no immediate use for the proceeds .
He says he could n't resist the " stupidly mispriced " terms -- as low as Libor plus 1.7 percentage points for 30 years .
He wanted as much money available when the boom turned to bust .
With the extra money the bank could pay off nearly all its depositors with capital on hand -- nearly unheard of in the history of banking .
Then came a shocker : Amid one of the most reckless lending sprees in history , regulators focused on the one bank that refused to play along .
Beal 's moves confused and worried them , and so they began to probe him with questions .
" What are you doing ? " he recalls them asking .
" You 're shrinking yetyou 're raising capital ? "
Says Beal about the scrutiny , " I just did n't fit into any box . "
One regulator , the former head of the Texas Savings & Loan Department , Charles Danny Payne , says , " I was skeptical at first , but I 've gained a lot of confidence over the years , " adding that Beal has an " uncanny ability to sniff out deals . "
Next , the credit rating agencies started pestering him about his dwindling loan portfolio .
They never downgraded him but scolded him for seeming not to have a " sustainable " business model .
This while their colleagues were signing off on $ 32 billion of bum collateralized debt obligations issued by Merrill Lynch .
It 's really quite amazingly backwards this story is .
To some extent , it even gives the lie to the idea that the problem was a lack of regulation .
Turns out the credit agencies and the regulators were looking out for the abnormal and the unusual .
They were n't just sitting behind their desks twiddling their thumbs reading Chris Cox 's dogeared copies of Atlas Shrugged .
These days Beal 's still fairly pessimistic and predicts that about half the country 's banks , 4000 , would go bust if they were being honest about their books .
But the good news :
Now he 's the model banker , though once again he 's annoying the government .
Sheila
Bair seems to think of him as a nuisance picking off assets at too - low prices and generally not playing ball with everyone else .
But it should be obvious we need more Andy Beals , not less .

It happens all the time on the plane .
Two people get to talking and , soon enough , one discovers he paid a lot more than his in - flight neighbor for the ticket .
Now , new research from a pair of Brandeis University economists suggests shoppers at the Fulton Fish Market might want to make small talk as they wait in line .
Kathryn Graddy and George Hall , both at Brandeis ’ International Business School , studied fish - purchasing patterns over 22 weeks and found that white customers usually pay five cents , and sometimes up to 10 cents , more than their Asian counterparts when buying a pound of whiting at the Fulton Fish Market in New York City .
Whenever a buyer approaches a fish stand , the economists write , a fish dealer ’s expert eye scans “ his type ” and evaluates his price elasticity .
As a rule of thumb , Asian customers mean tougher haggling and lower prices ; their white counterparts are a quicker sell , yielding higher profits for the vendor .
Whiting bought by Asians , in fact , mostly ends up in fish sandwiches and fish balls in low - end fry shops where retailers have little scope to pass higher prices onto frugal customers .
White buyers tend to represent more upscale restaurants or shops where they can pass on the price difference to the consumer .
They also want to get out fast — and can afford to do so .
White shoppers would fare better in a fish market with fixed and publicly displayed prices , Graddy and Hall conclude .
Here “ the inelastic white customers pay lower prices , purchase larger quantities of fish , and make more frequent purchases . ”
On the flip side , the more elastic Asian buyers would end up paying more and buying less .
So how could New York ’s fish shoppers be in the dark for so long over this ?
Easy , the report says , they rarely mix with each other .

ERIE , Pa. | Former President George W. Bush fired a salvo at President Obama on Wednesday , asserting his administration ’s interrogation policies were within the law , declaring the private sector — not government — will fix the economy and rejecting the nationalization of health care .
“ I know it ’s going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we ’re in , ” the former president said to applause from members of a local business group .
“ You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money . ”
Repeatedly in his hourlong speech and question - and - answer session , Mr. Bush said he would not directly criticize the new president , who has moved to take over financial institutions and several large corporations .
Several times , however , he took direct aim at Obama policies as he defended his own during eight years in office .
“ Government does not create wealth .
The major role for the government is to create an environment where people take risks to expand the job rate in the United States , ” he said to huge cheers .

Mr. Bush weighed in on some of the most pressing issues of the day : the election in Iran , the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba , and his administration ’s interrogation policies of terrorists held there and elsewhere .
The former president has not commented on Mr. Obama ’s decision to ban “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” such as waterboarding , which the current president has called “ off course ” and “ based on fear . ”
“ The way I decided to address the problem was twofold : One , use every technique and tool within the law to bring terrorists to justice before they strike again , ” he said , adding that the country needs to stay on offense , not defense .
On Guantanamo , which while in office Mr. Bush said he wanted to close , the former president was diplomatic .
“ I told you I ’m not going to criticize my successor , ” he said .
“ I ’ll just tell you that there are people at Gitmo that will kill American people at a drop of a hat and I do n’t believe that — persuasion is n’t going to work .
Therapy is n’t going to cause terrorists to change their mind . ”
The Obama administration has started to clear out some of the more than 200 detainees at the facility .
Repeating a mantra from his presidency , he called the current war against terrorism an “ ideological conflict , ” asserting that in the long term , the United States needs to press freedom and democracy in corners across the world .
Mr. Bush did not directly address Mr. Obama ’s response to the election in Iran , which some critics have called tepid , but he did make clear that the outcome is very much in dispute .
For a fifth straight day , as the Obama administration walks a tightrope by issuing little criticism , protesters gathered in Tehran to demand a new election .
“ Clearly , there ’s a level of frustration on the Iranian streets , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ It looks like it ’s not a very fair election . ”
Mr. Bush returned again and again to the economy , and sought to defend his own actions after the financial meltdown in the waning days of his second term — Mr. Obama repeatedly has said he inherited that mess .
“ I am told , ‘ If you do not move strongly , Mr. President , you will be a president overseeing a depression that will ultimately be greater than the Great Depression , ’ ” Mr. Bush said .
“ I firmly believe it was necessary to put money in our banks to make sure our financial system did not collapse . …
I did not want there to be bread lines , to be a great depression . ”
He said his administration sought to address the “ housing bubble ” before the system broke down .
“ We tried to reform ” mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , “ but could n’t get it through the vested interests on Capitol Hill . ”
Still , Mr. Bush was optimistic , pressing , as he did as president , free trade , open markets and the free enterprise system .
“ We ’ll come out of this better than before , ” he said to more applause .
But he was less than convinced about Mr. Obama ’s move to overhaul the health care system .
“ There are a lot of ways to remedy the situation without nationalizing health care , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ I worry about encouraging the government to replace the private sector when it comes to providing insurance for health care . ”
Asked by the evening emcee at the 104th annual Manufacturer and Business Association meeting if he finds the new president ’s policies “ socialist , ” Mr. Bush started — then stopped .
“ I hear a lot of those words , but it depends on — ” he said , breaking off .
He later offered a more diplomatic assessment : “ We ’ll see . ”
Wednesday ’s speech to hundreds of high - paying association members — “ premium ” tables at the city ’s convention center went for $ 1,500 — was just the second post - presidency speech by Mr. Bush on U.S. soil ( his two major speeches were both in Canada ) .
He was loose and relaxed , his nose a bright red from nearly a week in Kennebunkport , Maine , where he joined his family in celebration of his father ’s 85th birthday .
Mr. Bush told some of his new set stories :
How just a month after leaving office he was picking up his dog Barney ’s poop off a manicured lawn in his Dallas neighborhood ; how he ’s experienced his first red light in 14 years ( he served six years as Texas governor before being elected president ) .
His Secret Service detail , however , was not relaxed :
This was the first event in which audience members did not have to pass through metal detectors .
Outside , a tiny group of protesters and supporters — about 10 people on each side — faced off on opposite curbs .
One man held a sign that said , “ President Bush , thank you for saving all the babies . ”
On the other side : “ Arrest Bush . ”
But the former president got a big cheer when he walked out on stage — even bigger than Joe Paterno , the legendary Penn State coach who was also on hand for the event .
The former president noted that America has a funny political system : “ You ’re it , then you ’re not it — instantly . ”
He lamented the politics of personal destruction that he said is rampant in Washington , noting , though , that it has always been thus .
Recalling how a treasury secretary and a vice president once fought a duel , he joked : “ At least when my vice president shot somebody , it was an accident . ”
During a question - and - answer session , Mr. Bush recounted tough decisions he made in office .
Still steely , the former president said he left Washington with the same moral resolve .
“ When I look in the mirror , I say , ‘ He did not sell his soul for short - term politics . ’ ”
Asked about the morning of Sept. 11 , 2001 , when he first learned of the terrorist attacks while in a classroom full of children in Florida , Mr. Bush said he simply found an inner resolve .
“ I realized that we were in crisis , and the first thing I do in any crisis … is calm .
If you ’re president , and all of a sudden the whole world is watching you , and you get up and do something precipitously , frighten children , storm out , that kind of movement will cascade through a society , ” he said .
In answer to a question about what he learned as president , Mr. Bush smiled broadly .
“ There ’s so much stuff coming at you , ” he said to laughter .
But turning serious , he said , perhaps to his successor : “ You do n’t know what ’s going to come when you ’re president .
You just have to be ready for it . ”

Inquiring minds are investigating legislation that would sell US oil reserves in an attempt to bring down the price of gasoline .
Can such a scheme possibly work ?
Please consider US Reps File Bill To Tap SPR To Counter Oil Price Rise .
Several influential U.S. House Democrats have filed a bill that would require the government to tap the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counter rising oil prices .
Reps . Ed Markey , D - Mass. , Chris Van Hollen , D - Md. and Peter Welch , D - Vt. , said their legislation would direct the Department of Energy to sell 70 million barrels of more expensive light , sweet crude and replace it with cheaper heavy crude .
By mandating a release of oil into the market , legislators want to try and shake some speculators out of the market .
Many lawmakers blame what they term " excessive " speculation in the market for skyrocketing crude prices , despite many economists citing the fundamentals of supply and demand as being the primary drivers .
The revenues brought in from the price differential in the swap would then go back into the SPR account to fill the reserve back up to its 727 - million barrel capacity .

" I'm a National Socialist ! " he declared proudly .
Though he would reveal his name only as " Harry , " this particular neo - Nazi is known as " Vandal " on his Yahoo profile , where he lists late white supremacist leader William Pierce 's racist , dystopian novel The Turner Diaries and Tenney Davis '
The Chemistry of Powder and Explosives as two of his favorite books .
Vandal waited patiently on the sidewalk near Tent City on May 2 as thousands of marchers approached Joe Arpaio 's vast incarceration complex to protest the 287 ( g ) program that empowers the sheriff to enforce federal immigration law .
More polite than his nativist compatriots in groups such as United for a Sovereign America and Riders Against Illegal Aliens , Vandal was just as virulently committed to Arpaio and his anti-immigration policies as his heavy - handed colleagues .
The issue , he claimed , is that the United States is giving " preferential treatment " to Mexican immigrants over American citizens .
Asked whether he thought the sheriff wanted him and a gaggle of , well , neo - Nazis confronting anti-Joe protesters in the " Walk for Respect , " Vandal said : " He needs our support . "
Standing nearby was J.T. Ready , ex-Mesa City Council candidate , former Republican precinct committeeman , and erstwhile associate of State Senator Russell Pearce .
Ready was waving a huge Confederate flag and wiping imaginary " Mexcrement , " as he called it , onto a real Mexican tricolor on the ground .
Ready is the most infamous neo -Nazi in Maricopa County , known for handing out anti-Semitic screeds at Republican Party functions , for his activism in anti-immigration circles , and for his occasional run-ins with law enforcement , which have included getting arrested in 2007 for driving with fictitious plates on his black Chevy Impala and possessing a pre-emption emitter , which allows him to bypass red lights .
Also in his car at the time were a 9 - millimeter Beretta , white - power literature , and binoculars .
" Obama 's not my president , " Ready told New Times as he flitted from topic to topic , waiting with Vandal for the arrival of the marchers .
" He 's ZOG 's president . "
ZOG is neo -Nazi shorthand for Zionist Occupation Government , the fictitious Jewish conspiracy that some neo -Nazis believe controls the United States .
Ready continued his wide - ranging diatribe , segueing not very subtly into why he believes pogroms against Jews in Europe 's past were a good thing .
" They [ had ] to expel an alien that 's preying upon them .
[ They were ] parasites , " said Ready , a former Marine who was twice court - martialed and expelled from the military with a bad - conduct discharge .
" C'mon , that 's healthy .
It 's only when you 're unhealthy that you 've got parasites on you . "
When New Times asked Ready whether he hated all Mexicans , he offered another dehumanizing metaphor : " I do n't hate all of anything .
I do n't hate all scorpions , but I would n't want them crawling around in my house . "
Ready then bragged about how Sheriff Arpaio had stopped by earlier in the day , said hello , and even called him by name .
Another neo -Nazi , using the handle " Vito Lombardi , " excitedly related how a photo was taken of him and his hero , Arpaio .
The conversation was cut short by the anti-Arpaio demonstrators , led by rock musician Zack de la Rocha , who were making their way east on Durango Street , from 35th Avenue toward Tent City .
The neo -Nazis were the first to encounter the mostly Hispanic protesters , saluting them with Nazi sieg heils , enraging them with Mexican flag - stomping , and haranguing them with cries of " scum , " " murderers , " and " rapists . "
The Phoenix Police Department was out in full force to make sure violence did n't erupt between the neo -Nazis and nativists — many of whom displayed firearms — on one side of the street and the pro-immigration crowd on the other .
Still , the ugliness was pervasive , whether it was U.S.A. members holding placards linking Mexicans to diseases such as swine flu ( many in the pro-Joe crowd wore surgical masks ) , or Vito Lombardi and J.T. Ready 's teaming up to bait a local musician because they believed him to be Jewish .
After the march , it was revealed through an image posted on the white supremacist message board Stormfront.org that the neo - Nazi calling himself Lombardi really had scored his fanboy snapshot with Joe Arpaio .
Indeed , the sheriff had stopped beside the neo -Nazis in an unmarked black sedan before the throng of anti-MCSO protesters arrived .
Captured on video and posted on YouTube ( view here ) by nativist Lynne Stevens ( known online as " Jackie40d " ) , the sheriff speaks with the neo - Nazis briefly , allows them to take photos , and even gives them a little intelligence on the marchers .
The marchers " wo n't be here for an hour , " he informs them in the video , which has now been viewed more than 800 times on Stevens ' rarely watched YouTube channel .
Arpaio 's flirtation with the fascists that day could be written off as a politically incorrect flub — if it were not for his pattern of courting extremist nativists over the past four years .
It 's the natural result of Arpaio 's Johnny - come - lately stand on illegal immigration , his immigration sweeps ( during which claims of racial profiling have been rampant ) , and his Archie Bunker - like attitude regarding racial and ethnic issues wrapped up in the immigration debate .
For instance , take Arpaio 's now - infamous statement ( view here ) on a November 2007 episode of Lou Dobbs ' CNN show that it was an " honor " to be called a KKK member .
The clip has long since gone viral , giving ammunition to those who believe Arpaio to be an unrepentant bigot .
Yet the sheriff 's involvement with extreme hate groups is not incidental .
The relationship has been prolonged and intentional , arguably helping him get re-elected last year in a county where much of the electorate is hostile toward Mexican immigrants .
Since 2007 , Arpaio has appeared at nativist events , accepted awards from groups such as the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps , welcomed U.S.A. leader Rusty Childress into his immigration sweep headquarters , spoken at nativist meetings frequented by neo -Nazis , and used petitions circulated by extremists to justify his immigration dragnets .
Also troubling are indications that the MCSO , in some cases , instructs U.S.A. through member Barb Heller , who has bragged about her contacts with the Sheriff 's Office to anyone who will listen , and who apparently receives instruction and advice on how U.S.A. should handle itself .
In the light of Arpaio 's love affair with nativist groups , his photo with a neo -Nazi seems almost inevitable .
But the implications of it are disturbing .
The presence of neo -Nazis at the march and Arpaio 's snapshot with Lombardi were first reported by New Times on one of the newspaper 's blogs .
NBC affiliate Channel 12 later picked up on a YouTube video of Ready and Lombardi flipping ( view here ) sieg heils that New Times had already posted .
After seeing the video and photo , Arizona Anti-Defamation League director Bill Straus called on Arpaio to distance himself from neo -Nazis .
" The fact that it 's posted on Stormfront is enough for Arpaio to say , ' Hey , I 'm not looking for support from neo - Nazis , ' " Straus told New Times of the Arpaio - Lombardi snapshot .
But the sheriff has yet to condemn his National Socialist supporters .
All the MCSO public - relations team could muster was this lukewarm defense of their boss to Channel 12 :
" It is not the sheriff 's position to discourage groups on either side from exercising their rights .
Sheriff Arpaio does not have any control over who shows up to these public protests . "
A couple of days later , another jackboot dropped .
New Times discovered that the National Socialist Movement member who scored the sweetheart pic with Arpaio was Thomas Vito Coletto , who was implicated in what some thought was a " Columbine copycat " plot against Coletto's high school , Desert Mountain , in 2007 .
Coletto and four others were collared for burglarizing chemicals such as ammonium nitrate , the same compound used by Timothy McVeigh in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .
Coletto , now 19 , ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal damage in a 2008 deal with the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office , which dropped the burglary charge against him .
He received two years ' probation and a hefty fine .
The Scottsdale teen claims the incident was merely high school shenanigans , misinterpreted by the authorities in the paranoia over the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech .
However , a YouTube video of and by Coletto showing him using homemade explosives in an infantile effort to re-create the World War II experiences of his grandfather ( who , ironically , fought the Nazis in Europe ) is particularly eyebrow - raising in light of Coletto 's neo -Nazi affiliations .
( Coletto removed the video after New Times mentioned it in a blog post . )
This May 2 dalliance with Coletto and J.T. Ready was n't the first time Arpaio has associated with the neo -Nazis .
In March 2008 , the sheriff spoke before a United for a Sovereign America meeting at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Sunnyslope , where U.S.A. affiliate Elton Hall was in attendance .
Hall , 75 , is a legend in Arizona neo - Nazi circles , venerated by racist skinheads for his work as an organizer for George Lincoln Rockwell 's American Nazi Party in the 1960s .
Hall has been around so long that he 's actually mentioned in scholarly tomes about American neo -Nazis , yet U.S.A. members embraced him as a " patriot , " a term they used to describe him in one of the organization 's official statements .
Hall has kept vigil with other U.S.A. protesters at armed demonstrations outside civil rights leader Salvador Reza 's Macehualli Day Labor Center in north Phoenix .
For more than a year , U.S.A. has protested at the center , which gives day laborers a place to wait for jobs without trespassing on other businesses ' properties .
New Times exposed the septuagenarian storm trooper 's participation in U.S.A. activities in February 2008 , shortly after Hall was injured in a two - car collision as he picketed near the Macehualli center .
He recovered in time to hear Arpaio speak at the VFW post on March 20 .
If Arpaio could claim ignorance about Hall before the VFW appearance , the sheriff could not do so afterward .
Following a press conference on March 21 to announce an anti-immigration sweep in the area of Thomas Road and 32nd Street , New Times confronted Arpaio about his ties to U.S.A. and about U.S.A.'s accepting neo -Nazis into its fold .
J.T. Ready frequented U.S.A. meetings when they were held at the Kia dealership Childress once owned on West Camelback Road in Phoenix .
And Childress gave the maximum amount , $ 370 , to Ready 's 2006 Mesa City Council bid , as did Aron Mezo , Childress ' partner in the now - defunct Scottsdale nightclub E4 .
Childress also employed Ready as a bouncer at the club , during the time Ready was running for office .
Ready 's neo -Nazi leanings were first detailed by New Times in 2007 blog and column items discussing his Web page on NewSaxon.org , a social networking site " for whites , by whites , " where Ready maintains a blog under the handle " Viking Son " and makes such anti-Semitic statements as , " The Jew is a two - legged cancer which corrupts and putrefies all that is natural and noble upon this Earth . "
But if there were any doubts about Ready 's views remaining , he eliminated them by traveling to Omaha , Nebraska , for a rally sponsored by the National Socialist Movement on September 1 , 2007 .
There , Ready was captured in photographs standing shoulder to shoulder with swastika - wearing brownshirts .
But back to the sheriff 's March 21 press conference , which occurred inside a taped - off area that served as Arpaio 's provisional headquarters for the anti-immigrant sweep .
All anti-Arpaio protesters and U.S.A. counter - protesters remained outside the yellow tape , save for one : Rusty Childress .
Pressed about Childress ' presence in the inner sanctum , Arpaio responded by saying Childress is " a good guy . "
Arpaio was asked , " You do n't have any problem with him accepting neo - Nazis into his ranks ? "
The sheriff replied , " I have no problem .
You know what ?
I talk to everybody .
I even talk to the demonstrators . "
" Would you talk to the Klan ? " New Times asked .
" I talk to the inmates .
I talk to everybody .
I 'm the sheriff for everybody , " he responded , glibly .
If neo - Nazis did not give Arpaio pause , their presence later led to a mini-rebellion in U.S.A.'s ranks , with Republican activist and Vietnam veteran Bob Haran and anti-immigrant activist Anna Gaines walking out of an April 10 meeting where Hall was present .
Gaines accused
Hall of hurting the group 's image and suggested he remove himself from U.S.A .
Hall was defiant , and the meeting turned into a shouting match .
Hall remained , while acknowledging his National Socialist beliefs and his continuing activism as a neo -Nazi .
A week later , Hall offered the group an out :
He would officially " step down " from U.S.A. yet still participate in some of its events .
U.S.A. accepted his proposal , and Hall has been at subsequent U.S.A. demonstrations since last April .
For instance , he was present at U.S.A.'s counter - demonstration to the February 28 anti-Arpaio march , which drew 5,000 marchers to downtown Phoenix .
Like the smaller May 2 Walk for Respect , it was led by Rage Against the Machine / One Day as a Lion frontman Zack de la Rocha .
Aside from speaking to a group with neo -Nazi ties , Arpaio has also served as a " rallying point " for white supremacists , in the words of Arizona ADL director Straus .
For instance , on the white nationalist site Stormfront.org , whole discussion strings are devoted to Joe Arpaio 's so - called patriotic actions .
" I love to see a white man stand up for himself , " wrote one Stormfront member recently under the handle " direct action . "
In the same thread , a Stormfronter from Arizona named " DesertFox63 " stated , " Sheriff Joe is my man , yes he is .
I voted for him all 5 times . "
As with neo -Nazis counter - protesting the Walk for Respect , Arpaio has never disavowed support from the racist right .
And such radicals have flocked to demonstrations supporting him .
In late 2007 , M.D. Pruitt 's furniture store became a tinderbox as Pruitt 's owner Roger Sensing hired off - duty MCSO deputies to patrol his property and keep away day laborers seeking work from motorists .
The MCSO not only guarded Sensing 's lot , it scoured the area , stopping day laborers and drivers when possible , looking for illegal immigrants to arrest .
Under the leadership of Salvador Reza , weekend protests of Sensing 's business commenced , and counter - protesters from U.S.A. and other nativist groups showed up to oppose Reza 's action .
By the end of the year , the demonstrations and counter - demonstrations were drawing hundreds of activists from both sides .
The pro-Arpaio supporters were armed with guns , pepper spray , and collapsible batons .
Several neo -Nazis joined the nativist side , including Scott Hume ( a.k.a. Shawn Hughes ) , the " acting unit leader " of the Phoenix chapter of the National Socialist Movement .
( Hume was outed by New Times during coverage of the protests . )
Also present were newbie skinhead Damon Ashenfelter and longtime local neo -Nazi Jerry Harbin , among others .
The situation was tense , with nativist demonstrators stomping on the Mexican flag and both sides jeering each other .
Phoenix police eventually separated the protest factions to opposite street corners , but violence seemed imminent for a time .
Arpaio visited Pruitt's on several occasions , treating the furniture store as his personal fiefdom .
Occasionally , he ventured out to where the protesters were .
The nativist side cheered him like a conquering hero , while the pro-immigration side hissed and booed him .
Once , Arpaio walked down the street next to where Salvador Reza 's group was lined up on the sidewalk and taunted the crowd .
He was accused by some protesters of trying to incite the two groups .
If this was Arpaio 's intention , he did not get his wish .
By the end of 2007 , the Pruitt 's protests concluded with a proverbial whimper rather than a bang after owner Roger Sensing agreed not to hire off - duty MCSO deputies .
But Pruitt 's had given Arpaio a bold , new idea — sweeps to root out illegal immigrants that would continue to draw protesters and get the sheriff 's face plastered across the media .
Its neo -Nazi participants aside , United for a Sovereign America has always included a rogues ' gallery , accepting various extremists and questionable individuals into its meetings and activities in its ongoing effort to influence the immigration debate in Arizona and beyond .
Past attendees at U.S.A. assemblies have included John Watson , a.k.a.
" John the Scot , " who claimed to be a member of the White Knights of America , a white separatist group based in Tonopah , and Laine Lawless , a gun-toting pagan from San Francisco known for burning Mexican flags outside Mexican consulates in Phoenix and Tucson .
Scraggly ex-musician " Buffalo " Rick Galeener remains one of the group 's most outspoken and active members , despite his pleading guilty in December 2008 for urinating in public in front of a woman and her 2 - year - old child near the Macehualli Day Labor Center .
Galeener , who is usually armed , regularly refers to non-whites as " monkeys " and maintains a Web site that offers T - shirts with sadistic and sometimes racist messages such as , " Attention Mexico : We Shoot Strays " and " Undocumented Illegal Alien Hunter . "
Galeener also once made a vague threat toward U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver on U.S.A.'s
Web site , www.immigrationbuzz.com, after Silver issued a temporary order blocking a Cave Creek ordinance against day laborers .
" Nothing is too ' good ' for this traitorous judge , " opined Galeener .
" Remember her name when it comes time to mark an X . "
As another example , plus - size erotic masseuse Brandy Baron , one of Sheriff Arpaio 's most vocal supporters and a regular at the Macehualli protests , once suggested to videographer and pro-immigration activist Dennis Gilman that Mexicans should be shot as they tried coming over the U.S. - Mexico border illegally .
In retaliation for Salvador Reza 's leading the protests at Pruitt's , U.S.A began the daily protests at the Macehualli center , near 25th Street and Bell Road , around the beginning of 2008 .
At a recent six - year anniversary ceremony for Macehualli , about 50 nativist protesters , in an attempt to disrupt the celebration , hurled obscenities at day laborers and their young children as they entered the center for the event .
On U.S.A.'s
Web site , immigrants are portrayed as bringing crime , disease , and social decline .
The Web site demonizes Mexicans through regular updates and commentary on current events .
The reconquista conspiracy theory , which says Mexico is attempting to take back the Southwest by encouraging illegal immigration , is treated as gospel .
Also on immigrationbuzz.com , you can find video of the late Madeleine Cosman , a racist lecturer known for railing against " anchor babies " ( otherwise known as American citizens born to undocumented parents ) and proffering false claims that Mexican immigrants were responsible for a rise in leprosy cases .
Every crime committed by an illegal immigrant earns headline treatment on U.S.A.'s site .
As does every press release from Sheriff Joe .
For its anti-immigrant rhetoric and activism , U.S.A. has been labeled a " nativist extremist " group by the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report magazine .
The label means the organization targets " individual immigrants rather than immigration policies . "
Both Rusty Childress and Buffalo Rick Galeener have been profiled as nativist leaders by the Montgomery , Alabama - based civil rights publication .
Despite its infamy , U.S.A. has drawn visits from such local , far - right luminaries as State Senator Pearce , Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas , and Arizona GOP Chairman Randy Pullen .
But it 's Sheriff Arpaio who arguably has the tightest ties to the organization .
Indeed , it was Galeener who instigated Arpaio to bring one of his anti-immigrant sweeps to Bell and Cave Creek roads , near the Macehualli center .
Though the center is generally supported by local businesses in the Palomino neighborhood , Galeener was able to find eight businesses , out of hundreds in the busy Bell Road corridor , willing to request an MCSO sweep in writing .
The meager support for Galeener from local shops was enough to get the sheriff marching in lockstep with U.S.A.'s agenda .
Not long after the MCSO set up its command center in a parking lot at Bell and Cave Creek Roads on March 27 , about 700 anti-Arpaio demonstrators encircled the provisional headquarters , held back by MCSO barricades .
About two dozen counter - demonstrators from U.S.A. and the motorcycle group Riders Against Illegal Aliens also showed up .
These pro-Arpaio counter - demonstrators received special protection from MCSO deputies while they were there .
Both sides threw water bottles and soft - drink cans at each other .
At one point , a man with a shotgun slung over his back was arrested by the MCSO after appearing on the scene .
Neither side claimed him as one of their own .
He seemed to be one of the many disturbed individuals attracted to Arpaio 's circus - like sweeps .
During a March 20 address at the Sunnyslope VFW post , Arpaio tipped off U.S.A. that the Bell Road sweep was coming on March 27 .
" I appreciate your support , " he told the U.S.A. crowd , including neo -Nazi Elton Hall .
" You 're on the right track .
You 're doing what you should be doing . "
On that night , the crowd was whipped into a fervor when Arpaio informed them that undocumented immigrants were fleeing the state .
" The good news is , all these people are leaving , " Arpaio stated .
" They 're going to other states , or back to Mexico . "
The sheriff cemented his status as U.S.A.'s favorite politician with the VFW speech , and anyone speaking out against his policies met with U.S.A.'s wrath .
After Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon denounced Arpaio 's racial profiling and links to bigots and neo -Nazis exposed by New Times , some U.S.A. regulars formed a group called American Citizens United , which organized a recall effort against Gordon .
The effort was unsuccessful , even though U.S.A. members circulated petitions and drove cars around town pasted with signs demanding Gordon 's removal from office .
The leader of the campaign against the mayor was Anna Gaines .
Though she had stormed out of the April 10 U.S.A. meeting over the continued presence of neo -Nazi Hall , she was fully backed in her effort to recall Gordon by Rusty Childress and the U.S.A. faithful .
Ironically , Gaines was cited on a trespassing charge by local police for gathering recall signatures at a bookstore where Arpaio was signing copies of his " autobiography , " Joe 's Law .
She was later found not guilty of the charge .
Though the recall effort failed , U.S.A. members were n't finished with Gordon .
On the afternoon of Sunday , October 26 , they took the unusual step of picketing Gordon 's residence .
Gordon was not at home , but the nativists did manage to spook children at a Halloween party going on at a neighbor 's house .
One of their signs read : " Phil Gordon , you piece of shit ! "
Gordon spokesman Scott Phelps offered a wry analysis after the demonstration :
" You know the saying , ' If you lift a rock , you 'll find a snake ? '
Well , if you lift up a snake , you 'll find United for a Sovereign America . "
Days after the protest at Gordon 's home , U.S.A. joined with Minuteman Civil Defense Corps founder and current U.S. Senate hopeful Chris Simcox to give the sheriff a plaque on the lawn of the Arizona Capitol .
Actually , the plaque was given by a California group called the " National Veterans Coalition , " a shill for the far - right Constitution Party , which is allied with the equally conservative John Birch Society .
Still , the majority of those present were from U.S.A. , including Galeener and Barb Heller .
Called the " America First Award , " the engraved wooden plaque reads that it was presented to Arpaio for his " departmental policy against illegal immigration and standing up for America . "
Arpaio appeared in his full sheriff 's uniform , including gun and badge , to accept the plaque .
In December 2008 , Arpaio accepted a similar award from Simcox , after a speech the sheriff gave at Arizona 's American - Italian Club in Phoenix before a crowd of U.S.A. members and Minutemen .
Simcox , a nativist with a conviction for carrying a firearm into a national park , supported Arpaio 's 2008 re-election bid .
Many anticipate that Arpaio will return the favor by endorsing Simcox 's challenge to U.S. Senator John McCain in the 2010 Republican primary .
During his speech at the American - Italian Club , Arpaio noted the presence of Anna Gaines in the crowd , and he offered her his special protection in the fallout from her failed Gordon recall and her trespassing charge .
" If anybody gives you any threats over this situation , call me , " Arpaio informed her before the adoring crowd .
" We 'll take care of it . "
Like Arpaio himself , the MCSO is quick to show favoritism to United for a Sovereign America , and there is evidence that they act in concert , with the MCSO sometimes instructing U.S.A. members on what to do and how to comport themselves .
Acting as a go - between is 52 - year - old U.S.A. member Barb Heller , who reports to the group from contacts inside the Sheriff 's Office .
Heller , to put it mildly , is a Joe Arpaio fanatic , who attends almost every pro-Arpaio demonstration , and once ( wearing a tank top ) painted " Go Joe " on her upper chest for an event — a photo she proudly displays on her MySpace page .
On the first night of the sheriff 's recent anti-immigrant sweep in Avondale , Heller was present with about 30 U.S.A. members and assorted nativists .
Sharing the same sidewalk in front of the sheriff 's command post were about 100 anti-Arpaio protesters .
The MCSO provided no crowd control , though the two sides harangued each other incessantly .
Late in the evening , an MCSO sergeant placed an orange traffic pylon in the middle of the sidewalk and warned the anti-Joe side against passing this new boundary .
When one activist playfully moved the cone , the sergeant returned with MCSO SWAT Captain David Letourneau , who warned that anyone who touched the cone would be arrested .
Asked what the charge would be , Letourneau stated , " Whatever we can think of . "
The entire exchange is captured in a video posted on YouTube and can be seen at www.phoenixnewtimes.com ( view here ) .
Neither Letourneau nor the sergeant advised the nativists not to cross the MCSO 's pylon - marked boundary , only the anti-Arpaio faction .
The MCSO apparently was in contact with Heller via cell phone .
After everyone dispersed , she and another nativist approached the deputies and spoke with them near their command post , a move that surely would have gotten the anti-Arpaio protesters thrown in jail .
At a U.S.A. meeting following the exchange , Heller stated that she had received a phone call about 11:30 p.m. asking that she and the group leave so that the protesters would leave and the deputies could go home .
She also mentioned that her " friend on the squad " called her later that night and informed her that MCSO deputies were called back out to investigate a home invasion in the area .
At another U.S.A. meeting , after the May 2 march , she told the group how the MCSO had complained directly to her about J.T. Ready 's presence in the nativist camp .
Apparently , if Arpaio was unconcerned about the presence of J.T. Ready and the other neo -Nazis on the pro-Joe side , someone in the Arpaio camp realized there was a problem with having Hitler - worshippers supporting the sheriff in front of cameras .
" Phoenix PD calls MCSO ; MCSO calls me , " she informed her fellow U.S.A. members , confessing that she wondered , " Okay , you guys are all cops , and you expect me to do something about this ? "
Heller also discussed how Ready once tried to date her , and she asked other U.S.A. members to endorse a letter to Arpaio telling him that Ready and the other neo -Nazis had nothing to do with U.S.A .
" [ The letter ] was kind of suggested by the contact , " said Heller , not explaining who this mysterious " contact " was .
Heller continued , opining that the letter could give Arpaio some wiggle - room when it comes to rationalizing the neo - Nazis ' presence on the nativist side during the May 2 march .
Later , when discussing President Barack Obama 's visit to ASU this week , Heller mentioned that she promised " the department " that she would make an appearance at ASU to show support for Sheriff Joe while the president was in town .
Heller 's comments suggest that the MCSO is attempting to influence U.S.A. and use the group as a political tool .
Does Arpaio 's fondness for U.S.A. members , and the favoritism shown by the MCSO toward them , violate the professional ethics expected of a law enforcement organization ?
Tom Hammarstrom , executive director of the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board , did not comment on the MCSO directly .
But he pointed out , " Arizona peace officers are taught that they should perform all of their official duties without bias or favoritism . "
Even so , clearly Arpaio and his office see nothing wrong with returning the love of anybody who supports them — even neo -Nazis or groups that accept neo -Nazis as members .
Even at a time when hate crime is on the rise in Phoenix — up 10 percent in 2008 .
To Mark Potok , editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report , the message from Joe Arpaio is chilling .
" When law enforcement officials sidle up to right - wing radicals , " said Potok , " they are bringing contempt on all men and women who stand up for the law in this country .
They are telegraphing a message that the law protects everyone except for certain groups . "
Indeed , in the latest issue of Intelligence Report , Potok notes that , nationally , hate crimes against Hispanics are up 40 percent since 2003 , and the number of hate groups is also on the rise across America , topping 926 last year .
Arpaio 's infatuation with extremists and the National Socialist Movement could not come at a worse time for those who are their targets .
" These are the people who are charged with enforcing the law equally , " Potok told New Times , referring to police officers and sheriff 's deputies .
" It 's critical that our communities be able to trust police officers .
When the police are viewed as the enemy by certain segments of the community , I think ultimately all law and order breaks down . "
It is open for debate whether Joe Arpaio acts in the manner he does because he is a racist or harbors neo -Nazi beliefs .
But one thing is for sure :
He is a politician who is always shilling for votes , always looking for ways to feed his ego by keeping himself in the public eye .
Though the abuses are the same , he seems more a rabid opportunist than an extremist .
Going back to April 2005 , Arpaio was a hero in Arizona 's Hispanic community when his deputies arrested Iraq war veteran Patrick Haab for holding seven Mexicans at gunpoint at a Valley rest stop .
Haab 's vigilantism dovetailed with the Minuteman Project 's launch on Arizona 's border , and Haab quickly became a folk hero among nativists and Minutemen .
The sheriff , however , saw Haab as nothing but a lawbreaker .
" You do n't go around pulling guns on people , " Arpaio said of Haab at the time .
" Being illegal is not a serious crime .
You can't go to jail for being an illegal alien . . .
You can only be deported . "
The sheriff was lambasted by the nativist right , while County Attorney Andrew Thomas received all the glory from that side of the political spectrum for dropping the charges against Haab .
It was then that Arpaio 's political antennae must have tuned in to a way to garner more support for himself and his campaign for an unprecedented fifth term as sheriff in 2008 : go after illegal aliens .
Thomas helped grease the skids for Arpaio with a creative interpretation of Arizona 's human - smuggling law , which allowed felony charges against those smuggled in , as well as the smugglers .
Arpaio sicced his 160 - deputy force of 287( g ) - trained deputies on the undocumented in Maricopa County .
During a series of media - frenzied sweeps , he became the poster boy of the anti-migrant movement , and he was re-elected .
So now that he 's safely into his fifth term , why does he persist in pursuing Mexicans , even if he is the darling of nativists ?
Why does n't he let up , given that under way are a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of his activities and a review by the Department of Homeland Security of his 287 ( g ) agreement ?
The answer seems to be that whatever gets Arpaio 's mug on TV is fine by him .
And being the bogeyman on the illegal immigration issue earns the sheriff time on The Colbert Report , CNN , Larry King , Lou Dobbs . . .
As long as Arpaio senses a chance to score TV time , he 'll continue to double - down on racially profiling Hispanics , anti-immigrant sweeps , and even photo - ops with National Socialists .
CAIRO , April 24 ( Reuters ) - A 33 - year - old Egyptian woman has died of the H5N1 bird flu virus , the 26th human fatality of the disease in Egypt , state news agency MENA said on Friday .
The woman , Saadiya Mohamed Abdel Latief Hamed , died in Kafr El - Sheikh province , according to MENA , the third bird flu fatality in a week in the Arab world 's most populous country .

Advertisement Up to 100 members of Iranian reformist groups have been arrested , accused of orchestrating violence after the disputed presidential election result .
Backers of defeated reformist Mir Hossein Mousavi were rounded up overnight , reports said , including the brother of ex-President Khatami .
There were reports of new small - scale clashes on Sunday ahead of a planned victory rally by President Ahmadinejad .
At a news conference , he vowed Iran would not be bullied by foreign powers .
Describing the election as an " epic moment " , he praised a " very accurate " vote , and said the government had little opportunity to influence procedures .

In quotes : Reaction to result Tension looms after Iran result Iran poll result :
Your comments " Forty million people have taken part in this process .
How can they question it ? " he asked , accusing foreign media of refusing to accept a result they did not like .
Opponents of the election result would have until the end of Sunday to appeal against the result to Iran 's Guardian Council , Mr Ahmadinejad said .
Asked about Iran 's nuclear programme and Tehran 's relations with foreign powers , he said the nuclear debate " belongs to the past " , and said Iran had " embraced " the idea of an international effort to eliminate nuclear weapons .
Tehran tense
While the streets of Tehran were largely calm , the BBC's Jon Leyne , in the city , reports that clashes broke out by the office of Irna , Iran 's official news agency , and also in one suburb .
There were also new reports of a clampdown on independent media .
The offices of the Saudi - funded Arabic TV station al - Arabiya were shut down for " unknown reasons " , the channel said .
Mobile phone service was restored but there were reports that text messaging remained restricted and curbs continued on access to popular internet sites , including the BBC .
Mr Ahmadinejad is expected to attend a huge victory rally later on Sunday .
Jon Leyne
Reporting from Tehran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has always seen himself as more than just a politician .
Sometimes he speaks , and is treated , more like a seer prophesying the death of capitalism and liberal democracy .
With this victory , however secured , he will feel emboldened in this global vision .
At home , many Iranians will fear a clampdown on society and cultural life .
Mr Ahmadinejad knows that many even within the political establishment oppose him , which might increase his tendency towards authoritarianism .
All those young people who were out campaigning against him so recently will be nervous about their future , and even more disillusioned with the Islamic Republic .
Then there is foreign policy and the nuclear issue .
How can US President Barack Obama open negotiations with a president whose legitimacy and human rights record is even deeper under question ?
It is a political earthquake that will shake Iran , and could shake the world .
Details of latest arrests remained sketchy , but reports said those detained were members of pro-reformist political parties which had backed Mr Mousavi during the election campaign .
The reformists - said to include Mohammad Reza Khatami , brother of former President Mohammad Khatami , a former government spokesman and a former deputy speaker of parliament - were reported to have been taken from their homes by security forces overnight .
Iran 's state news agency , Irna , said those arrested were involved in orchestrating Saturday 's protests in Tehran .
Mr Mousavi's whereabouts are unknown but he is thought to remain free .
Angry crowds took to the streets to protest against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election , in spite of Mr Mousavi 's post-election call to avoid violence .
He has refused to accept the election result , calling it a " dangerous charade " and alleging wide - scale irregularities
The BBC 's foreign affairs editor John Simpson , in Tehran , says that while the protests appeared to be an upsurge of anger amongst ordinary people and did not appear to be arranged , it is an instinctive reaction by the authorities to see a hidden hand .
Senior Iranian political figures have offered their backing to Mr Ahmadinejad , among them parliamentary Speaker Ali Larijani and the head of the judiciary .

One of his defeated rivals also congratulated Mr Ahmadinejad .
Mohsen Rezai , who won just 1.7 % of the vote , declared that Mr Ahmadinejad had been elected president by " legal procedures " .
" I will support him in a bid to prevent any delays in the provision of services to the people , " Mr Rezai said in a statement .
The president already has the backing of the country 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who endorsed his election win on Saturday .
Our correspondent says the expressions of support for Mr Ahmadinejad could be an attempt to " lock down " support for the president within Iran 's divided political establishment .
Murky truth
The controversy over Iran 's election flared after high turnout and long queues at polling stations on Friday led Mr Mousavi 's supporters to expect a strong showing from their candidate and a close result .
Turnout was estimated at 85 % , with voting extended in many places .
Streets in Tehran were set alight as protesters burned barricades
But official results on Saturday gave the incumbent , Mr Ahmadinejad , a landslide victory .
His final share of the vote was almost 63 % .
Despite a rapid endorsement of the result from Ayatollah Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , Mr Mousavi issued a statement denouncing the verdict and alleging widespread voting irregularities .
Our correspondent John Simpson , in Tehran , says the truth about this election may never be known .
But many observers in Iran feel that the final result did not reflect the extraordinary numbers of people who turned out to vote , he adds .
World reaction has been muted , with major powers slow to welcome the Iranian result .
The European Union and Canada have voiced concern about allegations of irregularities , while US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said only that Washington hoped the result reflected the " genuine will and desire " of Iranians .
Long - time allies such as Venezuela and Syria , as well as neighbours Iraq and Afghanistan , are among those who have recognised Mr Ahmadinejad as the winner .

I have today 's idea of the day over at the Atlantic Ideas Blog , although it 's not so much an " idea " as it is a horribly vague , nagging concern about the future that for some reason my editors let me get away with .
The basic concern is about what the metaphorical confirmation hearing of the future will look like , when we all have large , embarrassing stockpiles of digital information accumulated about one another .
Will they assure mutual destruction ?
It frightens me just to think about all the stupid emails and blog posts I wrote in the past week , much less the past year !
The problem is that I could n't come up with an actual solution ( hence the lack of an idea ) except to put in a plea for a cultural shift :
We should all become more comfortable with skeletons in the closet .
But any other ideas ?
Or anyone who thinks this just is n't a problem ?
One angle that I do n't really consider in the piece is that a lot of the information dredged up might be damning and useful .
I happen to think , for example , that the fuss over that hoary old " wise Latina " line is fair game .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
How often do you find yourself with a portable computer burning up on your lap with strange noises coming from your fan ?
Thanks to a recent research conducted at Stanford University , bismuth telluride — a new , easy - to - manipulate material with unique electrical properties — could make computer fans a distant memory while allowing for much faster and power - efficient devices .
Move over electronics - here comes spintronics .
Spintronics , topological insulators , and the next electronics revolution
Spintronics is a new , very promising ( although still in its infancy ) technology in which the intrinsic spin of electrons , rather than the value of a voltage like in today 's electronics , is used to store and transport information to be interpreted as either a " 1 " or a " 0 " .
The materials most apt to use in the field of spintronics are what experts call topological insulators , something that scientists have been searching for years and have now finally found in bismuth telluride .
Topological insulators have the property of opposing no resistance at all to an electrical flow next to their surface , thus allowing for minimal heat dissipation .
The scientific community is n't new to zero - resistance materials : a class known as superconductors has been long known to have this property , and a number of compounds are known to belong to this category .
However , while superconductors only work at very low ( usually below - 150 °C ) temperatures , topological insulators like bismuth telluride maintain their properties at room temperatures , making them much more fit to practical applications .
Giving power back to the ... transistors
Fortunately for real - world applications , bismuth telluride is fairly simple to grow and work with , and it's also easy to fabricate and manipulate its electrical properties with our current semiconductor technology .
Because topological insulators like bismuth telluride do n't disperse heat at all , this means that no energy is dissipated and almost all of the transmitted power is driven from one end to the other with no losses , allowing for much more power - efficient designs .
Because in today 's electronics power and speed are very strongly dependent on each other , such designs will bring to higher processing speeds that will be achievable in quite a straightforward way .
When applied to the spintronics paradigm , it could also vastly improve memory density in hard drives , as well as improving speed for some specific types of memory ( particularly those known as MRAMs , or Magnetic RAMs ) .
Topological insulators are n't the right solution to obtain highly efficient power lines , as their unique properties vanish as the currents they carry grow over a specific threshold .
Computer fans , on the other hand , may not have long to live .

I was listening to the Thom Hartmann show the other day , and Thom was interviewing an author that caught my attention .
Little wonder since the topic was " Is there a secret society of Christian crazies and is Mark Sanford a member ? " .
That author was Jeff Sharlet and after listening to to Hartmann interview , I wondered if anyone in the main stream media would put him on the air .
Of course , Rachel Maddow , who seems to be getting all of the best guests lately -- or at least when the " news " has n't been canceled all week for Michael Jackson 's death and she mysteriously ends up taking vacation the same week -- ended up being the first one to have him on .
Sharlet is the author of The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power .
Scary , scary stuff for any of us that do n't like the idea of our government being run by creepy , extremist , right wing Christain fundamentalists .
Sharlet also wrote a piece for Rolling Stone on Sam Brownback which is well worth the read back in 2006 titled God 's Senator : Who would Jesus vote for ?
Meet Sam Brownback .
Maddow :
As part of the research for the book , Jeff lived among the family and saw many of its actions first hand . [...]
What is C - Street ?
I know it 's a house on C Street in Washington .
How is it part of the family ?
Sharlet :
Well , the C - Street house is actually a former convent and now it 's registered as a church and it's run by The Family and used by them to provide housing for six to eight congressmen at any given time , and to provide spiritual counseling for these congressmen .
Which all sounds fine so far , but what makes it a little bit different than other Christian conservative organizations , two things , you said that it 's secretive .
Indeed the leader of the group describes , he says , the more invisible you can make your organization , the more influence it will have .
And the other things is the nature of the influence they want to have .
I got to sit in on one of these spiritual counseling sessions between the leader of the family and Congressman Todd Tiahrt when I visited the C - Street House , I actually met Sen.
Ensign there .
As the leader of The Family was counseling Congressman Tiahrt , he had this very standard issue , bill of issues related to the Christian right .
He said you 've got to have a bigger vision of what we 're talking about here .
He called it Jesus plus nothing .
He said it 's sort of a totalitarian idea of Christianity and he gave as examples men who he believed understood the way power should be wielded .
He actually gave as examples , Hitler , Pol Pot , Osama bin Laden and Lenin .
Maddow : Wow .
When I read your book , The Family , when it first came out in hardback , my notes on um , I write notes in the flyleaf about what I was thinking about .
And my notes about it , I went back and looked , were that it was essentially to promote , it saw its role as promoting American power , world wide , unfettered capitalism with no unions , no programs to help poor people , all with this idea that godly powerful rich men should get as many resources as possible personally , and they should just privately help everyone else .
That is the impression that I was left with .
Was I close ?
Sharlet :
That 's dead on the money .
The family began , it 's the oldest Christian conservative organization in Washington and it goes back seventy years .
And the founder believed that god gave him a new revelation saying that Christianity had gotten it wrong for two thousand years and that what most people think of as Christianity , as being about , you know , helping the weak and the poor and the meek and the down and out , he believes god came to him one night in April in 1935 and said what Christianity should really be about is building more power for the already powerful .
And that these powerful men who were chosen by god can then if they want to dispense blessings to the rest of us , through a kind of trickle - down fundamentalism .
Maddow :
Well do you see a connection between that large sort of power theology and the fact that neither John Ensign or Mark Sanford for that matter , who 's also affiliated with the group , are n't quitting despite these scandals .
Is there something about this type of theology that tells these guys , hey do n't worry about the affair , you know , big picture , you 're good , stay where you are , it 's important for you to stay in power ?
Sharlet : Yeah , no , I think actually Gov. Sanford made it very clear when he cited King David as an example of the reason why he was n't going to be resigning office and that struck a bell with me because I , the King David story , the core teaching of The Family , when I first heard it , I was living with The Family .
One of the leaders of The Family was explaining why King David was important and it's not because he was a good man .
It 's because he was a bad man .
You know , he seduced another man 's wife , he actually had the husband murdered and he once explained why this was a model and he said it to one of the men in the group .
He said , suppose I heard you raped three little girls .
What would I think of you ?
And this guy , being a human being says , you would think I was a monster .
Well , the leader of The Family says no , not at all because you 're chosen .
You 're chosen by god for leadership , and so the normal rules do n't apply .
Maddow : When Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina talked about his relationship to this group , he 's also lived at the C - Street House , he described the group to the AP years ago , six years ago by saying " We do have a bible study ... somebody'll share a verse or a thought , but mostly it 's more of an accountability group to talk about things that are going on in our lives , and how we 're dealing with them " .
And you 've written that members of The Family give each other veto power over their lives , which , with these two scandals , I mean looking at the John Ensign scandal , how does a group like that not veto putting the mistress ' kids on the Republican party payroll ?
How does that not get outed by this group ?
Sharlet :
Well , because the responsibility of the other men in your accountability group , and I would say by the way , you do n't have accountability behind closed doors , that 's the opposite of accountability , what these other men are doing is they 're saying , alright , we 're going to look out for you .
Sort of self interest by proxy and what they 're calling accountability is a man might bring to the group for instance that he is having an affair with another woman , or the fact that he is perhaps corrupt in some way and so on , and these guys are going to deal with it internally .
Maddow : Wow .
Sharlet : Very much behind closed doors , and we as a group actually once said , what we do is , to use this pretentious Latin phrase , beyond the din of the vox populi .
What it means is beyond the voice of the people .
Maddow : Jeff Sharlet is an editor at Harper 's Magazine .
He 's also the author of the book The Family , and if you think this has incredible implications for domestic politics and hypocrisy and affairs , wait till you read about third world dictators and how these guys empower them .
UPDATE : Fester at Newshoggers has more on the ridiculously low rent being charged at the facility : C Street Group question .
NASA ’s next - generation
Ares rockets use technology derived from the space shuttle ’s solid rocket boosters ( Illustration : NASA / MSFC )
NASA ’s decision to engineer its replacement for the space shuttle using imperial measurement units rather than metric could derail efforts to develop a globalised civilian space industry , says a leading light in the nascent commercial spaceflight sector .
“ We in the private sector are doing everything possible to create a global market with as much commonality and interoperability as possible , ” says Mike Gold of the US firm Bigelow Aerospace , which hopes to fly commercial space stations in orbit .
“ But NASA still ca n’t make the jump to metric . ”
Gold chairs a Federal Aviation Administration working group on commercial spaceflight that is trying to change strict State Department rules affecting civilian spaceflight systems .
He sees NASA ’s decision to use imperial units as the latest blow to hit the sector .
‘ Clear advantages ’
Carol Hockert , head of the weights and measures division at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Maryland , sees his point .
“ There are clear advantages to using metric units in terms of global commerce and international research collaborations .
And space exploration certainly falls into a category that could benefit , ” she told New Scientist .
Advertisement
At issue is NASA ’s Constellation Program , which is intended to replace the space shuttle .
It will use new Ares rockets and a crew capsule called Orion to launch astronauts to the International Space Station ( ISS ) or the moon .
Civilian operators hope to one day pay to use Orion capsules to reach their orbiting structures , or have craft of their own dock with the capsules .
So the last thing they want is a measurement units mix - up between their own and NASA ’s equipment .
Shuttle technology
The sticking point is that Ares is a shuttle - derived design – it uses solid rocket boosters whose dimensions and technology are based on those currently strapped to either side of the shuttle ’s giant liquid fuel tank .
And the shuttle ’s 30 - year - old specifications , design drawings and software are rooted in pounds and feet rather than newtons and metres .
“ The Shuttle and US segments of the ISS were built using the English system of measurements , ” says NASA spokesman Grey Hautaluoma .
“ And much of the Ares launch vehicle and Kennedy Space Center ground systems are legacy hardware built in the English system , too . ”
US law
NASA recently calculated that converting the relevant drawings , software and documentation to the “ International System ” of units ( SI ) would cost a total of $ 370 million – almost half the cost of a 2009 shuttle launch , which costs a total of $ 759 million .
“ We found the cost of converting to SI would exceed what we can afford , ” says Hautaluoma .
“ Given these budget constraints and the need for consistent units throughout the Constellation Program lifecycle to minimise risks , and to contribute to mission success , we ’re revising the previous management directive to a primarily English - units - based program , ” he says .
That previous directive stems from 2004 when , under continuing pressure from its independent inspector general , NASA agreed to conform with US legislation enacted in 1988 that ordered all government departments to move towards the exclusive use of SI units .
‘ Problematic mistakes ’
In June 2006 , when NASA ’s progress on that looked sluggish , NASA spokesman David Steitz offered New Scientist this update : “ NASA is in the process of converting to SI units .
However , immediate conversion of systems that are already designed in English units can prove risky and inefficient .
The US space program … will need time to evolve into SI units . ”
Gold sees the latest announcement as significant backtracking : “ The space program is supposed to be about bridging barriers and bringing humanity closer together .
Failing to adopt a globally accepted uniform system of measurement seems to fly in the face of that . ”
“ Operating in space while using two different systems of measurement certainly opens the door for problematic mistakes and miscommunications , ” he adds .
Lost probe
Indeed , NASA lost an unmanned mission owing to a mix - up between metric and imperial units .
In September 1999 , its $ 125 million Mars Climate Orbiter probe was destroyed because its attitude - control system used imperial units but its navigation software used metric units .
As a result , it was 100 kilometres too close to Mars when it tried to enter orbit around the planet .
Units have also played a role in other spacecraft problems .
In 2006 , the guidance system on NASA ’s DART spacecraft went awry and caused it to ram into a military satellite it was merely meant to dock with .
Before DART ’s launch , NASA found that GPS data on its position was mistakenly being read by its computer in feet .
Ironically , correcting this to metres in a simulator resulted in an incorrect change to another parameter that was programmed into the spacecraft – a problem that led to the collision .
Moot point ?
“ Over the past couple of years , we have worked extensively with NASA while they considered adopting the metric system , ” says NIST ’s Hockert .
“ We stand ready to continue to assist them . ”
“ Using the metric system is certainly the right step in the long - term , ” says Eric Anderson of Space Adventures , a US firm that arranges trips for space tourists .
However , he says he understands NASA ’s difficulty in the face of limited budgets .
The argument may be moot , however .
Constellation , which was initiated by the Bush administration , may yet be cancelled .
Its rationale is currently under examination by an independent commission appointed by the incoming Obama team .
“ If the program is cancelled , ‘ zero ’ is the same in English and metric , ” notes Gold .
Here 's a video of a woman with alien hand syndrome from 2006 .
From Mind Hacks :
As it turns out , the patient says she generally knows it is hers , but when it is draped across her body in a certain position and making involuntary movements she can think it is someone else 's limb .
In other words , she seems to have fleeting somatoparaphrenia .
The video then shows the hand moving of its own accord and the patient having to use the other hand to keep it out of trouble .
Despite looking like she 's in pretty bad shape , frankenerin later posted a wonderful follow - up video where she is back on her feet and feeling fine , although discusses how she 's had to adjust her career aspirations owing to the longer - term effects of the brain injury .
Here 's why this is a good thing :
If you move the people who are re-downloading an app ( which means they already tried it , decided it was n't worth keeping , then changed their minds ) from the phone to their computer , then that opens up a significant bit of bandwidth over time .
That means your call goes through , or your phone can get a better fix on you if you need help or have to find something nearby .
It means that there are less people soaking up data because they 're being fickle , driving ten under the limit with their blinker on so to speak .
Here 's why this is a bad thing :
I do n't like having a 5 page dashboard on my phone .
I can barely handle 3 .
That means I delete things often from the phone , but keep them at home on the computer .
This also means from time to time I reach for an app that I forgot that I deleted and because I 'm out in the field , need to redownload it right on the phone .
I think it 's convenient , but agree that it 's wasteful .
I 'm bummed that they 're taking this feature away , but I guess it will learn me to depend less on frivolous apps and keep the ones that I really use the most on the phone .

The scrypt key derivation function
One of the commonly requested features for Tarsnap is passphrase - protected key files .
I started working on this in February , but soon discovered that the existing methods for passphrased - encrypted files were rather lacking -- at least based on my security guideline for tarsnap , i.e. , " what if the NSA tried to attack this ? " .
I am speaking today at BSDCan '09 about my work on the scrypt key derivation function .
In the context of hardware brute - force attacks , scrypt is thousands of times more secure than existing " best practice " solutions such as bcrypt and PBKDF2 ; in fact , under reasonable assumptions it is provably as strong as possible .
In addition to the key derivation function itself , I have released a simple file encryption utility which is approximately 100 billion times more secure than openssl enc , due to OpenSSL using MD5 as a key derivation function .
The code I have written -- key derivation function and file encryption utility -- are now available from the scrypt page on the tarsnap web site , along with the 16 - page paper I wrote defining and proving security properties of scrypt , and my conference slides .
So far I have only built the scrypt code on FreeBSD ; but I expect to port the code to other operating systems soon .
Within a few weeks I expect to release a new version of the tarsnap client which uses scrypt to -- finally -- add support for password - protected key files .
In his famous " what you need to know about secure password schemes " blog post of September 2007 , Thomas Ptacek concluded by saying that the correct choice of key derivation functions is bcrypt .
He was right ; but from today onwards , the correct choice is scrypt .

The idea originally comes from this blog post
The attack on the race brought cyclists to a standstill / Pic : Richard Thomas Police are investigating after carpet tacks were spread across roads bringing a major cycle race to a halt .
More than 3,500 people were taking part in the Etape Caledonia , over 81 miles around Pitlochry in Perthshire .
It is the only cycle event in Britain where all the roads travelled on are closed - which has angered some locals .
Tacks were strewn on a section of the race , bursting hundreds of tyres .
Police said it was a reckless act and it was fortunate no - one was hurt .
Cyclists ended up with damaged tyres and the event had to be stopped but organisers cleared the road and the race was completed .
The winner Veli-Matti Raikkonen - who is originally from Finland and is a member of Aberdeen 's Granite City racing team - was one of those who suffered a puncture after riding over the tacks .
It is really not acceptable that this kind of behaviour is allowed to happen
Etape Caledonia spokeswoman
A spokeswoman for the race said organisers were now working with Tayside Police to discover what had happened .
She said : " The obstruction is a safety matter and it is one the organisers take very seriously . "
The lead group of riders suffered punctures on a section of road at Innerhadden and Schiehallion - about 43 miles into the course - and hundreds of other cyclists suffered punctures as they approached the area .
The spokeswoman added : " It is really not acceptable that this kind of behaviour is allowed to happen .
" The organisers identified the area , stopped the cyclists who were coming up to it to minimise the number who were affected , and they also dealt with the punctures very , very quickly . "
A spokesman for Tayside Police said : " It was fortunate no - one was injured as a result of this irresponsible behaviour .
Uniformed and detective officers are carrying out inquiries in the area and are following a positive line of inquiry . "
' Disgusting act '
The event has been running for several years and has developed into the Perthshire Cycling Festival , but has brought protests over the disruption caused by the three - hour Etape Caledonia .
Some campaigners are angry because they believe their freedom of movement is being restricted , visitors may be put off coming to the area , affecting tourism and business , and locals could be prevented from getting to church .
Peter Hounam , from the Anti Closed Road Event ( Acre ) group , said : " Acre is against the closure of roads for cycle events in our area , we do not object to cyclists or people taking part in events .
Cyclists were left angry and frustrated by the events / Pic : Allen Glen " We totally deplore anyone taking direct action and we want people to have peaceful protests .
" We do n't condone what has happened , but it shows there is real frustration from people who feel the authorities are not listening to them . "
He said the event discouraged tourists because of the road closures and that it did not bring the kind of sustainable tourism needed in Perthshire , as many of the participants only stayed overnight .
But Kathy James , who runs a bed and breakfast in Aberfeldy , said the race brings millions of pounds to the area .
She told BBC Scotland : " What they 've done is they 've spread , from Rannoch down to us , tiny , tiny carpet tacks - I 've got one - they 've just spread the road with them .
" There 's a chap outside who came off his bike , there 's been a lot of people coming off their bikes and basically they had to stop the race further up .
" This area relies on tourism , it disgusts me as a local , I just think there 's no logic behind it . "
Biggest event Finance Secretary and North Tayside MSP John Swinney also expressed disgust over the incident .
He added : " This is a highly dangerous act which could have brought serious injury to people on the event . "
Alun Pugh , a former member of the Welsh Assembly , travelled to Scotland for the race .
He said : " It 's just really , really sad because this is the biggest cycling event for amateur mass participation cyclists in the whole of the UK .
" It very , very disappointing indeed that a small number of people have chosen to disrupt and wreck it . "
The event raises cash for Macmillan Cancer Support and the charity estimated it would raise £ 225,000 this year to help fund its work .

Editors ' note :
The review and ratings have been updated since the original publish date to reflect changed features and bug fixes from various software updates and also includes final battery results .
We have n't seen so much buzz over a phone since the iPhone , but for the past six months , all eyes have been on the Palm Pre .
Introduced at CES 2009 , the Palm Pre quickly became the most anticipated phone of the year , not only for what it meant for Palm and Sprint - - two companies struggling behind their competitors -- but also for what the device promised .
The multitasking features , the notification system , a physical keyboard , multitouch screen -- all of these factors combined made it , in our opinion , the most legitimate rival to the iPhone yet .
Now , here we are , six months later and the Palm Pre is finally ready for release .
We 've spent the past few days poring over every detail of the device ( without Palm's or Sprint 's supervision ) and we 're prepared to answer the all - important question : does it live up to all the hype ?
Well , we 'd say our thoughts on the Palm Pre echo those we had for the T - Mobile G1 .
There are some hardware and performance issues and we 're concerned about a few missing features , but we walked away impressed with the Palm WebOS .
The tiny QWERTY keyboard is n't going to draw any praise , nor is the lack of an expansion slot .
We 're also disappointed that the Pre lacks some basic functions , such as video recording and voice dialing , though Palm has said these features can be added later through an over - the - air update .
Battery life is also a concern , as the smartphone only lasted about a day on a single charge , which , in all fairness , is about the same as the iPhone .
All that said , the Pre 's " Deck of Cards " multitasking functionality and notification system are what make it special and they are areas where the Pre beats the iPhone or any smartphone on the market right now .
In addition , personal - information management is completely changed ( in a good way ) with the Synergy feature .
While the Pre finally gives Sprint customers something to be excited about , it wo n't please everyone .
Early adopters , gadget lovers , and consumers who need or crave more functionality from their cell phone will be well - served by the Pre , though there is a little bit of a learning curve to the device .
Also , because of the battery life and that slight bit of sluggishness , we 'd do n't think it 's the best device for business users or road warriors .
Also , despite some of the monthly savings of Sprint 's data plans , we do n't expect that many customers will switch to Sprint just to get the Pre , especially in light of the news Verizon and AT&T will eventually get their own models and a crop of hot , new phones on the way .
Starting from the ground up , Palm has really made a solid and smart platform and one that does n't just match the capabilities of its competitors but offers something more in its multitasking and personal information management capabilities .
Palm might not have completely knocked it out of the park with the Palm Pre , but at least it 's back in the game , and we look forward to more WebOS devices the future .
The Palm Pre is available starting June 6 , for $ 199.99 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate and with a two - year contract on Sprint 's Everything Data plan or Business Essentials with Messaging and Data plan .
In addition to Sprint stores , the Pre will be sold at Best Buy , RadioShack , and some Wal - Mart Stores .
Design
The Palm Pre 's design is unlike that of any smartphone we 've seen to date , but if we had to give a point of comparison , we 'd say it somewhat resembles the HTC Touch .
It 's a bit like a pebble , with its smooth , black , lacquered finish and rounded edges , and , like the iPhone , Palm keeps it simple by keeping external controls to a minimum .
The face of the device only has one control : a center button that will take you back to the Deck of Card view .
The center key is a bit deceiving in that it looks similar to a trackball navigator , so there were times where , out of habit , we would try to navigate a page by trying to scroll up and down using the center button , but you can only press it like a key .
On top of the unit , there 's a power button , a silent ringer switch , and a 3.5 - millimeter headphone jack , which we 're always happy to see .
The left side features a volume rocker , while the Micro - USB port is on the right .
Finally , on back , you 'll find the camera , flash , speaker , and removable battery .
Palm Pre is shown sandwiched between the Google Ion and the Apple iPhone 3G .
In its closed state , the Pre measures 3.9 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick and weighs 4.76 ounces .
It fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is certainly more pocket - friendly than the iPhone .
Some have worried about the durability of the phone , since it 's made of plastic .
We did n't throw it off a building or anything , but we thought it felt quite solid , not cheap or toylike .
The only negative things we'd note are that the phone is a smudge / fingerprint magnet and the slider design can feel a bit rickety at times .
However , the sliding mechanism is smooth , and the screen clicks securely into place when pushed up .
There 's a bit of a curve to the phone in its open state , and we preferred keeping it that way when talking on the phone , since it felt more comfortable against our cheek .
Touch screen
We have to say the Pre 's display is one of the main highlights of the phone .
It measures 3.1 inches diagonally , so it 's smaller than the iPhone 's and some other touch - screen devices , such as the T - Mobile G1 and the Samsung Omnia , but what it lacks in size , the Pre makes up for in quality .
The 24 - bit color HVGA display is vibrant and sharp with its 320x480 - pixel resolution .
Images , text , and Web pages all looked amazing .
We 'd say it 's on par with , if not just slightly crisper looking than , the iPhone 's screen .
Under the Preferences menu , there are settings to adjust the screen 's brightness and backlight time .
You can also customize the phone with preinstalled wallpaper , or use your own images and set them as your background .
The Pre 's vibrant touch screen is one of the highlights of the smartphone .
The Pre 's display has a built - in accelerometer so the screen orientation will automatically change from portrait to landscape mode when viewing photos , videos , and Web pages .
The accelerometer is fast and changes pages without any lag .
There 's also a proximity sensor , which will automatically turn off the display when you lift the smartphone to your ear for a phone call .
The capacitive ( meaning it responds to the touch of a finger ) touch screen is pretty responsive .
There 's no haptic feedback , but white rings will appear around an icon or menu item to let you know that the screen has registered your touch .
To scroll through lists , you can drag your finger along the screen or give it a quick flick to get through longer lists .
The onscreen dial pad is simple , with large buttons , and it includes shortcuts to voice mail and your call log .
Of course , you can also just use the Universal Search function and start typing a contact 's name to get quicker results .
The Pre 's screen is multitouch , which is a fairly big deal since the iPhone has long stood in a class of its own with this functionality -- but not anymore .
Like the iPhone , the Pre lets you zoom in and out on pages by pinching your fingers apart or close together ; double - tapping the screen will also achieve the same task .
In addition , swiping left to right on an item , such as an e-mail or call log number , will give you the option to delete it .
To copy , cut , and paste , just tap on the screen to place the cursor at the start of what you want to copy / cut , press the orange key on the keyboard , and drag your finger across the desired text .
You can do this anywhere on the screen , by the way ; it does n't have to be right over the words .
Once you 've selected everything , tap the upper - left corner of the screen to bring up the drop - down menu with your copy , cut , and paste options .
Below the screen , there 's a gesture area where you can perform a couple of tasks , which we outline in the section below .
Two small LEDs and the center button will illuminate white to indicate that it has registered your command .
User interface and navigation
We 'll say it outright : the Palm Pre is n't the most intuitive device to use , at least at first .
When you fire up the smartphone for the first time , there 's a brief animated tutorial to familiarize you with the various gestures , such as swiping right to left in the gesture area to return to the previous page .
The gestures are also illustrated in the quick start guide , but even so , it takes some time to learn all the various commands .
The Home screen looks easy enough to understand , with a simple tray along the bottom that includes shortcuts to the onscreen dialer , contacts , e-mail , calendar , and the main menu ( aka Launcher ) .
Pressing the Launcher icon will bring you to all your applications and settings .
It consists of three panels that you can swipe from left to right ( and vice versa ) , and each panel is dedicated to a more general category .
For example , the first panel includes all the core functions , such as messaging , Web , multimedia , Google Maps , task list , and so forth ; the second panel is focused on applications and Sprint services ; and the third panel features the phone 's various settings and options .
The user interface , in general , is very sleek and fresh , and provided smooth transitions .
Also , it 's more inviting and engaging than Google Android , which will make it more appealing to consumers .
To launch a program , you simply tap an icon , and once you 're in an application , you can tap the upper - left corner of the screen to open any relevant menus for that particular app .
Of course , the beauty of the Palm Pre is the multitasking capabilities , so you can simply launch another program without having to exit off the current one .
To do this , drag your finger from the gesture area up to the screen and you 'll see the home screen tray appear in a cool little wave ; from there , you can move your finger to one of the dedicated shortcuts or open the Launcher for a full list .
If you want to return to any running apps , a press of the center button will bring you to your Deck of Cards view where you can simply select the card you want .
If you 're wondering why the feature is called Deck of Cards , it 's because each application is presented in a card window and you can then shuffle through the open cards .
You can drag and drop cards ( or rearrange the order of apps in the Launcher ) by pressing and holding the item until you see a halo around the card and then you 're free to move it , but it 's not like with the T - Mobile G1 , where you can drag and drop icons onto the main home screen .
When you 're done , you can flick the card upward and that will close out the program .
As you can see , there 's a lot to learn , but after a couple of hours , we felt more comfortable and familiar with the gestures .
Obviously , with more use , these commands will become even easier and soon you wo n't even have to think about it , but when comparing the out - of - the - box experience of the Pre with that of the iPhone , the iPhone definitely wins for its ease of use .
That said , we give props to Palm for its connection manager .
By simply touching the upper right - hand corner of the screen , you get instant access to the Pre 's connection settings -- Wi -Fi , Bluetooth , Airplane mode -- instead of having to go through several menus as on the iPhone .
Keyboard
The lack of a physical keyboard was a big reason why some people chose not to buy the iPhone .
There will be those who argue that the iPhone 's onscreen keyboard is fine and just needs some getting used to , which is fair enough .
However , there are also some who desire physical keys and do n't want to give them up ( present company included ) , so it was like a dream when the Palm Pre was announced at CES 2009 with its full QWERTY keyboard .
Fast - forward to now , where we actually have the device in hand and we have to say , we 're a bit disappointed .
Similar to the Palm Centro and Palm Treo Pro , the jellylike buttons are quite small and there 's very little spacing between them .
In addition , the top row of keys runs right up against the edge of the open cover , so it 's easy to bump into it when typing .
The Palm Pre 's keyboard is less than ideal , with its small buttons and cramped layout .
I was still able to type faster using the Pre 's keyboard than the iPhone 's , but I also have small hands so it was easier for me to punch the keys .
However , I can definitely see people with larger thumbs having problems and , unfortunately , there 's no onscreen keyboard option at this point .
I took a quick poll of some co-workers and all agreed that the keyboard was small ; several called it a deal breaker , but a majority said they could get used to it after a while .
Do you trust Google ?
If you use its multitude of online services on a daily basis you might , but is that assumption wise ?
For some , Google is a wonderful company with a broad selection of useful online tools that make life easier , but for others Google is a looming , unregulated monster just waiting for the moment to drop the ‘ do n't ' from the company 's unofficial motto , " Do n't be evil . "
Artwork : Chip Taylor Recently , at the Aspen Ideas Festival , WNYC talk show host Brian Lehrer asked Google CEO Eric Schmidt if Google 's constantly growing importance to users in the United States and around the world meant that Google needed to be regulated as a utility by the Federal Government .
The surprise was n't in Schmidt 's response ( which was " no " ) , but the fact that everyone in the room laughed at Lehrer 's suggestion .
But is it that funny ?
Google tracks your online behavior to deliver relevant advertising ; the company inadvertently controls a large amount of what you see online through its search results ; it 's amassing the greatest library since Alexandria ; it has a huge share of the online video market ; and offers a wide range of services that bring more and more of your daily online habits into its online sphere .
Heck , Google has even flirted with offline advertising .
But Google Wants to Do Even More .
Earlier this week , Google announced it 's jumping off its own servers and onto your desktop with its own operating system , Chrome OS .
The move has prompted sharp reaction from privacy advocates , including the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Center for Digital Democracy , the Center for Democracy and Technology , and the American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research .
Google has often been accused of poor privacy standards , and has been criticized over privacy many times .
The search giant 's entry into a market largely dominated by Windows has received applause for bringing more competition to the OS market , but a successful operating system could put even more information about your computing behavior into the hands of one company .
How serious could Google 's online domination get ?
You tell me .
Google Has Your Day - to - Day Habits
Many people have a lot of information just sitting there on Google 's servers including personal appointments ( Calendar ) , correspondence ( Gmail ) , work and personal documents ( Google Docs ) and online reading habits ( Google Reader ) .
In 2007 , PC World published this startling chart showing the privacy risks for your information .
The basic problem was that all your information is just sitting there on Google 's servers unencrypted , raising the risk of data loss , theft , or unauthorized access .
Never mind if a Google employee tries to get that information , but what if the government subpoenas Google ?
The company says it has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to satisfy an " enforceable governmental request " among other situations .
Sure , the government could go after you for that same information stored on your own computer , but the feds could also get it from Google without you ever knowing , according to PC World 's article " Is Google Too Big ? "
Google Has Your Location
Several
Go ogle services can let you share with the world , and with Google 's servers , where you 're located right now .
Are these handy tools ?
You bet .
Nevertheless , you 're letting a big corporation track where you are at any given moment .
My Location is a Google Maps tool available for mobile and now for desktop customers .
This service shows where you are with a little blue dot on Google Maps , which can give you a sense of where you are in unfamiliar territory or provide you with directions to your destination .
Google says it does n't record your location in any way with My Location ; however , you still have to send your location information to Google 's servers to use the tool .
Latitude is a similar opt - in service to My Location , except it allows you to share locations between friends based on your mobile phone or desktop location .
The service has a lot of granular controls to restrict information sharing to specific friends , which makes this a very flexible service .
But unless you have told Google not to track you , the company has your most recent location on its servers .
Did you know that Google also ties information about your phone 's battery life -- as well as other unspecified data -- to your Google account when you use Latitude ?
Google probably wants battery life information so it can tweak the Latitude program , but why is it tying that information to your personal Google account , and what is this " other information " Google 's collecting about your phone ?
Google 's Got Your Voice
According to its privacy page on Google 's Mobile Privacy page , the company says , " for products and services with voice recognition capabilities , we collect and store a copy of the voice commands you make to the product or service . "
No doubt Google does this to improve its voice recognition services , but still : Google has a copy of your voice on file .
Google Voice , the company 's telephony service , also records your messages and your voicemail for you .
That 's a great service , and it's great that the company will transcribe your voicemail for you to deliver it via email of SMS .
It should be noted that all of the above services are opt - in , but if you so choose Google can have your voice , your personal voicemail messages , and a transcription of those messages on its servers .
Google 's Censoring You ( in China )
A controversial issue surrounding Google , and other information gatekeepers , like Yahoo ! and Bing , is how they are behaving in China .
All of these search engines routinely block access to particular subjects , like Tiananmen Square , at the request of the Chinese government .
Of course , if a Chinese citizen can access Google.com they would have the unfettered access they can't enjoy on Google.cn .
The typical argument in favor of Google bowing to Chinese demands is that Google needs to comply in order to do business in the largest emerging market on the planet .
But does n't that logic suggest Google could turn around and do the same thing at the request of any government ?
Google Wants Your Desktop with Chrome OS
No one outside of Google has even seen Chrome OS yet , but it 's already stirring concern with privacy advocates .
That 's because Google and its attitude toward privacy has been called into question many times .
When Google introduced its Chrome Web browser , the company was criticized for recording your keystrokes in Chrome 's search / address bar called the Omnibox , and that was before you even hit the enter key .
Sure you could turn this setting off , but should n't it have been an opt - in function to begin with ?
Will Chrome OS be tracking your on - and offline behavior by default as well ?
Google Privacy Policies Today
Google does say that your privacy is important to the company , and it has made some steps in this area .
Google says it keeps only 18 months of search data , and that data is completely anonymous .
The company is also careful to point to its privacy policy for every single Google product on its Web pages .
But it 's important to note that many of Google 's privacy measures were introduced only after public outcry , including a request to make links to its privacy policy more visible .
In fact , you could argue that Google is fundamentally reluctant to respect privacy in preference of innovation .
According to a blog post entitled " Another step to protect user privacy , " the company said , " Although [ anonymizing search server logs ] was good for privacy , it was a difficult decision because the routine server log data we collect has always been a critical ingredient of innovation . "
That 's a fair argument , since a lot can be learned from how people behave on the Web .
If you combine a large body of data about user behavior with Google 's massive computing power , you can see how Google could get an excellent sense of how to shape its products to meet user needs .
But then again , companies were innovating with focus groups and opt - in monitoring programs for decades and they fared pretty well .
Personally , I 'd prefer that Google and other online companies stopped tracking my cyber - behavior even if that did mean we 'd see less innovation from these companies .
Google has a lot of handy services , but as the company gains more and more information from its users , those users may raise even more questions about how big Google should be allowed to get , and whether the government needs to step in and strictly regulate how Google 's overwhelming amount of information is used .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I 've got to plug next week 's schedule into my Google Calendar , get caught up with my Gmail , catch up on my blog reading with Google Reader and then watch a few of my favorite videos on YouTube .

Calls for probe intensify amid revelations that Cheney ordered concealment of a covert spy program .

More Dems call for investigating CIA
Calls for an investigation into the Central Intelligence Agency intensified this weekend amid revelations that former Vice President Dick Cheney ordered the concealment of a covert agency spy program from Congress .
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) said that the Senate Intelligence Committee should “ absolutely ” investigate the program .

" The executive branch of government should not create programs like these programs and keep Congress in the dark , " Durbin said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” .
" To have a massive program that was concealed from the leaders in Congress is not only inappropriate , it could be illegal . "
In an article posted to its website on Saturday , the New York Times reported that CIA Director Leon Panetta notified House and Senate intelligence committee members that Cheney ordered the concealment of a surveillance program from Congress .
The article , which sourced the claim to " two people with direct knowledge of the matter , " follows on the heels of reports this week that Panetta had told House intelligence committee members that the CIA had misled Congress for eight years about the program .
Lawmakers have declined to offer any details about the covert program , citing the sensitivity of intelligence information .
Intelligence officials have told POLITICO that the program was " on-again , off - again over the years , " and that it " never went fully operational . "
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said that Congress should have been told about the classified program .
" I think you weaken your case when you go outside the law , " Feinstein said on " Fox News Sunday . "
" That 's something that should never happen again . "
Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill. ) , who chairs the House Intelligence Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee , said in an interview with POLITICO that the New York Times report only reinforced the need for the launch of formal investigation into the CIA ’s practices .
“ What it does is really propel a prompt investigation , ” Schakowsky said .
“ An explicit decision was made at the highest levels not to report this program . ”
But Republicans insist there is no need to rush into an investigation into the CIA - and are accusing Democrats of trying to make political hay out of the revelations .
" What if it 's a top secret program ? ” Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl asked on “ This Week . ”
“ Let 's do n't jump to conclusions is what I 'm saying . "
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , meanwhile , said Democrats were turning the CIA into a “ whipping child . ”
" That is n't a reason to disassemble the CIA and make them a whipping child in the middle of public opinion , which basically undermines the whole agency , " Gregg said on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
" This is a national attempt by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to basically undermine efforts to collect intelligence . "
But Democrats are making the case that the New York Times report offers vindication for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , who has come under fire from critics after asserting earlier this year that the CIA had misled her on its use of controversial water - boarding practices .
“ It certainly confirms her characterization of the level of openness the intelligence community and the CIA have given to Congress , ” Schakowsky told POLITICO .
Asked if Panetta 's charge – which does not seem to directly relate to the question of what the CIA Pelosi about waterboarding – offered validation to the Speaker 's complaint of being misled by the agency , Schakowsky responded : “ Absolutely . ”
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano declined to comment on the New York Times report , saying , “ It ’s not agency practice to discuss what may or may not have been said in a classified briefing . "
“ When a C.I.A. unit brought this matter to Director Panetta ’s attention , it was with the recommendation that it be shared appropriately with Congress .
That was also his view , and he took swift , decisive action to put it into effect , ” Gimigliano said .

Steele to GOP : ' Fight ' ABC
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele urged supporters Thursday to “ fight ” ABC News over the network ’s planned televised town hall on health care that is set to air directly from the White House .
“ It seems that the mainstream media has finally decided to dispense with the pointless denials of favorable coverage of the Obama administration .
Now one network , ABC News , has actually turned its entire programming over to President Obama and his big - government agenda , ” Steele wrote in a fundraising email under the subject line “ URGENT !!!
Help the RNC fight Obama & ABC News ! ”

“ The liberal special interests have clearly learned from their missteps the last time they tried to force Americans into a socialized health care system — the abysmal failure of the Clinton Administration 's ‘ HillaryCare , ’ ” Steele wrote .
“ That 's why their friends at ABC News will be promoting Obamacare at virtually every opportunity , from ‘ Good Morning America ’ to ‘ Nightline , ’ and reach from ABC News ' websites all the way to the White House 's East Room . ”
ABC has been under attack from the RNC since the committee learned of the hour - long town hall , which is scheduled to air June 24 .
In a letter leaked to the Drudge Report , RNC Chief of Staff Ken McKay wrote ABC to express that he was “ deeply concerned and disappointed ” with the network .
Senior Vice President Kerry Smith responded that the criticism is based on “ false premises . ”
“ No one watching , listening to , or reading ABC News will lack for an understanding of all sides of these important questions , ” Smith wrote in a letter to McKay .
“ We 've already had many critics of the President 's health care proposals on the air — and that ’s before a real plan has even been put before the country . ”
Steele , as part of an effort to solicit funds to run ads opposing the president during the televised event , claimed in his email Thursday that ABC has “ flatly rejected ” the RNC ’s request to “ add our views along side those of the Obama Democrats . ”
“ What are the Democrats and their media allies afraid of ?
The truth ? ” Steele wrote .
“ That is outrageous !
And we will not take it ! ”
WASHINGTON - Prisoners do not have a constitutional right to DNA testing after their conviction , the Supreme Court ruled yesterday , even though the technology provides an “ unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty . ’’
In the court ’s first examination of how to treat the rapidly evolving field of biological testing , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for a majority that said it is up to the states and Congress to decide who has a right to testing that might prove innocence long after conviction .
The “ challenges DNA technology poses to our criminal justice systems and our traditional notions of finality ’’ are better left to elected officials than federal judges , Roberts wrote in the 5 - to - 4 decision .
“ To suddenly constitutionalize this area would short - circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered legislative response , ’’ he wrote .
The case was one of the most anticipated of the term , given the revolutionary role DNA testing has played in modern criminal proceedings .
The Innocence Project , a group representing those who say they have been wrongfully convicted , said such testing has exonerated 240 people nationwide , at least 17 of whom had received the death penalty .
Dissenting justices , led by Justice John Paul Stevens , said the right to postconviction DNA testing should not depend on the widely varying laws enacted by the states .
Allowing a prisoner to test DNA evidence at his own expense would “ ascertain the truth once and for all , ’’ Stevens wrote .
He was joined in dissent by Justices David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , and Stephen Breyer .
The case at hand comes from Alaska , one of three states without a law allowing postconviction access to biological evidence .
The others are Massachusetts and Oklahoma .
William Osborne was convicted of the 1993 rape and assault of a prostitute in a secluded area near the Anchorage International Airport .
Osborne wanted to pay for a more discerning test of semen found in a condom at the crime scene , which prosecutors agree would almost definitively prove his guilt or innocence .
But prosecutors refused to allow the test , and Alaska courts agreed he did not qualify under the procedures they had established .
Osborne appealed to the federal courts , and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco recognized a right to such testing under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution .
But Roberts , joined by Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel Alito , said that was wrongly decided .
“ A criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man , ’’ he wrote , and thus states have more “ flexibility ’ ’ in deciding procedures for postconviction relief .
The majority said Alaska ’s procedures seemed sufficient and there was no reason for federal courts to “ leap ahead ’’ of the states .
Peter Neufeld of the Innocence Project , who argued the case before the court , said the decision will mean that “ more innocent people will languish in prison ’’ because they lack the legal right to DNA testing .
“ Some state statutes are simply inadequate , ’’ he said , noting that the patchwork of state and federal laws regarding testing means some prisoners will be unable to gain access to testing that would prove them innocent .
Even within the court ’s narrow decision on Osborne , there were divisions within the two sides .
Alito and Kennedy would go further than Roberts , holding that anyone who waived DNA testing at trial for tactical reasons has no right to pursue it after conviction .
Souter declined to join the other dissenters in recognizing a constitutional right to the testing .
He said he would rule for Osborne simply because Alaska ’s procedures for obtaining access to DNA evidence were insufficient .

Yaaec ( Yet another attempt to explain continuations ) !
It seems blogs related to Scheme or Ruby contains at least one attempt to demystify continuations .
Here is mine .
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic concepts like expressions and their evaluation , closures etc .
A continuation is a point in an expression being evaluated , frozen in time .
Consider the following code :
</div > < div id =" _mcePaste " style= " position : absolute ; left : - 10000 px ; top : 0 px ; width : 1 px ; height : 1 px ; overflow -x : hidden ; overflow -y : hidden ; " >< span style = " font - family : Georgia ; line - height : 19 px ; white - space : normal ; font - size : 13 px ; " >(+ 2 3 ) ;; => 5 < span style = " font - family : Consolas ; line - height : 18 px ; font - size : 12 px ; white - space : pre ; " >
This expression can be split into three points : + , 2 and 3 .
We can freeze the program at any of these points and store it away .
This is accomplished with the procedure call - with - current - continuation or call / cc .
The name itself gives a hint as to what it does .
call / cc takes a procedure as argument and evaluates it .
The evaluated procedure is passed a closure which contains the expression upto where call / cc was called .
Let us see call / cc in action by freezing the point where the value 3 is supplied :
</ pre> </div > < div id =" _mcePaste " style= " position : absolute ; left : - 10000 px ; top : 0 px ; width : 1 px ; height : 1 px ; overflow -x : hidden ; overflow -y : hidden ; " >( define frozen # f ) </div > < div id =" _mcePaste " style= " position : absolute ; left : - 10000 px ; top : 0 px ; width : 1 px ; height : 1 px ; overflow -x : hidden ; overflow -y : hidden ; " >(+ 2 ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set ! frozen k ) 3 ) ) ) ;; => 5</div > < div id =" _mcePaste " style= " position : absolute ; left : - 10000 px ; top : 0 px ; width : 1 px ; height : 1 px ; overflow -x : hidden ; overflow -y : hidden ; " > < pre style = " font : normal normal normal 12px / 18 px Consolas , Monaco , ' Courier New ' , Courier , monospace ; " >
(+ [ ] [ ] )
The current continuation is wrapped into the procedure object ” k ” .
We store this in the global variable ” frozen ” and return the value 3 as required by the original expression .
So , when it is evaluated the first time , the result will be 5 .
An easy way to understand continuations is to look at the expression as consisting of the procedure ‘+’ and two holes :
The first hole is filled by the value 2 : (+ 2 [ ] )
The second hole is filled by whatever ” call / cc ” evaluates to ( in this case 3 ) : (+ 2 3 ) ;; => 5
The expression with the hole is stored in the continuation object .
Anytime in the future , we can reuse this object like this : ( frozen 10 ) ;; => 12
What really happened when we evaluated ” frozen ” ?
The expression (+ 2 [ ] ) was resurrected and the hole was filled by the value returned by ” frozen ” .
Thus the expression becomes (+ 2 10 ) and gets evaluated to 12 .
If you are a C programmer , continuations could be understood in the context of the ” setjmp ” and ” longjmp ” functions .
While C allows you to jump back up the stack , ” call / cc ” allows moving in any direction .
This is achieved by saving the entire stack at the point where ” call / cc ” was called .
In our example , ” frozen ” is actually a closure that stores the stack up to the point where ” call / cc ” was evaluated .
One common use of continuations is in emulating keywords that provide ‘ escape ’ from a context .
In the C family of languages these keywords are ” return ” , ” break ” and ” continue ” .
Let us see how we can emulate one of them – the ” return ” keyword : ;;
This procedure searches a list for a value . ;;
If the value is found , the procedure exits by ; ; '' returning ' ' that value .
( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( return ) ( for element in list - to - search < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( if ( is? element ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( return element ) ) ) # f ) ) ) ;;
Test ( define ( is -1900 ? e ) ( = e 1900 ) ) ( find- element ( list 1890 2009 1900 2001 ) is - 1900 ? ) ;; => 1900 ( find- element ( list 1890 2009 1901 2001 ) is - 1900 ? ) ;; => #f
The definition of ” find - element ” can be visualized as : ( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span >[ ] )
When the searched element is found , it is passed as the argument of ” return ” , which actually represents the point where the evaluation of the body of ” find - element ” starts .
Each time ” find - element ” is evaluated , the hole is filled with either #f or the argument passed to the inner call to ” return ” .
This creates an illusion that ” find - element ” actually ” returns ” a value , while in effect the entire body of ” find - element ” ( the hole ) is getting replaced ( or filled ) by the value to which the continuation procedure evaluates .
There is a built - in form that makes it easy to create escape continuations called ” let/ec ” .
Here is the ” find - element ” procedure re-written using ” let/ec ” : ( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) ( let /ec return < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( for element in list - to - search < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( if ( is? element ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( return element ) ) ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > # f ) )
We can also use ” let/ec ” to emulate the ” break ” keyword , which can be used to terminate a loop prematurely : ( define i 0 ) ;;
This loop prints up to 5 ;; and breaks .
( let / ec break < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span >( while (< i 10 ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( printf " ~a~n " i ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( if ( = i 5 ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( break # f ) ) < span style = " white - space : pre ; " > </ span > ( set ! i ( add1 i ) ) ) )
Continuations find use in implementing features like exception handling , green threads , co-routines etc .
Most of these are already taken care of by abstractions built into Spark , so the programmer is saved from directly dealing with continuations .
But understanding how continuations work is important because it can be used to provide intuitive solutions to certain kind of problems .

( Uses Python ) 4 . [ http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-contin.html]
( Uses Java )
Here is my short , simple explanation of continuations .
The code examples are in Scheme .
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic concepts like expressions and their evaluation , closures etc .
A continuation is a point in an expression being evaluated , frozen in time .
Consider the following code :
(+ 2 3 ) ;; => 5
This expression can be split into three points : + , 2 and 3 .
We can freeze the program at any of these points and store it away .
This is accomplished with the procedure call - with - current - continuation or call / cc .
The name itself gives a hint as to what it does .
call / cc takes a procedure as argument and evaluates it .
The evaluated procedure is passed a closure which contains the expression up to where call / cc was called .
Let us see call / cc in action by freezing the point where the value 3 is supplied :
( define frozen # f ) (+ 2 ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set ! frozen k ) 3 ) ) ) ;; => 5
The current continuation is wrapped into the procedure object k .
We store this in the global variable frozen and return the value 3 as required by the original expression .
So , when it is evaluated the first time , the result will be 5 .
An easy way to understand continuations is to look at the expression as consisting of the procedure ‘+’ and two holes :
(+ [ ] [ ] )
The first hole is filled by the value 2 :
(+ 2 [ ] )
The second hole is filled by whatever call / cc evaluates to ( in this case 3 ) :
(+ 2 3 ) ;; => 5
The expression with the hole is stored in the continuation object .
Anytime in the future , we can reuse this object like this :
( frozen 10 ) ;; => 12
What happened when the above expression was evaluated ?
The expression (+ 2 [ ] ) was resurrected and the hole was filled by the value returned by frozen .
Thus the expression becomes (+ 2 10 ) and gets evaluated to 12 .
If you are a C programmer , continuations could be understood in the context of the setjmp and longjmp functions .
While C allows you to jump back up the stack , call / cc allows moving in any direction .
This is achieved by saving the entire stack at the point where call / cc was called .
In our example , frozen is actually a closure that stores the stack up to the point where call / cc was evaluated .
One common use of continuations is in emulating keywords that provide ‘ escape ’ from a context .
In the C family of languages these keywords are return , break and continue .
Let us see how we can emulate one of them – the return keyword :
( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( return ) ( for element in list - to - search ( if ( is? element ) ( return element ) ) ) # f ) ) ) ;;
Test ( define ( is -1900 ? e ) ( = e 1900 ) ) ( find- element ( list 1890 2009 1900 2001 ) is - 1900 ? ) ;; => 1900 ( find- element ( list 1890 2009 1901 2001 ) is - 1900 ? ) ;; => #f
The definition of find - element can be visualized as :
( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) [ ] )
When the searched element is found , it is passed as the argument of return , which actually represents the point where the evaluation of the body of find - element starts .
Each time find - element is evaluated , the hole is filled with either #f or the argument passed to the inner call to return .
This creates an illusion that find - element actually returns a value , while in effect the entire body of find - element ( the hole ) is getting replaced ( or filled ) by the value to which the continuation procedure evaluates .
There is a built - in form that makes it easy to create escape continuations called let / ec .
Here is the find - element procedure re-written using let / ec :
( define ( find - element list - to - search is ? ) ( let /ec return ( for element in list - to - search ( if ( is? element ) ( return element ) ) ) # f ) )
We can also use let / ec to emulate the break keyword , which can be used to terminate a loop prematurely :
;;
This loop prints up to 5
; ; and breaks .
;; Note : while is a special form in Spark - Scheme .
( define i 0 )
( let /ec break
( while (< i 10 ) ( printf " ~a~n " i ) ( if ( = i 5 ) ( break # f ) ) ( set ! i ( add1 i ) ) ) ) [ / sourcecode ]

ISLAMABAD ( AP )  Suspected U.S. drones launched two missile attacks on Taliban targets in the South Waziristan tribal region on Wednesday , killing at least 45 militants in the latest in a barrage of strikes close to the Afghan border , intelligence officials said .
The army said the top Taliban commander in another area of the northwest , the scenic Swat Valley , was wounded in a Pakistani airstrike .
It gave no more details .
South Waziristan lies close to the Afghan border and is the stronghold of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
Pakistan 's military is also bombing and firing mortars at insurgent targets in the region , saying it is chipping away at Mehsud 's resistance before launching a ground offensive there to eliminate him .
Mehsud is blamed for many of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in nuclear - armed Pakistan in recent years .
The first strike took place before dawn .
A suspected U.S. drone fired six missiles at a mountaintop training camp in the Karwan Manza area of South Waziristan , killing 10 militants , the intelligence officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media .
The nationalities and the identities of the slain men were not immediately known .
Hours later , 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) to the east , missiles believed fired from a U.S. drone hit four vehicles carrying Taliban militants , killing at least 35 , including a key Taliban commander , one intelligence official said .
He did not disclose the commander 's identity .
Other intelligence officials put the death toll as high as 50 .
Independent verification of the casualties and the target was not possible because the region is remote , dangerous and largely inaccessible to journalists .
U.S. officials do not publicly comment on the strikes .
The latest strike brings to six the number of suspected American missile attacks in South Waziristan in just over two weeks , an uptick that suggests Washington is also trying to kill or weaken Mehsud and his followers in the run-up to the Pakistani campaign .
Despite the apparent convergence of interests , Pakistan 's army insists it is not coordinating with the U.S.
It says the American missile attacks are hurting its attempts to kill or capture Mehsud because they alienate local tribesman they are trying to enlist in their campaign against him .
The United States is believed to have launched more than 40 missile strikes against targets in the border area since last August that have killed several hundred people , according to a count by the Associated Press based on figures given by intelligence officials .
The Pakistani government routinely protests the strikes as violation of the country 's sovereignty and has publicly asked the United States to give them the technology to launch their own attacks .
Pakistan launched the Swat Valley offensive more than two months ago after militants led by Maulana Fazlullah violated the terms of a peace deal .
It claims to have nearly cleared the valley of militants , killing more than 1,500 .
Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Wednesday that according to " credible information " Fazlullah was wounded in a recent airstrike .
Fazlullah 's capture or killing would be a major symbolic victory for the army and give a psychological boost to local residents fearful that the Taliban could re-emerge in Swat .
Abbas gave no more information about the circumstances involving Fazlullah 's wounding .
A militant spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment .

PANAMA CITY , Panama ( CNN ) -- Ricardo Martinelli , the multimillionaire owner of a supermarket chain , was inaugurated as president of Panama on Wednesday .
Ricardo Martinelli is a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center - left party .
National Assembly President Jose Luis Varela performed the swearing - in and placed the presidential sash on Martinelli , a pro-business conservative who defeated a candidate from the ruling center - left party in May .
The citizens of Panama " want things to be done differently , " Varela said at the inauguration .
" An attitude of change starts today . "
In his first speech as president , Martinelli promised a smaller government budget but raises for public workers .
Public safety , an issue that the outgoing administration of Martin Torrijos struggled to maintain , will be a priority , Martinelli said .
" Our prisons will be rehabilitation centers , not schools for criminals , " he said .
Panama will also work with Mexico and Colombia to combat drug trafficking in the region , Martinelli said .
Among the dignitaries at the inauguration was deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya , who was ousted in a military - led coup Sunday .
The Organization of American States has condemned the coup , and Zelaya has continued to carry out his presidential duties .
The son of Italian immigrants , Martinelli , 57 , is a self - made businessman who is chairman of the Super 99 supermarket chain , one of the largest private companies in Panama .
The U.S. - educated president previously served as minister and chairman of the board of directors of the Panama Canal Authority and formerly was director of social security for Panama , according to his Web site .
Martinelli won the presidency with 60 percent of the votes in a race against ruling - party candidate Balbina Herrera .

I ’m currently teaching myself C# ( with . NET to follow ) ; my client is building a new data warehouse , and the support tools will be Windows - based .
As a newly minted consultant , it also ca n’t hurt to have .
NET / C# experience under my belt , even if I generally prefer to do my development anywhere but Windows .
As a consultant , I need to maximize the possibility of getting future contracts ; if that means doing Windows , I ’ll do Windows ( and program where I ’d prefer to program at home ) .
As pretty much anyone who knows me knows , I am not a huge fan of Microsoft .
I ’ve spent a large part of my career programming on Unix - like systems .
From 1999 to 2008 , I worked for an independent software vendor , as a core member of their development team ; the product was written almost entirely in Java .
I like the Java VM .
It ’s mature , it ’s fast , it ’s highly portable , and there are loads of languages running on it .
When I was developing full - time in Java , I was the only member of the team whose desktop ran Linux ; everyone else used Windows .
With Java , it did n’t matter .
In fact , it was an advantage .
Several of our clients ran our software on Unix - like systems ; having at least one developer who used and tested our product on Linux was a win .
Our nightly build system was a cheap Linux server , as well ; since Java runs anywhere there ’s a Java VM , anyone on our team ( as well as any of our customers ) could run executables produced on that Linux box .
But Java , the language , depresses me lately .
It ’s being left in the dust by other languages .
Scala , my current favorite language on the Java VM , incorporates many newer ( and some not so new ) ideas that have yet to find their way into Java .
Worse , though , for Java enthusiasts : Java has fallen behind C#. I ’m boning up on C# using O’Reilly ’s C# in a Nutshell book .
( See http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001810/.
As an aside , the “ Nutshell ” books are an excellent way to learn a new language , if you already know n other languages . )
I ’m only partway through the book , but it ’s already clear to me that , overall , C# ( the language ) now has more goodness in it than Java does .
I have to give Microsoft credit ( much as it may pain me to do so ) .
Here are some things C# now has that Java does not :
Lambdas , which are way better than anonymous inner classes .
( C# has anonymous inner classes , too . )
Delegates .
You can kind of do this in Java , but it ’s not as clean .
Operator overloading .
This feature can be abused all to hell , but it is still occasionally useful , especially in libraries and in DSLs .
Properties .
No need to write getters and setters .
Everything looks like a direct field access , even if it is n’t .
This is Python ’s idiom , and Scala ’s , too , and once you start using it , you never want to expose explicit getters and setters , ever again .
foo .x += 1 is so much more readable than foo.setX ( foo.getX ( ) + 1 ) .
A yield coroutine capability .
Though I prefer Python ’s syntax ( and Scala ’s ) to C#’s , this is a powerful and highly useful capability .
If you ’ve ever used it to build lazy iterators ( in Python , Scala , C# , whatever ) , you know what I mean .
Extension methods .
These are the C# equivalent of the Scala implicit type conversion feature , and they ’re damned useful .
They permit you to “ extend ” existing classes , even if they ’re final , without actually extending them .
Like the Scala version , there ’s a mechanism for bringing the implicit conversions in scope ; they do n’t happen automatically .
( Think of them as a kind of scope - controlled monkeypatching . )
( Note :
As Tony Morris points out , in the comments to this article , extension methods are not really the equivalent of Scala ’s implicit type conversions ; Scala ’s implicits are much more powerful .
Still , it ’s clear that C# has borrowed one useful aspect of this notion , and it ’s equally clear that Java does not have a feature that ’s even remotely close to either Scala ’s implicits or C# ’s extension methods . )
A null coalescing operator that provides a simple syntax for dereferencing a reference and supplying a default if the reference is null .
In addition , C# has many of the same features as Java , including :
interfaces
generics
autoboxing and auto-unboxing
annotations ( though C# calls them “ attributes ” )
I still prefer the JVM to CLR .
The JVM is robust , mature , fast , and ( above all ) portable .
But Java , the language , has fallen behind , and it now lacks a lot of the useful features C# has .
One of the reasons I ’m all over Scala these days is that it corrects those flaws in Java , providing many up - to - date features while still permitting me to use the power and convenience of the JVM .
Either via libraries or built-ins , Scala provides the same features as C# , with a few more thrown in for good measure .
( I also happen to think Scala is a better language than C# , but I ’ll save that tangent for another time . )
But , in the .NET world , C# , not Scala , is the lingua franca .
And C# , and .NET , are the biggest hearts - and - minds competitor Java has .
Sun and the Java community have allowed Java , the language , to stagnate to the point where , compared to C# and Scala , it is almost painful to use .
As a long - time Java programmer , I have to say , that makes me a little sad .

Recent summers have seen on average less ice floating in the Arctic Ocean
Arctic ice reached a larger maximum area this winter than in the last few years , scientists say , but the long - term trend still shows it declining .
The 30 - year trend shows the maximum annual sea-ice cover , usually seen in March , is shrinking by 2.7 % per decade .
Only 10 % of the cover consists of relatively durable ice that has formed over more than two years , a record low .
Scientists from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , say the thin ice is prone to summer melting .
" Thickness is important , especially in the winter , because it is the best overall indicator of the health of the ice cover , " said NSIDC scientist Walt Meier .
We 're not set up well for summertime ; we 're in a very precarious situation
Walt Meier " As the ice cover in the Arctic grows thinner , it grows more vulnerable to melting in the summer . "
In the 1980s , thick multi - year ice made up 30 - 40 % of the cover , the scientists say .
The summer minimum area is changing much faster than the winter maxima , shrinking by about 0.7 % per year .
Last year UK researchers showed that the ice has also markedly thinned in recent years .
Space eyes
The Arctic sea-ice reached its maximum extent this year on 28 February , slightly earlier than usual , and remained roughly constant through March .
Averaged over March , the sea-ice covered 15.16 million sq km ( 5.85 million sq miles ) .
The maximum sea ice extent is declining by about 2.7 % per decade
By comparison , this was 590,000 sq km ( 228,000 sq miles ) below the average for the years 1979 to 2000 , and 730,000 sq km ( 282,000 sq miles ) above the record low of 2006 .
The winter saw big variations in Arctic air temperatures , with some areas much warmer and others cooler than average .
Some parts of the region including the Barents Sea experienced air temperatures 4C above the long - term average , while others , including the Bering Sea , were as much as 2C below the average - a pattern reflected in the areas where the thick , multi - year ice accumulated .
The data comes principally from two Nasa satellites .
IceSat measures the height by which the ice rises above the surrounding ocean , which can be used to calculate the overall ice thickness .
Meanwhile , the Quikscat satellite can distinguish between multi-year and newly formed ice using differences in the way they scatter light .
The shrinkage in Arctic ice area and volume carries implications for climate change globally .
Dark water absorbs more of the Sun 's energy than reflective white ice , so the decline of sea-ice will act to amplify a warming trend .
NSIDC researchers believe that a warm summer could see a major melt .
" We 're not set up well for summertime , " said Dr Meier .
" We 're in a very precarious situation . "
Forecasts of the date by which Arctic summers will be ice - free range from five years to several decades , with natural climatic cycles playing an important role .

Once upon a time , he was the most trusted man in America .
Today , at the age of 92 , he passed away , one of the last icons of the early days of TV news .
Walter Cronkite defined “ anchorman ” — literally .
He worked for years as a newspaperman and a radio newsman , but it was his jump to TV in 1950 that put him on the path to becoming a household name .
His big break came in 1952 , when he served as the “ anchor ” for CBS News ’ coverage of the 1952 political conventions .
In 1962 , Cronkite made the jump to the studio , replacing Douglas Edwards as the network ’s frontman .
By the later part of the decade , he ’d wrested first place in the ratings from the equally iconic Chet Huntley and David Brinkley , his competitors at NBC .
Looking back at the news of that era — from 1962 until Cronkite retired in 1981 — it ’s impossible not to associate Cronkite with the top stories of the day .
He choked up on when he had to break the news of President Kennedy ’s death .
He rubbed his hands in glee when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon .
He dealt a death - blow to Lyndon Johnson ’s presidency when he delivered an editorial on the Vietnam war .
“ If I ’ve lost Cronkite , I ’ve lost middle America , ” Johnson said .
Despite his powerful “ Tet Editorial ” and his unabashed support of the space program , Cronkite believed it was really the media ’s job to “ hold up the mirror — to tell and show the public what has happened ” and keep opinion out .
“ The ethics of a…responsible journalist is to put his or her biases , his or her prejudices aside in an attempt to be really fair to all sides at all times , ” he said .
“ And my pride is that I think I did that fairly well during my years . ”
The nature of reporting today has changed significantly ; Cronkite changed with the times .
He blogged occasionally for the Huffington Post , for instance .
But overall , he lamented what he saw as the downward - spiraling quality of the news , particularly on television .
“ The nation whose population depends on the explosively compressed headline service of television news can expect to be exploited by the demagogues and dictators who prey upon the semi-informed , ” he wrote in his 1996 memoir .
As proof , he later pointed to the debacle of the war in Iraq .
Americans thirty and under are more apt to associate “ anchorman ” with Ron Burgundy instead of Walter Cronkite .
But for people old enough to remember Cronkite , there will never be any anchorman but him .
Generations of Americans will ever remember him as the face of television news .
He was “ Uncle Walter , ” the man with the resonate craggy voice and bedrock integrity .
He was one of the all - time greats .
I was only eleven when Cronkite retired in March of 1981 , but of course I can still remember his sign - off each night : “ And that ’s the way it is … . ”
Now it shall be that way no longer .

Got a great email from Jonathan who started a webcomic at the beginning of this year .
Like a chode I took a month to respond .
Check out his comic here !
( CNN ) --
It began as horseplay , with two teenage stepbrothers chasing each other with blow guns and darts .
But it soon escalated when one of the boys grabbed a knife .
Michael Barton , Quantel Lotts ' stepbrother , was stabbed to death at age 17 .
The older teen , Michael Barton , 17 , was dead by the time he reached the hospital , stabbed twice .
The younger boy , Quantel Lotts , 14 , would eventually become one of Missouri 's youngest lifers .
Lotts was sentenced in Missouri's St. Francois County Circuit Court in 2002 to life in prison without parole for first - degree murder in his stepbrother 's stabbing death .
It made no difference that at the time of the deadly scuffle , Lotts was barely old enough to watch PG - 13 movie and too young to drive , vote or buy beer .
" They locked me up and threw away the keys , " Lotts , now 23 , said from prison .
" They took away all hope for the future . "
His stepmother , the victim 's mother , has forgiven Lotts and is working with lawyers to gain his release .
Lotts is one of at least 73 U.S. inmates -- most of them minorities -- who were sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison for crimes committed when they were 13 or 14 , according to the Equal Justice Initiative , a nonprofit organization in Alabama that defends indigent defendants and prisoners .
The 73 are just a fraction of the more than 2,000 offenders serving life sentences for crimes they committed as minors under the age of 18 .
Across the country , most juvenile offenders and many adults are given a second chance .
Charles Manson , convicted in seven notorious murders committed when he was 27 , will be eligible for his 12th parole hearing in 2012 .
He 's been denied parole 11 times .
Even " Son of Sam " killer David Berkowitz , who confessed to killing six people in the 1970s when he was in his 20s , has had four parole hearings , though he has said he does n't deserve parole and does n't want it .
But Quantel Lotts has no hope for a parole hearing .
At least not yet .
See which states have sentenced minors to life without parole »
Lotts is part of a trend that has developed over the past two decades .
Numerous studies have shown that In the 1970s and 1980s , minors were rarely given life sentences , let alone life without parole , experts said .
By the early 1990s , according to the Department of Justice , an alarming spike in juvenile homicides spawned a nationwide crackdown , including a movement to try kids in adult courts .
Lifers by the Numbers  2,225 : Inmates serving life without parole for crimes committed as minors
 42 : States that allow life without parole for minors
 14 : States that have no minimum age for life sentences
 73 : Documented cases of minors serving life without parole for crimes committed as 13- , 14 - year - olds
 44 : States that passed laws between 1992 and 1997 making it easier try minors as adults
Sources : Human Rights Watch , Equal Justice Initiative , National Conference of State Legislatures , U.S. Department of Justice
" Criminal court does n't care they are kids , " said Melissa Sickmund , chief of systems research at the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
" Once they are there , it 's just another case . "
Today , there are only a handful of states -- including Alaska , Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico and Oregon -- that prohibit sentencing minors to life without parole , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Proponents of the strict sentencing laws said public safety should be top priority .
They argued that judges give certain criminals , regardless of their age , life sentences because the crimes are so abhorrent .
" There are some people who are so fundamentally dangerous that they can't walk among us , " said Jennifer Jenkins , who co-founded the National Organization for Victims of Juvenile Lifers .
The Illinois - based group has fought legislation in nine states that would remove sentences of life without parole .
Jenkins has experienced the devastation of losing family members to a teen killer .
In 1990 , her sister and her sister 's family , who were living in a wealthy suburb in Chicago , Illinois , were murdered by a teenager .
" Victims have the right not to be constantly revictimized , " she said .
" They will come back to my community and your community and repeat , " said Harriet Salerno , president of Crime Victims United of California , a group trying to block the passage of laws that would ease sentencing for juveniles .
She founded the victim 's group after her daughter , a pre-medical student , was murdered at the University of the Pacific in Stockton , California in the 1979 .
" Many of them have dysfunctional homes , and the crimes will escalate because there is no place to put them . "
Only 19 states punish children under 14 with life sentences without parole , according to a study conducted by the Equal Justice Initiative .
Over the past three years , the advocacy group 's attorneys have appealed cases involving 13 - and 14 - year - old offenders in state and federal court .
Attorneys argue that the sentences are " cruel and unusual punishment " given the tender years of the offenders .
Read the center 's report
Last week , the state of Missouri dismissed Quantel Lotts ' case in St. Francois County Circuit Court .
The Equal Justice Initiative will challenge the decision in the Missouri Court of Appeals .
A separate petition , filed in 2007 , is pending in federal court in the Eastern District of Missouri .
Do n't Miss Equal Justice Initiative
Lotts remains in prison in Bonne Terre , Missouri , and he is hopeful .
He has new dreams of going to college and maybe even becoming a lawyer .
" My family motivates me , " he explained .
" Because I want to be out there with them so I can never give up . "
He wishes he could start over , but not at the beginning .
He grew up in a crack house with a mother who used and sold drugs .
In Lotts ' case , court documents reveal that he was sexually abused as a child .
When child welfare officials took Lotts from his mother at the age of 8 , they noted that he " smelled of urine and had badly decayed molars as well as numerous scars on his arms , legs and forehead . "
" Quantel had a lot of anger because of all he has been through , " said stepmother Tammy Lotts , 45 , whose son Michael Barton was Lotts ' victim .
iReport.com : Sentence ' totally unfair '
At the time of the crime , Tammy Lotts said she left her children for several days with her husband to get high on crack cocaine .

Most young offenders serving life without parole were exposed to poverty , violence or drugs during childhood , the Equal Justice Initiative reported .
Some victims ' families say that 's exactly why the juveniles should stay locked up .
Salerno , of Crime Victims United of California , said that some juveniles can be rehabilitated but that some committed crimes so severe , resources should n't be wasted on them .
Two cases in which juvenile offenders got life without parole did n't even involve murder .
Antonio Nunez was 14 years old when he committed a crime that gave him life without parole .
The crime was an armed kidnapping that occurred in 2001 .
He spent his childhood in a gang - ridden neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles , California .
He was shot in the stomach multiple times while riding his bike at age 13 .

In Florida , Joe Sullivan , who case will be heard soon by the U.S. Supreme Court , was sentenced to life without parole for 1989 rape of an elderly woman .
He was 13 at the time of the crime and is mentally disabled .
In 2005 , groups that opposed life sentences without parole for young people , began to gain traction after the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds in the landmark case Roper v. Simmons .
A year later , Colorado abolished life without parole for minors who commit crimes .
At the federal level , Rep. Robert C. Scott , D - Virginia , will introduce legislation this year to give youthful offenders the option of parole .
In California , Democratic Sen. Leland

Proving once again that " outdated technology " still has its place among today 's high - tech products , old - school film cameras may soon be the only shooters not rendered ineffective in the face of a new device that promises to identify and disable their digital counterparts in secure environments .
Currently still in the prototype phase , the device developed by researchers at the Georgia Tech College of Computing 's Interactive and Intelligent Computing Division uses its own set of digital cameras along with a scanning laser to inspect a given area for telltale signs of CCD imagers ( shape , size , reflectivity ) , and subsequently shoots out concentrated beams of light to overwhelm the sensors of offending gadgets .
Although the device is still unable to accurately detect camcorders whose CCDs are set farther back from the lens than regular still cameras , once that obstacle is overcome , this technology is expected to be deployed by governments and businesses as an anti-espionage technique or in movie theaters as a way of combating piracy .
See , you thought you were ahead of the game with your ten megapixel cameraphone , but it 's actually the spies and pirates equipped with those old medium - format Pentaxes who will soon rise to the top of their respective professions .

( CNN ) -- Ventures lead guitarist Bob Bogle , whose fretwork on such instrumental hits such as " Walk -- Do n't Run " and " Hawaii Five - O " influenced countless bands , died Sunday in Vancouver , Washington .
Bob Bogle ( second from left ) co-founded the Ventures , the highly influential instrumental band .
He was 75 .
The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , according to Don Wilson , who co-founded the Ventures with Bogle in the 1950s .
" He had a special sound that nobody could ever re-create .
He was totally unique as a guitar player , " Wilson told CNNRadio .
Wilson and Bogle learned how to play guitar while working as construction workers in the 1950s in their native Tacoma , Washington .
The pair formed the Ventures in 1958 .
" We had a lot of time on our hands after work , so we'd get together and play , " Wilson recalled .
" A year and a half later , we had a number two hit called ' Walk -- Do n't Run . ' "
The group first heard the song on a Chet Atkins record .
Several other hits followed , including " Perfidia , " " Walk Don't Run ' 64 " and " Diamond Head . "
The group took the theme of the TV show " Hawaii Five - O " into the Top Ten in 1969 and later supplied background music for the series .
But the band , which played almost solely instrumentals , was perhaps more influential for its albums .
Thirty - eight of the band 's long - players hit Billboard 's Top 200 chart , including albums that covered country songs , dance tunes and Christmas melodies .
One of the band 's albums was titled " Play Guitar with the Ventures , " and countless did .
" I can't think of a better contribution for instrumental music on his style than ' Walk -- Do n't Run , ' " Wilson said .
" A lot of good would - be guitar players and garage bands would go out and buy guitars just to learn that song . "
The Ventures were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 .
At the induction ceremony , Creedence Clearwater Revival 's John Fogerty praised the group : " It 's enough to say , the Ventures are the most popular instrumental band of all time , " he said .
Bogle fought his illness with dignity , Wilson said .
" His doctors gave him 10 years to live , and he lived 12 .
The last two years were really tough .
At least he lived to know the Ventures had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . "
Bogle is survived by his wife , Yumi .

A deal for Apple to build a major data center at a site in Catawba County , North Carolina is " all but done " and may be sealed when the state Senate finalizes an incentive package that could add up to $ 3 million in anual tax breaks for the company , according to local media reports .
Apple has been considering two sites in North Carolina for a potential $ 1 billion data center project that will provide it with a major East Coast infrastructure hub to support its iTune music store and iPhone app store .
Backers of a site in Cleveland County have been told by state officials that it is " all but a done deal " that Apple will choose a rival site in Catawba County .
The prospective Apple location in Catawba appears to be one of several locations county officials have been touting for data center projects .
On Thursday the North Carolina Senate gave preliminary approval to the incentive package for Apple , with a final vote scheuled for this evening .
Gov. Beverly Perdue is expected to sign the bill if it passes .
Catawba County officials have been targeting data centers for development , and have been actively marketing several sites off Route 321 for their fiber and power infrastructure .
" We have anticipated the needs of the data center industry and are working daily to make Catawba County one of the best place in the country to locate data centers and server farms , " Scott Millar , president of the Catawba County Economic Development Corporation , said on the agency 's web site .
One site advanced by Catawba for data center use is a 183 - acre tract in Maiden known as Catawba Data Park , which may suit Apple 's reported desire for a multi-facility campus setting .
County officials have also been working with T5 Mission Critical Facilities , a company formed recently by former members of the data center practice at the Staubach Company .
T5 is developing a site near Route 321 in with an existing 150,000 powered shell with up to 120 megawatts of power available for a single large user .
The company says the power from Duke Energy is priced at 3.8 to 4.4 cents per kWh .
Apple 's apparent preference for Catawba County emerged in the Shelby Star , which profiled the efforts by Cleveland County officials to attract Apple to a former Chris - Craft facility in Kings Mountain .
" State officials have told Cleveland County to ' run through the tape , ' in case something goes wrong with Catawba County 's bid , " the paper reports .
" And that still can't be ruled out , but officials say it is ' all but a done deal ' that Catawba will win the Apple sweepstakes . "
The incentive package moving through the state legislature offers income tax breaks to companies that invest more than $ 1 billion over nine years in a rural area of the state and pay above - average salaries , according to local media .
Catawba county had an unemployment rate of 15.6 percent in March .
The $ 1 billion price tag is nearly twice the $ 600 million that Google is investing in a large data center in Lenoir .

Mass protest in Tehran , June 15 , 2009 .
By Tony Iltis and Stuart Munckton
June 20 , 2009 -- Since the June 12 Iranian presidential election , and the almost immediate announcement of a landslide victory for incumbent Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , Iran has been convulsed by mass protests alleging electoral fraud .
Despite savage repression , including mass arrests , beatings of protesters , attacks on universities and at least 22 deaths , hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets daily .
The protests started in Tehran on June 13 , but have spread throughout the country .
The protesters have been calling for a re-run of the election , claiming that Mir-Hossein Mousavi won the elections despite the official results giving Ahmedinejad 64 % .
The protests are occurring despite both Ahmedinejad and Mousavi emerging from within the same undemocratic regime and holding similar positions on many issues .
Mousavi is presented in the Western media as a “ reformer ” , however he was prime minister during the 1980s when the regime committed some of its worst atrocities .
Nonetheless , the breadth of the protests , and the willingness to risk death , indicates widespread anger .
— potentially more anti-regime than pro-Mousavi .
In Iran , public executions and flogging are common .
A regime that violently represses trade unions , curbs the rights of women , gays and lesbians , national minorities and other oppressed sectors inevitably builds up grievances over time — anger that can explode onto the streets .
The post-election protests reflect this .
Ahmedinejad has traditionally had support from sectors of the poor , and has relied on populist anti-imperialist rhetoric .
That this is still able to mobilise sections of the oppressed has been shown by the counter - protest rally of Ahmedinejad supporters on June 14 that the British Guardian said the next day involved tens of thousands .
The June 18 Guardian said a June 15 rally supporting new elections “ estimated by Tehran 's mayor , Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf , to be as many as three million - strong ” .
Mobilisations on this scale have not occurred in Iran since the 1979 revolution , in which a mass uprising toppled the US - back Shah dictatorship .
On June 16 , a number of demonstrators were shot dead by the Basiji , religious police , and other pro-government militias .
The government has admitted to seven protester deaths , as well as 15 students killed when the Basaji attacked dormitories at the University of Tehran on the night of June 14 .
On June 19 , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded that the protests stop .
Khamenei is the unelected “ supreme leader ” who actually wields executive power .
However , some in the religious and political hierarchy have supported Mousavi 's call for new elections .
Grand Ayatollah Hossein - Ali Montazeri accused the government of vote - rigging .
Western media accounts
While the protests are no doubt an expression of anger at a repressive regime , the Western media ’s view of the democrat Mousavi against the dictator Ahmedinejad is flawed .
It is also hypocritical .
You get the sense that the only places in the world where electoral fraud and repression exists are in countries governed by forces the West does n’t like .
This ignores the deeply flawed 2000 presidential election that placed George Bush in office , followed by his administration destroying civil liberties at home and abroad .
In Saudi Arabia , governed by a brutal US - backed fundamentalist regime , free elections are unheard of .
In his June 4 , 2009 , Cairo speech , Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to admit that the US government helped organised a coup that overthrew the elected government of prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 .
Mosaddeq ’s crime was to nationalise Iran ’s oil industry .
The US - backed absolute monarchy of the Shah , which replaced Mosaddeq ’s government , was as extreme in its repression as it was loyal to its US sponsors .
The current regime emerged out of the 1979 anti-Shah revolution .
Not only did the current repression not start with Ahmedinejad , who was elected in 2005 , Mousavi was prime minister from 1981 - 89 when it was at its height .
No matter who you vote for in Iran , the regime wins .
All candidates must support the theocratic principals of the Islamic Republic and all candidates are vetted by the religious hierarchy .
Four hundred candidates nominated for the recent presidential election .
Only four were approved to run .
Such institutionalised rigging raises questions as to why the regime would resort to post-election manipulation of the result .
It is not possible yet to know for sure whether the elections were rigged or to what extent .
The low votes recorded in areas known to be strongholds of opposition support has been given as evidence of at least some fraud .
While the protests are taking the form of support for Mousavi and new elections , the large numbers involved and their steadfastness reflect a deeper hostility to the regime .
High inflation and unemployment are helping fuel anger .
` Twitter revolution ' ?
There is speculation that what is occurring is a version of the CIA - manipulated “ colour revolutions ” such as the 2003 “ Rose Revolution ” in Georgia and the 2004 “ Orange Revolution ” in Ukraine .
This uprising has been dubbed the “ Twitter revolution ” in the Western media due to the role of the online social networking site in spreading information among the regime ’s opponents .
This is accompanied by a focus on the participation in the protests by middle - and upper - class Western - oriented youth .
However , use of Twitter is unlikely to have mobilised millions of Iranians .
Middlesex University academic Ali Alizadeh said in a June 18 Cinestatic.com article : “ The creative self - organisation of the movement is using a manifold of methods ... many of them simple and traditional , depending on their availability : shouting ‘ death to dictator ’ from rooftops , calling landlines , at the end of one rally chanting the time and place of the next one , and by jeopardising oneself by physically standing on streets and distributing news to every passing car . ”
The presentation of the movement as largely Western oriented and middle class is related to the nature of the hostility between the Iranian regime and the imperialist First World .
The West is angered by Ahmedinejad ’s support for resistance movements in Palestine and Lebanon , as well as his government ’s alliance with Latin American governments that seeks to weaken elements of Western domination .
Ahmedinejad has played on Western hostility to boost his domestic support .
This has included his casting doubt on the extent of the Nazi Holocaust ( anti-Semitic comments which are less than helpful to the Palestinian cause ) .
Holocaust - denial aside , Mousavi ’s positions on these questions are not fundamentally different .
And these are not the cause of popular anger among Iranians — who largely support the Palestinian struggle and are hostile to imperialism .
1979 revolution
Obama was right in his Cairo speech when he acknowledge the Iranian people 's hostility to the US stems from the 1953 coup .
The US ruling class hatred of Iran stems from the 1979 revolution that overthrew its client .
This revolution damaged US interests , and lost it control over one of the world ’s largest oil reserves .
US corporate interests are desperate to reverse this .
Although the 1979 revolution ended up with the current regime in power , it began as a genuinely popular mass movement .
It was marked by a strike of 30,000 oil workers and massive , courageous demonstrations by working people , defying violence .
The ability of the conservative clergy to emerge from this upsurge in control is largely a product of mistakes by , and disunity among , Iran 's left - wing groups .
Most of the left did not take seriously the threat posed the religious fundamentalist clergy , which sought to ensure the revolution did not challenge capitalism but replaced the Shah with a new elite .
Some even believed that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini could be manipulated .
The largest socialist group , the pro-Moscow Tudeh Party , even collaborated with the clergy in crushing rival leftists .
It was later crushed itself by the theocratic regime it helped install .
However , the regime ’s legitimacy depended on the revolution ’s anti-imperialist gains .
The US response to its puppet the Shah being overthrown and replaced by a new regime hostile to its interests was to encourage the neighbouring Iraqi dictatorship of Saddam Hussein to invade Iran .
The resulting eight - year war bled Iran , but failed to overthrow the regime .
Neoliberal regime
Thousands of leftists were rounded up in Iran during the war under the excuse of national security .
When Mousavi was PM , thousands of such political prisoners were massacred .
While anti-imperialist in rhetoric and aspects of foreign policy , the regime ’s economic policies have , since the 1990s , been neoliberal .
Despite repression , trade union struggles have continued , such as the epic struggle of the Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Vahed Bus Company ( SWTVBC ) .
The leader of the bus drivers , Mansoor Osanloo , has been imprisoned since 2004 .
Iran 's presidential election became a lightning rod for discontent across society .
The regime ’s response has exacerbated the problem .
Mousavi appears to fear that the demonstrations have the potential to threaten not just Ahmedinejad , but the whole regime , of which he is part .
He has several times urged his supporters not attend illegal demonstrations , but changed his stance when it became obvious the protests would occur with or without him .
Seeking to maintain leadership of the movement , he is trying to ensure protests remain limited to the campaign against the electoral fraud .
He has so far succeeded .
However , a June 18 statement by the SWTSVBC said : “ The demands of almost an absolute majority of the Iranians go far beyond the demands of a particular group .
In the past , we have emphasised that [ as long as ] freedom of choice and right to organise are not recognised , talk of any social or particular rights would be more of a mockery than a reality . ”
The statement called for an international day of trade union solidarity with Iran for June 26 , which has been endorsed by a number of international trade unions .
In a June 17 ABC Radio National interview from Tehran , British journalist Robert Fisk said he saw police and soldiers fraternising with protesters — even protecting them from assaults by the Basiji .
Similar events occurred in the early stages of the 1979 revolution — a parallel it could not have failed to notice .
It remains to be seen whether the protests continue to deepen as an expression of deep - seated anger at the regime , or remain contained within the confines of a dispute between two figures in the ruling elite .

WITH just two knives for cutting and a baby pig for company , Xavier Rosset sat solo on an uninhabited Pacific island for 300 lonely days .
But unlike Robinson Crusoe , the young Swiss adventurer made a choice to isolate himself totally , surviving on food and shelter got by his own hand to challenge the modern way of life .
" It was hard , yes , very hard , " Mr Rosset said , freshly arrived back in Europe after ending his 10 - month stint in Tonga .
His island of choice was Tofua , a 64 - square - kilometre volcanic isle home to nothing except " some pigs , lots of coconuts , a lake and tropical forest " .
His luggage consisted of just a Swiss army knife , machete and a video camera to record his adventure for a documentary to be aired later this year .
The mission was to try to relearn the natural survival skills which urban men have long forgotten , but Mr Rosset said it was far from easy .
" At the beginning I had to try hard to survive , " the former professional snowboarder said .
" I had to find the food and water , build shelter , learn how to fish , everything . "
Last September , just 10 days in , he had a realisation that he was all alone and would be for many months to come .
" That was very hard , without my family , my girlfriend , my friends .
There was a lot of loneliness . "
But he was kept busy just trying to survive .
Over the next two months he lost nearly all the 18kg of body fat he had stockpiled before starting his adventure .
He was n't able to hold his weight steady until he discovered how to trap and kill wild pigs , in the process making his only " friend " , a tiny piglet .
" I could n't eat it because there was n't enough meat so I took it with me and she stayed with me for three months , " he said .
" She was exactly like a dog .
She was a very good friend for me but I did n't talk to her like ( Tom Hanks ) talked to the volleyball in the movie Castaway . "
It was n't until eight months into the stay that Mr Rosset says he felt at peace on the island .
In a blog recording from this time , the explorer said : " I 'm spending the most part of the day doing nothing , looking at the big ocean or the butterfly who has come to say hello to me . "
" I even have enough food .
I can say now and now only that I am feeling ( at ) home . "
Being truly home in Switzerland has been the biggest high however , and there 's no plan to go bush again anytime soon .

Maryland ’s state - regulated season for crabs runs from the beginning of April until the last of November .
Around springtime , watermen have emptied out their bushels of oysters and have already begun building their boxy wire traps , somewhat misleadingly called pots .
And just as hibernating mammals emerge from winter , so do last summer ’s surviving crabs  their meat having been soaked in what might be the culinary world ’s longest marinade .
These are the crustaceans , plump with meat and measuring from six to six and a half inches across , that are announced on giant chalkboard menus at crab houses and seafood wholesalers all over Maryland as “ jumbos . ”
Smaller “ mediums ” and “ larges ” even out the catch all season , but it ’s commonly stated in Maryland that the best time to fetch jumbos is late summer and early fall , when the crabs that have been lucky enough to survive the season begin to bulk up for hibernation .
My mother swears that these crabs are the sweetest .
“ Brrrraaaaccck , ” a large sheet of brown paper complained as it was torn from a roll on the Waterman ’s wall before being wafted over and weighed down by a mallet , a knife and plastic cups of melted butter and Old Bay Seasoning , the dressings that represent the diametric sweet and salty palate that governs a typical crab house spread .
When the crabs arrived , they were truly jumbo .
I began to pick the crabs , a process of pulling the meat from the shell chambers and claws .
First , I twisted the claws and fins at the joints to pull out the hidden meat .
If it did n’t worry its way out with an anxious snap , I was forced to break in with my knife , as I would need to later with the crab ’s body .
I let the rust - colored piquant chunks of Old Bay salt slide off the cracked shells and onto a sweet mined piece of meat and ate it straight from the knife ’s blade .
Midway through my first crab , an order of hush puppies had been set down next to me .
These large , deep - fried dollops of cornmeal , although flat - tasting on their own , took on a buttery sweetness after the mouth - puckering Old Bay .
I popped one or two in my mouth as I grabbed an old paint bucket from fellow diners at the other end of the table , to dispose of my vacated crab .
Only a soggy stain on the brown paper remained , but by my sixth crab , I was mighty full .

I BEGAN an extended and greasy reunion with the Eastern Shore this season at Waterman ’s , in the tiny marina town of Rock Hall , because it was one of our family ’s favorite crab houses , a lively spot with good catches .
From there , my plan was to travel south down the shore ’s wrinkly coast to where it meets the ocean .
One hundred and fifteen fifty - three years ago , Nikola Tesla was born in the small village of Smiljan , Vojna Krajina , in modern - day Croatia .
Beside the eponymous Tesla coil , Tesla is known for his contributions to the field of science , especially regarding electricity and electromagnetism .
In regards to the oft - cited Edison , Tesla had this to say :
If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack , he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search ...
I was a sorry witness of such doings , knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor .
New York Times ( 19 October 1931 )
While Tesla passed away in 1943 , penniless , his legacy is lasting .
He laid the groundwork for many modern branches of science and technology , including robotics , ballistics , remote control , radar , nuclear physics , and and theoretical physics .
He was also obsessed with pigeons .

Authorities in New York have declared war on the large flocks of Canada geese that congregate around the city 's airports , and will cull 2,000 in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the bird strike that forced a passenger plane to ditch in the Hudson river earlier this year .
The cull will target geese at open areas and more than 40 public parks in Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan and the Bronx within five miles of regional airports .
The city 's mayor , Michael Bloomberg , said the effort was justified by the dangers the geese pose to aircraft .
In January , the pilot of a US Airways flight was forced to make an emergency water landing after a bird strike , with his passengers making a miraculous escape from the aircraft as it floated on the freezing waters of the Hudson .
" The serious dangers that Canada geese pose to aviation became all too clear when geese struck US Airways Flight 1549 , " he said in a statement on Thursday .
" The incident served as a catalyst to strengthen our efforts in removing geese from , and discouraging them from nesting on , city property near our runways . "
The authority managing New York 's three airports , Kennedy , LaGuardia and Newark , had already had a programme to control bird populations through shooting and trapping birds , and removing their nests .
LaGuardia , which has a particularly bad history with birds , has had a programme of evicting geese for the last five years , and has removed 1,250 during that time .
In the past , some of the offending geese were donated to food banks .
That practice will not continue .
Jason Post , a spokesman for the mayor , told reporters the geese would be herded to a collection point , and then taken off site where they would be put down using carbon dioxide in methods approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association .
Conservation officials say there is a permanent population of about 20,000 Canada geese in the region .
Another 25,000 are believed to pass through the area during the migration season .
It is believed that the US Airways flight was brought down by migrating birds .
The cull is the first step in a major action plan to prevent birds strikes in the aftermath of the US Airways near - disaster , involving representatives from the city , airport authorities in New York and New Jersey , and the US agriculture department .
Bird strikes have been rising across the US , from 1,750 in 1990 to 7,666 in 2001 according to the federal aviation authority .
Canada geese , whose population have risen to 5.5 m last year , have emerged as a particular culprit .
There have been 77 collisions between planes and geese in the New York area over the last decade , according to the federal aviation authority .
The city is planning to fill in a large hollow at Rikers Island , just north of LaGuardia , that had been popular among geese .
At JFK airport , the authorities are also installing a new bird radar system , and have taken on an additional wildlife biologist to step up safety measures .
The city will erect signs in parks warning people against feeding geese , and will teach wildlife supervisors in the field how to fire shotguns .
This site documents my experience with natural landscaping and the mowing ordinance in my village .
My name is Jason Rohrer , and my wife Lauren Serafin and I own a house in the village of Potsdam , New York .
We bought our house in the summer of 2004 and have been cultivating a natural meadow landscape around it ever since .
Our current local ordiance prohibits grass taller than 10 inches .
After two run-ins with Village authorities over our landscape , we decided to fight the charges in court .
I was arraigned in August of 2005 and plead " not guilty . "
My trial was on December 15 , 2005 .
I represented myself .
On June 12 , 2006 , the Court entered a decision of " not guilty " for all charges .

Village 's Appeal Dismissed by jcr13 Sunday , January 14 , 2007 [ 10:16 am ]
In November 2006 , I filed a motion with the County Court asking that the Village 's appeal be dismissed ( on the grounds that their Notice of Appeal attempted to paint my acquittal as a dismissal , and on the grounds that an acquittal is not appealable ) .
In mid-December , I received notice from the County Court that the my motion had been granted and the appeal had been dismissed .
I will post more details about this when I have a chance .

Village Appeals My Acquittal by jcr13 Friday , July 21 , 2006 [ 11:04 am ]
After I received the decision of " not guilty " from the court , I knew that the long process ( nearly a year ) of fighting a court battle was finally over .
After all , the government cannot appeal an acquittal --- such an appeal is forbidden by the double jeopardy clause of the Constition .
Jeopardy attaches when the trial starts , and it ends when a verdict of acquittal is issued .
An appeal , therefore , would start a second round of jeopardy .
Many people that I talked to after the decision , including village officials , were suprised when I told them that an appeal was impossible .
Of course , most people are not all that familar with constituional law or court precedents ( nor was I before I got pulled into this ordeal ) .
You can imagine my shock when , on July 14 , 2006 , I received a large envelope in the mail from the Village Attorney .
That envelope contained a notice of appeal to county court of the " dismissal " and an affidavit of errors .
Note that orders of dismissal ( when a judge drops charges before a trial begins ) are appealable by the government , but acquittals are not .
I suspect that this " mistake " in wording in the notice of appeal was intentional on the part of the Village Attorney --- he may be trying to make a unappealable ruling look like an appealable ruling .
However , I will probably never know for sure .
On July 17 , 2006 , I appeared to speak at a meeting of the Village Board .
Before I spoke , I had a brief meeting with the Village Attorney in the hallway .
I said that I was suprised about his appeal , given all the caselaw forbidding it on double jeopardy grounds .
He said this was not double jeopardy and that the people appeal " dismissals " all the time .
I corrected him , saying this was an acquittal , not a dismissal .
He said that he thinks the judge was wrong and that it is common practice for county courts to review errors committed in justice courts .
He said I could try arguing on double jeopardy grounds if I wanted , but that it was not double jeopardy .
I asked for a precedent case on the matter , and he said he was not going to argue about it .
I read a few Supreme Court quotes to him about acquittals , and he refused to comment .
I then spoke in front of the Board , explaining double jeopardy to them , and reading lots of Supreme Court quotes about acquittals .
I finished by asking them to abide by their oath of office and uphold the Constitution .
I asked them to drop their frivolous appeal .
My request was covered on Page 2 of the July 18th edition of the Potsdam Massena Courier Observer .
The Board seemed to ignore me .
On July 19 , I filed a motion with the Village Court that it reject the notice of appeal as defective ( since it refers to a " dismissal " which never was issued ) .
After the fact ( today ) , I talked to a lawyer who does not think this motion will fly --- the Village Court operates in a relatively mechanical fashion after an appeal is filed .
The Court will send its return and the record to the County Court even if the notice of appeal is defective .
So , I may end up arguing in the County Court after all .
My initial defense will be relatively easy to argue : double jeopardy forbids this appeal .
Every lawyer that I have talked to agrees that this appeal violates double jeopardy protections .
And here I thought that this round of my fight was over .

Court Decision : Not Guilty by jcr13 Tuesday , June 13 , 2006 [ 12:15 pm ]
Yesterday we received a call from the Court clerk : our decision was ready .
My wife and I , with our child Mez in tow , plodded reluctantly to the courthouse with our hearts pounding .
My wife was convinced that the verdict would be " guilty . "
We were pleasantly shocked to find that the Court ruled in our favor .
After all this time and all this uncertainty --- I was at a loss for words and almost came to tears right there in the clerk 's office .
The decision itself is available here .
To sum up the decision , the judge ruled that the the Village never intended the 10 - inch mowing rule to apply to natural areas --- indeed , the judge observed , there are many other natural areas in the Village that are not being mowed ( such as along the trails in the Clarkson woods , or along the Racquette river banks ) .
The judge stated that he must apply the ordinance equally to all natural areas , including those that are intentionally created on residential lots .
He also noted that the wording in the ordinance was vague and , if interpreted literally , overbroad .
The decision was covered as the front page ( above the fold ) headline story in the Potsdam Massena Courier Observer today ( " Rohrer Can Keep His Meadow " ) .
The decision was also covered on the front page of the Watertown Daily Times along with a cover photo ( " Grass Greener For Potsdam Man " ) today .
I just finished my interview with the TV reporter from the News 10 Now .
The coverage resulted in a 2 minute video story which can be viewed online .
WWNY Channel 7 also ran a story .

Still still waiting by jcr13 Friday , May 26 , 2006 [ 9:20 am ]
Our meadow is filling in nicely , with beautiful tussocks of grass here and there , many now over two feet tall .
I planted sunflower seeds in a few places along our street frontages .
To my delight , we have several great mulleins that have sprouted up in the front yard .
We had many in the back yard last year , but those did not come back .
The white clover that we planted is taking over in certain spots , forming dense green blankets .
But we are still waiting for a decision from the court .
I talked to the Village Administrator today ( not about our trial , but about next week 's village - wide aerial BT spraying for forest caterpillars ) .
At the end of the call , he brought up " my grass " and said they have been asking the court for a decision .
It has now been more than five months since the trial and more than four months since the summations were filed .
He said they need a decision soon , because they need to figure out what to do with my yard .
If they do not get a decision soon , they will issue another ticket .
I told him that would count as double jeopardy , and that you can not be tried twice for the same crime .
He said that would be nice if it was true --- then he could only get one speeding ticket in his life .
I responded that multiple acts of speeding count as separate crimes , but this is all one continuous act : my grass was taller than 10 inches last year , it still exceeds that limit , and I have never mowed it .
They cannot issue me a new ticket for a crime while I am still on trial for that same crime .
Since the Village has been pestering the court for a decision , I decided to drop my " let sleeping dogs lie " philosophy .
I called the court clerk to ask what was going on .
She said that she has been reminding Tom ( the judge ) that a decision is overdue .
He is taking a long time because he has been doing a lot of research on the matter .
She has given him a deadline of next Wednesday ( May 31 , 2006 ) .
She will call me when I can pick up my copy of the decision .
My wife , Lauren , is convinced that they will decide against me at this level despite all of the caselaw , precedents , science , and logic in my favor .
I better get ready to appeal .

Still Waitng by jcr13 Sunday , April 16 , 2006 [ 11:27 am ]
Over four months have passed since my trial ( December 15 , 2005 ) .
I still have heard no word from the court about a decision .
Spring seems to be coming early this year ( possibly due to our unusually warm winter ) , and our meadow is starting to grow again .
Perhaps the judge is waiting to deliver a decision when it actually counts ( after all , you cannot mow a meadow that is covered in snow , so a February decision of " guilty " would have been strange ) .
On the other hand , maybe the judge is taking the case seriously and reviewing all of the documents and case law with close attention .
At the very least , I am certain that he is taking the case seriously .
I took a walk around our neighborhood yesterday and observed that three of the four nearby meadows ( the cornerstones of my equal protection argument ) have still not been mowed .

Summation Filed by jcr13 Monday , December 19 , 2005 [ 6:18 pm ]
Today at around 1 pm I filed my summation with the court .
This 9 - page document summarized and analyzed the trial .
My understanding is that a summation is basically a closing argument in written form .
My summation ended with the following request :
The testimony , evidence , and case law show that the mowing ordinance is being enforced against our natural landscape in a manner that violates the free speech , equal protection , and due process clauses of the United States and New York constitutions .
I request that the Court return a verdict of " not guilty " on these grounds .
By filing this document , I have completed my last step in this trial .
I now must simply wait for the judge 's decision .

Trial Story by jcr13 Monday , December 19 , 2005 [ 5:22 pm ]
My trial was on December 15 , 2005 .
Now that a few days have passed , I feel compelled to document my memory of it before I forget some of the finer details .
First of all , it was an experience of a lifetime .
The trial lasted over three hours ( from 10:30 am until after 1:30 pm ) and the arguments were somewhat subtle and complex .

A newborn humpback whale is lifted clear of the water by its mother to take its first breath .

Advertisement " In the past , people thought birds were stupid , " laments the aptly named scientist Christopher Bird .
But in fact , some of our feathered friends are far cleverer than we might think .
And one group in particular - the corvids - has astonished scientists with extraordinary feats of memory , an ability to employ complex social reasoning and , perhaps most strikingly , a remarkable aptitude for crafting and using tools .
Some corvids , such as rooks , live in large groups Mr Bird , who is based at the department of zoology at Cambridge University and is supervised by Dr Nathan Emery , says : " I would rate corvids as being as intelligent as primates in many ways . "
The corvids - a group that includes crows , ravens , rooks , jackdaws , jays and magpies - contain some of the most social species of birds .
And some of their intelligence is played out against the backdrop of living with others , where being intelligent enough to recognize individuals , to form alliances and foster relationships is key .
However , group living can also lead to deceptive behaviour - and western scrub jays ( Aphelocoma californica ) can be the sneakiest of the bird - bunch .
Many corvids will hide stores of food for later consumption , especially during the cold winter months when resources are scarce , but western scrub jays take this one step further .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Mr Bird says : " If they are being watched , they will hide their food , but they will do some ' fake hides ' as well - so they 'll put their beak in the ground , but not place the food .
It 's a bit like a confusion strategy .
" Sometimes , if they are being watched , then they 'll even go back and hide the food again . "
You looking at me ?
Corvids ' cognisance of other birds has led scientists to ponder whether they are also aware of themselves .
And to test this , scientists use the Gallup mark test , where an animal is marked on a part of its body that it cannot normally see and is then shown its reflection in a mirror .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
If it notices this mark and tries to remove it , then it suggests that the animal knows it is looking at itself and could possess some kind of self - awareness .
So far , only some species of primates have consistently passed this self - recognition test , although more recent studies suggest elephants and dolphins may also respond .
But last year , a German team revealed that magpies , marked with a coloured sticker under their beaks , tried to remove it when presented with a mirror - the first time a bird had been seen to pass this test .
Professor Onur Gunturkun , from Ruhr - University Bochum , one of the authors of the Plos paper , says : " It throws out the assumption that only higher mammals were capable of self - recognition . "
Tool tales
While the birds ' social intelligence has continued to impress , it is perhaps their physical intelligence , and in particular their tool use , that has stirred the most interest .
Recent studies reveal that corvids ' tool - use may at least rival , and even surpass , that of primates , such as chimpanzees .
And one species in particular possesses an extraordinary ability - the New Caledonian crow ( Corvus moneduloides ) , which is found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia .
Russell Gray and his colleagues from the department of psychology at the University of Auckland have studied this species extensively , and were the first to discover that the birds were crafting tools in the wild .

Advertisement Professor Gray tells BBC
News : " They do some really complex looking things .
" We have seen that they take a whole branch , chop off the side branches and hone away at the end to create a hook , which they use to get grubs . "
Other experiments carried out at field stations have even shown that the birds will use a number of different tools to reach a tasty snack .
Brainy Betty
Inside the laboratory , captive New Caledonian crows are also helping scientists to better understand tool use and corvid intelligence .
What has led to just this one species in this one little island in the Pacific being able to make these complex tools ?
Professor Russell Gray
And one bird in particular seemed to posses a remarkable ability when it came to solving problems using tools - Betty .
Alex Kacelnik , who leads the behavioural ecology group at Oxford University , said : " Betty was captured as a juvenile from the field , and she must have been one - and - a - half years old when she came to us .
And we did n't have any reason to suspect that she was an unusual animal . "
Betty 's tool use surprised the researchers
However the team discovered , by chance , that Betty was able to perform some remarkable feats that had never been seen before in any other animals .
The researchers were testing how New Caledonian crows selected tools by presenting them with a small bucket filled with some food , which was placed in a well , and pieces of wire , some straight and some with a hook at the end .
The aim was to see whether the crows would select the bent wire to retrieve the treat - laden bucket .
But Betty astonished researchers when she selected a straight piece of wire and then used her beak to bend it into a hook so she could pull up the bucket of food .
When she was later tested with just the straight wire , Betty repeatedly bent it into hooks - and other experiments with aluminium strips revealed how she would bend , shorten and lengthen the material to get to her food .
This was the first time that any animal had been seen to make a new tool for a specific task , without an extended period of trial - and - error learning .
' The million dollar question '
As scientists discover ever - more intelligent behaviour in corvids , they are now trying to understand why this group has developed these special abilities .
And New Caledonian crows ' tool - use is a key focus .
How do you define intelligence ?
How do you define what does it means to understand something ?
Dr Christian Rutz Professor Gray explains : " What has led to just this one species in this one little island in the Pacific being able to make these complex tools ?
It 's an ongoing mystery . "
Professor Kacelnik agrees : " This really is the million dollar question .
" We know that this is heritable - we have demonstrated that if you raise New Caledonian crows , without exposure to any social input , they still would want to use tools to solve problems . "
Researchers are also looking at the cognitive processes that underpin this behaviour .
Mr Bird says : " The interesting thing is that they can do so many of these clever things that primates can do - sometimes they can do them even better .
But their brain is completely different from the mammalian brain .
" They do n't have the area of the mammalian brain that is thought to be the area of intelligent cognition - the neocortex .
" Interestingly , they have another area , the nidopallium , that might do the same job . "
Corvid intelligence research is still in its early days
As scientists try to understand this , the research is also driving forward some more fundamental questions about intelligence .
Christian Rutz , who also works for Oxford 's behavioural ecology group , says : " There are such enormous semantic issues .
How do you define intelligence ?
How do you define what it means to understand something ? "
We have to be careful with ascribing intelligence to seemingly impressive behaviours , he says .
He explains : " Not everything that looks smart to the human observer is actually smart .
" For example , take orb web spiders .
These animals build sophisticated structures for foraging , but would we call this behaviour ' intelligent ' ?
Probably not . "
He says to understand what the birds are doing and whether this sets them apart in any way , the same experiments need to be carried out , multiple times , on many different species , to properly compare results .
Dr Rutz adds : " People tend to think corvid cognition research is now incredibly advanced and we 've answered most of the questions - I do n't think so , I think it is at the very beginning . "

The entire press and media world goes on 24h strike across Greece in response to the closing down of a major daily and radio station , in a context of rising repression and urban guerrilla warfare .
On the 24th of June 2009 , the entire press and media apparatus of Greece came to a standstill due to a 24h strike of press and media workers in response to the surprise shutting down of Eleftheros Typos , one of the country ’s oldest right - wing newspapers , and the popular City Radio , both owned by the tycoon and president of the 2004 Olympic Games , Mrs Angelopoulou .
The closing down of the daily and radio station came with no previous warning and are considered to be the first major effect of the global economic crisis in the country .
The industrial solidarity action that took place on the 24th and deprived the entire country of newspapers and news broadcasts on both radio , TV and the Internet is a first response to the sacking of 450 workers of the joint business .
At the same time workers occupied the offices of the newspaper and the radio station .
The press-media crisis and labour struggle come at a time of renewed tension across the country despite the summer holiday season .
Social polarisation , which is seen by many as a result of the December Uprising , peaked again last week with yet another urban guerrilla attack by the Sect of Revolutionaries , a group that had attacked a police department and a TV station with automatic weapons last winter .
This time the country came to a standstill as guerrillas executed an officer of the elite and secretive anti-terrorist bureau who was guarding the only accusation witness in the so - called Revolutionary People ’s Struggle ( ELA ) trial .
The trial , which is going through the appeal court , has been accused by the vast majority of the legal world as a sham ( the accusation witness is in fact the ex-wife of the chief accused ) , putting innocent people through a long and painful ordeal on non-existent evidence regarding their involvement in the urban guerrilla group that disbanded in 1995 after 20 years of action .
In their much - publicised communiqué , the Sect of Revolutionaries promised to make Greece bleed , targeting journalists , politicians and fascist leaders , while putting forward a new class theory positing at its epicentre as an archenemy what the guerrillas call the Lumpen Petty - Bourgeois Class .
The assassination and the communiqué have created havoc in the government , which has been trying to introduce a series of tough ‘ Law and Order ’ laws of disputable constitutional validity and judicial applicability .
The new police - state legislation introduced by the frail 1 - MP majority right - wing government , which secured the backing of the tiny fascist party ( LAOS ) , include : a ) immediate extradition of any ‘ foreigner ’ ( non - greek citizen , including EU citizens ) who is accused ( not convicted ) for a crime that can receive a penalty of more than 3 months ; b ) up to 10 years imprisonment for any greek citizen who ‘ helps or harbours ’ ‘ illegal immigrants ’ , doctors included ; c ) up to 10 years imprisonment of committing any crime or felony ( from spitting on the street to murder ) wearing a hood , or otherwise ‘ disclosing one ’s characteristics ’ , including heavy make - up ; d ) compulsory DNA sampling of anyone convicted to three months of prison or more ; e ) free and unlimited use of blast flash grenades by the police in dispersing crowds .
The new dictatorial measures have been met with hostility of all the political world , fascists excluded , and by the Lawyer ’s Union who has pledged to challenge their validity both in national and international courts .

If you have an oil or a jam - making thermometer , a specialist deep - fryer is uneccesary .
You just dump a few bottles of oil into a big , heavy pot and throw it on a high flame , watching the temperature slowly climb .
The trouble with this is that you need lots of oil , and it ’s messy filtering it back into the bottles ( when cold , of course ) .
So we actually like this mini - fryer from Deni , which sits on the countertop or can be stowed full , and best of all can fry with just a quart of oil ( around one liter ) thanks to it ’s compact form and tall , narrow shape , meaning you do n’t need a huge investment in grease just to get started .
There ’s also a frying basket , a magnetic safety cable ( like the MacBook Mag Safe connectors ) and a thermometer , which should on no account be trusted : use your own to double - check it .
The fryer maxes out at a French - fry - browning 375 ºF ( 190ºC ) and costs a reasonable $ 45 .
Buy it now and enjoy the health benefits of quick - sealed , deep - fried , low - fat food .

Re : Conditional Convergence , or when Addition Is n’t Commutative
I ’m writing in response to an apparently deleted blog post that was submitted to Reddit about conditional convergence .
The post was incorrect … well , perhaps nonsensical would be a better phrase .
But even though I ’m more of an algebraist , conditional convergence is still an interesting idea .
So I ’m taking my response there , and turning it into a new post .
Most people probably know that the infinite series ( 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + … ) diverges .
Even though the numbers in the sum keep getting smaller and approach zero the further you get out the sequence , you can still add up enough terms of this sequence to surpass any number you like .
It just might take a long time .
Now here are a couple other simple consequences of that .
Even if you throw away a bunch of terms from the beginning of the sequence , it still diverges .
Hopefully , this is obvious .
Even if you only add up every other term , it still diverges .
( Proving this by contradiction is fun if you have n’t done a lot of basic analysis .
All you need to know is that if each term of one series
A_n is closer to zero than the corresponding term of a series B_n , and B_n converges , then A_n converges , too . )
Okay , now lets consider the sequence we ’re really interested in :
1 – 1/2 + 1/3 – 1/4 + 1/5 – 1/6 …
The difference between this sequence and the original is that every other term is negative .
Now , it ’s not hard to see that this series actually converges .
But what does it converge to ?
Well , in the order it ’s given here , it converges to something between 1/2 and 1 .
But the interesting point here is that I can rearrange the terms of this sequence to give it any convergence behavior I want .
I can make it converge to any real number x .
I can make it diverge toward positive infinity .
I can make it diverge toward negative infinity .
I can even make it jump around back and forth between 0 and 1 but without actually converging anywhere .
And with all of these different convergence behaviors , I am still going to use the same terms of this series … just add them in different orders .
Making The Series Converge to x : Suppose I choose a real number x , and I want my series to converge to x .
Easy .
For simplicity , I ’ll assume x is positive , but it ’s easy ( and obvious ) to modify this for x negative , as well .
I ’ll start out just taking the positive terms of the sequence …
1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + … , and I ’ll keep going that way until the sum is strictly greater than x .
( How do I know that it will eventually become strictly greater than x ?
Because I am just adding up every other term of that first sequence , and we agreed that sum diverges to infinity .
So I ’ll reach x in some finite number of terms .
As soon as the sum surpasses x , I ’m going to start including negative terms …
– 1/2 – 1/4 – 1/6 … and so on .
I ’ll continue that way until the sum drops back down below x again .
Then I ’ll swap back to the positive terms , and so on .
I claim this uses all the same terms as the original series … but instead of converging to something between 1/2 and 1 , it converges to any real number x .
( If x is negative , the process is the same , except you start with negative terms .
And if x is zero , you start with whichever you prefer . )
Here ’s why that is .
Suppose you ’re looking for term n of the original series .
In the rearranged series , it wo n’t occur at position n .
But every time I switch directions , I ’m taking at least one term from that direction … so term number n is guaranteed to occur somewhere in the first n direction changes .
Each direction change is only finitely long ( as we saw above ; this is a consequence of the fact that the strictly positive series diverges ) , so term n occurs at some finite index in the sum .
So every term appears , and by the way I chose terms , I know I did n’t introduce any new ones , or duplicate any of them .
The terms are the same ; only the order differs !
But this new series definitely converges to x .
Right at each direction change , we overshoot x by a little bit .
But the amount that we overshoot x in the sum is always no more than the last term picked in the sequence … and as we choose more terms both on the positive and negative sides , the largest unpicked term is decreasing .
So over time , we start overshooting by smaller and smaller amounts , and the sum converges .
Making the Series Diverge to Positive Infinity : I can also make the same series , with the same terms , increase without bound , thereby diverging to positive infinity .
The trick it to use the negative terms , but just use them much less often .
So add positive terms until you get to , say , 2 .
Then negative terms until you get back down to one .
Then positive terms until you reach 3 .
Then negative terms until you ’re back down to 2 .
Keep that up and you get a divergent series .
Change the numbers a bit , and your series diverges to negative infinity instead .
You can even keep the sum from approaching infinity , while also preventing it from converging to any particular finite sum .
Add positive terms up to 1 .
Add negative terms until you get back to zero .
Positive terms back up to 1 . Repeat .
The details of proving that you ’ve got the same terms , and that the series actually shows the desired behavior , are similar to the first case .
So that ’s conditional convergence .
You really can take a series that conditionally converges , and make it show any behavior you like simply by rearranging the terms .

Medical Malpractice Case Results
$ 3.25 Million Settlement in Medical Malpractice Action Against Nurse Midwife For Failing To Timely Deliver Baby
The Plaintiff was a young female delivering her second child .
The first was delivered by c-section .
This time she desired a vaginal birth .
She engaged the services of a midwife to perform the delivery .
During the labor non reassuring signs and symptoms of a cord compression became apparent .
Plaintiff alleged the midwife negligently delayed notifying the mother ’s treating OB / GYN of these signs and symptoms resulting in a delayed delivery .
As a result , the child suffered a form of brain damage .
The midwife denied she was negligent , argued the baby ’s injuries were caused by a preexisting condition , and blamed other healthcare providers .
The case settled shortly before trial for $ 3.25 million .
$ 2.8 Million Settlement In Medical Malpractice Action Against Physicians And Hospital For Failing To Timely Provide Liver Transplant
The plaintiff was an adult male who presented to the hospital emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute liver failure .
Subsequently , he was diagnosed with acute liver failure and admitted for treatment .
No cause was determined so the only treatment available was a liver transplant .
Unfortunately , due to a series of medical and administrative errors a delay occurred in obtaining funding for the liver transplant .
By the time the funding was in place and the plaintiff was transplanted , the liver failure had caused the plaintiff to develop a hypoxic encephalopathy .
This condition subsequently led to his death .
He was survived by a single minor child .
The case settled shortly before trial for $ 2.8 million .
$ 11 Million Settlement In Medical Malpractice Action Against Physicians And Hospital For Failing To Timely Diagnose And Treat Stroke
The plaintiff was an adult male who presented to the hospital emergency department with signs and symptoms of a stroke .
The triage nurse examined the plaintiff and diagnosed a stroke but failed to inform the emergency room physicians of this view .
The emergency room physicians at first believed the plaintiff ’s condition was due to illicit drugs .
This was possibly due to the emergency department ’s history of treating patients with drug - related presentations .
However , the plaintiff ’s family denied any history of illicit drug consumption .
A routine CT was ordered and performed that was misread as normal when in actuality it showed two clots in the brain .
Ultimately , all lab work and toxicology screens proved negative ruling out illicit drugs .
Because the emergency room physicians did not connect the plaintiff ’s symptoms with a stroke presentation , no stroke alert was called .
Instead , the plaintiff was admitted to the floor with a diagnosis of general encephalopathy and an order for a neurology consultation .
Subsequently , the plaintiff ’s condition worsened causing him to fall out of bed .
Another CT was performed that was again misread as normal .
The plaintiff ’s condition continued to deteriorate until the plaintiff ’s wife insisted on the performance of an MRI .
An MRI was performed that detected the subject blood clots and led to the stroke ’s diagnosis .
Unfortunately , by this time no medicinal or surgical treatments were available to treat the stroke .
Also , the plaintiff developed increased intracranial pressures requiring in the performance of a craniotomy to relieve the pressure and another surgery to reimplant a section of his skull that was removed as part of the craniotomy .
After that the plaintiff went through extensive rehabilitation and ultimately reached maximum medical improvement .
He was left with severe physical and cognitive impairments .
He will never use his arms , walk or speak normally again .
He also will never work again in any capacity .
He is married with two children .
The defendants denied any negligence arguing that the plaintiff ’s complaints were not specific enough to point to a stroke and further that even if they were negligent there were no treatments available that would have avoided or significantly lessened the plaintiff ’s ultimate injuries .
The case settled before trial for a total of $ 11 million .
$ 7,000,000 Settlement For Catastrophic Internal Injuries Caused By Failed Radio Frequency Ablation Procedure
The plaintiff was a 63 - year - old male diagnosed with a suspicious kidney mass .
His urologist referred him to a hospital interventional radiology department for consultation regarding the mass .
The interventional radiologists recommended the mass be biopsied and eliminated using radio frequency ablation .
The interventional radiologist negligently performed the ablation procedure causing a perforation to the plaintiff ’s colon and duodenum .
This led to catastrophic injuries , including the loss of function to both kidneys , massive infections , damage to his heart , multiple fistulas and other injuries .
The interventional radiologists and hospital denied any negligence .
The case settled for $ 7,000,000 shortly before trial .
$ 3.25 Million Settlement In Medical Malpractice Action Against Physicians And Hospital For Failing To Timely Diagnose And Treat Spinal Epidural Abscess
The plaintiff was an adult male who developed complaints of mid back pain .
A series of physicians attributed his pain to soft tissue disorders of the spine .
His physicians recommended pain management .
Before his pain management appointment could take place , the plaintiff developed severe and unrelenting acute mid back pain that required hospitalization .
His treating physicians managed his back pain medically pending his pain management appointment .
However , during the four - day hospitalization his complaints worsened from pain to bilateral weakness in the arms , to chest numbness to ultimately paralysis of both legs .
No action was taken to investigate the progressing complaints until the plaintiff could not walk .
At that time , an emergency MRI was performed that revealed a spinal epidural abscess .
That led to emergency back surgery to remove the abscess and other surgeries .
However , by the time the surgery was performed , it was too late to reverse the bilateral leg paralysis .
Plaintiff was left with a permanent paralysis of both legs .
The plaintiff alleged the hospital nurses and multiple treating physicians were negligent by failing to timely appreciate , investigate , diagnose and treat the abscess .
The defendants denied any negligence , blamed each other and further argued the abscess was not treatable .
The case had unique challenges because the physicians carried low liability insurance coverage .
The case settled globally for $ 3.25 million prior to trial .
$ 2.5 Million Settlement In Medical Malpractice Action Against Hospital And Physicians For Failing To Timely Diagnose And Treat Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
The plaintiff was an adult woman who developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP .
She went to the hospital emergency department and was subsequently admitted to the floor .
Due to a series of delays and miscommunications , the plaintiff never received any treatment for the condition for approximately 12 hours .
As a result , she died leaving a husband and multiple survivors .
The plaintiff alleged the hospital and multiple treating physicians were negligent for failing to timely diagnose and treat the TTP .
The defense denied any negligence and further argued the TTP was not treatable .
The case settled for $ 2.5 million prior to trial .
$ 1,000,000 Settlement For Wrongful Death Of 67 - Year - Old Husband For Failing To Appreciate Signs And Symptoms Of A Cardiac Tamponade

He was diagnosed with complete heart block and underwent the placement of a pacemaker .
Following the insertion of the pacemaker , the man developed chest pain and then the pacemaker stopped functioning .
Throughout the evening and night , in addition to continued chest pain , the man ’s blood pressure dropped , he developed nausea and vomiting and shortness of breath .
The hospital ’s nurses failed to notify the cardiologist of these changes .
In the early morning , the man had cardiac arrest .
During the course of resuscitation , he was diagnosed with a cardiac tamponade secondary to one of the pacemaker wires perforating the heart .
As a result of the cardiac arrest , the man suffered irreversible brain damage , was ultimately disconnected from life support and subsequently died .
The defendants offered arbitration .
The case settled for $ 1,000,000 .
$ 700,000 Settlement For Wrongful Death Of Eight - Month - Old Special Needs Child

Federal judge taking long look at Prop. 8 SAME - SEX MARRIAGE
A federal judge said Tuesday he 's inclined to leave California 's ban on same - sex marriage in effect for now , but wants an early trial to determine whether the voter - approved prohibition violates the U.S. Constitution 's guarantee of equality .
In his first response to the lawsuit challenging Proposition 8 , Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco said the case raises numerous issues that may need to be considered at a trial , including the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians and the intent and effects of the state constitutional amendment .
Two same - sex couples filed the federal suit last month , four days before the state Supreme Court upheld Prop. 8 in separate proceedings as a valid amendment to the California Constitution .
The November ballot measure invalidated the court 's May 2008 ruling that struck down a law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
The couples , represented by Theodore Olson and David Boies - the lawyers for George W. Bush and Al Gore in the case that decided the 2000 presidential election - say Prop. 8 violates the U.S. Constitution by denying equal treatment to gays and lesbians .
Gay - rights groups did not raise that issue before the California court , unwilling to risk a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the right to marry .
Olson and Boies asked Walker to issue an injunction at a Thursday hearing that would suspend Prop. 8 and allow same - sex couples to marry while the case proceeds .
In Tuesday 's order , the judge said he has tentatively decided instead to move " directly and expeditiously " to a trial on the constitutionality of the measure .
Halting enforcement of Prop. 8 at this stage " may inject still further uncertainty , " Walker said .
He noted that any couples who married as a result of an injunction would be unclear about their status until a final ruling .
The judge said lawyers at Thursday 's hearing could discuss how the case should proceed .
Olson said he was pleased with Walker 's approach , even though the ballot measure will remain in effect .
" He 's taking the case very seriously , " Olson said .
" We 're prepared , willing and able to move as fast as the judge is willing to go . "
Attorney Brian Raum of the Alliance Defense Fund , representing sponsors of Prop. 8 , said he sees no need for a trial .
" We think this is an issue of law " that does not depend on disputed evidence , Raum said .
For example , he said , questions of past persecution of gays and lesbians are irrelevant because Prop.
8 allows them to marry , as long as they wed someone of the opposite sex .
" There is no indication that the marriage laws discriminate based on sexual orientation , " Raum said .
" Our position is that from a federal constitutional perspective , there is no fundamental right to same - sex marriage . "
Walker said in his order , however , that past discrimination is relevant in evaluating a law that limits the right to marry .
A related issue , he said , is " whether the availability of opposite - sex marriage is a meaningful option for gays and lesbians . "
He said opponents of same - sex marriage may also need to present evidence to justify their arguments that children are best raised by a married mother and father , and that allowing gays and lesbians to wed " destabilizes opposite - sex marriage . "
Citing the plaintiffs ' argument that Prop. 8 was motivated by antagonism toward homosexuals , Walker also said he may want to take a look at campaign ads and ballot arguments to establish voters ' intent .
Raum said none of that was necessary .
He said the voters ' intent is clear from the text of the measure , which reads in full : " Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . "
Bill Moyers weighs in on the appointment of Regina Benjamin for Surgeon General and the influence of money on the health care debate .
BILL MOYERS : This week , Regina Benjamin was nominated by President Obama to be our next surgeon general , charged with keeping the American public informed about our health .
She 's a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association and recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ' Genius Grant . '
But more important , she 's a country doctor , a family physician along the Gulf Coast of Alabama , serving the poor and uninsured .
After Hurricane Katrina destroyed her clinic a second time , she mortgaged her own home to rebuild it .
The day it was to reopen , a fire burned the clinic to the ground .
Moving to a trailer , Dr. Benjamin and her staff never missed a day of work .
Dr. Benjamin will no doubt bring that same ethic to the fight for health care reform .
Many of the folks in Regina Benjamin 's bayou town are so poor that sometimes she 's paid with a pint of oysters or a couple of fish .
She buys medicine for her patients out of her own pocket , and she makes house calls .
Now meet H. Edward Hanway , the Chairman and CEO of Cigna , the country 's fourth largest insurance company .
At the beginning of the year , Cigna blamed hard economic times when it announced the layoff of 1,100 employees .
But it reported first quarter profits of $ 208 million on revenues of $ 4 billion .
Mr. Hanway has announced his retirement at the end of the year , and the living will be easy , financially at least .
He made $ 11.4 million dollars in 2008 , according to the Associated Press , and some years more than that .
That 's a lot of oysters , although he lags behind Ron Williams , the CEO of Aetna Insurance , who made more than $ 17 million dollars last year , or John Hammergren , the head of McKesson , the biggest health care company in the world .
His compensation was nearly $ 30 million .
Here 's the difference .
To Dr. Regina Benjamin , health care is a service , helping people in need with grace and compassion .
To Ed Hanway and his highly paid friends , it 's big business , a commodity to be sold to those who can afford it .
And woe to anyone who gets between them and the profits they reap from sick people .
That behavior includes spending nearly a million and a half a day - - a day !-- to make sure health care reform comes out their way .
Over the years they 've lavished millions on the politicians who are writing and voting on the bills coming out of committee .
Now it 's payback time .
See for yourself here on our website , where you 'll find a link to campaign contributions and the politicians who right now are deciding who wins and who loses the heath care debate .
That 's it for the week .
I 'm Bill Moyers and I 'll see you next time .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was today undergoing medical tests after he felt unwell while exercising .
In a brief statement officials said Mr Sarkozy " felt faint " today and his personal doctor immediately took charge of him .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Television reports said Sarkozy was hospitalised after his morning jogging session .
Mr Sarkozy , 54 , was elected in 2007 and is regularly seen running .
He is also a cycling enthusiast .
He last underwent a medical examination July 3 , when his cardiovascular and blood tests were normal , the medical service of the Elysee said .
His first medical bulletin , issued shortly after his 2007 election , said Mr Sarkozy 's health was " good " and compatible with his presidential duties .
During his campaign , Mr Sarkozy campaigned for greater transparency on presidential health bulletins , as it was claimed several previous French presidents had concealed health problems from the public .
However , Sarkozy 's short hospital stay for a throat problem in the autumn of 2007 was revealed only three months later .
Orange stars live longer than the sun and are less violent than red dwarf stars , making the planets around them good candidates for hosting life ( Illustration : ESO )
The universe ’s best real estate for life may be around stars a little less massive than the sun , called orange dwarfs , according to a new analysis .
These stars live much longer than sun-like stars , and have safer habitable zones – where liquid water can exist – than those of lighter red dwarf stars .
Stars similar in mass to the sun , categorised as a yellow dwarf , have received the most attention from planet hunters .
But recent research suggests orange dwarfs may provide an even better hunting ground for life - bearing planets .
Edward Guinan of Villanova University in Pennsylvania , leads a team that has been studying how the properties of stars vary with mass .
The team is using observations from a variety of sources , such as archival measurements from the ROSAT X - ray satellite , and more recent measurements from ground - based telescopes .
Long lifetimes
The results confirm that red dwarf stars , which weigh between 10 and 50 % as much as the sun , are far more prone to unleashing powerful flares that can deliver deadly radiation to nearby planets .
This activity declines as the red dwarfs age , and scientists have not ruled out red dwarf planets as potential abodes for life , but any such life would certainly face some big challenges .
Advertisement
Orange dwarfs , on the other hand , with masses between 50 and 80 % that of the sun , have only a little bit more flare activity than sun-like stars .
They would also provide a haven for life for a much longer time – roughly double the 10 - billion - year lifetime of a sun- like star .
Moreover , they change very little in brightness compared to sun-like stars .
Our own sun has brightened by about 30 % since the solar system began , and will likely make Earth too hot for life in about 1 billion years , even though the sun will still have about 5 billion years of fuel left to burn .
Good targets
The odds of intelligent life arising may be better on planets around orange dwarfs than sun-like stars , given the extra time available for it to evolve .
That makes orange dwarfs not only good targets for habitable planet searches , but for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) as well , Guinan says .
“ There are old ones around – some are 8 to 9 billion years old , and could have planets that are more evolved , ” he told New Scientist .
Orange dwarfs are about three to four times as abundant as sun- like stars , making planet searches easier .
Indeed , some planets have already been found around orange dwarfs , though outside the stars ’ habitable zones .
But Gregory Laughlin of the University of California , Santa Cruz , says it should be possible with current technology to find Earth - mass planets in the habitable zones of nearby orange dwarfs .
“ They do seem to be a sweet spot for prospects of actually detecting habitable planets , ” he told New Scientist .
Guinan discussed his research this week at an astrobiology conference in Baltimore , Maryland .
What do comedian Will Ferrell and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford have in common ?
Both have been to the Land of the Lost .
Let 's just hope Sanford fares better ...
Most of us can escape for a few hours or maybe even a day or two without a lot of hoopla .
When you 're a standing governor , you do n't get that luxury .
You live under a microscope .
You 're lucky if you can hit the restroom without an escort .
This all makes today 's news that South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford has been missing for four days outright astonishing .
Sanford apparently left the governor 's mansion in a black SUV on Thursday .
His last known whereabouts , according to phone records , was somewhere near Atlanta .
His wife told the Associated Press that he needed time away from their children to " write something " .
Apparently his children are really annoying or his writing project was really important , as he turned off both of his mobile phones ( state and personal ) and had n't responded to text messages or emails .
Is everyone in a panic ?
Nah .
The First Lady said she was n't concerned .
The Lt. Governor 's office said Sanford has been reached .
And his office put out a statement this afternoon .
" Gov . Sanford is taking some time away from the office this week to recharge after the stimulus battle and the legislative session , and to work on a couple of projects that have fallen by the wayside .
We are not going to discuss the specifics of his travel arrangements or his security arrangements . "
Perhaps they wo n't talk about security arrangements because the governor gave them the slip too .
One state senator told Columbia 's State newspaper that Sanford has made a practice out of sneaking out .
" I was recently made aware that Governor Sanford has frequently been eluding [ gubernatorial security ] agents and disappearing at odd times , " Senator Jake Knotts said .
" As the head of our state , in the unfortunate event of a state of emergency or homeland security situation , Governor Sanford should be available at all times to the Chief of [ security ] , " the senator said .
Gary Karr , who served as press secretary to former South Carolina Governor David Beasley , agrees .
He told The Vote that " someone should know where Sanford is . "
" He 's the CEO of a multi- billion operation , " Karr said .
" Does n't mean everybody and his brother needs to know , but someone needs to be able to reach him . "
" Governors should be allowed some time off , but if you are serious about running a state someone should know where you are at all times , " he continued .
" It 's early and probably not much of a threat , but it is hurricane season .
It 's just a wee bit important for the governor to be reachable in those sorts of emergencies
Did Karr ever lose Gov. Beasley ?
" Me personally , I do n't recall any time where I ' lost ' him , " Karr said .
" But , I am pretty certain he never went on an extended trip without at least one security detail . "

In the game of chess , bishops play a very important role both in attacking the opponent ’s King as well as in defending one ’s own King , especially using its unique capability of moving along the diagonals .
Before dwelling further into the attacking aspects of the bishop , let us recollect some of the basic features of the opening principles .
In the opening stages of the game , we were taught that the pawn movements should be kept to the minimum such that the minor pieces such as knights and bishops are developed .
Then the next thing one is advised to do is to go for castling either on the kingside or in the queenside , whereby the King is safeguarded , and the rooks at the flanks are brought to the center of the first or last ranks .
Mere castling of the king will not guarantee 100 % safety and the castling should be followed with adequate precautionary measures in order to avoid devastating attack on the kingside by the bishops along the diagonals , especially the light - squared white bishop .
Sounds strange – is it not ?
Read on .
This attack is primarily suitable for the player using white pieces when and only when the opponent castles on the kingside and the king is placed at g8 with pawns placed at f7 , g7 and h7 respectively .
The broad idea is to sacrifice the light - squared bishop of white by capturing the pawn at h7 , drawing the king out and using the knight at g5 and the Queen moved to the “ h ” rank to say checkmate .
This attack on the castled black king by sacrificing the light - squared white bishop at h7 is called as the classic bishop sacrifice .
This is one of the oldest attacks on the castled king , tried and tested as early as early 1600s , as writing about this attack is found in Gioachino Greco ’s handbook in 1619 .
It is believed that Greco introduced this classic bishop sacrifice and as such the attack is also referred to as Greco ’s sacrifice by some of the writers .
Before exploring more about this Greco ’s sacrifice or classic bishop sacrifice , let us look at the game played by Greco where he employed this attack successfully .
As per Greco ’s handbook of 1619 , he reached the position in the game as given below after six not particularly intelligent moves .
( White to move )
Now , here comes the brilliant display of white involving the classic bishop sacrifice .
The mainline of the game is as follows :
7. Bxh7 + Kxh7 8 . Ng5 + Kg8 9 . Qh5 Re8 10 .
Qh7 + Kf8 11 . Qh8 # 1 – 0
There ends the game in white ’s favor after the sacrifice of the light - squared bishop .
In Part 2 of Attacking castled King with the classic Bishop sacrifice we will look at some of the variations and how to play those variations for a win .

The United States used more solar , nuclear , biomass and wind energy in 2008 than in 2007 , according to a new report that shows overall energy use dropped .
The nation used less coal and petroleum in 2008 compared to the previous year , and only slightly increased its natural gas consumption .
Geothermal energy use remained the same .
The estimated U.S. energy use in 2008 was 99.2 quadrillion BTUs ( " quads " ) , down from 101.5 quadrillion BTUs in 2007 , according to the report released today by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
The drop , however , came as a result of declines only in specific sectors .
Energy use in the industrial and transportation sectors declined by 1.17 and 0.9 quads respectively , while commercial and residential use slightly climbed .
The drop in transportation and industrial use — which are both heavily dependent on petroleum — can be attributed to a spike in oil prices in summer 2008 .
Last year saw a significant increase in biomass with the recent push for the development of more biofuels including ethanol , the report concludes .
" This is a good snapshot of what 's going on in the country .
Some of the year - to year changes in supply and consumption can be traced to factors such as the economy and energy policy , " said A.J. Simon , an LLNL energy systems analyst who develops the energy flow charts using data provided by the Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration .
Simon said the increase in wind energy can be attributed to large investments in wind turbine technologies over the last few years as well as better use of the existing turbines .
Nuclear energy also saw a slight increase from 8.41 quads in 2007 up to 8.45 quads in 2008 .
While no new nuclear power plants came online in 2008 , the existing plants had less down time .

The Chaser is successful because it makes fun of things that niggle everyone - ridiculous rules , stupid things politicians say , children 's names that are n't really names , annoying warehouse clearance ads .
With the " Make a Realistic Wish " skit , The Chaser forgot that formula .
Dying children do n't niggle anyone .
No one has a gripe with the Make - a - Wish Foundation .
Most of us respect the work they do and feel sympathy for the children and their families .
All The Chaser did was trigger those feelings , and make it worse .
There 's no fun for anyone in that .
Cathy Chase Wollstonecraft
As I know all too well from almost every working day in the transplant units at the Children 's Hospital , Westmead , the Make - a - Wish and Starlight foundations contribute to the morale and sheer capacity to cope of families whose children have life - limiting illnesses .
The sketch by The Chaser , which sneered at this commitment , was not only an emotional denigration of all involved , but must also put at risk the donations on which those foundations depend .
In the current tough financial times , those funds are diminishing .
Any argument that The Chaser might help by drawing attention to them is distasteful .
Even if that were its aim ( which is not plausible ) , the ends hardly justify such means .
Diana Carmody Roseville
With all the outcry about The Chaser , the websites that ran the story with links to the skit and the broadcasters that showed at least part of it demonstrated extreme hypocrisy .
If it was that bad , no footage should have been shown , particularly after the ABC cut it from repeats .
Pip Denton Guildford
With regard to the suggestion that anyone who was offended send a donation to the Make - A - Wish Foundation , perhaps the Chaser team should donate the money they were paid for that episode .
Janita Rankin Killara
The Chaser skit achieved what it set out to do , and that was to start debate about issues that are seen as taboo .
Let us debate the role of charities such as the Make - a - Wish Foundation .
As a doctor , I can tell you sick children want two things : to get better and to go home .
If you are concerned about sick children , donate to medical research or make it an election priority .
Research works , and that is why children now survive diseases that were once terminal , such as leukaemia .
Such charities pander to parent guilt and have become self - serving .

The Chaser 's segment was tasteless , but it reminds me of a key credo of theatre : " Comedy is for thinking , drama is for feeling . "
Maybe , just maybe , The Chaser has stimulated some thinking .

I suppose The Chaser must be working on a skit about Chris O'Brien ( " Tumour claims cancer specialist " , June 5 ) .

There 's a red herring in the dead parrot case
Bob Carr starts with a fundamental error ( " Rights charter like a dead parrot " , June 5 ) .
As advocates for a human rights act we are not proposing judge - made law .
We propose that Parliament , after considering the public 's views and in response to our obligations under international rights instruments , make a law to protect vulnerable individuals from abuse by government and government agents .
The mentally ill , old people in nursing homes , disabled children , the homeless , refugees and others can be , and often are , mistreated in the name of government policy .
We want a law that provides checks and balances on such policy by the lawmakers themselves .
We want Parliament to actively monitor the protection of the rights it sees fit to legislate .
There are no constitutional obstacles to drafting such a law , as the recent statement from experts including Michael McHugh , Sir Anthony Mason and Catherine Branson established .
We have put forward a model bill to show how such a law fits without problems into our legal and political system .
The constitutionality of protecting rights is a red herring .
Let 's move onto the purpose of our proposal : the recognition and protection by Parliament , the executive and the courts of the rights and dignity of all .
Susan Ryan Chairwoman , Human Rights
Act for Australia Campaign
Bob Carr says more judge - made law is the last thing Australia needs .
Maybe so , but politicians can give us worse , like the law Carr pushed through to introduce poker machines into hotels .
This was a bill of rights for publicans to fleece a new generation of problem gamblers .
Joe Payne Coogee I would have more confidence in the Human Rights Commission , with its record of exposing the suffering of the stolen generations and children in detention , protecting my rights than most elected politicians .
In many cases these are the people we need protecting from .
Rather than entrenching the obstacles to rights protection presented by the constitutional mess we live in , we could simply enact into our legislation the many fine - minded instruments we signed up to .
How radical would it be , for example , to have an Immigration Act that no longer breached the Convention on the Rights of the Child ?

Hobbled first test If John O'Neill is to use tonight 's Wallabies match as a litmus test for rugby at the Sydney Football Stadium ( Ruck & Maul , June 5 ) , he should talk to CityRail first .
The stadium is ideally situated for public transport .
But today there are no trains on the North Shore , Western , Northern , Epping - Chatswood , Central Coast or Hunter lines .
At least make it a fair test .
Peter Elwin St Ives Caught red- handed
My father used to say you could do what you liked - just do n't get caught .
Joel Fitzgibbon cannot honestly believe his downfall was a result of leaks by traitors in his office and department .
All they did was release information about what he , the Minister for Defence , did .
Come on big fella !
Ross Butler Manila Joel Fitzgibbon blames staffers for dobbing him in .
Does this mean it is all right to breach the ministerial code of conduct as long as you do n't get caught ?
Gwen Goodman Dubbo
It does n't say much for a country 's weaponry when a defence minister has to fall on his sword .
Morris Graham Georgetown Obama message of hope Barack Obama 's Cairo address will go down as one of the greatest by a US president .
His message delivers hope to many , but I fear will be unwelcome by those who , for whatever reason , do not want real peace .
Greg Loder Springwood Barack Obama has called on the Palestinian people to abandon violence in their quest to gain statehood : " Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed . "
I 'm sure this would have been news to George Washington and the other American revolutionaries who heard Patrick Henry 's call of " Give me liberty or give me death ! " and took up arms against the British to obtain their own two - state solution .
Nathan Cassidy Florey ( ACT ) Barack Obama needs to learn that rhetoric is no substitute for principles and consistency .
How can he claim with a straight face that the US supports the " equal administration of justice " after spending the previous day showing his support for King Abdullah and his horrendously unjust Saudi regime ?
I trust the Islamic world will see through this hypocrisy and maintain its justified scepticism towards the true motives of the US .
Chris Rice St Ives Sharing the blame
Henk Verhoeven ( Letters , June 5 ) may be correct that US pro-life groups have condemned the shooting of George Tiller .
However , their constant campaign of intimidation , harassment and hate certainly contributed to his death .
John Paul Cenzato Leura Surgeon who inspired I was saddened to learn of the early demise of my hero , Chris O'Brien ( " Tumour claims cancer specialist " , June 5 ) .
I met him in 2007 when undergoing radiation for my tumour .
I was relieved to know I was not alone in experiencing brain cancer , or finding the medical profession was n't all that professional .
Chris took the time to talk to me and reminded me I needed hope .
I did - I had hope in Chris .
I hoped he had the voice to make things better for people like me .
I believe he has gone a long way to doing so .
More changes will happen long after he has gone , but many of us will never forget where it all started .
Thanks .
Sarah Kauter Umina Just accentuate the negative Jim Ayling ( Letters , June 5 ) has an eye for the absurdity of economic speak , but we may not call our quarterly GDP outcome a " positive contraction " .
That would be mathematically incorrect , since a negative by a positive is always a negative .
The situation demands a double negative .
We experienced a negative contraction .

One woman , one vote Fearful as I am to open my male trap on the subject , I must take issue with Sarah Johnson 's view ( Letters June 5 ) that women have been " playing catch - up " on voting rights .
South Australia started the ball rolling in 1894 , and women could vote federally from the 1903 election .
I think 106 years is long enough to let that one go - although the North Sydney Bears have been waiting almost as long for a premiership , and still carry on about all the obstacles the other sides have put in their way .
Chris McGinness Erskineville Tamsin Lloyd ( Letters , June 5 ) , no one " opposed " a greater profile for women 's sport - they implied it had to be earned .
This is a reflection of the problem .
You can demand all you like , but unless you have something valuable to offer , your demands will fall on deaf ears .
Sam Fields Seven Hills
It 's all in a day 's work Andrew Symonds finished work and went out for drinks ( " Symonds sent home for booze breach " , June 5 ) .
He also had a few beers watching the State of Origin .
That is exactly what I did .
Lots of adults do .
And then we go back to work the next day .
Is it no longer in the Australian character to occasionally ( or regularly ) bypass authority ?
Can all be forgiven if a chastened Andrew brings in a letter from his mum ?
Then , as a child , he can be scolded for not putting up his hand before asking to leave the room , using swear words or whatever .
As a man , he can bat and bowl for Australia .
Barry Dalton Hong Kong
To save his trip being a complete waste of time , Andrew Symonds should have a stab at Boonie 's record on the flight home .
Gary Andrew Bardon ( Qld ) Welcome back , Andrew Symonds .
Rugby league needs you .
Stephen Driscoll Carlingford POSTSCRIPT
Is Australia racist ?
Was The Chaser sketch offensive ?
Does women 's sport get a raw deal in the media ?
Not really , yes and it depends which gender you ask , to judge by readers ' responses this week , although there were quite a few reservations in each case .
Perhaps worryingly for the Chaser team , the ringing condemnation of their skit was less of the " more in sorrow than anger " and more of the " this series is n't funny anyway " variety .
It was on for young and old when it came to grim medical themes .
As well as tackling terminally ill children , readers wrote about assisted euthanasia ( generally in favour ) , infant circumcision ( mostly opposed ) and the murder of the US abortion doctor George Tiller .
Nor were suffering animals exempt , thanks to the ban on Animal Liberation 's " caged eggs " ads on CityRail trains .
That debate drew inevitable comparisons with the treatment of commuters , after Monday 's story on overcrowding .
The trains coming from the Ku-ring - gai district will be even more full if the State Government has its way on increasing the density of suburbs along the North Shore line .
If our inbox is any guide , there will be mobs of polite , well - dressed residents assembling in Macquarie Street with pitchforks and blazing torches before that process is complete .

Shiny girl : Kim showed off her legs in super glittery leggings
Kim and her younger sister Khloe has embraced the Eighties theme for roller - skating at the Pepsi Throwback Launch Party at World on Wheels .
Also in attendance was Kelly Osbourne and The Hills reality stars Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth .
Kim appeared to have ditched the blonde locks she so excitedly showed off just three days ago .
The socialite stunned fans when she admitted her new blonde look was just a wig .
Ready to skate : Kelly Osbourne ( L ) brought a pair of pink sparkly skates , while Hugh Hefner 's former girlfriend Holly Madison wore an all - pink outfit
She wrote on her Twitter micro-blogging page : ' My blonde hair is a wig !
Ha ha , did I have you fooled ? '
Several fans claimed the blonde wig made the 28 - year - old look like Jennifer Lopez or South African model Tracy McGregor .
Famous rear : Jennifer Lopez and her curvaceous behind
One fan wrote : ' You look very pretty as always .
Reminds me of Jennifer Lopez meets Jessica Alba .
The darker hair definitely makes you unique . '
However , whether Jennifer Lopez will be so pleased about the comparison is debatable .
The singer 's curvaceous behind earnt her a legion of fans - and caused many women to attempt to copy her style .
And even now J.Lo is said to tailor her exercise routine to ensure she does not lose it .
Thankfully absent yesterday was the severe sunburn that Kim was sporting on her face just over a week ago .
Kim was left red-faced - literally - when she fell asleep in the sun wearing sunglasses while holidaying in Mexico .
She posted pictures of her sunburn on her Twitter page , admitting she regretted not using sun protection .
After flying into New York last week , Kim was forced to cover up her sunburn with lashings of foundation ahead of her appearance on a U.S. chat show .
During her stay in Manhattan she also picked up a tub of Kiehl 's Anti-Oxidant Skin Preserver cream , which she credited with healing her sunburn .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney have the political power to decide who they want to let into Canada and who they want to keep out .
With the power to make these decisions , a pattern has emerged where the current Conservative government has laid out the red carpet for former U.S. government officials such as George W. Bush , Bill Clinton and Condoleezza Rice .
While other people seeking entry or residency to Canada have encountered nothing but a locked door and an unwelcome mat .
Or , if they currently reside in Canada , they are about to be kicked out .
With a strong case being built around charging Bush with war crimes , why was he allowed into Canada without question or scrutiny by the government and Royal Canadian Mounted Police when others have been denied ?
Again , it comes down to political choices and political will .
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Jason Kenney , has made numerous public statements defending the impartiality of Canada ’s immigration system but a developing pattern is emerging regarding who is on Canada ’s Most Wanted vs. Most Un - wanted list -- so much so that Jason Kenney has been dubbed by Canadian activists as the new “ Minister of Censorship and Deportation . ”
While Kenney has stated that the Ministry of Immigration and Citizenship is separate from the country ’s immigration system ( and denies the ability to interfere politically ) , the operational truth is that these two political entities work in conjunction with one another .
For example , Minister Kenney has the ability to shape the immigration policy , the basis of the immigration system .
Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness , Peter Van Loan , who is in charge of Canada Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) , has control over this enforcement arm of the Canadian immigration system .
This means Kenney has the power to table legislation and set policy to prevent a deportation and Van Loan could grant a waiver to halt a deportation by the CSBA .
If they wanted to .
Here ’s an overview of who Canada has let into this country , who it has kept out and who it is currently trying to kick out .
Who ’s in
On Friday May 29 , 2009 , Presidents “ W. ” Bush and Clinton were invited to come to Toronto to speak about their legacies as U.S. presidents .
The event was sponsored by such corporations such as the Globe and Mail , TD Financial Group , Nayarit Gold Mining and the Toronto Board of Trade .
Protesters outside the Convention Centre where the two men spoke were more concerned with the presidents ’ legacies regarding war crimes :
- President George W. Bush and his administration for their actions in Iraq , including his declaration of pre-emptive war and his support of CIA - operated rendition sites and torture practices .
- President Bill Clinton and his administration for working through the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on Iraq between 1990 - 2003 and for the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 .
Bush had previously visited Calgary , Alberta for another speaking engagement on March 17 , 2009 .
Protesters in both Calgary and Toronto were infuriated to hear that Canada had allowed suspected war criminals to freely enter the country .
Upon hearing that Bush would be travelling to Canada , Lawyers Against the War ( LAW ) issued a statement to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) asking that Bush be denied entry into Canada under Canada ’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act -- Section 35 ( 1 ) ( a ) , because Bush is a war criminal under Canada 's Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act -- Sections 4 to 7 / subsections 6 ( 3 ) to ( 5 )
Along with Clinton and Bush , other prominent members of the Bush ’s administration , or Bush ’s “ war allies , ” have been allowed to enter Canada .
These include : Condeleezza Rice ’s ( former U.S. Secretary of State ) visit to Calgary on May 13 , 2009 ; Michael Chertoff ’s ( former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security ) visit to Ottawa on February 23 , 2007 ; John Howard ’s ( former Prime Minister of Australia and member of Bush ’s Coalition of the Willing ) visit Ottawa on May 18 , 2006 ; and Donald Rumsfeld ’s ( former U.S. Secretary of Defence ) visit to Banff , Alberta on September 13 , 2006 .
Canada ’s decision to allow individuals such as Bush to cross the border establishes the trend of an open - door , blood - red carpet policy of inclusion to those who are suspected of committing war crimes
According to writer Joshua Blakeney , “ It is clear that Canada is increasingly perceived to be a ‘ safe haven ’ for self - confessed torturers and war criminals who have committed what at Nuremburg -- reflecting upon the unilateralism and genocidal practices of Nazism -- was defined as the ultimate war crime of aggressive war . ”
Who ’s Out
Juxtaposed against the list above of individuals Canada has allowed to cross its borders are individuals who have been denied entry or repatriation ; the list of ' who ’s out ' reads like a black - list of prominent foreign peace activists and current Canadian citizens .
The most notorious case being that of British MP George Galloway , who was denied entry into Canada by the Canadian Border Service Agency ( CBSA ) on March 20 , 2009 , right before his Canadian speaking tour , because he was considered a threat to national security .
Citizenship and Immigration Minister Kenney could have overturned the decision but chose not to do so .
The Federal government cited the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act ( IRPA ) , Section 34 ( 1 ) , which reads among other points of order , that refusal can be based on whether , “ e ) engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada ; or ( f ) being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages , has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph ( a ) , ( b ) or ( c ) . ”
Along with Galloway , other peace activists and progressives who have been barred entry into Canada include : Reza Alijani ( an award winning Iranian journalist with Reporters Without Borders ) and ; Shadi Sadr ( a women ’s activist in Iran ) were denied entry into Canada in early May , 2009 ; and Ann Wright ( retired U.S. Army colonel and peace activist ) and Medea Benjamin ( co- founder of Code Pink ) , who were denied entry into Canada on October 22 , 2007 .
Along with these peace activists , Canada has so far refused to repatriate Canadian citizens held in a hellish legal and diplomatic limbo , thus denying them re-entry into the country .
One such case is that of Omar Khadr , a Canadian citizen held captive in Guantanamo Bay for the past six years who seeks repatriation .
Khadr was captured by American forces at the age of 15 following a four - hour firefight with militants in the village of Ayub Kheyl , Afghanistan .
He has spent six years in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps charged with war crimes and providing support to terrorism after allegedly throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier , but has yet to face a U.S. military tribunal .
The youngest person held in Guantanamo bay and the only Western citizen left , the Canadian government has so far refused to demand his repatriation to Canada .
On June 12 , Prime Minister Harper told Fox News that “ that Canada is not willing to take in Guantanamo Bay detainees . ”
This despite an April 23 , 2009 Federal Court ruling ordering the government of Canada to seek Omar Khadr 's repatriation from the United States .
Another Canadian citizen suspended in diplomatic limbo is Abousfian Abdelrazik , a Canadian citizen from Montreal who is currently stranded in Sudan , literally living inside the Canadian embassy for more than a year .
Abdelrazik was arrested on potential terrorism charges back in 2003 but the Sudanese government had released him without charges .
Both the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligent Service ( CSIS ) have similarly stated they both have no evidence against him .
Regardless of his innocence , the Canadian government has refused to allow Abdelrazik back into Canada despite a June 4 Federal Court ruling which orders the Federal government to repatriate him .
Who ’s being kicked out
Included in the list of Canada ’s most un - wanted are also those foreign nationals or refugee status applicants who face the threat of deportation from Canada because of the politics these individuals embody .
These include foreign nationals currently being held on Canadian Security Certificates .
According to writer Justin Podur , “ The entire security certificate process is based on urgency in placing someone in detention and ignoring due process , followed by a long , dragged out detention . ”
Although major changes were made , including a February 2007 Federal Court ruling that struck down the security certificate system as violating the Canadian Charter , a re-vamped security certificate system still remains in place in Canada .
Podur writes ,
“ In response to legal challenges to these secret deportation trials and opposition to draconian long - term detentions of people without trial , the government has released many of its detainees on house arrest .
These include Mohamed Harkat , Mohammad Majoub , Mahmoud Jaballah , Adil Charkaoui , and most recently Hassan Almrei .
Despite the pressures to ignore the lack of evidence , the courts have slowed down the government 's rush to persecute these men . ”
If the government ’s security certificates withstand further court challenges , deportations of these men will begin .
Iraq war resisters seeking permanent residence status in Canada are another group of individuals and families facing impending deportation back to the United States in the coming months , where they face military court marshals and less - than honourable discharges from the U.S. military for their conscientious objections to being deployed to Iraq .
Canadian Parliament passed two majority motions in support of resisters , but Kenney has spoken out against them as a group from his position as minister in charge of immigration , referring to them as “ bogus refugee claimants . ”
Kenney was rebuked by writer John Hogan in a Toronto Sun article , where Hogan claimed the Minister was interfering politically in the cases of war resisters by speaking publically , exposing his government ’s bias .
While a spokesperson from Kenney ’s office later stated that resister claims are being handled through what the government has called “ independent tribunals , ” Hogan countered , “ The immigration officers who are deciding the war resisters ' applications do not constitute ‘ independent tribunals . ’
They exercise decision - making authority delegated to them by the minister of citizenship and immigration . "
Lee Zaslofsky , an organizer with the War Resisters Support Campaign ( WRCS ) , called Minister Kenney 's comments political interference on the supposedly independent Immigration and Refugee Board ( IRB ) tribunal , which passes judgment on resisters ' immigration claims .
He said , " Minister Kenney 's comments show the Harper government has a blanket policy of opposition against war resisters , which makes it nearly impossible for them to be treated on a ' case - by - case basis ' as our government has been leading Canadians to believe . "
Criticism of Minister Kenney 's remarks was also expressed through an open letter by Elizabeth McWeeney , President of the Canadian Council of Refugees .
In the letter , written on January 8 , 2009 , she stated her concern surrounding Kenney 's comments which she called , " highly inappropriate , " since they " give the strong appearance of political interference . "
Fear and exclusion
Take all the separate elements of exclusion from Canadian society through the Canadian immigration system and put them together and the common factor between all the different groups of the un-wanted revolve around our perception of ‘ national security ’ ; as if the current government is using fear to force to public into a false decision between people ’s security or a person ’s right to not be discriminated against based on someone else ’s politics .
Again , it all comes down to political decisions .
Ask yourself : would you rather our government allow a suspected war criminal into this country , or someone who promotes peace or simply wants to live here in peace ?

NEW DELHI :
The government seems to be drawing a parallel between rising acreage of illegal opium cultivation and the mounting terror of Red ultras ��� both now spread across a dozen - odd states .
Sporadic reports , coinciding with anti-narcotics operations , suggest that part of the proceeds from the illicit trade goes into funding of Maoist insurgency .
Weeks before the Red ultras called for a bandh in five states to protest against the ongoing crackdown by paramilitary forces , the Director General Central Economic Intelligence Bureau ( DGCEIB ) had written to all chief secretaries and heads of anti-narcotics agencies and departments concerned urging them to initiate steps to eradicate cultivation of illicit opium that has now spread over 10 states .
The Centre had provided satellite images and shared other inputs pinpointing areas where opium crop was grown on large tracts running into thousands of hectares .
The government had asked the Narcotics Control Bureau ( NCB ) , under the home ministry , to provide coordinates such states ��� West Bengal , Jharkhand , Bihar , Orissa and Karnataka .
The areas in the first four states where illicit opium cultivation has been reported are wracked by Maoist insurgency .
Security agencies do n't rule out the fact that Maoists are not only benefiting from the illicit trade but in many parts the crop is being cultivated under their supervision .
The Central Bureau of Narcotics ( CBN ) , under the department of revenue in the finance ministry which oversees legitimate cultivation of opium in the country , has been asked to provide coordinates for five hill states of Himachal Pradesh , Arunachal Pradesh , J&K , Uttarakhand and Manipur .
Last week , CBN , excise officials and state police were involved in an operation to destroy illicit cultivation of opium poppy on 1,100 hectares in Pulwama district in J&K .
Just before the J&K action , officials had destroyed illicit crop on 600 hectares in similar clean - up operations in Himachal Pradesh .
Both the J&K and Himachal crops were enough to produce several tonnes of Afghan - variety heroin worth millions of dollars in the European market .
The wide cultivation is believed to have now spread across six districts in the state reflecting badly on the government 's anti-narcotics checks .
Agencies had earlier carried out operations in West Bengal , Bihar , Arunachal Pradesh among other states and destroyed crops over thousands of hectares .
In West Bengal 's Midnapore and Nadia districts , CBN had destroyed crops over 6,500 hectares in 2007 .
A Roman Catholic adoption agency which lost a battle to defend its pro-marriage ethos from new ‘ equality ’ regulations says it has been left with “ a big dent ” in its reserves .
The Leeds - based charity , Catholic Care , was recently told it must consider gay couples as potential adopters under the Sexual Orientation Regulations ( SORs ) , despite its belief that children need a mother and a father .
Chief Executive Mark Wiggin said the charity had needed two barristers and five solicitors to help wade through the detail of the case .
Things became even more complicated when the Equality and Human Rights Commission was allowed to intervene against the group .
The case was one of the first to be heard by the new Charity Tribunal appeal system , which promised to make the process quicker and cheaper for groups to challenge decisions made by the Charity Commission .
But Mr Wiggin said : “ The costs are prohibitive for most people ; it has made a big dent in our reserves . ”
Terry Sanderson , the President of the National Secular Society , said : “ This is the cost of bigotry .
There could be absolutely no justification for the Equality Laws to be breached on the basis of religious dogma . ”
Although the Tribunal ruled against Catholic Care , it noted that the charity was “ a well - respected voluntary adoption agency which has made a significant contribution to the provision of adoption services in this country and facilitated many successful adoption placements ” .
Speaking at the time of the ruling , a spokesman for Leeds Diocese said if the decision caused the closure of Roman Catholic adoption services “ a flagship service of the charities will be lost ” .
He added : “ We are concerned about the possible impact this will have on potential adoptive parents and children . ”
LOS ANGELES / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Along with a vast musical legacy and legions of adoring fans , pop superstar Michael Jackson leaves behind a mountain of debt and an unfulfilled comeback many hoped would rake in millions and erase his financial troubles .
Pop star Michael Jackson gestures during a news conference in Munich 's Olympic stadium in this June 9 , 1999 file photo .
Jackson , the child star turned King of Pop who set the world dancing but whose musical genius was overshadowed by a bizarre lifestyle and sex scandals , died on June 25 , 2009 .
He was 50 .

The King of Pop died suddenly on Thursday at the age of 50 , after a career spanning 40 years that included the biggest - selling pop album of all time , “ Thriller . ”
Despite taking in hundreds of millions of dollars as one of the most successful pop musicians of all time , Jackson racked up about $ 500 million of debt , according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month .
His top assets , however , including copyrights to his own songs and a stake in the Beatles ’ song catalog , are worth more than $ 1 billion , according to a music industry source .
Jackson ’s career and image were tarnished by his mounting financial and legal troubles in recent years .
Known for huge shopping sprees for toys and antiques , Jackson was accused by an accountant during his 2005 trial on child molestation charges of spending $ 20 million to $ 30 million more than he was bringing in per year .
The lavish lifestyle was made possible in part by a $ 200 million loan secured by his stake in the Beatles catalog .
Jackson owned the music in a joint venture with Sony Corp known as Sony / ATV .
Jackson refinanced those loans in 2006 in a bid to stave off insolvency .
In addition , Jackson last November had to hand over the title on his Neverland estate in California to a company made up of himself and Los Angeles - based real estate investment trust Colony Capital LLC , the firm that holds his $ 23 million loan on the property .
Colony Capital has been sprucing up the ranch and planned to sell it , according to the Journal .
Colony Chief Executive Tom Barrack told the newspaper last month the estate could fetch $ 70 million to $ 80 million , or more if Jackson ’s career were revitalized .
In a statement on Thursday , Barrack said he was “ deeply saddened ” by Jackson ’s death , but did not comment on the impact on Colony ’s business .
PLANNED BIG COMEBACK
To help turn around his financial fortunes , Jackson was planning a major comeback in London this summer , 12 years since his last tour .
AEG Live , which was promoting the 50 - concert run at the 02 Arena , stands to lose as much as $ 40 million if its insurance is not substantial enough to cover what it has already spent on the production , Billboard reported , and one attorney said the company would not be able to recover any of those costs from Jackson ’s estate .
“ The concert promoters ca n’t sue the estate , ” said Bob Rasmussen , dean of the Gould Law School at the University of Southern California .
“ Once he dies , he does n’t have any obligation to perform . ”
AEG , wholly owned by privately held Anschutz Co , will also certainly miss out on the $ 400 million the company estimated it could raise through a 3 1/2 - year plan to work with Jackson .
But Jackson ’s greatest financial returns may come in the wake of his death .
His long - term record company , Sony Music Entertainment , will likely reissue special versions of some his biggest - selling albums and possibly even rare recordings .
Google dehnt sein Tätigkeitsfeld immer weiter aus und kommt Microsoft , das bei Internet - Suche und - Anwendungen bislang kein glückliches Händchen bewiesen hat , auch in seinem ureigensten Feld in die Quere : Ein eigenes Betriebssystem kündigte der Suchmaschinenprimus an .
Damit muss Microsoft bei Betriebssystemen neben Linux mit einem weiteren ernsthaften Konkurrenten in einem Markt rechnen , der immer noch eine der wichtigsten Stützen für das Geschäft des Softwareriesen aus Redmond ist .
Bereits mit dem Handy - Betriebssystem Android , das auf Initiative von Google von einem Firmenkonsortium als Open Source entwickelt wird , konnte Google die etablierten Mitspieler im Markt für Handy - Betriebssysteme überraschen .
Google Chrome OS sei anfangs vor allem für Netbooks gedacht .
Unter der Schlagzeile " Introducing the Google Chrome OS " erklärten Sundar Pichai , Google - Vizepräsident für Produkt - Management und Linus Upson , Engineering Director bei Google , die Betriebssysteme , auf denen Webbrowser wie Google Chrome liefen , seien in einer Ära gestaltet worden , als es kein Web gegeben habe .
Chrome OS solle dagegen eine natürliche Erweiterung von Google Chrome sein – " es ist unser Versuch , zu überdenken , was Betriebssysteme sein können . "
Google gibt sich gewohnt selbstbewusst und verspricht Anwendern ebenso wie Entwicklern für das neue System einiges : Erste Geräte mit Chrome OS sollen bereits in der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 2010 auf den Markt kommen ; Chrome OS solle wie Android als Open Source zur Verfügung stehen und ein schmales System sein , bei dem die Schwerpunkte auf Geschwindigkeit , Einfachheit und Sicherheit lägen , betonten die beiden Google - Manager .
Nutzer sollen durch einen zügigen Start des Systems in wenigen Sekunden ins Web gelangen können .
Die Bedienoberfläche werde sparsam gestaltet :
Sie soll den Anwendern nicht im Weg stehen ; der Hauptteil der Aktivitäten finde im Web statt .
Chrome OS soll sowohl auf x86 - als auch auf ARM - Prozessoren laufen ; ein Linux - Kernel bildet die Basis für Google Chrome innerhalb eines neuen Window - Systems .

A brave people went in their millions yesterday to vote for the next president of Iran .
They went for the right reasons and they went for the wrong reasons but they wanted a say in how their country is governed .
In their tens of thousands , they waited in Tehran amid the sword - like heat of summer to insist that they had duties and obligations towards their society .
Alas , the clerical blanket which smothers Iran will ensure that mullahs – not people – ultimately get their way .
Thank you , Ayatollah Khomeini .
Not since the first free Iraqi elections have a Middle Eastern people so staunchly demonstrated their right to be heard .
The last elections in Iran provided a 60 per cent turnout .
Now some were saying it was 80 per cent , even 85 per cent .
I found the mosques and schools of Tehran packed to capacity , the overflow winding back down the hot pavements and across the baking highways .

Never before in Iran – not since the Islamic Revolution that brought all this about – have I heard such a thunder of free speech .
No , it is not a new Iran we are going to see , even if the favourite Mirhossein Mousavi wins the ticket .
( Both Mousavi and the unbalanced Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were last night claiming victory . )
But it will be a little bit stronger than it was before .
Please God , not a little bit more dangerous .
This new spirit could be heard outside the Issar School voting booths in Shaheed Mozaffarikhah Street – yes , of course this martyr died in the 1980 - 88 Iran–Iraq war , but then that awesome conflict had a lot to do with the turnout , as we shall see .
" There are different reasons why I am here , " Mariam Amina said to me , the less courageous voters – who did n't want to talk to the foreign journalist – listening to her every word .
" I was not going to vote – I was n't .
But then I thought my silence would help someone who is not qualified to be president of Iran .
And I thought my one vote would be worth it and that the person who becomes president would be a good president . "
Could there be a better reason for any democrat in the world to vote ?
The psychology student did suggest – unwisely , as I pointed out to her – that the British did not vote in such numbers " because they do n't need to change their government " .
Corruption , I gently offered , is not a uniquely Arab or Iranian phenomenon – but her courage drew others to talk .
A trickle of words turned into a waterfall .
Ehsan , his unwillingness to give his family name told its own story – got the day about right .
" Maybe people are n't here for the voting , " he said .
" Maybe it 's only a political demonstration against the regime .
We do n't have any way to say why we need to change . "
Minar – suffice it to say that every woman was scarved or chadored , albeit with ever increasing fringes of hair glistening beneath the sun – thought the " unpredictable debates " on Iranian television had a role in bringing the people of Tehran on to their canyon - like streets .
" No one knew what would be said on television .
That 's why so many people are taking part in this election .
The Supreme Leader [ Ayatollah Khamenei ] did n't want those cameras but they were there . "
They were indeed , and there was much conversation among the crowd as to why the long - dead Ayatollah Khomeini had laid this permanent crust of Islamic rule over a real democracy of the people .
Ehsan thought it accounted for the failure of the Mohamed Khatami government , " the chain over us , " he called it .
" There are people surrounding the Supreme Leader and they are all in line with him . "
Then came the shadows that always lie away from the blinding sunlight of Tehran .
A man called Kurosh – " Kurosh " is Persian for Cyrus , as in Cyrus the Great – took me to the shade on the other side of the street .
He did n't want to be heard .
" In the case of Mirhossein [ Mousavi ] , he might have a successful vote , he could save the country freely .
But I think in the next years , there may be a bloodbath in Tehran , because there are two totally divided sides in the country .
All this is silent at the moment ... "
Quite so .
On Thursday , for the second time in five days , the judiciary authorities closed down the pro-Mousavi newspaper Yaseno .
President Ahmadinejad 's boys were at work again .
And as I drove to the poverty of south Tehran – you always know you are heading for the poor here , because all roads to them lead downhill – there were those childish posters of the ever - smiling country boy who is still – just – the President .
Ahmadinejad running in his sports clothes , Ahmadinejad among his smiling people , Ahmadinejad playing football .
Inside the Hasrat Rasoul Mosque – and here we were definitely amid the poverty of the capital – there were three state television cameras ( Ahmadinejad 's work again , of course ) and there were thousands waiting to vote , old bearded men , young labourers , half shaved , in dirty trousers , and on the other side of the " masjid " a row of women , their chadors billowing in dark clouds .
" For Ahmadinejad , naturally , " came the first male voice .
" Because he 's an expert and an uncorrupt person .
I did n't vote for him last time because I did n't know him .
But his plans have always been complete and successful . "
What was this ?
The man who has turned Iran into a laughing stock , who clearly cannot understand economics – reporters do sometimes have to tell the truth – is " complete " is he ?
He is " successful " is he ?
Though at the end , that 's what his election result might prove to be .
Then 52 - year - old Hassan Danesh revealed himself .
He runs a clothing store in the Great Tehran Bazaar .
Same old story , the bazaaris in league with the clerics , just as they were in the 1979 revolution .
Then a shock .
A veteran of the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war , white - haired now , Asghar Naderzadeh stepped towards me .
He was a Basiji , a religiously inspired volunteer to fight Saddam , fought at Shalamcheh , arrived on the front lines at the age of just 14 .
" I want Mirhossein , " he said .
" The war veterans all know him as a good person .
He managed the war perfectly and controlled inflation during this period . "
The old Basiji , it should be understood , were heroes and died for Iran .
The new version , the young men who never fought but cluster around the Supreme Leader , are a political breed .

Another man , after Asghar , nameless this time but voting once more for Mirhossein " because of the way he speaks , his promises ... "
And then , inevitably , the voice of conservative womanhood .
" All the time , Iran is a victory for Muslims .
Everywhere imperialism has intimidated countries .
We are all supporters of the Supreme Leader and the [ Ahmadinejad ] government . "
Untrue .
Samaya was voting for the first time , a job in public relations management , who had listened to all four candidates in the televised debates .
" It 's my responsibility to vote for my president , Mirhossein Mousavi .
His personality is fit for being a president . "
We were all being watched and listened to – at far too close quarters – by a young army officer , a lieutenant with an AK - 47 rifle , unshaven but with hard , strong eyes .
Was this Big Brother , coming to betray those who wished to speak their minds ?
Again , another woman , 27 - year - old Marjan , a student of English translation at Tehran university , in jeans and a long black cloak and scarf .
" I love my country and I love my revolution and I would like a good president for my country , Mr Mousavi .
He helped save our country . "
It seemed the 1980 - 88 war can not go away .
An older lady now .
" We want to protect the blood of our martyrs in the war .
I am the sister of a martyr who died in battle at Fakkeh in Khuzestan , a housewife with two daughters and I want Ahmadinejad . "
Then came the classic illogicality .
" I do n't want Mousavi to be president because he 's going to promote bad ' hijab ' .
We do n't need more freedom for girls to go out in bad dresses . "
She was not alone .
Kobra , a nurse in a scarf and purple coat , wanted the same as the housewife in front of her .
" I vote because of my beliefs , because of love for this country 's Islam and for the blood of our martyrs .
It must be Ahmadinejad .
He is the icon of resistance and courage . "
This was extraordinary .
Kobra was transposing Ahmadinejad from hero of the 1980 - 88 war – which he was not – into hero of the war against George W Bush , a war of threats , to be sure , but certainly not a war of weapons .
And then Kobra surprised us all .
" I think President Obama is approaching Iran properly and this will be accepted in our society .
We want other people in other countries to acknowledge us as human beings .
All of us believe in God , like the Christians and the Jews .
You believe in Jesus , we believe in Mohamed .
We are all the same .
In this election , I am looking for a channel to express my ideas .
Tell everyone that we love Western countries . "
This was a deeply moving statement of love and belief to come from an Ahmadinejad voter but just at that moment , the army lieutenant came up to me , rifle over his shoulder .
" We are persuading these elements that we are having a democracy in Iran , " he told me .
" But democracy is for people who know their own intentions .
Iranian people do n't know what they want .
Democracy will not work here .
People should be educated , then they know what they want .
Do n't you believe that ? "
I said that you cannot filter out the poor from the educated and let only the rich and the powerful rule .
I guessed the soldier was a bright man – I was right , he was a mining engineer in civilian life – but then up came the man from the interior ministry and the man from the governorate and told the soldier he was not allowed to talk to journalists .
And this was when Lieutenant Zuheir Sadeqinejad of the Iranian army replied .
" I was asking the journalist questions , " he snapped back .
" And I have the right to speak . "
And I wondered if – despite his flawed argument – he was n't the greatest democrat of them all .
The expats ' view : ' I knew we had to come out '
With its patio cafés and millionaire mansions , Kensington Court in west London is usually more accustomed to the genteel comings and goings of its well - heeled residents .
Yesterday it could have been mistaken for north Tehran .
Thousands of chanting Iranians gathered outside the Iranian consulate to cast their vote – something that expats have rarely done during previous elections .
But this year 's presidential race has invigorated Britain 's Iranians like never before thanks to the astonishing rallies of the reformist candidate Mirhossein Mousavi .
Maryam Gol , who left Iran in 1974 and now lives with her family in Milton Keynes , was one of hundreds patiently queuing up to vote yesterday afternoon .
It was the first time she had cast a ballot since settling in the UK .
" When I saw just how many young people came out to support Mousavi ,
I knew we had to come out and help them , " she said .
" People truly believe that change is on the way . "
If supporters of the conservative incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were present they were keeping their heads down .
Instead the street was filled with hundreds of young , expectant Mousavi supporters in his green campaign colours and chanting slogans hoping for change .
Students Fasilat Nassiri , 23 , and Behrad Parvar , 25 , were queuing with friends who all said they were voting for Mr Mousavi .
" Refusing to vote is not an option , " said Ms Nassiri .
" I do n't think things will suddenly change but there is a glimmer of hope .
We have to seize that . "

The corruption , and power among those in Cheney 's camp is probably more powerful and ominous than any mafia organization .
The tentacles that run deep into the government are very deep and " invisible " .
Threatening to anyone that confronts them on a legal basis !
Shit happens !
Surely though , intelligence agencies within our government , if there are any within it , that are honorable , with integrity , surely some ( ? ) , need to investigate covertly , before any outright charges and arrests are made .
Our entire democracy depends on it .
9-11-01 has fascillitated this demise of our country .
The numerous questions surrounding that , if answered , may better bring about a conclusion on these matters .
Fathoming the level of criminality within our governmnet is a problem .
It 's beyond what most people can imagine .
The massive security forces surrounding Washington D.C. needs to start protecting that which is outer , from that inner .

Also , any NYC residents reading this need to sign the petition to have a new investigation into 9-11 - 01 .
There are going to be every imaginable attempt to prevent this from happening .
66 % of New Yorkers want this , disbelieving the governmment .
There needs to be an overwhelming show of support through this petition to make it happen , derailing the efforts to squelch it .
Thanks !
Go to the link below to sign , if you are a NYC resident , please !
Thank you so much !

" Democrats are " Republicans .
Sorry but I 've watched America for the last 9 years or so , I can remember thinking in 1999 " we survived without having a nuclear war " , " the cold war is over " , " maybe now great sums of money can be spent on research , medical and scientific " and " how cool , here 's the 21 st. century " .
Talk about disappointed .
I do n't know what the problem is , maybe somebody ( maybe a country ) has enough blackmail on every politician in America or maybe there is just too much money in the system for bribes etc .
But it seems that everything that happens is never in accordance with the will of the people .
Nothing get investigated no matter how big or how many Americans die ... sure a lot of noise is made about " smoking out the bad guys " but its always only words and never actions .
I read that " The United States is putting pressure on New Zealand to contribute more to the war in Afghanistan , warning Wellington that it should act as an ally in case it ever needs US military support . " even when we do n't know why you are killing people in Afghanistan
but we should help ?
Why ?
Is that a threat ?
Your DEMpublicans tell us to kill people in another country or else ?
Do you think some people in Rome talked about these type of things before it collapsed ?

99 here is a cut 'n ' paste from rawstory comments re : Spitzer : Federal Reserve is ‘ a Ponzi scheme , an inside job ’ .
It says it all ...
11 hours ago , yvonne
From “ Unheralded warnings from the founding fathers ” : Thomas Jefferson speaking on the first attempt to establish a central bank in America : “ The system of banking is a blot left in all our Constitutions , which , if not covered , will end in their destruction .
I sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies ; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity is but swindling futurity on a large scale . ”
“ The end of democracy , and the defeat of the American revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of the lending institutions and moneyed incorporations . ”
“ If the people ever allow the banks to issue their currency , the banks and corporations which will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property , until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
“ Paper is poverty …
It is not money , but the ghost of money . ”
“ There is an artificial aristocracy , founded on birth and privelege , without virtue or talents …
The artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government , and provisions should be made to prevent its ascendency . ”
__________________
James Madison speaking on the first attempt to establish a central bank in America : “ History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse , intrigue , deceit and violent means possible , to maintain their control over governments , by controlling money and its issuance . ”
“ It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties .
We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens and one of the noblest characteristics of the late revolution .
The free men of America did not wait until usurped power has strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in precedents .
They saw all the consequences in the principle , and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle . ”
___________________________
Andrew Jackson speaking on the second attempt to establish a central bank in America : “ If congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money , it was given them to use themselves , not to be delegated to individuals or corporations . ”
“ I am one of those who do not believe that a national debt is a national blessing , but rather a curse to a republic , inasmuch as it is calculated to raise around the administration a monied aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of the country . ”
President Jackson told the bankers “ You are a den of vipers and thieves .
I intend to rout you out , and by the Eternal god , I will rout you out ! ” _________________________
Abraham Lincoln speaking on the third attempt to establish a central bank in America : “ The money powers prey on the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity .
The banking powers are more despotic than monarchy , more insolent than autocracy , more selfish than bureaucracy .
They denounce as public enemies all who question their methods or throw light upon their crimes .
I have two great enemies , the Southern Army in front of me , and the bankers in the rear .
Of the two , the one at my rear is my greatest foe .
As a most undesirable consequence of the war , corporations have been enthroned , and an era of corruption in high places will follow .
The money power will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few , and the Republic is destroyed . ”
_____________________
In 1913 , the bankers / corporations finally achieved their goal when the Federal Reserve was created .
President Woodrow Wilson , after having broken campaign promises and betrayed his country by signing into law the Federal Reserve Act : “ I am a most unhappy man .
I have unwittingly ruined my country .
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit .
Our system of credit is concentrated .
The growth of the nation therefore , and all our activities , are in the hands of a few men .
We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world .
No longer a Government by free opinion , no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority , but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men . ”
_________________________________
Congressman Louis T. McFadden ( Congressional Record , June 15 , 1934 ) : “ Every effort has been made by the Federal Reserve Board to conceal its power .
But the truth is , the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the government of the United States .
It controls everything here ; and it controls our foreign relations .
It makes or breaks governments at will .
No man , and no body of men , is more entrenched in power than the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Banks .
These evil - doers have robbed the country of more than enough money to pay the national debt .
What the National Government has permitted the Federal Reserve Board to steal from the people should now be returned to the people .
The people have a valid claim against the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks .
If that claim is enforced , Americans will not need to stand in bread lines .
Homes will be saved .
Families will be kept .
What is needed here is a return to the Constitution of the United States .
The old struggle that was fought out here in Jackson ’s day must be fought over again .
The Federal Reserve Act should be repealed ; and the Federal Reserve Banks — having violated their charters — should be liquidated immediately .
Faithless government officers who have violated their oaths of office should be impeached and brought to trial .
Unless this is done by us , I predict the American people — outraged , robbed , pillaged , insulted , and betrayed as they are in their own land — will rise in their wrath and send a President here who WILL sweep the money changers from the temple . "
NOW THAT WE KNOW WHO THE ENEMY OF AMERICA IS AND HAS BEEN , WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT ?

99 stuff like this scare the crap out of me ...
THE FEDERAL Reserve Board ’s independence is a bit like the judiciary ’s independence .
Absolutely vital for the institution ’s proper functioning , it nevertheless depends on Congress and the president to respect decisions with which they disagree .
In such cases , the best protection for either the Supreme Court or the Fed is to stay strictly within its legally prescribed authority and to act according to principled criteria : legal ones for the justices , technical economic ones for the central bank .
Which brings us to the proposed Federal Reserve Transparency Act , sponsored by anti-Fed crusader Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) in the House and socialist Bernard Sanders ( I - Vt. ) in the Senate .
In the name of open government , it would subject the Fed ’s decisions to a full - blown audit by the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress .
Though the bill has attracted 276 co-sponsors in the House and 17 in the Senate , it is wrongheaded in the extreme .
By opening up the Fed ’s most sensitive interest rate and credit policies to public second - guessing , the bill would create a risk — real and perceived — of monetary policy bent to suit congressional overseers .
This would destroy financial markets ’ faith in the Fed and , by extension , the value of the U.S. dollar , just as surely as a political “ audit ” of the Supreme Court ’s deliberations would undercut public faith in the justice system .
The Washington Post is a traitor to America , if you read the whole article you will see what I mean ...its interest are not America 's interest , it sides with the Fed and the Fed 's only interest is the " Fed " .

GOS , you forgot to mention , after the circle jerk , he will write a sternly worded letter that will make some headlines , passing for action , and satisfying the obamabots .
I would rather see him give each of these criminals a personal visit , drop his drawers , and moon 'em .
At least that would represent some sort of " progress " over his inaction and total capitulation over the past 8 years .

freedomofinfo :
How can anything be a " more on - topic discussion of mr. conyers and his claim to hold bush officials responsible " ?!?!?!?!?!?!
There is nothing else to discuss - it 's all fantasy .
The dems ran on accountability on 2006 and then took impeachment off the table - selling their supporters out .
Little conyers ran a series of " investigations " but would not even enforce subpoenas ( you try to be a no - show an YOU would go straight to jail ) .
After grabbing headlines with bold - sounding statements , conyers would issue a stern warning letter for the friday news dump - he did this repeatedly .
He is going to do nothing .
He is just grabbing headlines .
His wife is in violation of federal corruption laws - who is he to run these investigations anyhow .
He is a direct beneficiary of her corruption .
This is a satire piece that is based on the ridiculousness of the whole situation , which is an insult to the intellegence of all Americans .
There is nothing more to be on - topic about .
The fact that obama has gone alone with virtually every buch administration crime and gives these criminals a free pass should be part of the dialog .
But what else is there to say ?
The thread you link to is mostly just the same ol ' same ol ' with nothing there that is n't already here .
So what 's your point ?

Rep. Conyers Blocked Impeachment and Is Blocking Investigation and Prosecution in His Judiciary Committee Millions of Amercians worked to have Cheney and Bush Impeached .
Most of us thought we could trust and count on Rep. John Conyers to start Impeachment Hearings as soon as he became Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January of 2007 .
We even delivered to Rep. Conyers a petition with over 1,100,000 signatures asking him to start Impeachment Hearings .
The 80 year old congressman who has been in office for 40 + years used to have a great liberal reputation .
Conyers has been described as the “ powerful Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ” but has accomplished very little in protecting our Constitution from the ravages of the Bush - Cheney Administration or bringing violators of our Federal Anti-Torture Laws to justice .
His House Committee is where the Impeachment Process had to be started .
Conyers has been a big disappointment to Impeachment and Torture Accountability Advocates .
He portrayed himself as the Champion of Impeachment in the House , but blocked Impeachment for years and kept Rep. Kucinich ’s Bush - Cheney Impeachment Bills from ever being seriously debated in his committee or voted on .
Conyers accepted an IMPEACHMENT PETITION SIGNED BY 1.1 MILLION VOTERS but IGNORED IT AND HAD THOSE DELIVERING IT ARRESTED .
He never mentioned the 1.1 Million Signature Petition after that day .
Strange behavior from the “ Champion of Impeachment ” .
Conyers is on the board of Progressive Democrats Of America but even they can't get him to do his duty .
Now we see in the Washington Post that a " Conservative Group Calls For Probe Of Conyers - Wife 's Case Raises Disclosure Issue " http://tr.im/uezF and in the Detroit newspapers that Rep. Conyers could be involved in his wife 's Federal Bribery Conviction .

Originally released in 2008 in a limited handmade CD package , " Silent Opening " is an intimate folk / rock debut album from the french songwriter Yonograph ( Yohann Antignac ) .
After playing in different bands and artistic projects , Yohann played solo on stage in 2006 under the name of " Yoan and the Silent Phonograph " .
Why this name ?
Maybe to refer to the good old music values which disappeared day after day ... or maybe just because of the worry of feeling lonely on stage .
The " one man band " became Yonograph in 2010 after many gigs everywhere in France ...

Why the Public Plan Is a Fundamentally Conservative Idea
I 've been trying to figure out how to make this sound like more than a cute argument , because I think it 's actually a point my conservative friends should seriously consider .
In general , there are two ways for firms to adopt an idea .
The government solution -- the socialist solution -- is to impose it on them by legislative fiat .
An example would be Congress passing a law that makes selling New Coke illegal .
The other path is through market competition .
Plummeting revenue and rising market share for Pepsi convince the Coca Cola company that selling New Coke is a bad plan and they should cut it out .
It is perhaps evidence of the triumph of market - based ideas that the public plan falls pretty decisively on the right edge of that spectrum .
The idea here is that the public plan will adopt effective reforms that will then lower its costs and improve its quality .
In response , the private market will follow suit .
But this deal wo n't be around forever .
The public plan is an effort to institute reforms through a market mechanism .
But if it fails , and the health industry does n't manage to bend the cost curve on its own , it 's fairly likely that it will end up on the business end of some serious new regulations .
And at the point that costs become a crisis , those regulations will need to work fast .
That means they 'll be implemented in the government 's way , not the market 's way .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith today became the first Cabinet casualty of the MPs ' expenses scandal , after it was revealed she told Gordon Brown within days of revelations about her finances that she wanted to quit the Government in a reshuffle .
Ms Smith was the most high profile among a clutch of resignations to hit the Prime Minister today , including two further members of his administration .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The moves created a momentum that threatens to de-rail his planned relaunch in the wake of what are expected to be abysmal polling results for Labour in the council and MEP elections on Thursday .
Children 's Minister Beverley Hughes announced she wanted to leave in the shake - up - for family reasons - and Cabinet Office Minister Tom Watson is also expected to step down .
Labour backbencher David Chaytor confirmed he would retire at the next election to contest claims he reaped almost £ 13,000 in taxpayers ' cash on a mortgage that did not exist .
And ex-Cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt , relatively untouched by the expenses furore , said she was not seeking re-election , to concentrate on charity work in India .
Sources close to the Home Secretary said Ms Smith was so hurt by revelations in March - including the humiliation of repaying £ 10 her husband Richard Timney , who works as her assistant , claimed for watching two adult films - that she told Mr Brown just days later that she wanted to quit .
One source said : " She 's been hurt by what 's gone on and it 's been a difficult couple of months for her . "
Another source close to the Home Secretary said she wrote to the Prime Minister at Easter in the wake of disclosures about her expenses to inform him she did not wish to continue in Government .

As well as the outrage over her claim for adult films , Ms Smith was criticised for claiming her main residence was a rented room in the property she shared with her sister .
That allowed her to claim second home allowance on the family home in Redditch , Worcestershire .
It is understood Ms Smith 's decision was influenced not just by the expenses claims but also driven by a desire to spend more time with her family .
Her children , aged 10 and 15 , live with Mr Timney during the week while Ms Smith is in Westminster .
The source defended Ms Smith 's claims compared to later revelations , and said the family " went through " the expenses scandal before the wider story broke , meaning they faced the media attention on their own .
The Home Secretary did not mention her decision as she opened a debate in the Commons this afternoon , but looked on with barely disguised fury as shadow home secretary Chris Grayling paid tribute to her as Britain 's first female home secretary at what he described as her " final appearance at the despatch box " .
Labour Backbencher Mr Chaytor , MP for Bury North , said he made the decision to leave Parliament at the next general election after weekend talks with senior party officials and his constituency party .
He had already been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party and faced the humiliation of being de-selected as a candidate after a forthcoming " star chamber " inquiry .
Announcing his decision to go , Mr Chaytor said that , for the coming months , his " priority must be to explain my errors following allegations over the use of parliamentary allowances " .
" This will be time - consuming and stressful , " he went on , adding that he would not have time for constituency campaigning .
He is to repay nearly £ 13,000 he claimed by continuing to submit £ 1,175 monthly bills for mortgage interest months after the loan was paid off .
Another Cabinet reshuffle casualty could be Chancellor Alistair Darling , whose career is hanging by a thread after he was forced to apologise for , and pay back , hundreds of pounds he wrongly claimed on his taxpayer - funded expenses .
Today he even had to revise the amount he repaid after quoting the wrong figure .
After telling broadcasters last night that he was repaying £ 350 , an aide said today the true sum was nearly double that , at £ 668 .
Transport Secretary Geoff
Hoon was also under pressure after being forced to issue an apology and pay back money after admitting he had " accidentally " overclaimed £ 384 .
Ms Hughes increased the sense of disarray in Westminster by releasing a statement disclosing she had told the Prime Minister she wanted to leave the Government in his next reshuffle , which she said could be " very soon " .
Ms Hughes will also be leaving Parliament at the next election , as will Ms Hewitt , MP for Leicester West .
Both cited family reasons and denied their decisions were related to the expenses scandal .
But they were the latest of 15 MPs who have lined up to hand in their resignation notices since the furore erupted almost four weeks ago .
Another Labour backbencher , Jim Devine , was facing de-selection today after being referred to the party 's star chamber over allegations that he submitted receipts from a firm that may not have existed .
Gordon Brown , struggling to contain the expenses row , is to start chairing a new National Democratic Renewal Council , made up of ministers , from next week .
But his proposals to help rebuild the public 's trust in parliament were again drowned out by the expenses row .
Asked today for his views about Mr Darling and Mr Hoon , Mr Brown 's spokesman said : " He thinks they are both doing very good jobs . "
Mr Darling , on a visit to Swindon , brushed aside questions about the Government 's future , saying : " We want to make sure we support our economy , that we help the people of this country , that we also have the right constitutional framework so people feel confident they can have a say and that when they want things done , they can get them done .
" That 's what we are concentrating on .
Whether it 's today or weeks ahead , that 's what this Government is totally focused on . "
But feverish speculation at Westminster is already turning to the fate of Mr Brown after the impact of the results of this Thursday 's elections sink in among Labour ministers and backbenchers .
And tonight , the SNP and Plaid Cymru announced they would use an opposition day debate next Wednesday to urge the Prime Minister to request the dissolution of parliament and hold a general election .

Hosted VoIP solutions provider Aptela has announced that its working with ClearSight Networks ’ Network Time Machine ( NTM ) to diagnose problems on customer and carrier networks .
Matt Smith , vice president of technology and client services at Aptela , said the solution allows them to quickly and easily maintain network uptime and stave off unexpected outages .
Since Aptela works with so many customer and carrier networks in addition to its own network , it used to be nearly impossible to pinpoint specific issues and their origins .
He said NTM works like a metal detector for finding needle - in - a - haystack problems across all points within the network .
" Now , with ClearSight ’s NTM , we can take retroactive network data , pull up metrics on any call , and identify the source of the problem .
" We are able to resolve issues and performance bottlenecks for our customers and carriers faster , more accurately and with less overhead . "
As a hosted - PBX and VoIP service provider , Aptela routes customers ’ voice and data traffic via the Internet .
For SMBs with limited IT resources and budgets , this method provides the benefits of a scalable and powerful VoIP system without the associated price tag .
However , it also means that Aptela does not have visibility into the network hardware at each customer location .
Smith said that using ClearSight ’s NTM and pre-established metrics , the company now has greater insight and better visibility into any VoIP call , fax , email or phone registration over the network — and may quickly identify possible causes of latency , jitter and other call quality problems .
Hosted VoIP services are on a strong growth trajectory , with a recent Infonetics Research report showing that the VoIP services market grew 33 per cent to USD $ 30.8 billion in 2008 .

Confronting the CIA ’s Mind Maze
If , like me , you ’ve been following America ’s torture policies not just for the last few years , but for decades , you ca n’t help but experience that eerie feeling of déjà vu these days .
With the departure of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney from Washington and the arrival of Barack Obama , it may just be back to the future when it comes to torture policy , a turn away from a dark , do - it - yourself ethos and a return to the outsourcing of torture that went on , with the support of both Democrats and Republicans , in the Cold War years .
Like Chile after the regime of General Augusto Pinochet or the Philippines after the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos , Washington after Bush is now trapped in the painful politics of impunity .
Unlike anything our allies have experienced , however , for Washington , and so for the rest of us , this may prove a political crisis without end or exit .
Despite dozens of official inquiries in the five years since the Abu Ghraib photos first exposed our abuse of Iraqi detainees , the torture scandal continues to spread like a virus , infecting all who touch it , including now Obama himself .
By embracing a specific methodology of torture , covertly developed by the CIA over decades using countless millions of taxpayer dollars and graphically revealed in those Iraqi prison photos , we have condemned ourselves to retreat from whatever promises might be made to end this sort of abuse and are instead already returning to a bipartisan consensus that made torture America ’s secret weapon throughout the Cold War .
Despite the 24 version of events , the Bush administration did not simply authorize traditional , bare - knuckle torture .
What it did do was develop to new heights the world ’s most advanced form of psychological torture , while quickly recognizing the legal dangers in doing so .
Even in the desperate days right after 9/11 , the White House and Justice Department lawyers who presided over the Bush administration ’s new torture program were remarkably punctilious about cloaking their decisions in legalisms designed to preempt later prosecution .
To most Americans , whether they supported the Bush administration torture policy or opposed it , all of this seemed shocking and very new .
Not so , unfortunately .
Concealed from Congress and the public , the CIA had spent the previous half - century developing and propagating a sophisticated form of psychological torture meant to defy investigation , prosecution , or prohibition — and so far it has proved remarkably successful on all these counts .
Even now , since many of the leading psychologists who worked to advance the CIA ’s torture skills have remained silent , we understand surprisingly little about the psychopathology of the program of mental torture that the Bush administration applied so globally .
Physical torture is a relatively straightforward matter of sadism that leaves behind broken bodies , useless information , and clear evidence for prosecution .
Psychological torture , on the other hand , is a mind maze that can destroy its victims , even while entrapping its perpetrators in an illusory , almost erotic , sense of empowerment .
When applied skillfully , it leaves few scars for investigators who might restrain this seductive impulse .
However , despite all the myths of these last years , psychological torture , like its physical counterpart , has proven an ineffective , even counterproductive , method for extracting useful information from prisoners .
Where it has had a powerful effect is on those ordering and delivering it .
With their egos inflated beyond imagining by a sense of being masters of life and death , pain and pleasure , its perpetrators , when in office , became forceful proponents of abuse , striding across the political landscape like Nietzschean supermen .
After their fall from power , they have continued to maneuver with extraordinary determination to escape the legal consequences of their actions .
Before we head deeper into the hidden history of the CIA ’s psychological torture program , however , we need to rid ourselves of the idea that this sort of torture is somehow “ torture lite ” or merely , as the Bush administration renamed it , “ enhanced interrogation . ”
Although seemingly less brutal than physical methods , psychological torture actually inflicts a crippling trauma on its victims .
“ Ill treatment during captivity , such as psychological manipulations and forced stress positions , ” Dr. Metin Basoglu has reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry after interviewing 279 Bosnian victims of such methods , “ does not seem to be substantially different from physical torture in terms of the severity of mental suffering . ”
A Secret History of Psychological Torture
The roots of our present paralysis over what to do about detainee abuse lie in the hidden history of the CIA ’s program of psychological torture .
Early in the Cold War , panicked that the Soviets had somehow cracked the code of human consciousness , the Agency mounted a “ Special Interrogation Program ” whose working hypothesis was : “ Medical science , particularly psychiatry and psychotherapy , has developed various techniques by means of which some external control can be imposed on the mind / or will of an individual , such as drugs , hypnosis , electric shock and neurosurgery . ”
All of these methods were tested by the CIA in the 1950s and 1960s .
None proved successful for breaking potential enemies or obtaining reliable information .
Beyond these ultimately unsuccessful methods , however , the Agency also explored a behavioral approach to cracking that “ code . ”
In 1951 , in collaboration with British and Canadian defense scientists , the Agency encouraged academic research into “ methods concerned in psychological coercion . ”
Within months , the Agency had defined the aims of its top - secret program , code - named Project Artichoke , as the “ development of any method by which we can get information from a person against his will and without his knowledge . ”
This secret research produced two discoveries central to the CIA ’s more recent psychological paradigm .
In classified experiments , famed Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb found that he could induce a state akin to drug - induced hallucinations and psychosis in just 48 hours — without drugs , hypnosis , or electric shock .
Instead , for two days student volunteers at McGill University simply sat in a comfortable cubicle deprived of sensory stimulation by goggles , gloves , and earmuffs .
“ It scared the hell out of us , ” Hebb said later , “ to see how completely dependent the mind is on a close connection with the ordinary sensory environment , and how disorganizing to be cut off from that support . ”
During the 1950s , two neurologists at Cornell Medical Center , under CIA contract , found that the most devastating torture technique of the Soviet secret police , the KGB , was simply to force a victim to stand for days while the legs swelled , the skin erupted in suppurating lesions , and hallucinations began — a procedure which we now politely refer to as “ stress positions . ”
Four years into this project , there was a sudden upsurge of interest in using mind control techniques defensively after American prisoners in North Korea suffered what was then called “ brainwashing . ”
In August 1955 , President Eisenhower ordered that any soldier at risk of capture should be given “ specific training and instruction designed to … withstand all enemy efforts against him . ”
Consequently , the Air Force developed a program it dubbed SERE ( Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ) to train pilots in resisting psychological torture .
In other words , two intertwined strands of research into torture methods were being explored and developed : aggressive methods for breaking enemy agents and defensive methods for training Americans to resist enemy inquisitors .
In 1963 , the CIA distilled its decade of research into the curiously named KUBARK Counter - intelligence Interrogation manual , which stated definitively that sensory deprivation was effective because it made “ the regressed subject view the interrogator as a father - figure … strengthening … the subject ’s tendencies toward compliance . ”
Refined through years of practice on actual human beings , the CIA ’s psychological paradigm now relies on a mix of sensory overload and deprivation via seemingly banal procedures : the extreme application of heat and cold , light and dark , noise and silence , feast and famine — all meant to attack six essential sensory pathways into the human mind .
After codifying its new interrogation methods in the KUBARK manual , the Agency spent the next 30 years promoting these torture techniques within the U.S. intelligence community and among anti-communist allies .
In its clandestine journey across continents and decades , the CIA ’s psychological torture paradigm would prove elusive , adaptable , devastatingly destructive , and powerfully seductive .
So darkly seductive is torture ’s appeal that these seemingly scientific methods , even when intended for a few Soviet spies or al - Qaeda terrorists , soon spread uncontrollably in two directions — toward the torture of the many and into a paroxysm of brutality towards specific individuals .
During the Vietnam War , when the CIA applied these techniques in their search for information on top Vietcong cadre , the interrogation effort soon degenerated into the crude physical brutality of the Phoenix Program , producing 46,000 extrajudicial executions and little actionable intelligence .
In 1994 , with the Cold War over , Washington ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture , seemingly resolving the tension between its anti-torture principles and its torture practices .
Yet when President Clinton sent this Convention to Congress , he included four little - noticed diplomatic “ reservations ” drafted six years before by the Reagan administration and focused on just one word in those 26 printed pages : “ mental . ”
These reservations narrowed ( just for the United States ) the definition of “ mental ” torture to include just four acts : the infliction of physical pain , the use of drugs , death threats , or threats to harm another .
Excluded were methods such as sensory deprivation and self - inflicted pain , the very techniques the CIA had propagated for the past 40 years .
This definition was reproduced verbatim in Section 2340 of the U.S. Federal Code and later in the War Crimes Act of 1996 .
Through this legal legerdemain , Washington managed to agree , via the U.N. Convention , to ban physical abuse even while exempting the CIA from the U.N. ’s prohibition on psychological torture .
This little noticed exemption was left buried in those documents like a landmine and would detonate with phenomenal force just 10 years later at Abu Ghraib prison .
War on Terror , War of Torture
Right after his public address to a shaken nation on September 11 , 2001 , President Bush gave his staff secret orders to pursue torture policies , adding emphatically , “ I do n’t care what the international lawyers say , we are going to kick some ass . ”
In a dramatic break with past policy , the White House would even allow the CIA to operate its own global network of prisons , as well as charter air fleet to transport seized suspects and “ render ” them for endless detention in a supranational gulag of secret “ black sites ” from Thailand to Poland .
The Bush administration also officially allowed the CIA ten “ enhanced ” interrogation methods designed by agency psychologists , including “ waterboarding . ”
This use of cold water to block breathing triggers the “ mammalian diving reflex , ” hardwired into every human brain , thus inducing an uncontrollable terror of impending death .
As Jane Mayer reported in the New Yorker , psychologists working for both the Pentagon and the CIA “ reverse engineered ” the military ’s SERE training , which included a brief exposure to waterboarding , and flipped these defensive methods for use offensively on al - Qaeda captives .
“ They sought to render the detainees vulnerable — to break down all of their senses , ” one official told Mayer .
“ It takes a psychologist trained in this to understand these rupturing experiences . ”
Inside Agency headquarters , there was , moreover , a “ high level of anxiety ” about the possibility of future prosecutions for methods officials knew to be internationally defined as torture .
The presence of Ph.D. psychologists was considered one “ way for CIA officials to skirt measures such as the Convention Against Torture . ”
From recently released Justice Department memos , we now know that the CIA refined its psychological paradigm significantly under Bush .
As described in the classified 2004 Background Paper on the CIA ’s Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques , each detainee was transported to an Agency black site while “ deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs , and hoods . ”
Once inside the prison , he was reduced to “ a baseline , dependent state ” through conditioning by “ nudity , sleep deprivation ( with shackling … ) , and dietary manipulation . ”
For “ more physical and psychological stress , ” CIA interrogators used coercive measures such as “ an insult slap or abdominal slap ” and then “ walling , ” slamming the detainee ’s head against a cell wall .
If these failed to produce the results sought , interrogators escalated to waterboarding , as was done to Abu Zubaydah “ at least 83 times during August 2002 ” and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad 183 times in March 2003 — so many times , in fact , that the repetitiousness of the act can only be considered convincing testimony to the seductive sadism of CIA - style torture .
In a parallel effort launched by Bush - appointed civilians in the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld gave General Geoffrey Miller command of the new American military prison at Guantanamo in late 2002 with ample authority to transform it into an ad hoc psychology lab .
Behavioral Science Consultation
Teams of military psychologists probed detainees for individual phobias like fear of the dark .
Interrogators stiffened the psychological assault by exploiting what they saw as Arab cultural sensitivities when it came to sex and dogs .
Via a three - phase attack on the senses , on culture , and on the individual psyche , interrogators at Guantanamo perfected the CIA ’s psychological paradigm .
After General Miller visited Iraq in September 2003 , the U.S. commander there , General Ricardo Sanchez , ordered Guantanamo - style abuse at Abu Ghraib prison .
My own review of the 1,600 still - classified photos taken by American guards at Abu Ghraib — which journalists covering this story seem to share like Napster downloads — reveals not random , idiosyncratic acts by “ bad apples , ” but the repeated , constant use of just three psychological techniques : hooding for sensory deprivation , shackling for self - inflicted pain , and ( to exploit Arab cultural sensitivities ) both nudity and dogs .
It is no accident that Private Lynndie England was famously photographed leading an Iraqi detainee leashed like a dog .
These techniques , according to the New York Times , then escalated virally at five Special Operations field interrogation centers where detainees were subjected to extreme sensory deprivation , beating , burning , electric shock , and waterboarding .
Among the thousand soldiers in these units , 34 were later convicted of abuse and many more escaped prosecution only because records were officially “ lost . ”
“ Behind the Green Door ” at the White House
Further up the chain of command , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , as she recently told the Senate , “ convened a series of meetings of NSC [ National Security Council ] principals in 2002 and 2003 to discuss various issues … relating to detainees . ”
This group , including Vice President Cheney , Attorney General John Ashcroft , Secretary of State Colin Powell , and CIA director George Tenet , met dozens of times inside the White House Situation Room .
After watching CIA operatives mime what Rice called “ certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques , ” these leaders , their imaginations stimulated by graphic visions of human suffering , repeatedly authorized extreme psychological techniques stiffened by hitting , walling , and waterboarding .
According to an April 2008 ABC
News report , Attorney General Ashcroft once interrupted this collective fantasy by asking aloud , “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
In mid-2004 , even after the Abu Ghraib photos were released , these principals met to approve the use of CIA torture techniques on still more detainees .
Despite mounting concerns about the damage torture was doing to America ’s standing , shared by Colin Powell , Condoleezza Rice commanded Agency officials with the cool demeanor of a dominatrix .
“ This is your baby , ” she reportedly said .
“ Go do it . ”
Cleansing Torture
Even as they exercise extraordinary power over others , perpetrators of torture around the world are assiduous in trying to cover their tracks .
They construct recondite legal justifications , destroy records of actual torture , and paper the files with spurious claims of success .
Hence , the CIA destroyed 92 interrogation videotapes , while Vice President Cheney now berates Obama incessantly ( five times in his latest Fox News interview ) to declassify “ two reports ” which he claims will show the informational gains that torture offered — possibly because his staff salted the files at the NSC or the CIA with documents prepared for this very purpose .
Not only were Justice Department lawyers aggressive in their advocacy of torture in the Bush years , they were meticulous from the start , in laying the legal groundwork for later impunity .
In three torture memos from May 2005 that the Obama administration recently released , Bush ’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stephen Bradbury repeatedly cited those original U.S. diplomatic “ reservations ” to the U.N. Convention Against Torture , replicated in Section 2340 of the Federal code , to argue that waterboarding was perfectly legal since the “ technique is not physically painful . ”
Anyway , he added , careful lawyering at Justice and the CIA had punched loopholes in both the U.N. Convention and U.S. law so wide that these Agency techniques were “ unlikely to be subject to judicial inquiry . ”
Just to be safe , when Vice President Cheney presided over the drafting of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , he included clauses , buried in 38 pages of dense print , defining “ serious physical pain ” as the “ significant loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member , organ , or mental faculty . ”
This was a striking paraphrase of the outrageous definition of physical torture as pain “ equivalent in intensity to … organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death ” in John Yoo ’s infamous August 2002 “ torture memo , ” already repudiated by the Justice Department .
Above all , the Military Commissions
Act protected the CIA ’s use of psychological torture by repeating verbatim the exculpatory language found in those Clinton - era , Reagan - created reservations to the U.N. Convention and still embedded in Section 2340 of the Federal code .
To make doubly sure , the act also made these definitions retroactive to November 1997 , giving CIA interrogators immunity from any misdeeds under the Expanded War Crimes
Act of 1997 which punishes serious violations with life imprisonment or death .
No matter how twisted the process , impunity — whether in England , Indonesia , or America — usually passes through three stages :
1 . Blame the supposed “ bad apples . ”
2. Invoke the security argument .
( “ It protected us . ” )
3. Appeal to national unity .
( “ We need to move forward together . ” )
For a year after the Abu Ghraib exposé , Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon blamed various low - ranking bad apples by claiming the abuse was “ perpetrated by a small number of U.S. military . ”
In his statement on May 13th , while refusing to release more torture photos , President Obama echoed Rumsfeld , claiming the abuse in these latest images , too , “ was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals . ”
In recent weeks , Republicans have taken us deep into the second stage with Cheney ’s statements that the CIA ’s methods “ prevented the violent deaths of thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands , of people . ”
Then , on April 16th , President Obama brought us to the final stage when he released the four Bush - era memos detailing CIA torture , insisting : “ Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
During a visit to CIA headquarters four days later , Obama promised that there would be no prosecutions of Agency employees .
“ We ’ve made some mistakes , ” he admitted , but urged Americans simply to “ acknowledge them and then move forward . ”
The president ’s statements were in such blatant defiance of international law that the U.N. ’s chief official on torture , Manfred Nowak , reminded him that Washington was actually obliged to investigate possible violations of the Convention Against Torture .
This process of impunity is leading Washington back to a global torture policy that , during the Cold War , was bipartisan in nature : publicly advocating human rights while covertly outsourcing torture to allied governments and their intelligence agencies .
In retrospect , it may become ever more apparent that the real aberration of the Bush years lay not in torture policies per se , but in the President ’s order that the CIA should operate its own torture prisons .
The advantage of the bipartisan torture consensus of the Cold War era was , of course , that it did a remarkably good job most of the time of insulating Washington from the taint of torture , which was sometimes remarkably widely practiced .
There are already some clear signs of a policy shift in this direction in the Obama era .
Since mid-2008 , U.S. intelligence has captured a half - dozen al - Qaeda suspects and , instead of shipping them to Guantanamo or to CIA secret prisons , has had them interrogated by allied Middle Eastern intelligence agencies .
Showing that this policy is again bipartisan , Obama ’s new CIA director Leon Panetta announced that the Agency would continue to engage in the rendition of terror suspects to allies like Libya , Pakistan , or Saudi Arabia where we can , as he put it , “ rely on diplomatic assurances of good treatment . ”
Showing the quality of such treatment , Time magazine reported on May 24th that Ibn al - Sheikh al - Libi , who famously confessed under torture that Saddam Hussein had provided al - Qaeda with chemical weapons and later admitted his lie to Senate investigators , had committed “ suicide ” in a Libyan cell .
The Price of Impunity
This time around , however , a long - distance torture policy may not provide the same insulation as in the past for Washington .
Any retreat into torture by remote - control is , in fact , only likely to produce the next scandal that will do yet more damage to America ’s international standing .
Over a 40 - year period , Americans have found themselves mired in this same moral quagmire on six separate occasions : following exposés of CIA - sponsored torture in South Vietnam ( 1970 ) , Brazil ( 1974 ) , Iran ( 1978 ) , Honduras ( 1988 ) , and then throughout Latin America ( 1997 ) .
After each exposé , the public ’s shock soon faded , allowing the Agency to resume its dirty work in the shadows .
Unless some formal inquiry is convened to look into a sordid history that reached its depths in the Bush era , and so begins to break this cycle of deceit , exposé , and paralysis followed by more of the same , we ’re likely , a few years hence , to find ourselves right back where we are now .
We ’ll be confronted with the next American torture scandal from some future iconic dungeon , part of a dismal , ever lengthening procession that has led from the tiger cages of South Vietnam through the Shah of Iran ’s prison cells in Tehran to Abu Ghraib and the prison at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
The next time , however , the world will not have forgotten those photos from Abu Ghraib .
The next time , the damage to this country will be nothing short of devastating .
