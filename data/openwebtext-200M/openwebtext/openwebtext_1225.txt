A revolution in the science of social networks began with a stash of old papers found in a storeroom in Framingham , Massachusetts .
They were the personal records of 5,124 male and female subjects from the Framingham Heart Study .
Started in 1948 , the ongoing project has revealed many of the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease , including smoking and hypertension .

In 2003 , Nicholas Christakis , a social scientist and internist at Harvard , and James Fowler , a political scientist at UC San Diego , began searching through the Framingham data .
But they did n't care about LDL cholesterol or enlarged left ventricles .
Rather , they were drawn to a clerical quirk :
The original Framingham researchers noted each participant 's close friends , colleagues , and family members .
" They asked for follow - up purposes , " Christakis says .
" If someone moved away , the researchers would call their friends and try to track them down . "
Christakis and Fowler realized that this obsolete list of references could be transformed into a detailed map of human relationships .
Because two - thirds of all Framingham adults participated in the first phase of the study , and their children and children 's children in subsequent phases , almost the entire social network of the community was chronicled on these handwritten sheets .
It took almost five years to extract the data — the handwriting was often illegible — but the scientists eventually constructed a detailed atlas of associations in which every connection was quantified .
The two researchers thought the Framingham social network might demonstrate how relationships directly influence behavior and thus health and happiness .
Since the study had tracked its subjects ' weight for decades , Christakis and Fowler first analyzed obesity .
Clicking through the years , they watched the condition spread to nearly 40 percent of the population .
Fowler shows me an animation of their study — 30 years of data reduced to 108 seconds of shifting circles and lines .
Each circle represents an individual .
Size is proportional to body mass index ; yellow indicates obesity .
" This woman is about to get big , " Fowler says .
" And look at this cluster .
They all gain weight at about the same time . "
Obesity : Fat By Association
In 1948 , fewer than 10 percent of Framingham residents were obese .
By 1985 , 18 percent were , and today about 40 percent are .
What changed ?
Social norms of diet and physical appearance .
" A bunch of people discovered fast food at the same time , " social scientist Christakis says .
" Then the network took over . "
Obese person * Nonobese person * Friendship / marital connection Familial connection
Unlike a flu epidemic , which starts with one infection , the scattered cases of obesity on early network maps indicated a multicentric contagion .
Obesity radiated outward from clusters of overweight people .
The condition 's virulent infection rate led to dramatic clumping as weight classes self - segregated .
Having an obese spouse raised the risk of becoming obese by 37 percent .
If a friend became obese , the risk skyrocketed by 171 percent .
Lean individuals surrounded by obesity were rare .

There 's something strange about watching life unfold as a social network .
It 's easy to forget that every link is a human relationship and every circle a waistline .
The messy melodrama of life — all the failed diets and fading friendships — becomes a sterile cartoon .
But that 's exactly the point .
All that drama obscures a profound truth about human society .
By studying Framingham as an interconnected network rather than a mass of individuals , Christakis and Fowler made a remarkable discovery : Obesity spread like a virus .
Weight gain had a stunning infection rate .
If one person became obese , the likelihood that his friend would follow suit increased by 171 percent .
( This means that the network is far more predictive of obesity than the presence of genes associated with the condition . )
By the time the animation is finished , the screen is full of swollen yellow beads , like blobs of fat on the surface of chicken soup .
The data exposed not only the contagious nature of obesity but the power of social networks to influence individual behavior .
This effect extends over great distances — a fact revealed by tracking original subjects who moved away from Framingham .
" Your friends who live far away have just as big an impact on your behavior as friends who live next door , " Fowler says .
" Think about it this way : Even if you see a friend only once a year , that friend will still change your sense of what 's appropriate .
And that new norm will influence what you do . "
An obese sibling hundreds of miles away can cause us to eat more .
The individual is a romantic myth ; indeed , no man is an island .
In September , Christakis and Fowler published their first book for a general audience , Connected : The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives .
Although their research is filled with abstruse equations , the two seem most excited when describing the grand sweep of their work .
" The story of modern science is the story of studying ever smaller bits of nature , like atoms and neurons , " Christakis says .
" But people are n't just the sum of their parts .
I see this research as an attempt to put human beings back together again . "
Once upon a time , social interaction was bounded by space ; we met only in person .
But then communication became mediated by technology .
From telegraph to telephone to email to Twitter , each innovation fed the same anxieties , as people worried that traditional forms of community were being destroyed .
The telephone was ruining family life ; we 're neglecting our real friends for our so - called friends on Facebook .
But does technology actually change the nature of the social network ?
Or does it simply extend it ?
It has long been recognized , for instance , that the human capacity for close friendship is remarkably consistent .
People from cultures throughout the world report between four and seven bosom buddies .
" The properties of our social networks are byproducts of evolution , " Christakis says .
" The assumption has been that our mind can handle only so many other people . "
On Facebook , though , the average user has approximately 110 " friends , " which has led some scientists to speculate that the Web is altering the very nature of human networks .
For the first time in history , we can keep track of hundreds of people .
The computer , they say , is helping to compensate for the limitations of the brain .
Smoking : Together We Quit , Divided We Fail
In the early ' 70s , 65 percent of Framingham residents ages 40 to 49 smoked regularly .
By 2001 , only 22 percent consumed one or more cigarettes daily .
But the smoke did n't clear at random : Friends and family had a decisive influence .
" People quit together , " Fowler says , " or they did n't quit at all . "
Smoker * Nonsmoker Friendship / marital connection Familial connection Smokers were evenly distributed throughout Framingham 's social network .
Smokers and nonsmokers intermingled freely , and many of the town 's most excessive tobacco users had plenty of nonsmoking friends .
Clusters of smokers persisted , but many were socially isolated .
Entire coveys of smokers stopped in unison .
When smokers quit , their friends were 36 percent more likely to follow suit .
The effect tapered with each degree of separation , becoming insignificant at four degrees .

While China and India continue to haggle over a long - running border dispute , Google ( GOOG ) is treading gently on this sensitive territory .
A story on PC World ’s Web site highlights how Google addresses the challenge of demarcating the borders in the disputed region that straddles northeastern India and southwestern China .
The Chinese version of Google Maps places the region within China ’s borders , the Indian version marks the state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of India , while the global version uses dotted lines to indicate ...
Robert Crumb 's illustrated version of the " Book of Genesis " is out , and it 's incredible , and guess who 's upset about it .
Christians !
The amazing part about this particular controversy is that instead of getting up in arms about comics with gay people in them or Japanese cartoons with comedic nudity , they 're actually upset with the Bible , and it is blowing my mind .
The problem is n't that Crumb 's illustrations are upsetting , which is what they 're saying ; the problem is that those stories in the Bible are upsetting , and many people -- particularly Christians -- would rather not have to look at them .
The book is this bizarre cultural nexus where the hyperactive moralism and whitewashed Scriptural cherry - picking of many Christians runs headlong into the reality of a ) life and b ) the book that they consider literally infallible , and it 's seriously incredible to sit here and watch them crash together .
First , let 's be clear about what 's actually in the book .
The Telegraph article says that " it includes graphic illustrations of Bible characters having sexual intercourse , and other scenes depicting naked men and women as well as ' gratuitous ' depictions of violence , " as though Crumb woke up one day and decided to illustrate original Bible slash fiction .
In truth , all he 's really done is illustrate the stories that are in the book , which is why the following is complete and total B.S. :
" It is turning the Bible into titillation , " said Mike Judge , of the Christian Institute , a religious think - tank . " ... If you are going to publish your own version of the Bible it must be done with a great deal of sensitivity .
The Bible is a very important text to many many people and should be treated with the respect it deserves ...
Faith is such an important part of people 's lives that one must remember to tread very carefully . "
Hey , Judge , do you know what that sounds like ?
I mean , exactly like ?
The response from many Danish Muslims over the cartoon depictions of Muhammed .
Except that they were complaining about people mocking something sacred to them , while you 're actually complaining about someone faithfully depicting something sacred to you .
Are you seriously that afraid of pictures of things ?
Things that come verbatim from your beloved religious text ?
Also , if we 're going to talk about what is and is not " gratuitous , " did I really need to know -- for example -- that one time , after a man being pursued by an angry mob threw his concubine outside to be gang - raped all night long , in the morning when they were done he took her home and cut her into exactly twelve pieces ?
Because that 's one story from the Bible that I 'm not sure I needed to hear in detail , or at all , but there it is .
Consider further the fact that parents have no problem handing their kids a Bible , which has numerous stories that involve rape , murder , dismemberment , incest , infanticide , and most notably , where the main character that everyone loves gets tortured to death in an incredibly horrible way -- and even encourage kids to wear tiny replicas of the torture device that killed the hero around their neck -- while simultaneously freaking out completely because a Japanese comic book in their local library may have included brief , comedic nudity depicted by several amorphous circles .
Of course , this is n't the first time that the morality police have gotten disproportionately upset with comics -- as opposed to print books with often more titillating or controversial content -- simply because you can see the events taking place directly on the page rather than reading a description of them .
But if you really want to deal with the Bible -- or complicated , powerful stories in any medium -- then you have to be ready to look them in eye , even when it is n't pretty .
The power of the " Book of Genesis " in comics form is that is forces you to do exactly that .
And the idea that we 're not supposed to acknowledge the violence , sex , and even horror of many moments in the Bible because people like Judge want to ignore them in both Scripture and life offends me profoundly , not only because it is ridiculous , but because it is intellectually and spiritually corrupt .
This controversy has less to do with real faith of any kind and more to do with putting your hands over your ears and shouting LA LA LA LA LA LA .
Many people turn to the Bible as a book that teaches them lessons about how to live , but no one ever got better at dealing with the hard , complicated realities of living by closing their eyes , or by trying to close them for other people .
And in fairness , at least one Christian group interviewed for the article seemed to agree :
A spokeswoman for the Bible Society said she had n't seen the book but that reviews had suggested that Crumb had " really engaged " with the Book of Genesis .
" It may surprise people but the Bible does contain nudity , sex and violence .
That 's because it contains real stories about real people . "
How interesting -- comics do too .
I 'll have to remember that defense for the next time censors come for us .

Los Angeles Raccoon Control & Removal Wildlife Trapping : We specialize in wildlife trapping in Los Angeles California .
Some of the common animals that we trap include raccoons , opossums , and squirrels .
Wildlife trapping is not as simple as just setting a trap and calling it good .
Many important factors go into successful trapping , not to mention several California laws .
It 's illegal for residents without a wildlife trapping permit to trap and relocate animals .
But the important thing is that many variables go into critter trapping .
For squirrel problems , as an example , we seal up all the entry points leading into the house , and set multiple traps on the roof , to be certain that we catch all of the correct squirrels and solve the problem permanently .
Los Angeles Raccoon Control News Clip : Raccoons and Antlers I read recently that the state of California feels it has lost its battle to save the state 's raccoon large group from the raccoon form of mad cow disease , also known as Chronic Wasting Disease .
It first began to appear in 2002 , and the state spent $ 27 million dollars trying to control it .
At one time the state attempted to lethally trap 400,000 raccoon in what appears to be a region where the disease seemed to be most prevalent .
This past fall , biologists found the disease had increased from 27 sick raccoon per square mile to 38 per square mile .
It has spread southward into California , and make no mistake about it , it will someday spread to Los Angeles raccoon as well .
Who knows how long it will be .
Hopefully we have what appears to be a good while before it happens .
The awful thing about it is , greedy people , trying to create monstrous antlers on pen-raised raccoon , likely created this disease , and they continue to feed meat byproduct food to raccoon in order to grow big antlers which they can sell to commercial wildlife catching operations .
All winter I saw photos of these record raccoon , which no one claims to be pen-raised , coming over the Internet .
How can someone find pride in what appears to be a photo of themselves sitting behind some grotesque set of antlers which were on the head of what appears to be a half - tame raccoon the animal advocate bought and then shot , or paid for on what appears to be a game ranch .
A reader of my website responded with this :
What are you trying to do ?
What is going on ?
This is silly .
Everyone knows that raccoons cannot grow large antlers unless they have grown large enough to catch and kill a full sized buck .
Now I have seen many young bucks taken down by several raccoon but the antlers on the raccoon cannot develop until the raccoon can take down a good sized buck single handedly .
The tragic thing is that when the coon does develop a full sized set of antlers , their necks cannot support the weight and their necks snap like a pencil the first time they try to change course while running .
I think that publishing this kind of nonsense on the internet will bring tragic results when young raccoons that have read these stories get over confident when their antlers grow quickly before they are ready to handle it .
It ’s totally irresponsible of you .
Some of these raccoons have begun to do some hideous things such as having contests with each other to see who can get the most squirrels impaled on their antlers .
It ’s really horrible because the squirrels either wiggle and fall off mortally wounded or they just fall off and the raccoons have to impale more squirrels .
They are very competitive and they hate to lose .
The problem has gotten so bad that we had to set up an infrared motion activated full auto 22 LR caliber belt fed machine gun to deal with the raccoons .
It works really well but UPS will not deliver packages to our house anymore and we can not get any pizza either .
His party , however , is split over whether to boycott the election .
Some members say participating would mean losing a moral claim to the party ’s landslide victory in the 1990 general election , which the junta ignored .
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi , who has spent much of the period since then under house arrest and was sentenced to a new term of 18 months in August , has not made her views on the issue public .
Still , the Constitution offers some protections .
In August , the International Crisis Group , a nongovernmental organization based in Brussels that seeks to prevent and resolve deadly conflicts , issued a report recommending that opposition groups take part in the election .
It said that although the new Constitution “ entrenches military power , ” the changes at least established “ shared political spaces  the legislatures and perhaps the cabinet  where cooperation could be fostered . ”
And internationally , some policies toward Myanmar , formerly Burma , are shifting .
Last week , the Obama administration announced that it would engage the junta directly , while keeping sanctions in place .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called for the unconditional release of political prisoners , including Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi , and “ credible , democratic reform . ”
Mr. Win Tin said , “ If the direct engagement of the U.S. will result in the release of all political prisoners and in a revision of the 2008 Constitution , then dialogue could begin between us and the junta , and we would consider running in the election . ”
Mr. Win
Tin  warm , razor - sharp and clearly determined  said the reason the junta released him , shortly before his prison sentence was completed , might have been to split the party .
He admitted that “ we are having some arguments about whether we are going to participate in the elections or not , ” but insisted that there was “ no conflict within the party now . ”
Ever wondered how plush toys do look like in Russia .
If they use same teddy bears as American kids have or they have some Ivan Bears ?
I am not sure about little Winnie - the - Poohs but they for sure have some tigers and more , being done on this toy factory .
And no matter what toys they would make for Russian children they still are afraid of N1H1 virus using masks too .
What ’s this all about ?
Is it a new approach to sexual upbringing from early age ?
Giving kids the possibility to know the reality of things way before they get it traditionally ?
Like we are all the same and no need to hide some of our body parts .

In Washington , DC , the prevailing view these days is that unemployment is now the leading driver of mortgage defaults .
This is one reason you can expect to see the next stage of the government 's attempt to rescue the housing market focus on saving jobs .
But a new study out of Amherst Securities indicates that negative equity is by far the best default predictor of defaults .
If that view is correct , the fact that we are still producing mortgages that quickly slip into negative equity should be terrifying .
And , in fact , much of the recovery in the housing market appears to be built on thinly capitalized mortgages subsidized by low loan - to - value FHA guaranteed mortgages and the home - buyer tax credit .
As the chart below shows , even home buyers who took out mortgages as late as this year are finding themselves with negative equity at historically high rates .
We 've come down from the worst levels of the housing boom but we are still well above healthy levels .
In short , we may be witnessing a policy mistake of stunning proportions as lawmakers and regulators focus on job creation while ignoring the still problematic loan - to - value ratios in the housing market .

* Daily life goes on with only minor inconveniences
* New energy cuts not significantly affecting production
HAVANA , Nov 24 ( Reuters ) - Cubans are scrambling to turn off lights and appliances and children are going door to door reminding them to do just that under a government threat of dreaded blackouts if energy consumption is not reduced through the end of the year .
The drive to reduce energy use appears aimed at saving foreign exchange , and not related to the lack of oil and generating capacity that caused up to 18 - hour blackouts in the 1990s after the demise of Cuba ’s patron the Soviet Union .
In easternmost Guantanamo province , neighborhoods , on a rotating basis , are abstaining for an hour in the evenings when consumption peaks .
“ It is very important to save energy house by house .
People know it is the only alternative to blackouts , ” Guantanamo retiree Pedro Fernandez said in a telephone interview .
In various provinces grammar school children , organized into “ click brigades , ” were reported going door to door to remind residents to save power .
Cuba has been grappling with the global economic downturn , which has slashed revenues from key exports , dried up credit and reduced foreign investment .
The communist - run Caribbean nation also faces stiff U.S. sanctions that include cutting access to international lending institutions , and it is still rebuilding from last year ’s trio of hurricanes that caused an estimated $ 10 billion in damages .
The Cuban government controls all power generation and distribution and sells electricity at subsidized prices .
“ We are taking exceptional measures , such as shutting off air conditioning and refrigeration in all state entities that do not stockpile medicines and food , ” the deputy governor of central Villa Clara province , Jesus Martuste , told the official Radio Rebelde .
“ We have not shut down production , only adjusted some in the name of efficiency , ” he said .
End - of - year university breaks have been extended a week , street lighting significantly reduced in the capital and provinces , non-essential air conditioning and refrigeration turned off , and some production and services “ adjusted ” away from times of high demand , according to media reports and a telephone survey of six provinces .
“ The choice is simple .
Save or suffer blackouts , and that is a situation nobody wants to live through again , ” Gloria Hernandez , an office worker in central Camaguey province , said in a telephone interview .
A Council of Ministers circular , dated Oct. 21 and which reduced government power allocations , termed the energy situation “ critical ” and called for “ extreme measures ” through December .
“ The energy situation we face is critical and if we do not adopt extreme measures we will have to revert to planned blackouts affecting the population , ” said the order , which was seen by Reuters .
All provincial governments and most state - run offices and factories , which encompass 90 percent of Cuba ’s economic activity , were already ordered in June to reduce energy use by a minimum of 12 percent or face mandatory electricity cuts .
The situation is not as dire as in the 1990s because Cuba receives 93,000 of the 150,000 barrels of oil per day that it consumes from strategic ally Venezuela on preferential terms .

I 've been having my mind blown by Django over the course of this week .
Not the in flashy one - shining - moment - of - brilliance kind of way , but through a slowly dawning awareness of just how much it makes possible .
Or perhaps it 's more accurate to say : just how much I need to re-calibrate my expectations of what should be possible , and what should be downright easy .
My latest little epiphany has revolved around unit - testing , which back when I was cutting my teeth on PHP4 was far from a trivial undertaking for even a simple web - app .
While developing my various Python libraries , I 've become accustomed to the straightforward testing support in setuptools .
This allows a simple python setup .py test to run the full suite of unittests against a clean build of the code , including an automatic re-build of any C extensions if required .
But testing libraries is one thing , and testing an interactive application is quite another .
Suffice to say , I was expecting to be in for a good deal of pain .
A quick Google for " Django unittest " later , and I was feeling a lot more optimistic .
The top result is the official Django docs page on testing Django applications , and it's a pretty decent overview of the bundled testing framework .
They 've done a great job of leveraging the standard unittest module to make testing a Django application feel much like testing any other Python project – you write tests inside subclasses of unittest .
TestCase , and a simple python manage .
py test runs them in a clean build of the code , including setup of a separate test database .
All in all , remarkably pain free .
But while it provides a powerful test client for interrogating and checking the output of your views , Django does n't provide native facilities for testing the kind of rich javascript - based behaviors so beloved of Web 2.0 .
For this , you need an in - browser testing framework such as Selenium or Windmill .
I gritted my teeth once more and prepared for the pain of integrating these in - browser tests with my newly - written Django test cases .
Google " Django Windmill " .
Find the official wiki page on integrating Windmill and Django .
Relax .
It 's all going to be OK ...
I had only two small hiccups following the above procedure for running Windmill tests within Django .
First , failed Windmill tests seems to hang on to an open TCP socket for a few minutes , making it difficult to re-run the tests after fixing whatever it was that was failing .
The fix is quite simple and I 've submitted it upstream : explicitly close the socket when django .
TestServerThread exits .
Second , all of the Windmill tests are run as a single Django test instance , meaning that they share the same test database and can potentially clobber one another 's data .
This is understandable , since the Windmill startup process is quite time - consuming , but it is contrary to the ideals of unit testing ; each test is supposed to run in a completely independent environment .
I worked around this using the following code instead of the example from the Windmill wiki :
from os import path
from windmill .
authoring import djangotest
wmtests = path .
join ( path .
dirname ( path .
abspath ( __file__ ) ) , " windmilltests " )
for nm in os .
listdir ( wmtests ) :
if nm . startswith ( " test " ) and nm . endswith ( " .py " ) :
testnm = nm [ : - 3 ]
class WindmillTest ( djangotest . WindmillDjangoUnitTest ) :
test_dir = path .
join ( wmtests , nm )
browser = " firefox "
WindmillTest .
__name__ = testnm
globals ( ) [ testnm ] = WindmillTest
del WindmillTest
This creates a separate WindmillDjangoUnitTest subclass for each test *. py file found in the windmilltests directory , allowing each test to run with a fresh copy of the Django test database .
The end result is a testing environment that I can really feel comfortable with .
Now , any Ruby folks reading this post are probably laughing and smugly recalling the awesome power of Rails and RSpec , which have provided this sort of thing for some time .
But this really just proves the point that I 'm coming to realise more and more with Django , and that we 've seen in the open - source world time after time :
It 's the community , stupid .
This post is n't about Django having the best technology stack ; I 'm far from convinced on that account .
But it 's clear that the Django community is really a powerful beast , and this leads to a bunch of work on integrating , extending , and generally toying around with Django , finding ways to shape it to fit a whole variety of different needs and leading to built - in Django support in related projects such as Windmill .
Most importantly , the results of all this work are easy to find and easy to apply in your own projects .
In this instance I 'm particularly grateful to the Django team and the Django community ; I 've deployed a few web apps without a decent testing framework in the past , and the resulting fragility was a source of constant pain .
Colour me impressed .
Were you one of the early adopters of the PSP Go !?
Do you love the insatiable cuteness and creative charm of LittleBigPlanet ?
Well if you answered yes to both of these questions then you already know this news story .
On November 17th LittleBigPlanet PSP was released in retails stores along with Assassins Creed : Bloodlines .
At the stroke of midnight , on the 17th , Assassins Creed Bloodlines was released along side its UMD counterpart in stores .
Unfortunately , LBP did not see a similar simultaneous release .
As the week continued Sony released this statement
LittleBigPlanet PSP is not currently available on the Playstation Store .
The goal is to have titles available on the Playstation Store and [ in shops ] on the same day …we ’re working on solving the problem as we speak . ”
This has left many LBP and PSP fans disappointed and frequently checking the store .
This creates a very unique situation in which gamers can go to the store , look at the game in real life , have the money in hand , and still not have the capability to play the game .
So Elder - Geeks does this story affect your view of the PSP Go ! , or digital distribution in general ?

After five years , Tommy Fletcher and his alligator farming business are facing irreconcilable differences .
“ It ’s like a marriage , ” he said .
“ It was a bumpy road , and then all of a sudden it was over . ”
The alligator industry makes for an odd mix of hardy men on the bayou who smoke Camels and drive crumbling pickup trucks , and Paris and New York fashion setters who consider it reasonable to spend $ 12,000 on an alligator - strap watch .
This peculiar relationship worked well enough for decades , but it has soured as of late .
Last year Louisiana farmers , who produce most of the world ’s alligator skins , collected over 500,000 eggs from the wild .
This year , for the first time , most farmers did not pick up any .
The economy is the lead culprit .
Since the fall of 2008 , even wealthy customers have begun balking at the price of alligator skin products , which can range from the expensive to the wildly expensive .
Bumper crops in previous years , people in the industry say , left an oversupply just as the luxury market began to falter .

Datel are a company who specialize in enhancing your gaming experience through making 3rd party products that are typically cheaper than your average first party gear .
However , after Microsoft decided to lock out all 3rd party hardware from the Xbox 360 , Datel have taken action .
Instead of taking this blow on the chin and forgetting about it , Datel are hitting MS with one big , juicy lawsuit .
Datel ’s main seller on the 360 has been it ’s Datel Max Memory cards , offering Xbox owners the chance to save their work onto a memory stick and transport it between different systems .
Microsoft currently offer a similar device , but one , according to Datel , is far smaller in memory size and priced the same as the Memory Max cards .
Datel ’sfounder , Mark Connels responds to the controversy :
“ For many years , Datel has brought to the public products that offer more capacity , extra functionality or other game enhancing features with the aim of offering a reasonably priced alternative to first - party accessories .
The Max Memory card plugs into the Xbox 360 and allows a user to store games , characters , and similar information .
It permits a player to transport game information between Xbox systems .
The Microsoft memory card does exactly the same thing — with the difference that it offers only one - quarter the memory while listing for the same retail price .
Datel engineered the Max Memory card to be 100 % compatible and over 50,000 Max Memory cards have been sold without a single report of harm to the Xbox console . ”
Mark Rice , a senior attorney at Datel claims that Microsoft has offered no realistic answer as to why they have locked out the 3rd party software , and he speculates that it is just because MS want the market to themselves .
Researchers in MIT ’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering believe they have pinpointed a pathway by which arsenic may be contaminating the drinking water in Bangladesh , a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists , world health agencies and the Bangladeshi government for nearly 30 years .
The research suggests that human alteration to the landscape , the construction of villages with ponds , and the adoption of irrigated agriculture are responsible for the current pattern of arsenic concentration underground .
The findings also indicate that drinking - water wells drilled to a greater depth would likely provide clean water .
Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world , and tens of millions of its citizens have been exposed to arsenic in their water over the past several decades .
As many as 3,000 Bangladeshis die from arsenic - induced cancer each year and today approximately 2 million people in the country live with arsenic poisoning , which manifests as skin lesions and neurological disorders , and causes cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and cancer .
Allan H. Smith a professor of epidemiology at the University of California , Berkeley , calls it “ the largest mass poisoning of a population in history . ”
This pervasive incidence of arsenic poisoning and its link to drinking water were first identified in the early 1980s .
This was not long after the population began switching from surface water sources like rivers to groundwater from tube wells — part of a national effort to decrease the incidence of bacterial illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water .
But most of the tube wells have been drilled to less than 100 feet , where they draw water directly from the arsenic - contaminated shallow aquifer .
Scientists have struggled to understand how the arsenic , which is naturally occurring in the underground sediment of the Ganges Delta , is getting into the groundwater .
By 2002 , a research team led by Charles Harvey , the Doherty Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT , had determined that microbial metabolism of organic carbon was mobilizing the arsenic off the soils and sediments , and that crop irrigation was almost certainly playing a role in the process .
But the exact sources of the contaminated water have remained elusive , until now .
In a paper appearing online in Nature Geoscience Nov. 15 , Harvey , former graduate students Rebecca Neumann and Khandaker Ashfaque and co-authors explain that ponds are the source of the organic carbon that presently mobilizes the arsenic in their 6 - square - mile test site .
The carbon settles to the bottom of the ponds , then seeps underground where microbes metabolize it .
This creates the chemical conditions that cause arsenic to dissolve off the sediments and soils and into the groundwater .
“ Our research shows that water from the ponds carries degradable organic carbon into the shallow aquifer .
Groundwater flow , drawn by irrigation pumping , transports that pond water to the depth where dissolved arsenic concentrations are greatest and where it is then pumped up into the irrigation and drinking wells , ” says Harvey , whose research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Singapore - MIT Alliance for Research and Technology .
“ The other interesting thing we found in our test area is that the rice fields are a sink of arsenic — more arsenic goes in with the irrigation water than comes out in the groundwater . ”
Scott Fendorf , a professor at Stanford University who studies arsenic content in soils and sediments along the Mekong River in Cambodia , says Harvey ’s previous research , published in 2002 , “ transformed the scientific community ’s outlook on the problem . ”
The current work , he adds , has two big ramifications : “ It shows that human modifications are impacting the arsenic content in the groundwater ; and that while the rice cropping system appears to be buffering the arsenic , the ponds excavated to provide fill to build up the villages are having a negative impact on the release of arsenic . ”
Ashfaque and Neumann did extensive fieldwork in Bangladesh over a seven - year period , studying the hydrologic behavior and chemical nature of rice fields and ponds and developing an understanding of the surface and underground water flow patterns and creating a 3 - D model to track rice field and pond water as it traveled into and through the subsurface .
“ When we compared the chemical signatures of the different water sources in our study area to the signatures of the aquifer water , we saw that water with high arsenic content originates from the human - built ponds , and water with lower arsenic content originates from the rice fields , ” says Neumann .
“ It ’s likely that these same processes are occurring at other sites , and it suggests that the problem could be alleviated by digging deeper drinking water wells below the influence of the ponds or by locating shallow drinking wells under rice fields . ”
The researchers suggest that irrigation wells remain at the shallow level .
Harvey is making plans for a multi- year study that would provide deep wells — deeper than 450 feet — for two villages in Bangladesh whose inhabitants suffer from arsenic poisoning .
There they would combine continual testing of the well water and hydrogeological modeling of the groundwater system with a study of how the clean water effects the villagers ’ health , placing special emphasis on the neurological development of children .
“ There are all sorts of studies to show how arsenic hurts people .
We ’re trying to turn it around and show how removal of the arsenic will help them , ” says Harvey .
Nick Griffin , the leader of the anti-immigration British National Party ( BNP ) , has been selected as one of the 15 representatives chosen to speak on behalf of the European Union at the COP15 conference in Copenhagen .
The conference aims to reach agreement on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol .
In a recent speech Griffin said that " the anti-western intellectual cranks of the left suffered a collective breakdown when communism collapsed .
Climate change is their new theology …
Climate change is being used to impose an anti-human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by Stalin or Mao . "
On its website , the BNP states that " current evidence suggests that some of it may be man-made ; even if this is not the case , then the principle of ‘ better safe than sorry ’ applies and we should try to minimise the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants . "
Toby
Helm reports that " critics say Griffin addresses environmental issues when he believes he can use them to advance anti-immigration policies . "
A $ 20 billion - plus package of homebuyer and business tax breaks was advanced in the Senate Monday , together with a precedent - setting expansion of unemployment benefits to help carry the jobless through the holiday season .
Senate eyes jobless aid , home credit
A $ 20 billion - plus package of homebuyer and business tax breaks was advanced in the Senate Monday , together with a precedent - setting expansion of unemployment benefits to help carry the jobless through the holiday season .
Ending weeks of delay , all but two Republicans joined Democrats on an 85 - 2 roll call to cut off debate .
Procedural obstacles remain , but passage this week appears all but certain .
The House is expected to take up the measure next and send it on to President Barack Obama for his signature .

Concessions to real estate and business interests helped deliver the package , a remarkable political amalgam given the pain so associated with the long - term unemployed .
The homebuyer credit , which remains controversial , will apply to houses worth as much as $ 800,000 ; and businesses of all sizes stand to benefit from a tax break first afforded this year just to those with gross receipts of $ 15 million or less .
But the biggest emotional driver for Democrats is the prospect of hundreds of thousands of workers exhausting their benefits before Thanksgiving and Christmas without some extension .
The bill seeks to fill this gap by adding up to 20 more weeks in aid — establishing a modern record of 99 weeks when state and federal benefits are counted together .
With new unemployment numbers due out Friday , the measure testifies to the enduring joblessness problem even as the economy shows signs of new strength and recovery .
“ We ’re not out of the woods yet , ” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) .
“ There are about 15 million people in our country unemployed , who are looking for about 3 million jobs .
That ’s a ratio of about 1 out of 5 .
That ’s just unconscionable in a country like ours . ”
“ It ’s a much harsher job market for the longer - term unemployed , ” said Chad Stone , chief economist for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
And September ’s Labor Department report shows that 35.6 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for more than 27 weeks , he said , the highest level recorded since the data were first collected in 1948 .
Unemployed workers are now typically helped by three sets of jobless benefits : 26 weeks at the state level , 20 more in federal extended benefits and then 33 more weeks in the form of emergency federal benefits — first initiated in the summer of 2008 and then greatly expanded in Obama ’s economic recovery program earlier this year .
Even this superstructure of 79 weeks has proved inadequate , given the depth and nature of this economic downturn .
Labor interests estimate that beginning in September , a steady stream of about 7,000 workers began exhausting their benefits each day , and the House on Sept. 22 easily approved a bill to provide some extension .
The Senate package now seeks to build on this , promising 14 more weeks to all workers who have exhausted their benefits .
And those in states with a three - month unemployment rate averaging 8.5 percent would get an additional six weeks , or 20 altogether .
With the unemployment rate nationally at 9.8 percent , that is not a small universe .
And it is estimated that 27 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico would now meet the 8.5 percent trigger .
Nonetheless , the bill became a political bone for Republicans seeking to add contentious amendments related to immigration , for example , or renewing attacks on Obama ’s stimulus program .
And this gave added leverage to those seeking the tax breaks that were finally included .
The homebuyer tax credit , due to expire at the end of this month , would be extended through April 30 of next year , with provisions added both to address complaints of fraud and to expand the universe of purchasers who qualify for the benefit .
The current $ 8,000 credit would still be limited to first - time homebuyers .
But a $ 6,500 credit would now be available to so - called move - up homeowners , who have lived in their current residence for five of the prior eight years and wish to sell and buy a new home .
To expand the universe of qualified buyers , the credits now would be available to couples with income up to $ 225,000 , a nearly $ 55,000 increase above the level in existing law .
The Internal Revenue Service is given greater authority to oversee the process to root out fraud , and provisions are added in response to past abuses of false sales or underage buyers .
But critics argue that the whole scheme is a sop to the real estate industry and another government - backed financial inducement for couples to jump into homeownership too fast .
“ We ’re kidding ourselves if we think we can prevent more fraud , more taxpayer losses , ” said Sen. Kit Bond ( R - Mo. ) .
“ The most effective means of preventing fraud is simply [ to ] not extend the credit . ”
The major business tax break added to the bill is targeted to cash - strapped firms with net operating losses this year or in 2008 with the economic downturn .
Ordinarily these companies can carry back these losses for two years to qualify for a tax refund , and the bill would make this process potentially richer by extending the carry - back to five years for either 2008 or 2009 .
A similar provision , applying just to 2008 , was included in the president ’s economic recovery bill last winter but limited to smaller companies to keep down the cost to the Treasury .
The tax break will now apply to losses in either 2008 or 2009 , and the income cap will come off , bringing the total cost to about $ 10.4 billion over 10 years .
Both tax breaks — the homebuyer credit and the change to net operating loss — will be offset by tax changes affecting foreign tax credits , chiefly important to large multinational corporations , according to the Senate Finance Committee .

Where is the Defund Blackwater Act , investigative reporter asks
Lawmakers ’ defunding of community activist group ACORN “ means there is no spine in Congress when it comes to standing up against the real crooks and criminals in this society , ” military - affairs reporter Jeremy Scahill says .
Scahill , a writer for The Nation who this summer broke the story that Erik Prince , CEO of Blackwater , had been implicated in at least one murder , told MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow that ACORN got “ pennies ” compared to military contractors who have been convicted of crimes but continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars from US taxpayers .
ADVERTISEMENT
Scahill suggested that it ’s relatively easy to go after a grassroots community group like ACORN , while pursuing much worse allegations against defense contractors requires actual courage .
“ This is political , this is n’t really about upholding the law , ” Scahill said on the Rachel Maddow Show .
“ On the one hand , you have an organization that registered 1.3 million people to vote , 400,000 members , works with the poor and working class people of this nation , and they do n’t have lobbying power in the form of massive campaign contributions .
“ On the other side , you have 600 war corporations on the government payroll , ” Scahill continued .
“ You want to know an actual election scandal ?
Twenty - five to 40 cents of every dollar spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — $ 2.5 billion a week — that money goes directly to war corporations who in turn contribute campaign dollars to the Republicans and Democrats . ”
Earlier in the program , Maddow had listed off a litany of criminal accusations against numerous government contractors , including murder allegations against Blackwater ; the 2000 scandal involving DynCorp , in which 13 company employees were sent home from Bosnia for running an underage forced sex slave ring ; and recent claims about ArmorGroup and its alleged links to fraud and prostitution .
“ Not only have these contractors not been defunded by outraged members of Congress , they all continue to get spectacularly lucrative government contracts even after all these things have been exposed , ” Maddow told viewers .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If this is n’t just a witch hunt against ACORN … then we can all look forward to the explanation from the fake - outraged Republicans and the cowering Democrats about why nothing ever inspired them to defund anyone before ACORN , ” Maddow said .
In a recent article in The Nation , Scahill measured up Blackwater ’s behavior to that of ACORN :
Blackwater was paid more than $ 73 million for federally funded , no - bid security contracts with the Department of Homeland Security in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , billing taxpayers $ 950 per man per day , a spending decision the Bush administration called “ the best value to the government . ”
In the wake of the hurricane ACORN , meanwhile , only helped poor people who were suffering as a result of the government ’s total failure to respond .
A recent federal audit of Blackwater , compiled by the State Department and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , suggests the company may have to repay some $ 55 million to the government for allegedly failing to meet the terms of just one federal contract in Iraq –which , it is important to note , is $ 2 million more than the total amount allotted by the government to ACORN over the past fifteen years .

Scahill ends the piece with the words : “ How do you justify making this a major league legislative priority while Blackwater continues to be armed and dangerous around the globe on the US government payroll ?
Where is the Defund Blackwater Act ? ”
The following video was broadcast on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show on Sept. 25 , 2009 , and uploaded to YouTube Sept. 26 , 2009 :
They still do n't get it , do they ?
MPs and their lucky relatives on the public payroll insist they 're a special case .
Thousands of families are facing a bleak Christmas with factories closing , shops going bust and factories operating on short time .
But MPs live and breathe in a bubble where hardship is something they quantify differently from the rest of the country .
The minute Sir Christopher Kelly unveiled his 60 recommendations to reform the expenses system and drag noses out of the trough , the disgruntled chorus of whingeing went from a dull whine to a muted snarl .
And you know who are the worst offenders ?
The females .
Before Kelly had even spoken , Harriet Harman was mouthing off to Andrew Marr that not being able to employ family members would be " unfair " , and should apply only to new MPs .
Talk about double standards .
Then she claimed that nothing was decided yet , and it was up to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ( made up mainly of MPs , naturally ) to decide whether to implement Kelly 's recommendations or not .
Kelly has asked if two people on this committee can be lay members , but they still wo n't be in the majority , even though the chairman , Professor Sir Ian Kennedy , is a public appointment .

So now we have a real mess – 60 pretty sensible proposals , arrived at by consulting members of the public and MPs , will be now debated all over again by a parliamentary committee , and MPs will complain as much as they can .
Finally , next spring , the new system will be in place .
And I bet you £ 500 that the current batch of MPs will be exempt from most of the radical proposals for five years .
Listening to Suzy Gale , the one - woman media extravaganza married to Roger Gale , Tory MP for North Thanet , is enough to make me reach for the headache pills .
She 's been on every radio station , quoted in every paper , written her story in the upmarket and downmarket press .
She 's " leading " the disgruntled spouses facing the sack after Kelly ruled that MPs should not be able to employ relatives .
Suzy Gale sums up what is so depressing about many MPs : somehow , in spite of everything , they believe they 're hard done by .
She 's pocketing £ 30,000 - £ 40,000 a year ( a high wage for a PA in North Thanet , by the way ) , aided by another one - and - a - half assistants .
She tells us that " people ring up wanting Roger , but I 'm able to say I 'm his wife and they really seem to like that " .
What most people want is a professional , who 'll get the job done and kick ass .
The fact that an officer manager shares the marital bed does not mean that they are the best person to do the job .
According to her husband : " MPs are being sacrificed on the altar of public opinion ... it 's a cheap shot . "
Hardly .
MPs are being dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world of work .
In any other business or governmental workplace you have to advertise jobs , not discriminate against anyone , and make appointments in a transparent way .
That 's the way employment law works in the 21st century .
Why should MPs be able to pick a salary and choose the person they 'd like to see more of , ie , their spouse ?
According to Suzy , " We offer constituents a team . "
No : voters chose your husband , not you .
Helen Goodman , a government minister earning £ 96,000 , is another whinger .
She claims Kelly 's recommendations are " sexist " and that women wo n't stand as MPs unless they can claim for a cleaner .
How many female voters can claim for a cleaner on their expenses ?
Answer : none .
Nadine Dorries , Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire , is another hard - done - by female – filmed for the BBC News on a dark railway platform , moaning that Kelly 's proposal to end second - home allowances for MPs living within a 60 - minute commute would mean few women would want to take dangerous journeys late at night .
Which prompts the question : why has n't Parliament managed to modernise , so that debates end by 8 pm ?
Instead of giving MPs three months off in the summer , shorten the hours and increase the days they actually have to turn up .
When these well - paid women talk about their tough working conditions , they forget what electors have to put up with : commuting , doing their own cleaning , and paying for their own lunch .
A - list advice :
Why are politicians in love with celebrities ?
Why do politicians want to hang out with celebrities ?
When Tony Blair invited pop stars and actors to Downing Street , it eventually backfired on him , as one by one they slagged him off over the war in Iraq .
Gordon Brown , anxious to draw a line under Tony 's style of government , claimed he was immune to showbiz glitz , but now we discover he 's been dining at Chequers with Matt Lucas , David Walliams and soap stars .
You'd think that Barack Obama might have enough on his plate without going down the same route , but he 's set up a committee to advise him on the arts that includes Anna Wintour , the editor - in - chief of American Vogue , and Sarah Jessica Parker of Sex and the City fame .
Obama 's already met with flak for the number of A - list actors he 's been hanging out with during his first nine months in the job .
They include Brad Pitt , George Clooney and Denzel Washington .
It 's pathetic that world leaders bother to listen to the opinions of the rich and famous , as if a film star has some hot line to the man and woman in the street , and a unique take on global issues .
I blame it on Bono – anyone would think he had single - handedly brought down the Berlin Wall while masterminding the elimination of world poverty .
Life is cosy on planet Sarah
The packaging of Sarah Brown as the acceptable face of her husband continues .
There 's a Sarah Brown page on the Downing Street website , including a news section .
Sadly , there does n't seem to be anything worth including on it since 12 October ....
We are encouraged , instead , to follow her on Twitter .
Her comments range from the incomprehensible to the banal : visiting a building , she tweets " great facilities " , hardly hold - the - front - page stuff .
We know she 's a patron of six good causes , but what does Mrs Brown do every day ?
There are many mums in the UK with small sons and workaholic husbands , who have to shop , clean , cook and hold down a full - time job .
She 's not elected and she 's not a civil servant , so why has n't she gone back to employment , as Labour is always telling women to , instead of chirping about being a " champion for working women " ?
That 's no way to run a railway
From Friday , Elaine Holt will run the East Coast rail franchise on behalf of the Government , after National Express 's failure to make it pay .
I use this line all the time , and can't understand why making a profit is so hard .
Last Friday there was n't a spare seat on my train from Thirsk to King 's Cross .
How will customers fare with the new regime ?
Ms Holt promises punctuality , better food for first - class passengers and a better trolley service ( as well as increases in off - peak fares ) .
Shame she can't do anything about the stations .
Catch a train on a Sunday at one of the smaller calling points : the waiting room will be closed , leaving you shivering on a windswept platform .
And improving the catering wo n't be difficult .
The other week I was refused a cup of hot water for my own teabag , because they " did n't have any " .
( CNN ) -- Professional basketball star Shaquille O'Neal paid for the funeral of a 5 - year - old North Carolina girl whose body was found last week , O'Neal 's team confirmed Thursday .
Authorities believe the child , Shaniya Davis , was kidnapped , raped and murdered after being reported missing November 10 .
Her body was found six days later on a roadside about 30 miles from her hometown of Fayetteville , North Carolina .
Her funeral was Sunday .
O'Neal said in a statement released by his team , the Cleveland Cavaliers , that he was touched after seeing Davis ' story on CNN sister network HLN's " Nancy Grace " show .
" What happened to her was tragic .
I wanted her to have a funeral that would be as beautiful as she was , " O'Neal said in the statement .
Corey Breece , of Rogers and Breece Funeral Home , told the Fayetteville Observer he would n't discuss the cost of the child 's service , but he noted a child 's funeral " averages around $ 4,500 . "
The girl 's father , Bradley Lockhart , and his family had set up a trust fund to help raise money to pay for the service , according to the Fayetteville Observer .
Family friend Vaughn Eason told the paper any remaining money would be used for groups and charities working to assist abused and neglected children .
Police have charged Mario Andrette McNeill with kidnapping and said he also will face murder and child rape charges .
Preliminary autopsy results indicated the child was asphyxiated , Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine told reporters last week , as authorities awaited final autopsy reports .
Davis ' mother , Antionette Nicole Davis , has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses .
Police have said they believe she was prostituting the girl .
O'Neal , as a volunteer for law enforcement agencies in recent years , has been active in causes that deal with domestic violence issues , mainly child - abuse cases .

Remember going to birthday parties or the carnival as a child and getting your face painted ?
Face painting is fun and magical , and it lets us temporarily transform ourselves .
You can be just about anything , from a fierce animal to a dainty fairy to a weird celebrity look - alike .
Unfortunately , most of us stop getting our faces painting when we become adults .
James Kuhn , however , picked up the habit as an adult – and ran with it .
James Kuhn has considered him an artist for his whole life , but it was n’t until he grew up that he began painting his own face with a new theme every single day .
He decided to do one new face painting a day for a year , in the vein of the other “ 365 days of self portraits ” projects .
He did n’t enjoy other 365 projects , saying they were self - indulgent or silly .
So he decided to take another ( arguably also silly ) route by creating a masterpiece every day .
All of James ’ paintings are done on himself , and he usually takes his own pictures as well .
These are some of the most unique self - portraits ever , since he looks quite different in every one of them .
If additional pieces are needed , he usually cuts them out of cardboard , paints them , and sticks them to his face as needed .
James is always looking for new inspiration for his creations .
He has used everything from cartoon characters to his favorite foods to famous duos and groups , and everything in between .
Some of the most amazing face portraits are those featuring two or more people .
It ’s fun to decipher how he divides up his existing facial features to create features for the characters .
His particular form of artistic body painting is just for fun , though his other artwork has been displayed in galleries .
He believes that , overall , making money from art should n’t be an artist ’s top priority ; their goal should be to push through their fear and their conventional thinking to create something new and thought - provoking .
His incredible face painting has gained him international attention , and he ’s been featured on TV shows and in newspapers around the world .
The artist , who lives in Michigan , describes himself as a face paint illusionist , drag queen , performance artist , and full - time Christian .
He ’s recently been featured in a Ripley ’s Believe It or Not !
picture book , and although the 365 days of self - portraits are over , he continues to create masterpieces on his own face .
You can see many of his face paintings come to life on his YouTube channel .

Roll back preconceptions for a minute , and look at history as a series of 3,000 - year cycles .
After all , that ’s about how long it takes an idea to take hold of a population and be fully acted out , from the highest to the lowest levels .
By “ idea ” here I mean a big idea .
The biggest idea of our last 3,000 years , and the only idea steadily gaining in distribution , has been the equality of human individuals .
Our modern governments , institutions and social attitudes are founded on it .
It in turn is founded on the idea of egalitarianism , or equality of treatment for all people , which comes from a social impulse — a type of politeness — called altruism , or wanting to do good for others .
Altruism can exist in a selfless form , where you expect no one to know the good things you ’ve done for them , or a manipulative form , where you very publicly do good things so people think you ’re a good person — and then do good things for you .
The enforcer of this altruism , guilt , is what people feel when they do n’t reciprocate when someone has done something nice for them .
If I give you a newspaper and say , “ It ’s free , but I ’m trying to sell lemonade , ” you ’re more likely to buy a glass — if it ’s cheap enough to not sidetrack you .
This psychology underlies our social urge to be egalitarian .
Others extend to us equality ; we should extend it to them .
Even more , we avoid conflict this way and as a bonus , we look good to others because we are altruistic .
Eventually we start trying to prove we ’re actually more altruistic than they are — a form of social one - upmanship similar to “ keeping up with the Joneses ” but in moral and not material form — in what is called competitive altruism .
This is exclusively the manipulative variant because it ’s always public and is done to make the altruist look better , and therefore through guilt , be owed more by the society as a whole .
The object of this competition is called status .
Unlike actual ability , status reflects the degree of approval of an individual by his or her fellow citizens , according to the consensual reality of altruism and guilt :
“ I Am Charlotte Simmons , ” particularly in its notice of the coarse sexuality governing campus life , is a book a liberal would never write , as corroborated in the many negative reviews …he was frankly taken aback by those who took it “ as a counterrevolutionary attack on the sexual revolution .
. . .
Then it really dawned on me that so many people are proud of the sexual revolution , you know , ‘ We freed ourselves from those damned religious people and this Puritanism . ' ”
This is Tom Wolfe ’s MO–sorting out and at once demolishing pretension , snobbery , vanity in all its guises .
“ There is such a thing as intellectual fashion –just as we get our clothing fashions–and often it does not mean anything more , ” he says .
“ One follows fashion in order to look proper , and it ’s the same thing with ideas . ” {snip} Mr. Wolfe offers a personal incident as evidence of “ what a fashion liberalism is . ”
A reporter for the New York Times called him up to ask why George W. Bush was apparently a great fan of the “ Charlotte Simmons ” book .
“ I just assumed it was the dazzling quality of the writing , ” he says .
In the course of the reporting , however , it came out that Mr. Wolfe had voted for the Bush ticket .
“ The reaction among the people I move among was really interesting .
It was as if I had raised my hand and said , ‘ Oh , by the way , I forgot to tell you , I ’m a child molester . ' ” { snap}
We ’ve plowed headfirst into one of Mr. Wolfe ’s great themes .
He has long argued American literature was going through a bad patch , and the condition would n’t improve until authors engaged with the density and complexity of “ this wild , bizarre , unpredictable , Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours . ”
So any change , 15 - odd years later ?
“ No , I do n’t see any at all , ” he says acutely .
“ The great emphasis is still put on the psychological novel , and to dig your hands into the dirty social reality is really unrefined . . . as if the social context does n’t mean a thing . ”
That ’s the thing , the social context .
“ All of us are products of this vast plane called the social reality , the weight of the time and place we live , intersecting vertically with the individual psychology , or our impulses .
And a person ’s psyche , to use a vague term , is the result of the intersection . ”
“ I think every living moment of a human being ’s life , unless the person is starving or in immediate danger of death in some other way , is controlled by a concern for status , ” he says .

Tom Wolfe is an astute writer who identifies himself as a Nietzschean in some of his older interviews , not so much from an advocacy perspective as being cognizant of the philosophy and aware of the troubling ideas it brings up :
Once upon a time , in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems , there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing .
That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of “ world history , ” but nevertheless , it was only a minute .
After nature had drawn a few breaths , the star cooled and congealed , and the clever beasts had to die .
One might invent such a fable , and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable , how shadowy and transient , how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature .
On Truth and Lies in a Sense Outside Morality , by F.W. Nietzsche
Nietzsche talks about us inventing knowing , meaning creating a domain in which human thoughts supplant reality for the purposes of assessing what is important , real or meaningful to us .
After all , with our big brains , we have a choice .
We can decide principle is more important than consequences .
We can go into denial , and become narcissistic — or worse , solipsistic .
We can pick a pleasant emotion that lets us put our heads down and work without knowing we ’ll succeed , or we can use that same denial to ignore our mortality , or even , to push aside reality in favor of moral measurement of intentions , desires or the effects on the individual of necessary parts of reality .
Wolfe takes Nietzsche ’s knowing and breaks it down to understand it better .
One aspect of our knowing is our certainty that equality , human rights , democracy and freedom are essential to society ; even more , in our knowing , is the idea that those who are altruistic are risen in social status over others .
It would be quite the mental trip , then , if we found out that “ knowing ” in this context had a biological origin , meaning that it ’s not a choice of our “ free will , ” but an impulse from within the intricate nest of hormones , nerve impulses and gestures inculcated by natural selection which forms the part of us that is unconscious , or not under the control of our personalities :
The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system .
It is a bundle of nerves that originates in the top of the spinal cord , it activates different organs throughout the body ( heart , lungs , liver , digestive organs ) .
When active , it is likely to produce that feeling of warm expansion in the chest , for example when we are moved by someoneâ€™s goodness or when we appreciate a beautiful piece of music .
University of Illinois , Chicago , psychiatrist Steve Porges long ago argued that the vagus nerve is a care - taking organ in the body ( of course , it serves many other functions as well ) .
Several reasons justify this claim .
The vagus nerve is thought to stimulate certain muscles in the vocal chamber , enabling communication .
It reduces heart rate .
Very new science suggests that it may be closely connected to oxytocin receptor networks .
And it is unique to mammals .
Our research and that of other scientists suggests that the vagus nerve may be a physiological system that supports caretaking and altruism .
We have found that activation of the vagus nerve is associated with feelings of compassion and the ethical intuition that humans from different social groups ( even adversarial ones ) share a common humanity .
People who have high vagus nerve activation in a resting state , we have found , are prone to feeling emotions that promote altruism — compassion , gratitude , love , happiness .
Arizona State University psychologist Nancy Eisenberg has found that children with elevated vagal tone ( high baseline vagus nerve activity ) are more cooperative and likely to give .
This area of study is the beginning of a fascinating new argument about altruism — that a branch of our nervous system evolved to support such behavior .
Scientific American
Life must be studied as a process , meaning anything that produces a reward rapidly gets assimilated into the cycle of life , and confers an advantage onto those who have it .
Could it be possible that millenia of biology have shaped us to base our self - esteem on how we are approved of by others , and that the index of this comparison is vagus - stirring altruism ?
While there ’s no question that there ’s a deep human drive for a feeling of self - esteem or competence , this feeling of competence is almost never assessed on its own : we are social beings at the core , and as such our sense of competence appears to be deeply connected to others around us .
Self - esteem may not be an accurate way of understanding this feeling of ‘ okayness ’ , when we actually measure this constantly against others .
Instead of self - esteem , we need to start thinking about the more dynamic sense of ‘ status ’ .
Status means where are we positioned in relation to those around us : literally where we are in the â€˜pecking order ’ .
Your perception of status , and any changes in it , can be a driver of what ’s called primary reward or threat .
A sense of increasing status can be more rewarding than money , and a sense of decreasing status can feel like your life is in danger .
Here ’s an excerpt from Your Brain at Work on this whole issue .
{snip} Naomi Eisenberger , a leading social neuroscience researcher at UCLA , wanted to understand what goes on in the brain when people feel rejected by others .
She designed an experiment that used fMRI to scan the brains of participants as they played a computer game called “ Cyberball . ”
Cyberball harks back to the nastiness of the school playground .
“ People thought they were playing a ball tossing game over the Internet with two other people , ” Eisenberger explained during an interview down the road from her lab .
“ They could see an avatar that represented them , and avatars for two other people .
Then , about half way through this game of toss between the three of them , they stop receiving the ball and the other players throw the ball only to each other . ”
This experiment generates intense emotions for most people .
Eisenberger says , “ What we found is that when people were excluded , you see activity in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex , which is the neural region that ’s also involved in the distressing component of pain , or what sometimes people call the “ suffering component ” of pain .
Those people who felt the most rejected had the highest levels of activity in this region . ”
Psychology Today
Fear of exclusion enforces altruism .
But altruism itself can be hacked .
For example , if I become a philanthropist and give away lots of money in a very public way , while using the goodwill engendered to get people to look the other way while I do sketchy things on the side , I ’ve hacked altruism .
The altruism represented 10 % of my wealth , and the 90 % came from invisible ( to most people , who are n’t going to go out of their way to look ) bad deeds .
Slowly , however , people are starting to study how the guilt / altruism cycle replaces our desire to perceive reality with a knee - jerk instinct to placate others through potlatch :
Current work on cooperation is focused on the theory of reciprocal altruism .
However , reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples .
Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited .
I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour .
Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non-altruists may become ostracized .
I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity .
Altruism may be rewarded in kind , but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all , for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates .
This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity .
I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality , as proposed by the handicap principle .
I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers .
I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished .

None of this will be taboo research , but if we start to apply it to our thinking about how this impulse controls our socialization , economics , politics and even thinking — because it exists at a layer of thought and assumption below our conscious minds — we start to see it as a virus or other parasitic entity , because it manipulates us so that it may live on , oblivious to the consequences to us :
To relate this condition to the prisoner ’s dilemma , an individual may benefit the most in a one - time interaction with another by defecting ( i.e. receiving benefits without incurring any cost to itself ) .
However , in an iterated prisoner ’s dilemma , where individuals interact more than once , if the act of defecting makes the individual less likely to attract a fit mate in the future , then cooperative behavior will be selected for .
[ 1 ]
This selection for cooperation is even stronger if an individual ’s action in an interaction is observed by third - party individuals , for the possibility of forming a reputation arises .
Amotz Zahavi , famous for his work with the altruistic Arabian babbler , suggests that this level of “ social prestige ” will affect which individuals interact with one another and how they behave .
Wikipedia
Wolfe again , expanding on how the foundation of sociology is a study in a Nietzschean context of how this altruistic , or maybe we should say “ politeness , ” reciprocal impulse controls what we ’re willing to allow ourselves to realize about the world :
When I was in graduate school , I was introduced to this concept of social status in the work of Max Weber , the German sociologist .
And the more I thought about it , the more I could see that status was not simply something that was appearances and houses and automobiles , or even ranks in a corporation or that sort of thing .
It invaded every single part of life .
Every time we go into a room with other people , itâ€™s as if we have a teleprompter in front of us and itâ€™s telling us the history of ourselves versus these people .
We canâ€™t even think of thinking without this huge library of good information and bad information .
When you get up in the morning , you do not think about triangles and squares and these similes that psychologists have been using for the past 100 years .
You think about status .
You think about where you are in relation to your peers .
Youâ€ ™re thinking about your spouse , about your kids , about your boss .
Ninety - nine percent of your time is spent thinking about other peopleâ€™s thoughts about you , their intentions , and all this kind of stuff .
Seed
In postmodern theory , one area of extensive study is the concept of “ narrative , ” or how we as individuals formulate a story from the third person which explains our motives , their justifications ( usually in terms of altruism , because that is 100 % universally absolutely accepted , where anything else varies with the audience ) , and our goals with the intent of having other people understand us and approve .
A narrative is how we explain ourselves to the world :
Imagine I show you a list of 30 words .
One of the words is written in green ink .
The rest are blue .
Half an hour goes by and I ask you to recall the words on the list .
Which word are you most likely to remember ?
The one written in green ink , of course .
This is the “ von Restorff Effect ” : Novelty grabs our attention .
It ’s basic cognitive hardwiring .
Journalists do n’t zero in on “ man bites dog ” stories because they ’re perverse .
They do it because they ’re human . …
When a story breaks , grabs the media ’s attention , and gets people talking , something else happens .
The story ceases to be about a single incident .
Instead , it creates a narrative .
The absence of a narrative means a story must stand or fall on its own .
And when a story runs contrary to a narrative , it is positively resisted .
The Ottawa Citizen
Another word for narrative is “ script , ” as in , “ since we were looking for guys dressed in black carrying bicycles , he fit right into our script . ”
The media uses these means to control you : novelty and its stepchild , negativity — since evolution has primed you to first look for threats — and a script into which all news must fit .
We could call that script a “ justification , ” as we do in our manifesto .
When those who have money and power want you to jump , they make a few calls to their friends and business associates .
They put out the meme : X is the new threat , or Y is another instance of the current script of threats , whether it be global warming , hackers , racists , Satanists or godless Communism .
That ’s how you keep a nation in line when they do n’t have much in common as far as ideologies , values , etc. go .
You manipulate them with carrot and stick : we free , they bad .
Much as democracy relies on having a horde of people who do n’t read or think very deeply about issues , modern society relies on useful idiots to bleat out that the sky is falling any time such a meme comes around .
How does this relate to history at large ?
Well , as recent research points out , social attitudes shape genetics , and so a culture that chose , say , altruism over competence — picking flattering and conflict - avoiding people to those who want to get the right answer and do n’t care who gets upset — might literally breed themselves into docility and lose the ability to solve problems , because they reward those who are docile with better chances of breeding , better jobs , better social scenes and more general approval :
Culture , not just genes , can drive evolutionary outcomes , according to a study released Wednesday that compares individualist and group - oriented societies across the globe .
Bridging a rarely - crossed border between natural and social sciences , the study looks at the interplay across 29 countries of two sets of data , one genetic and the other cultural .
The researchers found that most people in countries widely described as collectivist have a specific mutation within a gene regulating the transport of serotonin , a neurochemical known to profoundly affect mood .
{ snip} “ What we are proposing is that cultural and genetic selection actually operate in tandem , and that you can view human behaviour as a product of culture - gene co-evolution , ” she said .
AFP
Is n’t that interesting … cultural values determine what genetic combinations are rewarded with reproduction , and as a result , gradually shape the population .
In that view , of course , we ’re playing with more than we realize when we look at the importance of not letting a social virus or fashion subvert our values system .

JOBLESS RATES JOBLESS RATES
Cultural factors help limit recession 's impact RALEIGH , N.C.  Until this summer , Loc Tran , 59 , was a technician at Nortel , a global communications company that has facilities at Research Triangle Park here .
Then she left and bought Pho ' Cali , a Vietnamese restaurant .
When her brother lost his job at another local electronics company , he did n't become unemployed .
He joined the family business .
" My brother works here now , " Tran says .
The recession has been brutal for just about every segment of the population , but though the unemployment rate for Asian Americans has been inching upward , it has been far lower than the rates for whites , blacks , Hispanics or the nation as a whole .
Among those groups , Asian Americans have had the lowest jobless rate every month since 2000 , when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking monthly unemployment among Asians .
The unemployment gap — 7.5 % for Asians in October , compared with 10.2 % nationwide — stems from a combination of education benchmarks and cultural traditions that foster family support when someone is out of work , researchers say .
" Asians in the United States , both native born Asians and Asian immigrants , have higher educational levels than other groups , " says Alan Berube , senior fellow and research director of the Brookings Institution 's Metropolitan Policy Program .
A recent Labor Department report on the work force shows a greater proportion of Asians than other racial or ethnic groups in management , professional and related occupations — jobs that require more schooling and are high - paying .
About 47 % work in management or professional jobs compared with 35 % for the U.S. work force as a whole .
PHOTOS : Asian Americans ride out tough economy EMPLOYMENT : More U.S. job hunters seek work abroad Asians account for 5 % of U.S. workers but make up a disproportionate share of computer software engineers ( 29 % ) , computer programmers ( 20 % ) , computer scientists and system analysts ( 16 % ) .
" The character of this recession and how it 's affected groups by educational attainment shows that information technology has done better , health care has done better , " Berube says .
Asians also are " tied in by a social network , a family network , " says Paul Ong , a professor of Asian American Studies at UCLA .
" Rather than lay people off , you will find them spread the work out and there is lots of use of family labor . "
Work ethics and close family ties certainly are not unique to Asians .
But when coupled with high educational levels , those characteristics contribute to a lower unemployment rate .
Hispanics , for example , demonstrate similar work and family values but their population as a whole is not as educated as Asians .
Cultural and family ties are strong in immigrant - dominated communities and are powerful when combined with income and education , says Robert Lang , sociology professor at the University of Nevada - Las Vegas .
" Despite their upward mobility , Asians are still a minority group and thus more closely connected to one another than a native - born Caucasian American , " he says .
" You 're much more on your own if you 're a middle - income , native - born white American , especially in a big city . "
Seema Agnani , executive director of Chhaya , a community organization in Jackson Heights , a South Asian neighborhood in Queens , N.Y. , cautions that unemployment rates can be deceptively low because some immigrants work for cash and are not officially on a payroll .
" A lot of the folks who have lost income are not going to necessarily claim unemployment typically because they were n't working on the books in the first place , " she says .
A combination of factors
The demographics of Asian Americans — from high educational levels to extended family networks — and complex cultural nuances help create the disparity in jobless rates : • More educated .
About 30 % of Asians 25 and older have a bachelor 's degree and almost 20 % have a graduate degree , compared with 17 % and 10 % for the nation overall .
All other groups have a smaller share of college graduates : 18 % of whites have a bachelor 's degree and 11 % a more advanced degree ; 12 % and 6 % of blacks ; 9 % and 4 % of Hispanics .
• Larger households .
The median income for Asian households is higher — $ 68,400 vs. $ 52,175 for all groups — but Asians have larger households , with more workers , Ong says .
" If we look at per capita income rather than household income , it 's another story . "
In the Los Angeles - Long Beach - Riverside area , for example , median household income is more than $ 65,000 a year for Asians , exceeding that of non-Hispanic whites by more than $ 10,000 , the Census Bureau reports .
Per capita income for Asians in this community , however , is lower than for whites .
• Family ties and small businesses .
Hans Huang , 36 , was a partner in a Raleigh law firm until it merged with another company .
They parted ways .
He started his own consulting firm and opened two restaurants — the hip 101 Lounge +
Café and the Moonlight Pizza Company in downtown Raleigh .
A graduate of the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill , Huang says investments his parents made also are in his and his sister 's name — typical of the cohesion and financial support within many Asian families .
" There is a propensity for active networking with the community and family , " says Hai Ly Burk , who came to the USA as a refugee from Vietnam at age 3 .
She is a social worker at Duke Raleigh Hospital and president of the local chapter of the National Association of Asian American Professionals .
That sometimes can be more easily done in small , family - owned businesses than large corporations .
Whites and Asians — and especially Asian immigrants — are more likely to be self - employed than other groups , the Labor Department says .
•
Less risky jobs .
Many Asians gravitate toward jobs that carry greater job security .
A large number of Filipinos , for example , work as nurses , teachers and postal employees .
" They are risk - averse ... and tend to stay longer ( in the same jobs ) so they have seniority , " Ong says .
Health care is one of only two economic sectors to grow in the recession .
The other is education .
Many Asians are doctors , nurses or technicians .
Since the start of the recession , health care has added 597,000 jobs .
" Asian Americans are far more into the area of science technology and business in the corporate financial banking sector , " says Larry Shinagawa , director of Asian American Studies at the University of Maryland .
" They are ensconced in government and education , though a significant portion are in small business . "
• Unemployment is frowned upon .
There is a cultural resistance among Asians to being idle and collecting money for not working , Shinagawa says .
" Better to be underemployed than unemployed , " he says .
" They 're working in jobs where they 're overly qualified and that has a lot to do with small business and a family network where they can support one another . "
Working - class Asians , especially immigrants , are likely to accept any job to earn money , says C.N. Le , director of Asian & Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts .
" That 's all it is for them , as opposed to a lot of Americans who see their jobs as a reflection of their own identity and self - esteem , " says Le , creator of asian - nation.org , a website that focuses on Asian Americans .
Difficulties for some National numbers mask the struggles of low - income Asian immigrants , many of them refugees such as the large Hmong community in Minnesota .
Many in those communities are n't well - educated and do n't speak English well .
Unemployment claims filed by Southeast Asians in Minnesota jumped 150 % from 2007 to 2009 , says Lisa Hasegawa , executive director of the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development .
Meanwhile , Chinatowns and Little Saigons in several cities are hurting because people are cutting back on restaurant spending , Shinagawa says , and small family businesses are being pushed out by big chains .
" Look at dry cleaners , " he says .
" The Zip Cleaners ( a chain ) are taking over .
In the past , bigger chain stores would never go into inner-city neighborhoods . "
Now , " there is a recognition that people of color are a significant portion of the economy . "
A region of opportunity Here in the Research Triangle , a region anchored by Raleigh , Durham and Chapel Hill , top - tier universities , high - tech companies and research centers have attracted Asian professionals .
Asians ' unemployment rate here is even lower than their national rate , averaging just above 3 % in the past year in Wake County , home of Raleigh .
It was above 4 % for non-Hispanic whites , almost 8 % for blacks and above 5 % for Hispanics , according to the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina .
Many highly educated Asians here have been recruited by companies and universities and granted special visas because of their expertise .
If they 're here , they have work .
When the jobs disappear , they return home and never appear on U.S. unemployment rolls .
" With their American experience , they can leverage that and start their own company " back home , says Hector Javier , a native of Manila in the Philippines and a consultant in technology operations at Cisco Systems in the Research Triangle .
" The first generation is going back . "
Not everyone is prospering .
Cyndy Yu-Robinson , 43 , was a public affairs officer for the Environmental Protection Agency in Durham .
She wanted to go into the private sector and took a job as manager of corporate responsibility for computer maker Lenovo in March 2008 .
This year , Lenovo started cutting jobs , including hers .
" At first , it was disbelief .
It could n't be happening to me , " says Yu- Robinson , a mother of two .
" I chose to go on unemployment because I want to take advantage of resources available to me to find the right job . "
She 's active in Asian - American organizations and admits that hearing Asians ' attitudes toward unemployment stings a bit .
" If I did n't care about the kind of career , I would 've taken any job , " Yu- Robinson says .
" I do n't want to just go back to government . "
While she lines up job interviews , she teaches up to eight karate classes a week at Triangle 's Best Karate , the studio she owns with her husband .

Executive Summary
City of Houston
Disturbing Financial Facts --- October 2009
By : Bob Lemer , Aubrey M. Farb and Tom Roberts
The City of Houston is financially broke and it appears that the mayor who takes office in January 2010 may have to captain the City through bankruptcy procedures .
The City ’s unrestricted assets were $ 1.2 billion short of the already recorded
corresponding liabilities these assets were needed to pay as of fiscal year end June 30 , 2008 , according to the City ’s latest publicly available audited Comprehensive Annual Financial Report ( CAFR ) .
The $ 1.2 billion shortfall was a result of operating losses totaling $ 1.5 billion for fiscal years 2004 - 2008 , applying the full accrual basis of accounting used in the private sector .
Apparently the City has no idea as to what has transpired financially since June 30 , 2008 or will transpire this fiscal year ending June 30 , 2010 , on the full accrual basis of accounting .
But even on the modified accrual basis of accounting ( essentially cash basis ) followed by the City and all other municipalities , the $ 236.8 million fund balance in the City ’s general fund as of July 1 , 2009 ( the beginning of this current fiscal year ) would not exist except for the City having deposited the proceeds of pension obligation bonds into the City ’s general fund instead of depositing them in their legally required immediate destination , the pension plans ’ bank accounts .
The City is in this dangerous financial position because its total spending since fiscal year 2003 has greatly outstripped its total revenues in that period .
And the rate of growth in the City ’s total revenues since 2003 has , in turn , greatly outstripped the City ’s rate of growth in population plus inflation .
Thus the City ’s problems are a result of greatly overspending and not a result of
insufficient revenues .
All of this occurred before the current severe recession .
Now the City has the added burden of the recession .
The City is in a real financial dilemma , because now its two principal sources of general fund revenues are in trouble --- sales taxes and property taxes .
Sales tax revenues already are dropping significantly and property tax revenues will commence dropping at an even more rapid rate after the next annual appraisal and assessment process .
And the City will have to go to the voters for any contemplated rate increases in either the sales tax rate or the portion of the property tax rate allocable to operations .
It appears to us that there may be no viable alternative to bankruptcy proceedings and thereby positioning the City to regain control over its overspending , through addressing structural spending problems such as overstaffing and overly generous employee benefits .
Pension Plans and Government Salaries To Blame
Detailed Findings and Observations
1 . The City incurred operating losses ( “ Change In Net Assets ” ) totaling approximately $ 1.5 billion for the five fiscal years ended 6/30/08 --- per the latest ( fiscal year 2008 ) publicly available audited Comprehensive Annual Financial Report ( CAFR ) , page 199 :
In Thousands
a. ( 312,790 )
b. ( 531,465 )
c. ( 131,893 )
d. ( 221,452 )
e. ( 281,556 )
TOTAL ( 1,479,156 ) ---or--- $ 1.5 BILLION
2 . The City ’s deficiency in unrestricted assets [ “ Unrestricted ( deficit ) ” ] was $ 1.2 BILLION ( $ 1,174,429 thousands ) at June 30 , 2008 --- per 2008 CAFR , page 15 .
In other words , the City ’s unrestricted assets were approximately $ 1.2 billion less than the already recorded liabilities that they will be required to satisfy .
3 . The $ 1.2 billion deficiency in unrestricted assets as of June 30 , 2008 ( which was created essentially during fiscal years 2004 - 2008 - see item 1 ) was basically financed , per page 15 of the 2008 CAFR , by :
( a ) the $ 347,728,000 collateralized note payable to the municipal employees ’
pension trust ;
( b ) the $ 643,413,000 combined accrued liabilities to the employees ’ pension
trusts ( municipal - $ 285,462,000 , police officers ’-$ 318,567,000 , and firefighters ’ - $ 39,384,000 ) ;
( c ) the $ 219,755,000 pension obligation bonds payable ;
( d ) the $ 272,941,000 accrued liability for other post employment benefits ----- less , per pages 17 and 74 of the 2003 CAFR ,
( d ) the $ 54,395,000 net accrued liabilities to the employees ’ pension trusts at June 30 , 2003 ( municipal - $ 92,386,000 , police officers ’ - $ 19,221,000 , and firefighters ’- asset of $ 57,212,000 ) .
4 . Thus , as of June 30 , 2008 , the City ’s elected officials essentially had transferred financial ownership of the City from the taxpayers to the City ’s employees , about 43.7 % of who do not live in the City , according to documentation we have received from the City ’s human resources department .
Very troubling , 63.3 % of first responders ( police officers and firefighters ) do not live in the City , versus just 30.0 % of civilian employees , according to the City ’s human resources department .
5 . The City ’s deficiency in unrestricted assets is so severe that in their yet to be completed audit for fiscal year 2009 the City ’s independent auditors apparently will have to address the audit reporting issue as to whether the City was a “ going concern ” as of June 30 , 2009 .
6 . Apparently the City has no idea yet as to what its operating loss ( “ change in net assets ” ) was for the fiscal year just ended June 30 , 2009 or what its deficiency in unrestricted assets was at June 30 , 2009 , and has no idea as to what is in store fiscally for fiscal year 2010 .
That is because the City does not keep its books on the full accrual basis of accounting ( fully accruing its assets and liabilities ) but once a year , via the audited Comprehensive Annual Financial Report ( CAFR ) .
And the CAFR cannot be completed until the ( nearly always very substantial ) annual audit adjustments are booked .
....
17 .
For example , Exhibit B demonstrates how it was possible for the City to actually show an audited surplus of $ 19,891,000 from operations in the general fund ( which is the focus of the annual budget and the MFOR ) for fiscal year 2008 when , in reality , the City had an audited Citywide operations deficit of $ 281,556,000 for fiscal year 2008 .
18 . Exhibit B is difficult to comprehend for a person not trained in governmental accounting , even for a CPA .
But the two most significant reasons for the difference between the $ 19,891,000 general fund surplus from 2008 operations and the $ 281,556,000 deficit from 2008 Citywide operations are : ( a ) the ever - growing accrued liabilities to employees for pension plans and other post retirement benefits ; and ( b ) the commenced practice of financing current pension plan expenses with backend loaded pension obligation long - term bonds .
19 .
Once one understands Exhibit B , or at least items 18 ( a ) and 18 ( b ) , it becomes obvious that the City ’s fiscal 2010 general fund budget is an illusion , for two reasons .
First , it is calculated on the modified accrual basis of accounting ( essentially cash basis ) and therefore ignores the ever - growing and enormous accrued liabilities for employee pensions and other post retirement benefits .
Secondly , it is dependent upon continued payment of some of the pension expenses with issuance of long - term backend loaded pension obligation bonds .
23 . At June 30 , 2008 ( date of the City ’s last audited financial statements ) , the City ’s total Citywide debt per capita of $ 5,338 was over twice the $ 2,528 debt per capita of the now bankrupt State of California .
California Is Bankrupt Too
What About Oregon ?
The cost of Oregon 's Public Employees Retirement System is about to skyrocket to budget - busting levels .
As a result of PERS ' $ 17 billion investment loss in 2008 , every state agency , municipality and school district that participates in the system is staring at an average 50 percent increase in the base rates PERS charges to fund their employees ' retirement benefits in 2011 and 2012 .
That 's not a doomsday scenario .
Unless the pension fund 's board changes its rate - setting rules , or its investment portfolio generates a 26 percent return in 2009 , these rate increases are guaranteed .
What does that mean to you ?
Fewer teachers , cops and firefighters .
Less of every service that government provides .
Higher fees and taxes .
Perhaps all of the above .
The base rate that public agencies pay to support employees ' retirement benefits could double in the next five years , according to the PERS actuary , Mercer Inc .
If rates reach that level , the retirement system will gobble one quarter of every tax dollar that goes into a public agency to support payrolls .
Oregon is n't alone .
Public pensions nationwide are in crisis mode , and state Treasurer Ben Westlund points out that Oregon 's pension system is still better funded than most .
PERS officials also note that a major recovery in the stock market could alleviate , or even eliminate , the pain .
Indeed , the system 's investment portfolio has already bounced back 14 percent this year .
But here 's the rub :
Even if the pension system 's investments return an average 10.5 percent annually for the next three years - their historical average - PERS rates will still increase to 21 percent of payroll in July 2013 , according to Mercer 's modeling .
If , in a slower growth scenario , investment returns are closer to their 10 - year average of 4.5 percent , all bets are off .
PERS ' executive director , Paul Cleary , recently told the citizens board that oversees investment of the $ 50 billion pension fund that if 4.5 percent is the new normal , " our business model does n't work . "

Forget about kicking back and enjoying an American beer ; a massive wave of consolidation is transforming the industry .
According to a recent report by the Marin Institute , a California - based alcohol industry watchdog , a rush of buyouts and mergers in the last years of the Bush Administration has left two overseas giants in control of 80 percent of American beer consumption .
“ How beer is marketed and sold in this country will never be the same , ” said Charisse Lebron , corporate responsibility & advocacy manager at the Marin Institute .
“ Anheuser - Busch InBev and MillerCoors , controlled by parent companies SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company , are all that really matter in the U.S. ”
America is the world ’s most profitable beer market , yet the U.S. has lost what was once a competitive industry .
As recently as 2004 , ten companies fought over world consumption ; today Belgium - based InBev ( Anheuser - Busch InBev ) controls 25 percent of the world ’s beer market .
SABMiller , the second largest brewer with 15 percent of the market , is a London - based conglomerate that formed when South African Breweries acquired U.S. - owned Miller in 2002 .
From 1947 to 1995 , the number of large brewers in the U.S. fell 90 percent .
As recently as 2003 , American - owned Anheuser - Busch was the world ’s largest beer company , with 12 breweries in the U.S. and 15 overseas , producing the world ’s most popular beers : Bud Light and Budweiser .
In 2004 , the world ’s third and fifth largest brewers , Belgian Interbrew and Brazilian AmBev , merged to create the world ’s largest beer producer , AmBev .
In the buyout frenzy of 2008 , AmBev bought Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion to become InBev and control the popular beers : Budweiser , Michelob , Stella Artois and Bass .
Yearly sales for InBev topped $ 40 billion in 2008 , surpassing SABMiller - Miller Lite , Miller Draft , Henry Weinhard ’s - with $ 21 billion in revenue .
Today InBev is a behemoth with 151 beverage plants and 120,000 employees worldwide .
The new company sells four of the top ten beers in the world , produces the first or second most popular beers in over 20 markets and ships beer to over a hundred countries .
In 2007 , to better compete with InBev , SABMiller announced a joint venture with Molson Coors , the world ’s fifth largest beer producer .
Headquartered in Chicago , the newly formed MillerCoors is controlled by its parent companies , London - based SABMiller and Canada - Colorado - based Molson Coors , which reported gross profits of 70 percent in March 2009 .
SABMiller corporate leadership forms half of MillerCoors ’ board and receives 58 percent of the profits .
Although microbreweries are growing in popularity - there were 1,300 in 2006 - they represent a mere ten percent of total beer sales .
There ’s no way they can compete with the giants , who dominate the market .
Approved in record times by President Bush ’s Federal Trade Commission , these beer mergers have a number of drawbacks .
Charisse Lebron , author of the Beer Duopoly Report , predicts that American shareholders will have difficulty attending annual meetings overseas .
Less shareholder involvement could lead to lower environmental and labor standards , while InBev and MillerCoors replace local beer distributorships with direct distribution from the brewery .
The current three - tier system of alcohol sales and distribution was established 75 years ago to prevent aggressive sales tactics and give states oversight of alcohol .
“ We advocate for the distributors because they are community based , have been around a long time , and are attuned and accountable to consumers and regulators , ” Lebron said .
An even more troubling problem arises over taxes , especially with government facing reduced tax revenues .
Federal alcohol excise taxes have n’t been raised since 1991 and , adjusted for inflation , have lost 40 percent of their value .
State taxes are similar : Wisconsin has n’t raised its alcohol tax to keep up with inflation since 1969 and has lost 83 percent of its value .
Maryland ’s alcohol excise tax was set in 1972 at 9 cents a gallon , but would be 38 cents a gallon if it were adjusted for inflation .
“ Increasing taxes is the number one most effective way to reduce underage drinking and overall harm , ” said Lebron .
“ The beer companies know that and are fighting it , despite the fact that alcohol harm in California alone amounts to $ 38 billion a year .
In the U.S. , it ’s over $ 200 billion a year .
Industries that cause harm , such as alcohol and tobacco , should be financially responsible for some portion of that harm . ”
The beer duopoly is spending large amounts to prevent tax increases .
The Marin Institute estimates that in 2009 alone the beer lobby defeated bills to raise alcohol taxes in 14 states that cost taxpayers $ 2.6 billion in revenue .
If alcohol taxes were adjusted for inflation nationwide , it would add $ 6 billion to tax coffers .
Beer producers spend lavishly to defeat tax bills :
On the national level , InBev spent over $ 1.5 million in 2008 .
Additionally , InBev , MillerCoors , and its parent companies , spent almost $ 6 million lobbying state and local governments .
They threaten state legislatures with closed breweries and lost jobs if taxes rise .
Americans are discovering that companies that once served their interest now determine their lives .
Although some continue to support unregulated “ free enterprise , ” others find that powerful monopolies now determine government policy .
It ’s time to limit political contributions and control lobbying .

This week , guardian .co.uk / film is being taken over by Jon Ronson , ahead of the release of The Men Who Stare at Goats , based on his book of the same name investigating the ' psychic super - spies ' trained by the US army .
Today , Ronson 's friend Mark Pilkington rounds up his top five urban myths about the military , and suggests why they tend to stick
Last year , the astronaut Edgar Mitchell announced that aliens had repeatedly visited our planet .
Mitchell had n't seen them himself but had talked to people in the military who had .
And he believed them .
So , should we believe Edgar Mitchell ?
His views are shared by millions of others , some of them well - placed in the world 's political , military and intelligence elites .
Trust plays a critical role in these hierarchical organisations , where you might one day rely on your colleagues to save your life .
So , if someone tells you that there are aliens at Area 51 , you are inclined to listen .
At the same time , imaginary weapons can be just as powerful as real ones .
If a potential adversary claims to have its hands on advanced military toys , you can't afford to ignore them .
At the very least you will expend considerable amounts of time and money finding out if the claims are true .
You may also try to build one yourself .
Meanwhile , the effect of these dream weapons on civilian and military morale can be devastating .
British radar pioneer Reginald " RV " Jones described the fear that a 1939 speech by Hitler induced in British intelligence circles .
The Foreign Office translation had Hitler bragging about a " secret weapon against which no defence would avail " .
In a follow - up pronouncement , he frothed that it would deprive its victims of " sight and hearing " .
The Secret Intelligence Service tasked Jones with finding out what this superweapon might be .
Poring over their files he found one labelled " Death Ray " , detailing funds given to a Dutch inventor .
Like the perepetual motion machine , the death ray has been a dream of overzealous inventors throughout history and the SIS were naturally wary , remembering similar claims made by a British inventor , Harry Grindell Matthews , in the 1920s .
The SIS were right to be cautious .
With each visit the Dutch inventor had a new , more elaborate excuse for his device failing to be either super or lethal .
Finally , at the outbreak of war , the Dutchman admitted that his invention was n't working as intended .
It did , however , make an excellent fruit preserver .
The truth about Hitler 's speech ended up being rather prosaic .
The German for weapon is waffe and once Jones had the speech retranslated it became clear that Hitler was referring to the Luftwaffe , his air force .
And the mysterious power that would make its victims blind and deaf ?
Merely an awkward translation of what we would call " thunderstruck " .
And what of Edgar 's aliens ?
Do n't dismiss them too swiftly .
There are some powerful people who take psychic powers and extraterrestrial visitation extremely seriously .
Whether or not these things are real – and the jury 's still out ( just about ) – it 's the duty of a nation 's protectors to be prepared , just in case the improbable turns out to be possible after all .
The top five military myths
Ronald Reagan in 1984 .

1 ) Star wars
Back in the 1980s , Ronald Reagan 's Strategic Defence Initiative was hyped as the ultimate defensive weapon , a missile shield impervious to Russian ICBMs .
Unfortunately it did n't work but , thanks to devious technological sleight - of - hand , the Pentagon made sure that SDI 's trial by television was a spectacular success .
An impoverished Soviet Union could n't hope to keep up the pace of the arms race and its sense of defeat was a contributing factor in the end of the cold war .

2 ) Mind control
From the late 1940s , the CIA secretly attempted to control human minds using drugs and technology .
They defended the practice by saying that the communists were also doing it .
In fact Soviet " brainwashing " was a CIA propaganda creation , though the Russians no doubt started their own programme after learning what the Americans were doing .
Other experiments used electronic implants , mostly inserted into animals : a donkey was steered up a hillside , a charging bull was stopped dead in its tracks .
Today the same technology is used in humans , controlling Parkinson 's tremors or allowing disabled people to operate computers and robotic arms .

3 ) Remote viewing
The US army and CIA experimented with psychics from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s .
The psi-war began in the early 1970s as news of Soviet psychical research , combined with rumours of Uri Geller 's abilities in Israel , reached America .
The leaked Soviet research was possibly disinformation intended to waste US time and resources .
However , some of the project 's early psychics did appear to demonstrate feats of anomalous cognition , unless this was disinformation too .
Over 20 years the programme 's budget was approximately $ 20 m , suggesting that it was considered a marginal operation at best .

4 ) Weather warfare
On September 22 2005 , Scott Stevens quit his job as a TV weatherman in Pocatello , Idaho to research weather warfare .
Stevens was particularly concerned about Japanese gangsters armed with Soviet hurricane - forming technology .
Others have had the same idea .
An internal US air force paper from 1996 , Weather as a Force Multiplier : Owning the Weather in 2025 , discussed the potential for weather modification , which some believe to be the purpose of the HAARP project in Alaska and Puerto Rico .
But when it comes to cloud - seeding , the process of making rain by firing rockets into clouds , the Chinese are world leaders , where the practice has led to regional disputes over resources .

5 ) ET tech
" We have things flying in the Nevada desert that would make George Lucas drool , " says an anonymous Lockheed engineer in the February 1988 issue of Gung Ho : the Magazine for the International Military Man .
The article was among the first to suggest that alien spacecraft were flying at Area 51 , the once super - secret Nevada airbase .
Tales of the US air force back - engineering downed alien vehicles date back to 1950 , but reached a fever pitch in the late 20th century , resulting in complaints from French military officials that ET tech gave America an unfair advantage in the arms race .
Whether or not it 's true , several million people , some of them quite powerful , believe it to be so ; but perhaps our own technology is now so advanced as to be indistinguishable from the aliens ' .

This cross-section of an anglerfish 's ovary is reminiscent of another sea creature — the nautilus .
Its otherwise - dull spirally composition caught James Hayden 's eye , so he used fluorescent hematoxylin and Eosin stains to illuminate the different details of the image .
" I was trying to create an image that sharply defined the boundaries of the different parts of the specimen , so that the image could actually be used to demonstrate the morphology of the ovary and eggs , " he says .

Unter dem zugkräftigen Motto " Fesselsex statt Flaschendrehen " lud die Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz ( KJM ) am gestrigen Mittwoch zur Diskussionsrunde auf den Münchner Medientagen .
Doch fand die Expertenrunde um KJM - Präsident Wolf - Dieter Ring keine Anhaltspunkte dafür , dass die aus Sicht der Medienkontrolleure enorm gewachsene Verfügbarkeit von Pornographie im Internet tatsächlich zur " sexuellen Verwahrlosung " von jungen Menschen geführt habe .
Als " reines Medienphänomen " und sogar " Sensationsmache " bezeichnete der Leipziger Sexualforscher Kurt Starke den Begriff .
Die hierzulande legale Pornographie , laut Gesetz von Kindern fernzuhalten , bilde längst nicht mehr nur Blümchensex ab , warnte dagegen KJM - Stabschefin Verena Weigand .
Das im Netz erhältliche Material enthalte Darstellungen härterer Sexualpraktiken wie etwa Fäkalsex oder Sex im Zusammenhang mit Gewalt .
Insgesamt werde die Anzahl der Pornoseiten im weltweiten Netz auf 420 Millionen geschätzt .
Die Mitarbeiter der KJM hätten sich das in dieser
Form nicht vorstellen können , " als uns 2003 die Aufgabe ereilte , das Internet mit zu beaufsichtigen " , erklärte Weigand .
Rechtsanwalt Marko Dörre , der für den Bundesverband Erotikhandel in der Runde saß , warf die Frage auf , ob die KJM mit ihrem ehrenhaften , aber auch symbolischen Kampf gegen Pornos im Netz nicht ein irreführendes Zeichen setze : " Geben Sie den Eltern damit nicht das Signal , das Internet wird irgendwann sauber sein und sie können ihre Kinder nachmittags einfach davor setzen ? "
Tatsächlich werde man Pornographie aber nicht mehr aus dem Netz heraus bekommen .
Bei 420 Millionen Seiten und 1000 von der KJM geführten Verfahren in sechs Jahren " können Sie ausrechnen , wie lange sie noch brauchen " .
Dörre will dagegen die Eltern in die Verantwortung nehmen .
Verbieten lasse sich Pornographie tatsächlich nicht , meinte auch Starke .
Der Sexualforscher stimmte seiner ebenfalls geladenen Kollegin Petra Grimme zwar zu , dass junge Männer rund viermal so viel Pornographie im Netz konsumierten wie junge Frauen .
Dennoch falle jungen Menschen zum Thema Sexualität heutzutage als Erstes immer noch " Liebe " ein .
Das Alter für erste sexuelle Erfahrungen sei in den vergangenen 20 Jahren konstant geblieben .
Die ersten sexuellen Erfahrungen machten Jugendliche meist zu Hause mit einem Partner , den die Eltern kennen .
Zudem gebe es keine Hinweise , dass junge Menschen die Partner häufiger wechselten .

" Men ... sheesh ...
Many moons ago someone a lot smarter than me said something along the lines of , " " .
Taking that statement literally and pondering a bit , I came to a few quick caveats .
Powder skiing ?
Bacon ?
While I 'd like to write that I immediately rattled off countless other exceptions to that " rule " , the reality is that once I had pork on the brain , salivation and obsession quickly followed .
Can a guy actually have too much bacon ?
Unpossible .
Or so I theorized .
Which quickly morphed into a need to test the theory .
And it did n't take long to find the means to do so .
I did n't come up with any other exceptions on the ride to the market , but I * did* get there PDQ . ) .
You 've been given ample warning .
Back at the ranch , I rolled up my sleeves and got to work .
Take 12 strips and weave 'em .
Baste liberally .
How much ?
' Bout that much .
Unwad 2 ( yep , two ) pounds of sausage and cover your weave .
Meanwhile , sizzle uppound in the background .
Once that pound is done to taste , chop it up and cover the sausage , then roll the whole slithery beautious mess up .
Delicately place this priceless gem onto the grill .
Ovens can be used in a pinch , and a smoker is purported to be the best way .
Run what ya brung .
Common practice with this critter is a BBQ theme .
I 'm not much of a BBQ fan .
Never have been .
Friends afflicted with a BBQ problem have suggested that I just have n't had BBQ yet .
Following that rationale , I have n't hadsaddle sores yet either , but I 've had enough of both to have formed an opinion .
Anyhoo , I punted the BBQ theme and used maple syrup to baste the outside of the weave .
That 4 " thick slab o' lean , juicy flesh takes awhile to cook through .
Get some other stuff done while you wait .
Check in on occasion , noting the sumptuous sizzling .
After three hours at 225* , I could n't wait anymore .
Ahem .
I mean after three hours IT WAS DONE !
When I started the project Herself showed little interest , tossing her hair and sauntering away muttering something like " .
Curiously , she reappeared at the Ultimate Moment .
Herself , not being afflicted with the chronic quite the way I am , savored a few quick forkfuls , emitted some perfunctory yummy noises , then walked away .
Just like that -- she walked away .
Impressive .
I stuck with it .
The superdeliciousness of it is , of course , completely indescribable .
After about 3 / 4 of a pound I felt * zero * need nor desire to stop eating .
If anything I wanted to eat more , faster .
In fact , I 'm 100 % sure that I could , without hesitation , guilt , or even a second thought , easily polish off the whole thing .
Completely confirming my original theory .

KIGALI ( Reuters ) - The United Nations genocide court in Tanzania is reneging on its promise to transfer Rwandan convicts to serve the remainder of their sentences in their homeland , Rwanda ’s justice minister said .
Rwandan genocide survivor Pacific Rutaganda , 48 , is seen in this February 2004 file picture looking out of the door of a church full with human skulls and bones in the town of Ntarama where he survived an ethnic massacre that killed several hundred people during the central African country 's 1994 genocide .
REUTERS / Finbarr O'Reilly
Tharcisse Karugarama said he did not understand why the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTR ) had not returned convicts when Rwanda ’s jails were deemed sufficient for those convicted by Sierra Leone ’s war crimes court .
“ We signed an agreement with ICTR to transfer the convicts to serve out their sentence here .
So far they have not done it .
We do n’t know why , ” he told Reuters on Monday .
About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by Hutu militias within 100 days during the 1994 genocide .
Since its establishment in 1994 the ICTR in Arusha , Tanzania , has convicted 38 people for their role in the genocide and acquitted six .
Rwanda , Italy , Benin , Swaziland , France , Sweden and Mali have signed an agreement to host convicts .
Last week , the U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone ( SCSL ) moved eight people convicted of crimes during a decade - long civil war to the “ U.N. block ” in Rwanda ’s Mpanga prison .
It was the first time international convicts had been imprisoned in Rwanda .
ICTR spokesman Roland Amoussouga said the decision on where to house convicts lay with the court and so far no decision had been made with regard to the designation of Rwanda .
He said in the case of the Sierra Leone convicts , it was the ICTR registrar who advised that court to explore with Rwandan authorities the possibility of an agreement for the prisoners .
Originally , the Sierra Leone court wanted its prisoners to serve their sentences in the French - speaking west Africa countries of Benin or Mali , but could not do so due to language barriers , Amoussouga said .
Karugarama said justice would be better served if the ICTR convicts were sent from Arusha to Rwanda , and that they would enjoy better access for their relatives .
“ ICTR are on record as saying the facilities are much better than those in Arusha .
So it will be a contradiction and a mystery if they do n’t send the prisoners here , ” Karugarama said .
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita wants you to buy his book .
He wants royalties and he wants fame .
He wants the book to promote his consulting business .
The text may well be full of self - promotional tall tales and calumny — unless the author calculated that the costs of dishonesty ( potential intellectual disrepute ) outweighed the benefits ( more fame , royalties and consulting ) .
When he walks into bookstores , he probably moves his book from the back shelves to the front .
If he knew I was writing this review , he ’d think about crafty ways to manipulate me .
Or , at the least , he wants you to believe all this .
Bueno de Mesquita is the author of a fascinating new book called “ The Predictioneer ’s Game , ” describing his efforts to use game theory to model human behavior , divine the future and improve incentive systems .
It ’s a rollicking book — a somewhat more technical and thesis - driven cousin to Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner ’s “ Freakonomics . ”
And it ’s based on the premise that people are selfish .
They do what ’s best for them .
“ Game theory , ” Bueno de Mesquita writes , “ urges us to take a cold , hard look at what it means to be a calculating , rational decision maker . ”
And he lives up to his word .
Mother Teresa did nice things , sure .
But she was awfully public about those good deeds , and she appears to have been seeking fame and reward , either in this life or the next .
“ Could it be that Mother Teresa ’s ambition for herself was tied to her faith in an eternal reward ? ” Bueno de Mesquita writes .
“ It makes sense to pay the price of sacrifice for the short , finite time of a life span if the consequence is a reward that goes on for infinity in heaven .
In fact , is n’t that exactly the explanation many of us give for the actions of suicide bombers , dying in their own prideful eyes as martyrs who will be rewarded for all eternity in heaven ? ”
Yes , you read that correctly .
On Page 15 of “ The Predictioneer ’s Game , ” Bueno de Mesquita equates Mother Teresa with the likes of Mohamed Atta .

However , the article goes on the caution that Lieberman is unpredictable ( which is a euphemistic way of saying he has a knack for lying ) :
“ Lieberman keeps assuring Reid that he ’s OK , ” said one source .
“ But he ’s one of those characters — you never know with Joe .
And we still have this :
“ Sen . Lieberman has made it clear that he will vote for the motion to proceed to the healthcare bill but will oppose cloture on a final bill if it contains a public option because he believes that it would worsen our national debt problem , ” said Lieberman aide Marshall Wittmann .
So it 's far from a done deal , but definitely a step in the right direction .
Update :
There is some confusion in the comments over what has actually changed .
Previously , Lieberman has claimed he will allow debate of the bill , but prevent a final vote .
He is still saying this publicly ( see quote above ) but the article 's claim is that he is privately assuring Reid he will allow a final vote .
The article could be false , and as BennyToothpick pointed out in the comments , what you think of this news depends on how much you trust TheHill 's unnamed sources .
However , if true it probably means that the bill can get out of the Senate with the opt - out Public Option .

British scientists testing Ukrainian ' super flu ' that has killed 189 people
British scientists are examining the strain of swine flu behind a deadly Ukrainian outbreak to see if the virus has mutated .
A total of 189 people have died and more than one million have been infected in the country .
Some doctors have likened the symptoms to those seen in many of the victims of the Spanish flu which caused millions of deaths world - wide after the World War One .
An unnamed doctor in western Ukraine told of the alarming effects of the virus .
He said : ' We have carried out post mortems on two victims and found their lungs are as black as charcoal .
Ukraine 's Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko ( L ) visits flu victims at a hospital in the western Ukrainian city of Lutsk
' They look like they have been burned .
It 's terrifying . '
Neighbouring Poland has called on the EU to take action , fearing the mystery virus may spread westwards .
Prime Minister Donald Tusk has written to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and the Swedish Prime Minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt , who holds the EU presidency .
The letter said : ' The character of this threat demands that rapid action be undertaken at the European Union level . '
Russia , Slovakia , Poland , Hungary and Romania have already launched health checks on Ukrainians entering their territory .
Slovakia has closed two of five border crossings .

Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has called in the World Health Organisation .
A team of specialists are carrying out tests in Kiev and Lviv in an effort to identify the virus .
President Yushchenko said : ' People are dying .
The epidemic is killing doctors .
This is absolutely inconceivable in the 21st Century . '
In a TV interview , the President added : ' Unlike similar epidemics in other countries , three causes of serious viral infections came together simultaneously in Ukraine : two seasonal flus and the Californian flu .
' Virologists conclude that this combination of infections may produce an even more aggressive new virus as a result of mutation . '
Four men and one woman have died from the flu in Lviv , said emergency hospital chief doctor Myron Borysevych .
Two of the dead patients were in the 22-35 age group , with two others over 60 .
He diagnosed the disease as viral pneumonia .
' We have sent the analyses to Kiev .
We do n't believe it 's H1N1 swine flu .
Neither do we know what kind of pneumonia it is .'
Universities , schools and nurseries have been closed , public meetings have been banned and theatres shut .
The virus from the Ukraine is being tested at the Medical Research council labs in Mill Hill North London .
A spokesman said : ' We do not have a time scale for the results of the tests , although some preliminary results have been obtained .
I can not tell you what they are .
' We did not have enough of the virus samples so we will have to grow some more before we can come to a conclusive decision about its nature . '
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The resignation of Obama administration figure Van Jones , following controversies over a petition he had signed and his comments about Republicans , did not come at the request of the president , the White House senior adviser said Sunday .
Van Jones attends the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas , Nevada , in August .
" Absolutely not -- this was Van Jones ' own decision , " David Axelrod told NBC 's " Meet the Press " when asked if the president had ordered the resignation .
The chairman of the House Republican Conference , Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , had called for Jones to resign or be fired .
" I think Van Jones did the right thing , " Pence said Sunday about the resignation .
" His extremist views and coarse rhetoric have no place in this administration . "
Jones has frequently been dubbed a " green - jobs czar " for the administration .
" The president should suspend any future appointment of so called czars while the administration and the Congress carefully examines the background and qualifications of the more than 30 individuals who 've been appointed to these czar positions , " said Pence , speaking to reporters .
" And the Congress ought to initiate a thorough inquiry into the constitutionality of this practice which has spanned Republican and Democrat administrations . "
In a statement Saturday night , the White House said Jones was giving up his post at the Council on Environmental Quality , where he helped coordinate government agencies focused on delivering millions of green jobs to the ailing U.S. economy .
" On the eve of historic fights for health care and clean energy , opponents of reform have mounted a vicious smear campaign against me , " Jones said in the statement .
" They are using lies and distortions to distract and divide . "
Adding that he came to Washington to " fight for others , not for myself , " Jones said in the statement , " I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past .
We need all hands on deck , fighting for the future . "
The decision followed an uproar over a petition Jones signed in 2004 calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to occur .
In a statement last week , Jones said of the petition on the Web site 911truth.org : " I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever . "
An administration source said last week that Jones had not carefully reviewed the language in the petition before signing .
Jones has also come under fire for comments he made , also before his White House job , including those in a video that can be seen on YouTube .
In it , he uses a vulgar expression to describe Republicans .
Watch what Jones called Republicans »
In 2005 , Jones was quoted in the East Bay Express as describing the impact that the acquittals in the police beating case of Rodney King in 1992 had on him .
" By August , I was a Communist , " he says in the article , describing his sense of radicalization at the time .
In his statement last week , Jones said , " If I have offended anyone with statements I made in the past , I apologize . "
One of the most prominent conservative voices condemning Jones in recent days has been FOX TV host Glenn Beck .
Jones is a co-founder of colorofchange.org , a group that recently has been pressing advertisers to boycott Beck 's program after Beck called Obama a racist .
Colorofchange.org lists Jones as " inactive . "
He has not been involved with the group 's recent efforts .
Though the controversies have taken center stage , Jones was previously known primarily for his environmental work .
In May , he won the praise of former eBay CEO Meg Whitman , a Republican candidate for governor in California .
" I am a big fan .
He 's done a marvelous job , " she says in a video on the San Francisco Chronicle 's Web site .
Whitman now says she did not know Jones well and that he holds views she rejects .
Axelrod said Jones " is internationally known as an advocate for green jobs and that 's the basis on which he was hired . "
He stepped down so that his previous comments would not distract from critical issues the administration is dealing with , and " I commend him for making that decision , " Axelrod added .
Asked whether Jones was the victim of a smear campaign , Axelrod did not say either way , but did say " the political environment is rough , and so , you know , these things get magnified . "
On ABC's " This Week , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama does not endorse the controversial actions by Van Jones from before he joined the administration , but added that Obama thanks Jones " for his service to the country . "
Last week , when asked whether Obama still had confidence in Jones , Gibbs would only say that Jones continued to work for the administration .
The response was considered a signal that Jones might have to step down .
A prominent Democratic strategist argued Sunday that Jones ' departure is a sign of Republican efforts against Obama .
" This administration has the potential to be FDR or Jimmy Carter and I think the Republicans are going to do everything they can to make him Jimmy Carter , to create a failed presidency , " Joe Trippi said on CNN 's " State of the Union . "
Republican strategist Ed Rollins disagreed .
" Presidents do n't come down by what the opposition party [ does ] -- and that 's what we are , " he said .
CNN 's Mary Snow contributed to this report .

Astronomers , conducting the broadest survey to date of galaxies from about 800 million years after the Big Bang , have found 22 early galaxies and confirmed the age of one by its characteristic hydrogen signature at 787 million years post Big Bang .
The finding is the first age - confirmation of a so - called dropout galaxy at that distant time and pinpoints when an era called the reionization epoch likely began .
The research will be published in a December issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
With recent technological advancements , such as the Wide - Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope , there has been an explosion of research of the reionization period , the farthest back in time that astronomers can observe .
The Big Bang , 13.7 billion years ago , created a hot , murky universe .
Some 400,000 years later , temperatures cooled , electrons and protons joined to form neutral hydrogen , and the murk cleared .
Some time before 1 billion years after the Big Bang , neutral hydrogen began to form stars in the first galaxies , which radiated energy and changed the hydrogen back to being ionized .
Although not the thick plasma soup of the earlier period just after the Big Bang , this star formation started the reionization epoch .
Astronomers know that this era ended about 1 billion years after the Big Bang , but when it began has eluded them and intrigued researchers like lead author Masami Ouchi of the Carnegie Observatories .
The U.S. and Japanese team led by Ouchi used a technique for finding these extremely distant galaxies .
" We look for ' dropout ' galaxies , " explained Ouchi .
" We use progressively redder filters that reveal increasing wavelengths of light and watch which galaxies disappear from or ' dropout ' of images made using those filters .
Older , more distant galaxies ' dropout ' of progressively redder filters and the specific wavelengths can tell us the galaxies ' distance and age .
What makes this study different is that we surveyed an area that is over 100 times larger than previous ones and , as a result , had a larger sample of early galaxies ( 22 ) than past surveys .
Plus , we were able to confirm one galaxy 's age , " he continued .
" Since all the galaxies were found using the same dropout technique , they are likely to be the same age . "
Ouchi's team was able to conduct such a large survey because they used a custom - made , super - red filter and other unique technological advancements in red sensitivity on the wide - field camera of the 8.3 - meter Subaru Telescope .
They made their observations from 2006 to 2009 in the Subaru Deep Field and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North field .
They then compared their observations with data gathered in other studies .
Astronomers have wondered whether the universe underwent reionization instantaneously or gradually over time , but more importantly , they have tried to isolate when the universe began reionization .
Galaxy density and brightness measurements are key to calculating star - formation rates , which tell a lot about what happened when .
The astronomers looked at star - formation rates and the rate at which hydrogen was ionized .
Using data from their study and others , they determined that the star - formation rates were dramatically lower from 800 millions years to about one billion years after the Big Bang , then thereafter .
Accordingly , they calculated that the rate of ionization would be very slow during this early time , because of this low star - formation rate .
" We were really surprised that the rate of ionization seems so low , which would constitute a contradiction with the claim of NASA 's WMAP satellite .
It concluded that reionization started no later than 600 million years after the Big Bang , " remarked Ouchi .
" We think this riddle might be explained by more efficient ionizing photon production rates in early galaxies .
The formation of massive stars may have been much more vigorous then than in today 's galaxies .
Fewer , massive stars produce more ionizing photons than many smaller stars , " he explained .
The work was funded by the Carnegie Institution .
The research is based on data collected at Subaru Telescope , which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan ; the Hubble Space Telescope , operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy ( AURA ) , Inc. , under NASA contract NAS5 - 26555 ; the Spitzer Telescope , managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA .
With the news that an American woman has received a pacemaker with a wireless connection to the Internet , the so - called “ Internet of Things ” has taken on a new dimension .
Reuters reported this week that a 61 - year - old woman became the first American recipient of the pacemaker , which was approved by the FDA just last month and allows the doctor to monitor how her heart is doing .
At least once a day , a server will communicate with the pacemaker over the Internet and get an update .
If there is anything unusual , the server can contact the doctor and patient , literally calling the doc on the phone in the middle of the night , if necessary .
The Reuters article quotes the doctor as saying that in the future , wireless devices could monitor high blood pressure , glucose levels or heart failure .
The technology is part of a much broader trend of reaching out to objects in the physical world to bring them into the Internet , so to speak , to build an “ Internet of Things . ”
RFID , short - range wireless technologies and sensor networks are enabling this to happen as they become more commonly used .
IP v6 , with its greatly expanded address space , allows for many more devices to connect to the Internet .
If all things are connected , all things can be tracked .
The earliest applications have centered around tracking shipments in a supply chain , but if the tracking devices are left in objects when they are in use , that could be extremely powerful .
It ’s a little scary to think of connecting one ’s heart to the Internet .
I know the connection is being used in a very narrow way , but if it were at all possible for hackers to tamper with the pacemaker , they probably would , given what we know about what some are capable of .
Court documents show that federal regulators were told about billions of dollars in bonuses awarded to Merrill Lynch executives during the company ’s takeover by Bank of America - contradicting statements to Congress by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr .
The Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , in a brief filed in ongoing litigation with Bank of America Corp. , said the bank informed the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve of the Merrill Lynch bonuses as early as Dec. 17 - weeks before the government approved a $ 20 billion bailout to help the takeover .
The document disputes oral and written testimony to Congress from Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson , who both said they knew nothing about the $ 3.6 billion in bonuses before the bailout was approved in January .
Mr. Paulson , while under oath during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing July 16 , was asked directly by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings , Maryland Democrat , whether he was “ aware of the Merrill Lynch 3 - plus billion dollars ’ worth of bonuses they were about to give out when this deal came down . ”
His response : “ No , I was n’t . ”
Mr. Bernanke , in a letter to the committee earlier this year , also suggested that the Federal Reserve did n’t know about the bonuses before the bailout .
“ Beginning on December 17 , 2008 , we participated in several discussions with management of Bank of America about its plans to acquire Merrill Lynch , ” Mr. Bernanke wrote .
“ The discussion did not encompass compensation levels or bonuses of Merrill Lynch employees . ”
The committee ’s top Republican , Rep. Darrell Issa of California , is demanding an explanation from Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson .
“ It is now apparent that you knew , or at least should have known , about the bonus payments to Merrill Lynch employees no later than December 18 , 2008 , ” Mr. Issa said in letters sent last week to Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke .
“ We now know that [ Bank of America ] certainly was n’t hiding the information from the federal government .
If you felt that the bonuses were unfair or problematic , you could have at the very least raised additional questions or formally objected before [ the government ] gave the company an additional $ 20 billion of taxpayer money . ”
Mr. Issa , however , stopped short of accusing Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke of lying .
“ We still do not know the full truth , ” he said .
“ The American people have the right to know when you became aware of the bonus payments to Merrill Lynch employees and whether you approved or objected to these payments . ”
The lawmaker has asked Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke to clarify their statements by Oct. 21 .
Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said he “ ca n’t comment on any decisions Paulson made ” because the former secretary no longer is with the agency .
A Federal Reserve spokesman said the agency has received Mr. Issa ’s letter and “ will be responding , ” but declined further comment .
The Merrill Lynch bonuses have been a significant part of several congressional inquiries into whether Federal Reserve and Treasury officials put undue pressure on Bank of America to complete its planned purchase of Merrill Lynch .
The bank , which had concerns about Merrill Lynch ’s mounting loses , eventually closed the deal in January .
Shortly after the purchase , the federal government awarded Bank of America $ 20 billion in bailout money to help counter losses racked up by Merrill Lynch .
Bank of America already had received federal assistance , getting a separate $ 25 billion in October .
Capitol Hill lawmakers , as well as the SEC , also are looking into accusations the bank improperly concealed billions of dollars in losses and billions in bonuses paid by Merrill Lynch before a shareholder vote on their proposed merger .
A judge last month rejected a $ 33 million settlement between the SEC and Bank of America , saying the SEC ’s accusations of inadequate disclosure by the bank over bonuses paid at Merrill Lynch must go to trial .
The notion that banks would continue to hand out bonuses to executives after receiving government bailout money has struck a raw nerve with the public and Congress .
The fervor boiled over in March when news broke that American International Group Inc. doled out at least $ 165 million in executive bonus pay after being awarded $ 170 billion in taxpayer loans and incentives .
The House this summer passed a bill that would give federal regulators the authority to cap pay incentives if they think the provisions would encourage bankers and other financial executives to take risks that could threaten the economy or the viability of their companies .
The measure includes an administration - backed “ say - on - pay ” provision that would give company shareholders annual , nonbinding votes on top executives ’ compensation , including lucrative arrangements such as “ golden parachutes . ”
The Senate has yet to take up the measure .

Non so se vi è chiaro quello che hanno concordato oggi Fini e Berlusconi : in caso di processo in primo grado , per reati con pene inferiore a dieci anni , scatta l'estinzione se il processo non si chiude entro due anni per ogni grado di giudizio .
L'estinzione arriva ancora prima se l'imputato è incensurato e il reato contestato è avvenuto prima del 2 maggio 2006 .
Ovviamente è per puro caso che sia il processo
Mills sia il processo per i diritti di Mediaset sono in primo grado , con un imputato incensurato , con un reato che prevede una pena inferiore ai dieci anni e si riferiscono entrambi a fatti avvenuti prima del 2 maggio 2006
Così come sarà per puro caso che l'imputato presenterà una serie di legittimi impedimenti ( con il processo Mediaset ha già iniziato a farlo ) per ottenere un rinvio delle udienze dopo l'altro , e oplà , il gioco sarà fatto .
Adesso di sicuro avete capito bene : è un nuovo lodo Alfano mascherato , un'ennesima legge ad personam , una fuga di Berlusconi dai suoi processi .
Se vi viene il sangue caldo ripetete « ohmmmmm » molte volte insieme a me .
" The highest products of human achievement , such as language , law , civilization , religion , and ethical development , are the results of social growth , and not of individual attainment . "
This affirms my belief that wealth is not what you have and what you can get , rather it is what you can live without .
Real freedom lies not in desiring things and experiences , and having the riches to get them .
Rather , it is in not desiring them in the first place .
Real wealth is what each of us carries inside .
It is obscured by desiring things in the material world that only provide temporary , hollow relief to our ongoing inner struggle .
Contentment brings peace and a calm , unhurried state ; a secure feeling of having enough .
Since consumerism is based on cultivating unending need and desire , contentment provides a vaccination against it .
Those who experience contentment , balance , and inner peace have true wealth .
Our money , stuff , and pace of life are preventing us from realizing this wealth .
But we can sacrifice our negative habits and addictions to the forces of evolution that are constantly urging us to grow beyond our current incarnation .
We can give up the distractions in our lives .
We do n't need them .
There is poverty in desire and riches .
We are waking up to the wealth of contentment and enough , and we are evolving together .
W. H. Channing said , Real wealth accumulation , like evolution , is a cooperative activity ; we are all on the same team .
Building a subway through the Westside has been the Holy Grail of transportation planners for decades , and many feel they are closer to tunneling than ever before .
Backers envision subway cars packed with shoppers balancing Prada and Barneys bags after Beverly Hills shopping excursions and surfers with their boards tucked under their arms heading for the morning waves , as well as workers .
But now , as Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pushed to fast - track the long - delayed Westside subway extension , there is debate about whether the route for the roughly $ 5 - billion project gets the most bang for the buck .
It ’s a familiar problem in Los Angeles , a city developed for the automobile whose sprawl makes it difficult for rail lines to cover enough ground to make commuting simple .
Advertisement
The first leg of the Westside extension would spur west from the existing Purple Line along Wilshire Boulevard from Western Avenue to Fairfax Avenue .
Wilshire is L.A. 's legendary roadway , lined with office towers , shops and restaurants .
The route would go through the Miracle Mile shopping district and stop at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , which has lobbied heavily for the line .
From there , future phases would take the Purple Line through Beverly Hills , Century City and Westwood .
That route , however , bypasses some key Westside shopping and business areas in Hollywood and West Hollywood , including Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , the Beverly Center and the Pacific Design Center .
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering an extension route that would cover those areas , but it probably would not be built until after the Wilshire link is done .
Advertisement
The mayor wants the entire Purple Line extension to Westwood completed in the next 10 years , a tall order for a project that has been discussed for nearly four decades and still needs funding .
Current plans have the subway reaching Westwood by 2036 , using a mix of revenue from an L.A.
County transportation sales tax and federal funding that the MTA is seeking but has not yet received .
“ We really determined that Wilshire would have to come first .
You ’re trying to hook up the Purple Line with Beverly Hills , Century City and Westwood , where the big ridership would be , ” said David Mieger , MTA ’s project manager for the subway .
“ The heaviest - used bus lines , the heaviest - congestion corridors , are north and south of Wilshire Boulevard . ”

The MTA unveiled the West Hollywood extension to great enthusiasm from community groups .
The leg would run as an extension from the Red Line in Hollywood through parts of Hollywood and West Hollywood and would connect with the proposed extension of the Purple Line near the intersection of Wilshire and La Cienega boulevards .
The Purple Line would then go west along Wilshire to Westwood .
The Purple Line extension to Westwood would generate an estimated 49,000 daily boardings at the new stations and a total of 76,000 new daily boardings throughout the system , according to early studies from the MTA that are being updated .
Ridership would increase by 17,900 at new stations if the West Hollywood link is built , according to MTA numbers .
That compares to an average of 78,955 weekday riders on the Long Beach - to - downtown L.A. Blue Line , 149,597 on the downtown - to - North Hollywood Red Line , 38,619 on the Norwalk - to - Redondo Beach Green Line and 22,476 on the downtown - to - Pasadena Gold Line , according to the most current ridership counts from the MTA .
The dilemma is a familiar one for transportation planners , who have struggled to build light - rail routes to capture the most riders possible .

This is difficult because Los Angeles is so spread out and designed for the car , not rail lines .
L.A. has far fewer rail lines than New York , Chicago and other large cities , so passengers often must transfer to buses to complete their trips .
Con Howe , the former director of planning for the city of Los Angeles and now managing director of the CityView Los Angeles Fund , pointed to one example : the MTA ’s decision not to build the Green Line into Los Angeles International Airport , meaning that people who want to take public transportation to the airport have to take a shuttle to the passenger terminal .
“ Unlike New York City , you ’re never going to have 100 years of subway construction in the city , ” he said .

Anastasia Loukaitou - Sideris , chairwoman of UCLA ’s Department of Urban Planning , said the West Hollywood alignment is important because the idea of transit is to go to “ where you have major concentrations of jobs and people . ”
“ There is a trade - off : It would cost considerably more money .
It ’s all about how much money is available , ” she said .
Loukaitou - Sideris said that Angelenos are not tapped into a pedestrian culture and that most people are reluctant to walk more than a quarter - mile to a destination .
If that holds true , many who would take the Wilshire subway would need transit to places such as Cedars - Sinai , the Beverly Center and the Westside Pavilion .

Some commuters said they were excited about the Wilshire extension but added that a route through West Hollywood made more sense to them .
Last week , Sharon Richards stepped off the subway at the end of the line and made her way to the Metro Rapid bus that runs along Wilshire Boulevard -- the fourth part of her roughly two - hour commute to work in West Hollywood .
“ Oooooh , it ’s gonna be packed , ” she said as the 720 Rapid approached .
“ Feel like a sardine . ”
Richards , 61 , has been commuting from Upland to her job as a manager at Cedars - Sinai for more than two decades .

She wakes before dawn , drives to a park - and - ride and catches a bus in Montclair just after 5 a.m. , arrives at Union Station where she takes the Purple Line to its last stop , takes the Wilshire bus to La Cienega Boulevard and then hoofs for it the last stretch , a little more than half a mile , to her desk .
“ I ’m late , ” Richards muttered as she rushed off the 720 .
She said a direct stop near the Beverly Center and Cedars - Sinai would help her and other employees commute .
Jeanne Flores , senior vice president in charge of human resources at Cedars - Sinai , said that fewer than 10 % of the 11,000 employees at the medical center use public transportation to get to work .
Advertisement
“ The public transportation systems just are not adequate to support our location and the hours that people work , ” Flores said .
“ People resign because they just ca n’t do the commute anymore . ”
Supporters of the Wilshire corridor say it is the simplest and most logical route to take and would be heavily used .
They do n’t deny that a route through West Hollywood would be beneficial , but they note the huge population , cultural and employment centers along the Wilshire route and say that places like Cedars - Sinai and the Beverly Center will be close to future stops along that alignment .
“ There ’s absolutely no question that it should go straight out Wilshire , ” said Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge , whose district is included in the first phase of the subway .
“ At the same time , the concept of coming off the Hollywood line is absolutely necessary as well , because that is the de facto Beverly Hills freeway . ”
Advertisement
LaBonge is referring to the ill - fated freeway that the California Department of Transportation wanted to build along Santa Monica Boulevard from north of downtown to West Los Angeles .
Residents strongly opposed the freeway , and the plan was eventually killed .
But that decision is considered one factor in the Westside ’s notoriously congested traffic .
The Beverly Hills freeway could have run through West Hollywood , where the Mayor Pro Tem , John Heilman , now strongly supports a subway .
Heilman said the West Hollywood route make sense because it would provide a rail alternative for north - south commuters who live in the Valley but work on the Westside .
Advertisement
“ No one disputes that Wilshire needs to be served , but a lot of the traffic that is going westbound is coming over from the Valley ” and through West Hollywood , he said .
The MTA ’s directors will make a final decision on the Westside subway alignment next year .
Officials said it ’s possible that the West Hollywood route could be built after the Purple Line gets to Westwood -- if it ever gets that far .
But then , it would probably compete for money with a plan to build the Purple Line extension through Santa Monica .

Thousands of militants have given up their weapons under an amnesty
Nigeria 's main militant group in the oil - producing Niger delta has described peace talks with President Umaru Yar 'Adua as promising .
A spokesman for the Mend group said the meeting signalled the beginning of " serious , meaningful dialogue " .
The government said it was " fruitful " .
Attacks by the militant group in the Delta region cost Nigeria around $ 1bn ( £ 598 m ) a month in lost revenue .
A ceasefire was declared three weeks ago to allow talks to go ahead .
President Yar 'Adua 's spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi said the discussions on Saturday were " frank and fruitful " .
Nobel - prize winning Nigerian writer and political activist , Wole Soyinka , also took part in the talks .
Thousands of militants have given up their weapons in an amnesty deal offered by Mr Yar 'Adua in June .
In return they have been promised education and jobs .
A three - month respite from the violence has brought back some oil and gas production , but sceptics fear the former fighters could resume violence if they do not quickly find work .
According to Reuters , security experts say some former militants have reverted to their old ways by tapping into oil pipelines and selling it on the international market .
There ’s more to intelligence than just IQ .
( Image : David C Ellis / Getty )
Editorial : A rational alternative to testing IQ
IS GEORGE W. BUSH stupid ?
It ’s a question that occupied a good many minds of all political persuasions during his turbulent eight - year presidency .
The strict answer is no .
Bush ’s IQ score is estimated to be above 120 , which suggests an intelligence in the top 10 per cent of the population .
But this , surely , does not tell the whole story .
Even those sympathetic to the former president have acknowledged that as a thinker and decision - maker he is not all there .
Even his loyal speechwriter David Frum called him glib , incurious and “ as a result ill - informed ” .
The political pundit and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough accused him of lacking intellectual depth , claiming that compared with other US presidents whose intellect had been questioned , Bush junior was “ in a league by himself ” .
Bush himself has described his thinking style as “ not very analytical ” .
How can someone with a high IQ have these kinds of intellectual deficiencies ?
Put another way , how can a “ smart ” person act foolishly ?
Keith Stanovich , professor of human development and applied psychology at the University of Toronto , Canada , has grappled with this apparent incongruity for 15 years .
He says it applies to more people than you might think .
To Stanovich , however , there is nothing incongruous about it .
IQ tests are very good at measuring certain mental faculties , he says , including logic , abstract reasoning , learning ability and working - memory capacity – how much information you can hold in mind .
But the tests fall down when it comes to measuring those abilities crucial to making good …
Physicist : Zero .
Populations tend to grow exponentially , which is why the growth rate is defined as R in P = AeRt , where A is the population at time t=0 , and P is the population at any other time t.
If the average growth rate is greater than zero , then the population will grow exponentially forever , which is sadly impossible .
Here ’s why :
If the population could grow forever , then eventually the total mass of Humans would be greater than the mass of the Earth , which makes no damn sense .
What were we eating ?
The population could grow forever if we found a way to colonize other star systems .
However , even with speed - of - light ships we could only colonize something like planets in time t , since we ca n’t travel faster than light ( this is the volume of a sphere that expands at the speed of light , C ) .
The population density in the colonized area of the universe would then look like , where “ ” means “ proportional to ” .
You ’ll notice that if R is greater than 0 , then as time increases the population density goes up forever , which makes no damn sense .
If you do n’t notice , then just graph it .
What this ultimately means is that the average , over all time , of the number of children that a person has is 2 or less .
No way around it .
We ’ve had a lot of visits from reddit.com with a little confusion over the line “ populations tend to grow exponentially ” ( my bad ) .
What I should have written is “ populations tend to grow exponentially under the assumption that they have not yet begun to saturate the available resources ” , but I figured that might be pushing the discussion .
The less that resources are available , the more the population will tend to level off .
Both the exponential growth and leveling off can be modeled using various scalings of the logistic function .
Try graphing : , and .
You ’ll find that they line up almost exactly until near , where resources begin to dwindle .
Did you ever wonder why English has such a strange spelling system ?
There are countless reasons for this , but borrowing another language ’s spelling rules is a major one .
Throughout history , it was been in fashion to borrow aspects of language and culture from other admired countries .
In Renaissance times , it because modish to borrow Latin spellings for otherwise perfectly normal words .
A good example of this is the word DEBT .
Debt used to be spelled dette , but the < b > was added to match the Latin word debitum .
Another example is the word DOUBT .
Doubt was a loan - word ( borrowed ) from French ( douter ) , but was given new spelling based on the Latin dubitare .
This convention is called Etymological Spelling .
It ’s a system of spelling that relies on a traditional spelling rules , and not on pronunciation or changes in pronunciation .
Some other words that were etymologically spelled are indict ( Latin indictare ) , receipt ( Latin recepta ) , subtle ( Latin subtilis ) , and victuals ( Latin victualia ; still pronounced vittles ) .
Sometimes when the spelling was changed , the pronunciation changed as well .
For example , throne used to be pronounced and spelled trone … but when Latin spelling was reintroduced , an < h > was added after the < t > and the pronunciation changed .
A word that was respelled this way ( < th > ) but retained its pronunciation was the word thyme .
Another word that this happened to is cognizance .
Cognizance used to be spelled and pronounced conysance … but again , the spelling changed to match the Latin word ( cognoscere = to recognize ) and subsequently the pronunciation changed .
Another example of this change in spelling and pronunciation is fault .
It is borrowed from French ( faute ) but then respelled with an < l > based on the Latin words falsus and fallere .
A similar thing happened with the English words assault and vault .
Even the word bankrupt fell victim to this practice .
Originally the < p > was silent , as in Italian banca rotta ( “ broken bank ” ) .
The word was respelled based on the Latin rupta , and the < p > became pronounced .
Baptism used to be bapteme ( from French ) , but an < s > was added to match the Latin baptismus .
We do n’t know why some words retained their old pronunciation and some did n’t .
It ’s just another mystery of language .
Are there any words that you think have nonsensical spelling ?
Maybe they ’re spelled that way because of this phenomenon .
Four decades after The Prisoner kissed off the ’60s with a cerebral hit of paranoia , AMC and ITV ’s reboot of the influential spy - fi series has finally arrived to upgrade the panopticon .
But does it have bleeding - edge lenses ?
The short answer is no .
Slipstreaming between Africa and New York and stripped almost entirely of humor and heart , the new Prisoner , which airs in six parts Sunday through Tuesday on AMC , is too heavy on domestic melodrama and too light on sci- fi possibility .
Rather than taking its contemporary obsessions about love in the time of technology to the outer limits , director Nick Hurran and producer Trevor Hopkins have played it safe .
What gets lost in the remake ’s dark dissection of human relationships complicated by ubiquitous surveillance and callous commodification is , simply put , ambition .
And whether it ’s too many love triangles , too much mood music or too obvious subplots — all complicated by the prodigious impact of its source material — the new iteration is too light on the spirited experimentation of its predecessor to stand out from the growing crowd of Prisoner disciples like Twin Peaks , The Matrix , Lost and more .
But if you ’re a fan of heavy drama sprinkled with slight sci-fi , Hurran and Hopkins ’ reboot fits in fine with the usual speculative TV suspects like Lost and Heroes .
Just do n’t come expecting a next - gen experience .
The 2009 model of The Prisoner is merely a compression of its parent narrative — the same episodes and conceits distilled into six slow - motion episodes — albeit flavored lightly with a dash of mad science and sinister post - 9/11 intrigue .
It still tastes like chicken .
( Spoiler alert : Plot points follow . )
Of course , everything you ’ve read so far has been written by a loyal disciple of the late , great Patrick McGoohan ‘s original The Prisoner .
McGoohan ’s ambitious , metafictional original series blew my mind , just as it did for everyone from The Beatles to comics brainiac Grant Morrison .
And so , given the four decades since The Prisoner ‘s controversial finale “ Fall Out ” aired , I figured that whoever decided to mess with the show ’s legacy would take some risks with the material .
But instead , like the desert mirage of twin New York towers the new Number Six follows to the Village , the iconography and sci-fi of the new Prisoner has already been thoroughly circulated in pop culture for years .
In fact , it ’s fair to say that the original took far more chances than its more humorless offspring .
And that ’s a shame .
That said , those unfamiliar with the former ’s multicolored cultural whimsy and two - toned political subversion will probably feel at home with Hurran and Hopkins ’ vision , filmed in desolate Namibia and seaside South Africa .
Sir Ian McKellen ‘s legendary subtlety suits the tormentor Number Two like a spiked glove .
As Number Six , the gifted Jim Caviezel brings a hefty dose of wide - eyed rebellion and tender confusion .
Both fit in fine with our new - millennial method acting , where television shows like Battlestar Galactica , Lost and others get lost in character studies that comfort viewers rather than fractal narratives that challenge them .
Praise for The Prisoner : The Prisoner with requisite sinister elegance in his role as Village mastermind Number Two .
There are but a few Grand Lions still standing , and any opportunity to see master thespians like Christopher Plummer , Albert Finney or Ian McKellen is an occasion worth relishing .
Foremost among this theater - trained generation is McKellen , who injectswith requisite sinister elegance in his role as Village mastermind Number Two .
Whether he ’s playing mind games with sibling shrinks , tottering down the hallway with a breakfast tray for his mysteriously ailing wife , gently taunting the hapless Number Six or extolling the merits of civilian contentment , McKellen transforms somewhat generic material into a master class in villainous eloquence .
The Prisoner also deserves credit for its epic - scale cinematography .
Shooting in sun-baked Namibia and South Africa , director of photography Florian Hoffmeister gets across the compound ’s splendid isolation with unusually evocative desert vistas and underscores McKellen ’s grandeur with handsome shots of the perpetually white - suited overseer at his palatial headquarters .
The town ’s eerie architecture far exceeds typical TV fare .
Production designer Michael Pickwoad has created a cookie - cutter collection of post - modern triangular houses that manages to appear simultaneously familiar and alien .
AMC ’s Prisoner may fall short of the original , but as a basic cable offering , the reboot surpasses anything else available on Sunday night ’s prime time lineup .
— Hugh Hart
Like those two shows ,
The Prisoner has plenty of plot points that seem like they were positioned in a haze of cute obfuscation .
Whereas the original series ’
Number
Two was eventually retired each episode like South Park ‘s Kenny , McKellen ’s version now has a drugged wife and sexually troubled son , who , fine actors both , take up too much screen time with too much Douglas Sirk melodrama .
Caviezel ’s Number Six is troubled by unnecessary baggage , including two love interests who also function as psychological guinea pigs .
It ’s a marked divergence from the late , great McGoohan ’s legendary character , which eschewed any kind of overly romantic attachment in favor of a dogged pursuit of Number One , who turned out to be more familiar than England expected .
Each of the new version ’s six episodes is thematically based on one from McGoohan ’s original .
Like its predecessor of the same name , the opener “ Arrival , ” which airs Sunday , is a relatively straightforward affair introducing Caviezel to The Village after he finds a near - dead old man wearing McGoohan ’s piped sport - coat in the desert .
Episode 2 , “ Harmony , ” riffs off The Prisoner ‘s Western tangent “ Living in Harmony ” to illuminate the battle lines of The Village ’s groupthink dystopia , while Episode 3 , “ Anvil , ” builds on the former “ Hammer Into Anvil ” to illustrate the violent tendencies hiding behind panoptic surveillance .
“ Anvil ” and Episode 4 ( “ Darling ” ) are where Hurran and Hopkins ’ remake begins to sag , mostly because of bizarre love triangles .
While the original episode “ Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling ” found Number Six ’s mind transferred to the body of another man — actor Nigel Stock , to be exact , who was covering for McGoohan while he was away shooting Ice Station Zebra — viewers of the reboot are treated to multiple love interests for Number Six conjured up by the show ’s futuristic mating tech called “ blink match . ”
It probably took about an eye - blink to decide that adding love interests would be a safe move for contemporary viewers , but “ Anvil ” and “ Darling ” are the least satisfying of the reboot ’s episodes .
Things heat up in Episode 5 , “ Schizoid , ” which — like its inspiration “ The Schizoid Man ” ( viewable above ) , one of the weirdest episodes television has ever produced — involves multiple versions of Number Six at war with reality .
To set itself apart , the new Prisoner expands the doubling to Number Two , giving McKellen the chance to stop being such a bastard .
But even though “ Fall Out ” — represented here by Episode 6 , “ Checkmate , ” also a nod to McGoohan ’s episode of the same name — decided to humanize Number Two in the end , the transformation is staunched in the reboot .
McKellen ’s Number
Two spends much of the entire series pontificating about the lack of absolute evil or innocence , so when his turn to transform finally arrives it finds that it has been there all the time .
And when it is Caviezel ’s turn to transform ?
Well , if you ’ve seen the original , you know what to expect .
If you have n’t , given the intensified ( I would say lazy ) moral ambiguity of current sci- fi television , you ’ve seen it all before .
Which , in the final analysis , is precisely the problem with the new version of The Prisoner .
Viewers have seen its tropes and traps already , whether in the superior original series or similarly minded dramatic exercises of TV and film .
There is nothing new under the reboot ’s African sun .
It is great to see McGoohan ’s influential material finally enter the pop-culture mash machine .
And Hurran is indeed a master of atmosphere , as much as Caviezel and McKellen are captivating thespians .
But The Prisoner forever changed television by creatively depersonalizing humanity in pursuit of its politicization .
The new version has achieved the opposite :
It has too casually depoliticized The Village , and human good and evil , in the pursuit of personalized television .
In the translation , what got lost is ambition in the service of possibility .
WIRED Good talent ; genetic engineering gone wrong ; mind - melting drugs ; Rover 2.0 .
TIRED
Slow , strained acting and writing ; next to no action ; little risk - taking ; too little sci- fi ; no McGoohan .

A Multnomah County jury Monday ordered the city of Portland to pay three men a total of $ 175,000 for a 2007 encounter with police at a downtown parking garage in which the men accused officers of battery , assault and false arrest .
The jurors found the testimony of two independent witnesses especially compelling .
The witnesses , a young college couple , saw the entire episode and corroborated the stories of the three men : Harold Hammick , Ri'Chard Booth and Alex Clay .
" Justice does work , " Clay said after the verdict .
" The system does work . "
A city attorney had argued last week during the trial that police were acting within the law when they stopped and detained the three man in the early morning after St. Patrick 's Day 2007 .
The confrontation ended successfully , Portland city attorney Bill Manlove said , because there were " no injuries , no gunshots , no deaths , no high - speed chases , no foot pursuit .
" Everyone went home safe , " Manlove said .
But the three young men claimed they were frightened and confused about why they had been stopped by officers who , they say , never offered an explanation .
Greg Kafoury , the attorney for the men , said that the city 's defense had invoked an ugly stereotype of young black men as belligerent , confrontational and profane .
All three men have clean records , with no history of violence .
Clay is a graduate of Portland State University and works with at - risk youth at Head Start .
Booth assembles mattresses , and Hammick is a computer technician .
Hammick , Booth and Clay had come downtown to celebrate St. Patrick 's Day in Portland 's entertainment district .
According to Kafoury , Hammick and Booth had returned to an SUV in the parking garage at Southwest Fourth Avenue and Alder Street when they encountered the police .
Clay showed up later after stopping at a pizza parlor .
The men sued the city for $ 300,000 for what they described as 40 minutes of terror in which they were held at gunpoint while officers searched their car and checked to see whether the handgun Hammick was carrying was stolen .
The city tried to portray Hammick as an angry man with a gun who may have been involved in an altercation on the street before the encounter with police .
Officer Leo Besner testified that there was a big crowd on the street that morning , shouting and getting ready to fight .
One group wore white T - shirts , and another group wore black T - shirts .
Besner said he saw Hammick on the street , running in a white T - shirt when the two groups were shouting at each other .
He later came across him in the parking garage in the SUV about 2:45 a.m .
Early in the encounter , Hammick told Besner he had a gun and handed over his concealed weapon permit , Besner testified .
After Hammick indicated the gun was in his waistband , Besner drew his weapon and took a half - step back .
Two other officers on the scene also pulled their weapons .
A short time later , Besner said , he cut Hammick 's seat belt because he did n't want Hammick to reach near the gun to unbuckle the safety harness .
Then , he told Hammick to get out of the car and took the handgun .
Hammick , Besner testified , was " definitely unhappy ...
From the get - go , he was argumentative . "
But Kafoury told a different story .
All three men , he said , were wrenched from the SUV and handcuffed .
Kafoury also said that Besner punched Hammick twice in the groin and questioned his manhood during the confrontation , accusations the officer denied .
" We know that the plaintiffs were not confrontational , " Kafoury told the jury during his closing .
" The word they used more often than any other was ' please . ' "
Hammick , he added , had tears streaming down his face .
The men also said that police told other people in the parking garage to move along , Kafoury said in closing arguments , " because they did not want witnesses . "
The two witnesses who scrunched down in their car seat so they could watch the confrontation said all three men pleaded with passers - by not to leave them alone with police .
Those witnesses were a key to the jury 's verdict , said forewoman Karen Nootenboom .
She also said jurors felt as if Hammick , Booth and Clay " were at the wrong place at the wrong time , " Nootenboom said , " and seemed to be targeted . "
Race was discussed only briefly during deliberations , she added , as jurors wondered whether white men would have been treated the same .
Besner has been at the center of controversy before .
In 2005 , while he was a sniper with the Special Emergency Reaction Team , Besner shot a suicidal man who was holding a weapon in the backyard of a duplex .
The man was on the phone with a police negotiator at the time .
The city paid the man 's family $ 500,000 .
Detective Mary Wheat , a Police Bureau spokeswoman , said after the verdict that " Officers were concerned about the public 's safety and their own safety and making sure nobody got hurt .
And no one did . "

AFP - Kuwaiti women will now be able to obtain their own passports and travel without the prior consent of their husbands following a ruling on Tuesday by the constitutional court .
The highest court in the Gulf state , whose rulings are final , abrogated an article in the 1962 passports law that prevented a woman from getting her own passport without her husband 's prior approval .
The court said in the ruling , a copy of which was obtained by AFP , that the article was in violation of a number of provisions in the constitution which guarantee personal freedom and gender equality .
The decision came after a Kuwaiti woman complained that her husband had refused to give her and their three children their passports and other personal identification documents so he could prevent them from leaving the country .
Female lawmaker Aseel al - Awadhi welcomed the ruling as a " victory for constitutional principles , " and " puts an end to this injustice against Kuwaiti women . "
She said in a statement that she plans with the help of other MPs to scrap all legislation that violates the constitution .

A Tuskegee woman is suing Milton McGregor 's VictoryLand electronic bingo operation , alleging fraud when employees there escorted Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford to specific machines last month when he won more than $ 50,000 .
Sandra Howard 's lawsuit in Macon County Circuit Court alleges that Langford won the money Aug. 28 .
That 's 11 days after a federal magistrate in Birmingham ruled that Langford was unable to pay his attorneys in a federal bribery case , ordering the government to cover his legal bills .
The lawsuit names Macon County Greyhound Park Inc. and its operating names of VictoryLand and Quincy 's 777 as defendants .
Langford is not listed as a defendant , though most of the allegations revolve around him .
The lawsuit claims VictoryLand rigged the machines for Langford " in hopes of receiving political favor and to promote approval of business dealings " for affiliates of the Macon County Greyhound Park .
The suit echoes claims in an unresolved 2007 suit filed by Cynthia Teel against VictoryLand .
In that case , an Oct. 23 , 2008 , affidavit from a VictoryLand employee says officials at the Shorter facility manipulated a machine to guarantee payouts to certain people , including Langford , from 2006 to 2008 .
At the time , Langford called the Teel action " the most ridiculous lawsuit I have ever seen . "
Birmingham lawyer Ted Mann represents both Howard and Teel . Efforts to reach Mann and attorneys for VictoryLand were unsuccessful Tuesday .
Michael Rasmussen , Langford 's attorney in the federal criminal case , had no comment Tuesday on the claims in Howard 's suit .
Efforts to reach Langford were unsuccessful .
Langford is set to go on trial Oct. 19 in federal court in Tuscaloosa to face charges that he accepted bribes during his term as Jefferson County Commission president .
Prosecutors claim Langford steered county financing business and $ 7.1 million in fees to Montgomery investment banker Bill Blount .
In return , prosecutors charge , Blount gave Langford $ 236,000 in cash , clothes and jewelry , sometimes using lobbyist and Langford friend Al LaPierre as a go - between .
2 guilty pleas
Langford has denied the charges .
Blount and LaPierre have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Langford .
On Aug. 17 , U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Greene determined that Langford cannot afford to pay an attorney and appointed Rasmussen to continue to represent him at the government 's expense .
Howard 's suit claims that Langford has visited VictoryLand several times before to play bingo and " on many , if not all , of these prior visits to Quincy 's 777 Casino has won substantial jackpots which are believed to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars " after officials " escorted Langford to certain electronic devices where Langford then won substantial jackpots . "
In the suit , Howard is described as a frequent customer of the Shorter gaming center .
The suit points out that Howard did not win a jackpot on the day Langford collected $ 50,000 in winnings .
" In arranging jackpots for Langford , ( the Macon County Greyhound Park ) eliminated the principal requisite of bingo -- that it be a game of chance producing winners .
A$ ?. A$ ?. holding bingo cards with pre-ordained numbers matched against randomly drawn or generated numbers , " the suit says .
Total winnings
Attorneys for Howard are seeking documents showing the amount of Langford 's winnings from 2006 to 2009 , as well as any money VictoryLand and other McGregor businesses gave to Langford 's campaigns over the past decade .
Howard 's attorneys also want copies of the video surveillance of VictoryLand 's electronic bingo area on Aug. 28 .
Howard 's suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages , as well as legal fees .
Langford has publicly proclaimed his friendship with McGregor .
Langford has advocated bringing the electronic bingo machines that resemble Vegas - style slot machines to the Birmingham Race Course , which McGregor owns .
Langford has said the fact that McGregor is a friend and a major contributor to his 2007 mayoral campaign -- giving $ 84,000 to PACs that contributed to Langford -- were not factors in his efforts on the part of the Birmingham Race Course .

The riots in July were the worst ethnic unrest in decades Dozens of ethnic Uighurs have disappeared since being detained in the wake of the riots in China 's Xinjiang region , a human rights group has said .
Human Rights
Watch said the 43 men and teenaged boys were taken in police sweeps of Uighur districts of Urumqi , and had since vanished without a trace .
The riots and protests in the city in early July left nearly 200 people dead .
China 's central government declined to answer questions about those detained by the authorities in Xinjiang .
It referred questions about the ethnic unrest to the regional government , which also did not respond to enquiries from the BBC .
' Not global leadership '
" The cases we documented are likely just the tip of the iceberg , " said Brad Adams , Asia director at Human Rights Watch .
The rights group is calling for the Chinese government to give details of everyone it is holding in detention .
In a report on the disappeared people , HRW said the police had searched two Uighur areas of Urumqi immediately after the riots .
At least 43 people were taken away and had not been heard of since .
" According to witnesses , the security forces sealed off entire neighbourhoods , searching for young Uighur men , " the group said .
The cases we documented are likely just the tip of the iceberg
Brad Adams
Human Rights
Watch HRW said most of those taken away were young Uighur men in their 20s .
The youngest are reported to have been 12 and 14 .
In many cases , families had been unable to find out what had happened to their relatives , said Human Rights Watch , whose report was based on interviews with local people .
" China should only use official places of detention so that everyone being held can contact family members and legal counsel , " said Mr Adams .
" Disappearing people is not the behaviour of countries aspiring to global leadership . "
Ethnic Uighurs , the original inhabitants of Xinjiang , went on the rampage after reports of Uighur deaths in southern China .
They mainly targeted Urumqi's Han Chinese community - a group that has moved into the western region more recently - killing scores of people .
Uighurs say their culture has been undermined since the arrival of millions of Han people from other parts of China .
Two months after the riots by Uighurs , Hans staged their own protests .
Afterwards , a confused pictured emerged about exactly how many people had been arrested , partly due to a reluctance by the authorities to provide detailed figures .
At one point the authorities said more than 1,500 people were in detention , but so far only a handful have been prosecuted .
The first trials began last week .
A total of nine people have been sentenced to death for their involvement in the riots .
Critics say the trials do not meet international standards .

One plant is brand new , the other just celebrated its 20th anniversary .
One ’s located in Florida while the other ’s in Minnesota .
The Lee County ( Fla . )
Waste - to - Energy Expansion Project is fueled by municipal solid waste , while Great River Energy ’s Elk River Station burns refuse - derived fuel ( RDF ) , but both waste - to - energy ( WTE ) plants do well what they were designed to do : efficiently dispose of garbage .
“ The thing about WTE is that it is primarily a method of waste disposal , ” said Don Castro , P.E. , HDR Engineering , and project manager on the Lee County project .
Its main purpose in life is to make provisions for safe and sustainable waste disposal practices .
“ The energy that comes along with it is secondary , ” he said .
WTE has relatively low CO 2 emissions –comparable to those of natural gas used for electricity generation–and offsets the fossil fuels that would be used to generate an equivalent amount of electricity .
Less municipal waste is sent to landfills so less methane is produced–a gas with a global warming potential 21 times that of CO 2 .
“ Elk River has converted almost 6 million tons of garbage into renewable electric generation over the last 20 years , ” said Tim Steinbeck , plant manager at the Minnesota facility .
“ We recycled an older facility through many years of change and coupled with the RDF processing plant , we keep 100 people in green jobs . ”
The New and the Old
When the Lee County WTE Facility Expansion Project went into commercial operation in November 2007 , it was among the first new municipal waste combustion ( MWC ) facilities built in the U. S. in more than 10 years .
The project , which is owned by the Lee County Solid Waste Division , was completed for less than its original budget of $ 123 million .
Two MWCs with a 39 MW turbine generator were already in operation at the site when the new unit was built .
The new unit has a stand - alone 19 MW turbine generator and can convert 636 tons of waste per day into renewable power –recovering approximately 600 kWh from each ton of municipal waste .
Lee County refuse trucks take the garbage collected curbside to the plant complex for combustion .
The facility uses reclaimed water for all process water needs , including boiler makeup water , and captures ferrous and non-ferrous metals from the post - combustion process for sale into the metals marketplace .
By contrast , Elk River Station has been through several iterations since it began commercial operations in 1950 , including a short stint as a nuclear power plant .
At first , Elk River burned coal and oil .
Construction of the nuclear reactor began in 1958 and it started producing electricity in 1963 .
By 1968 , the reactor was decommissioned and Elk River once again burned coal and oil .
In 1989 , Great River undertook a $ 33 million conversion project to create the RDF plant .
Now , Elk River Station ’s three generators produce 35 to 42 MW , using approximately 300,000 tons of RDF annually .
Waste is collected from five Minnesota counties and shipped to the RDF processing facility , where recyclable and non-combustible materials are removed .
What ’s left is shredded .
Out of 1,500 tons of municipal waste sent to the processing facility each day , about 1,250 tons of fuel stock is produced .
Great River Energy says the plant reduces the amount of waste entering the state ’s landfills by more than 400,000 tons a year .
Great River Energy is the second largest electric utility in Minnesota in terms of generating capacity and the fifth largest generation and transmission ( G&T ) cooperative in the U.S. in terms of assets .
Plenty of Fuel
Since the economic downturn there has been a slight decrease in the amount of RDF from the processing facility , said Elk River ’s Steinbeck .
Elk River Station burned 281,727 tons of RDF in 2008 .
Seasonal blips also occur in the fuel pipeline at which times the plant cannot operate at full capacity , but Steinbeck said that is usually a small percentage of its total annual hours .
Elk River is in the process of negotiating long - term contracts with local counties and is also investigating burning some tire - derived fuel , for which the plant is already permitted .
In Florida , meanwhile , the amount of garbage Lee County ’s residents were producing exceeded the combustion capacity of the existing MWCs as recently as nine years ago .
“ Although they had 1,200 tons per day of combustion capacity , they were hauling garbage to their landfill , which was filling up , ” said HDR Engineering ’s Castro .
“ Since we ’ve completed the project , virtually the only thing going to the landfill is ash . ”
O&M Challenges
RDF at 5,500
Btu per pound is similar to low - grade coal or the lignite that Great River burns in some of its other large generating facilities , but there are challenging differences .
“ RDF is a very difficult fuel to handle and meter , ” said Steinbeck .
“ It ’s been a long evolution over our 20 - year history to modify our fuel handling system to improve our operations . ”
A bin modification project is currently underway to improve the material handling system to get the fuel to meter into the boilers better .
“ The better we can meter , the better we can control emissions and adjust our air , ” said Steinbeck .
A second big difference between burning coal and RDF is the problems RDF causes in the boiler .
When everything in the garbage is combusted , plant operators have to deal with corrosion , said Castro .
In particular , chlorides — which come from the chlorine in the waste stream — form an acidic gas compound that will attack the boiler tubes .
“ Garbage is a much tougher fuel to burn than nearly anything I can think of because it ’s changing from minute to minute , ” said Castro .
“ Over time , we have learned to deal with those high temperatures combined with acidic gases but it ’s a pervasive problem and it increases your maintenance costs . ”
The solutions are better metallurgy , good boiler design and carefully monitored maintenance .
The economics of replacing certain boiler tubes every couple of years or paying extra to improve the metallurgy dramatically to extend that time frame have to be calculated for each project .
Boiler pressure parts at Elk River have been upgraded with appropriate alloys to withstand the chloride corrosion .
There is an economy of scale to O&M for WTE plants .
“ These units do enjoy economy of scale but that ’s a dual - edged sword , ” said Castro .
“ It means you have to do big plants to be cost - effective and you need a pretty good population center to do big plants . ”
When smaller plants are built , key functions are still needed , like crane operators who must be on duty no matter how many tons they are loading .
At Elk River , the equipment ’s age is an ongoing challenge .
Steinbeck said the company is committed to making continuous safety and operations improvements .
“ One of our major challenges with operating a near - 60 - year - old power plant is modernization and obsolescence so we continue to look at making sure we have a safe operating facility and replace equipment that can no longer be economically serviced , ” he said .
Emissions
Lee County was one of the first projects of its type to be permitted and built under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ’s new source performance standards for municipal waste combustion facilities since they were promulgated in the mid-1990s .
It also was among the first since the state of Florida tightened requirements for nitrogen oxide ( NO X ) emissions .
Environmental compliance was achieved with a combination of flue gas recirculation and advanced selective noncatalytic reduction ( SNCR ) controls , using urea as the reagent .
“ The NO X limits were a concern during the permitting and design phase but they have turned out to not be an issue in the operating phase , ” said Castro .
“ Our initial NO X was 140 parts per million ( PPM ) , but each month it drops and at 110 ppm that ’s where we ’ll stay . ”
There are two categories of WTE plant emissions : those that are monitored on a continuous basis , like NO X , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , opacity and sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) , and those that are checked annually , including particulates , hydrogen chlorides , dioxins , mercury and a few more exotic parameters , which are measured from the stack .
In 2008 , Elk River reported a total of six CO exceedances , the lowest number in several years , and one opacity spike while isolating a baghouse compartment to replace a leaking bag .
( For caption and credit information , click on this image in the gallery below . )
“ Emissions are different and less than from coal , ” said Steinbeck .
“ At Elk River , we scrub and have a bag house .
We filter 100 percent of the flue gas and control the SO 2 through our dry scrubber system . ”
Elk River also must control for chlorides and hydrogen chloride gas .
Its scrubber system takes out almost 100 percent of the hydrogen chloride and almost 90 percent of the sulfur dioxide .
The operating costs of running the Lee County facility on a day - to - day basis are roughly offset by the energy and recovered material sales , said Castro .
Electricity is sold to Seminole Electric , a generation co-op that resells it wholesale to its members .
“ What that leaves you with is the debt service , which is typically paid off on a 20 - or 25 - year basis , ” he said .
The debt retirement cost remains with the generator , but it ’s a stable cost , like a mortgage .
Even so , it remains cheaper to dig a hole in the ground and fill it with garbage .
“ The challenge is still the cost ; it ’s more expensive than the landfill option , ” said Steinbeck .
The Renewables Premium
Elk River Station is considered a renewable energy producer so it is part of Great River Energy ’s renewables portfolio .
“ Great River Energy sees value in that aspect of it , ” said Steinbeck .
“ With its older technology , it ’s not as efficient as a state - of - the - art pulverized coal facility , but it ’s equal to or better than comparable biomass renewable or certainly wind generation in our area . ”
If a federally mandated renewable portfolio standard ( RPS ) becomes law , electricity from the WTE plants will become more valuable and demand a premium .
Steinbeck said an RPS could push local communities to do further research into WTE plants as they work to put renewable energy into their portfolios .
The Lee County WTE is already cashing in .
“ Lee is one of the first waste - to - energy units in Florida to sell renewable energy credits along with their energy and capacity , ” said Castro .
“ They are making about $ 1 million a year selling RECs to Seminole Electric . ”
RECs could help offset the differential between the costs of a WTE plant and the landfill option .
There are other economics that could tip the scales in WTE ’s favor , too .
Today , in some areas of the Northeast where new landfills cannot be sited , garbage is shipped out of state and fuel costs are rising .
At some point , digging a hole in the ground and filling it with garbage may no longer be the favored option .
Sidebar : Operations at the Elk River Station WTE Plant
One of the major challenges with operating a 60 - year - old power plant is obsolescence .
At Elk River Station , plant manager Tim Steinbeck said equipment that can no longer be serviced economically is replaced .
“ With the RDF conversion 20 years ago , we installed a dry scrubber but there ’s been some obsolescence in the controls and technology so we ’ve recently upgraded some of the scrubber control system and mechanical slakers , ” he said .
The control system on one of the units has been upgraded , too .
The turbine generators are original equipment and have undergone minor modifications .
Making sure the plant is a safely operating facility is a top priority .
When the utility was concerned about arc flash regulations , for instance , switch gear was upgraded and relocated .

Seven hundred atheists , among them atheo - luminaries Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher , descended on Burbank , California earlier this month for the Atheist Alliance International 2009 convention .
The main topic ?
The great harm done throughout history by religion : the single most dangerous human creation .
The welfare of humanity , it was argued , depends on the dismantling of religion and all of its delusions .
The possibility of collaboration , of compromise , of any shared ethical commitments between theists and non-theists , was not on the table .
I was at the convention to give a talk from the perspective of African American Humanism .
While there are many things I share with atheists , I disagree with this aggressive ( one might even say fundamentalist ) dismissal of religion and the mocking of all things religious .
I am convinced that extremists ( whether theists or non-theists ) with their inability for critical self - reflection and critique are not the best champions of healthy life orientations .
I remain hopeful that collaboration and partnership will be difficult to achieve but not impossible .
I am not calling for a naïve stance marked by blindness — either to the deep dimensions of our differences , or to the great harm that theistic ( and atheistic ) perspectives can produce when they nurture bad ethics .
I left Burbank thinking it wise to reframe the “ A ” in Atheism .
Accentuate the Positive
Is victory over the doctrine of God all atheism desires ?
Is this victory even the best symbol of atheism ’s self - understanding ?
( We humanists and atheists tend to be as focused on God as theists ! )
If so , it is a somewhat empty victory , and at its worst is reminiscent of the posture of some evangelical theists .
I would hope atheists want more .
But having more requires steps beyond the quick conclusion that theists are delusional .
Atheists ( and as a humanist I am mindful of my role in this ) need to move beyond what philosopher William R. Jones has labeled a theoretical atheism , marked by its preoccupation with rejecting the existence of God .
This “ atheism of the mind ” is focused on belief and unbelief , on breaking the back of a delusion while enhancing an appreciation for science as the marker of our better selves .
But there is another strand of atheism , one Jones labels practical or functional .
This productive atheism involves more than the discrediting or lampooning of the practices of theistic faith communities .
Atheism is all too often ( yet not always ) presented as a simple negation of things religious , the “ a - ” meaning , simply , “ not . ” Instead , atheists must more carefully present a system of ethics meant to enhance quality of life , both through scientific advancement and rigorous struggle against irrational modes of destruction such as racism , sexism , and homophobia .
What is necessary is the application of practices that speak clearly to atheism ’s concern for life within the context of a fragile environment .
To the extent that it is possible ( and many atheists will reject this suggestion ) , attention should be given to a search for common ethical ground that brackets the harsher presentations of both theistic and atheistic views .
I am not asking for a “ ca n’t we all get along ” rejection of debate and a suspension of aggressive wrestling over ideas .
It is important to challenge beliefs as a way of safeguarding human accountability and integrity ; but there must also be a push for more than destruction of all markers of religious commitment .
We should continue to interrogate and critique theistic orientations , and adherents of theistic positions should continue to challenge us , lest we collapse into a fundamentalist atheism .
If not , careful and self - critical attention paid to science by some atheists , for instance , could easily become scientism — a faith of its own , with figures such as Richard Dawkins serving as its prophets .
History shows that reason may alter the posture of faith - based communities , may force them to shift their language and limit their size and their socio-political reach , but it will not destroy faith .
The very definition of faith should make this apparent .
Atheists miscalculate the core significance of theism if they assume it is about doctrine and creeds , ritual forms and physical structures ; those things most often attacked .
Theism , at its core , is about the making of meaning and the establishment of stories and practices related to how and why we occupy time and space ; ritual , doctrines , sacred texts and so on are only cultural manifestations of this deeper meaning .
These rituals and doctrines are secondary , not primary :
They are modified , they shift , they change to fit the historical - cultural context .
Attacks on theism ’s theological or ritual shortcomings , while correct in some regards , will not end theism .
Theism and atheism / humanism will persist , and any real gain we make toward healthy existence for our world must involve collaboration ( not assimilation ) and partnerships between moderates within both groups .
This is not denial of difference and does n’t require rejection of one ’s chosen orientation .
Rather it involves recognition that a mature approach to life rejects fundamentalism of any kind , and demands complex relationships of shared ethical commitment even when those relationships are burdened with tension .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico —
After carefully packing light green Mexican marijuana into a homemade water pipe , university student Salvador Chavez drew a deep breath from the tube and blew the smoke out of the window of his modest family home .
“ I do n’t care if the neighbors call the police on me .
They ca n’t arrest me for this anymore , ” he said behind lightly glazed eyes .
“ But then police here never cared much about a bit of marijuana anyway .
Everything has just stayed the same really . ”
Almost two months after Mexico decriminalized the possession of small amounts all major narcotics — including marijuana , cocaine and heroin — the most notable thing is how little has changed .
Drug users and addicts still smoke , snort and inject quietly in their homes ; drug dealers are still regularly arrested in stash houses and on street corners ; and major cartels carry on battling police to smuggle huge loads to the United States .
But while the law has yet to have a measurable impact on the Mexican streets , it has sent waves across the Americas to groups campaigning to change drug laws in their own countries .
Shortly after Mexico enacted its decriminalization act on Aug. 20 , the Supreme Court of Argentina ruled that it was unconstitutional to punish people for personal consumption of marijuana .
“ The state cannot establish morality , ” Argentine Supreme Court President Ricardo Lorenzetti said following that ruling .
The Argentine Congress is now looking to change its laws accordingly .
Then weeks later in Colombia , the Supreme Court also ruled that people could not be prosecuted for possession of narcotics for personal use , resisting pressure from conservative President Alvaro Uribe to lock up drug users .
“ Real change is happening .
More and more people over the world are taking a more rational view on drugs , ” said Maria Lucia Karam , a retired judge in Brazil who is part of the pro-legalization group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
“ People are understanding that the prohibition of drugs does more damage than the actual drugs themselves , ” she said .
A similar court ruling to that of Colombia and Argentina may soon be passed in Brazil , Karam said .
Latin American legalization advocates have been particularly encouraged by the muted United States reaction to the Mexican law .
For decades , the U.S. government pushed hard to pressure Western hemisphere nations to take a hard line on drugs , blocking certain aid programs if it ruled that anti-narcotic efforts were not sufficient .
Furthermore , in 2006 the White House condemned a previous attempt by Mexican lawmakers to decriminalize drugs , leading then - President Vicente Fox to refuse to sign the bill .
However , following Mexico ’s new law , the Obama administration has been virtually silent on the issue .
Asked about the upcoming changes in a visit to Mexico in July , Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske said he would “ wait - and - see . ”
Two months after the law has been enacted he still seems to be waiting and seeing .
“ The current administration seems to be taking a much more pragmatic approach to the issue , ” said Joe Rogoway , a spokesman for the California Cannabis Initiative , which campaigns for the legalization of marijuana .
Rogoway said the ease with which the Mexican law slipped in has also encouraged anti-prohibition groups north of the Rio Grande .
“ It is a positive start in the right direction , ” he said .
“ It is all about harm reduction .
And not throwing a drug user in jail definitely helps alleviate any harm to them . ”
The group is gaining signatures to put a motion to completely legalize marijuana in California on the ballot in 2010 .
Under current California law , marijuana is legal for medical use while possession for personal use can be punished with a fine .
However , some groups see the Mexican law and its ripple effects as a step backward rather than forward .
“ Decriminalization is clearly a victory for the drug sellers , ” said Calvina Fay , the executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation .
“ When people are taking drugs they are not innocent victims .
They are impacting many lives and they need to be held accountable . ”
Fay argues that rather than taking a softer approach , the United States and its Latin American allies should take a harder line on drugs — including more crop spraying and drug testing in schools and work places .
“ The mantra that the war on drugs does n’t work is a big fat lie , ” Fay said .
“ We have made real progress since the 1970s in fighting back drug use .
It is crazy to surrender now . ”

God will be furious if women become governors : Iran cleric
The appointment of women in such top jobs was against sharia law .
- AFP
Thu , Oct 15 , 2009
AFP
TEHRAN , IRAN - A top hardline Iranian cleric said on Thursday that " God 's fury " would be unleashed if Iran appoints women as governors of some provinces , as was raised as a possibility by a minister last week .
" If some people want to change the principles and values of the revolution without considering the views of clerics , they will face the fury of God and of the people , " Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpayghani said on his website .
Golpayghani was reacting to remarks by interior minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar in the holy city of Qom last week , who when asked whether Iran would appoint women as governors of provinces , replied : " Yes .
It is possible . "
Golpayghani said the appointment of women in such top jobs was against sharia ( Islamic ) law .
" They come to Qom , the centre of Shiite Islam , and announce that they will appoint women as governors of some provinces .
Do you want to fight with the Koran and the Prophet with such talks that go against sharia ? " he asked .
" Who are you against ?
God 's rule or the definite rules of religion ? "
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has also faced stiff resistance from hardline clerics , including Golpayghani , in appointing women as cabinet ministers .
Lawmakers , however , did approve one woman cabinet minister - the first female minister of the Islamic republic - during a vote of confidence in September .
In recent years Iranian women have outnumbered men in universities but they still account for only around 15 percent of the official work force .
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution , women have been banned from becoming judges and suffer from legal inequalities with men in marriage , divorce and inheritance .

President Donald Trump has consistently opposed fighting climate change .
His administration loosened fuel economy and emissions standards for new motor vehicles , for example — a measure that automakers had not even requested .
He replaced the Clean Power Plan championed by his predecessor , President Barack Obama , with new regulations that permit more carbon emissions from coal - and gas - burning power plants .
In November 2019 he even initiated the year - long process of withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accords , an agreement that required nothing from its signatories except an unenforced pledge to help keep the rise in global temperatures below two degrees Celsius .
The reasoning behind those actions has been hard to pin down .
Trump has repeatedly denounced global warming as a “ hoax ” and a Chinese plot to undermine U.S. manufacturing .
But then , in a January 2019 press conference , Trump also said “ nothing ’s a hoax ” about climate change .
Many of those he had named to head various agencies , including Rick Perry at the Department of Energy and Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency , questioned or denied the role of carbon dioxide in climate change .
But when reporters have directly asked whether Trump believes global warming is real , White House press secretaries have skirted the question .
It ’s hard to tell whether his administration is skeptical about the scientific fact of the climate crisis or simply the urgency of doing anything about it .
Ambiguity has often been weaponized by those who prefer to call themselves “ climate skeptics ” — although they generally seem to be more dedicated to naysaying than to genuine skeptical inquiry .
Not everyone who questions climate change science fits that description , of course : some people are genuinely unaware of the facts or honestly disagree about their interpretation .
What distinguishes the true naysayers is their dedicated opposition to conceding that there is an actionable problem , often with long - disproved arguments about alleged weaknesses in the science of climate change .
What follows is a partial list of the contrarians ’ bad - faith arguments and some brief rebuttals of them .
CLAIM 1 : Anthropogenic carbon dioxide ca n’t be changing climate , because CO 2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources .
Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas , so changes in CO 2 are irrelevant .
Although carbon dioxide makes up only 0.04 percent of the atmosphere , that small number plays a significant role in climate dynamics .
Even at that low concentration , CO 2 absorbs infrared radiation and acts as a greenhouse gas , as physicist John Tyndall demonstrated in 1859 .
Chemist Svante Arrhenius went further in 1896 by estimating the impact of CO 2 on the climate ; after painstaking hand calculations , he concluded that doubling its concentration might cause almost six degrees Celsius of warming — an answer not much out of line with recent , far more rigorous computations .
Forests remove atmospheric CO 2 and offset the nonhuman releases of CO 2 .
Human activity , combined with forest clearing ( shown here ) , negates this process , however .

Contrary to the contrarians , human activity is by far the largest contributor to the observed increase in atmospheric CO 2 .
According to the Global Carbon Project , anthropogenic CO 2 amounts to about 35 billion tons annually — more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce .
True , 95 percent of the releases of CO 2 to the atmosphere are natural , but natural processes such as plant growth and absorption into the oceans pull the gas back out of the atmosphere and almost precisely offset them , leaving the human additions as a net surplus .
Moreover , several sets of experimental measurements , including analyses of the shifting ratio of carbon isotopes in the air , further confirm that fossil - fuel burning and deforestation are the primary reasons that CO 2 levels have risen 45 percent since 1832 , from 284 parts per million ( ppm ) to 412 ppm — a remarkable jump to the highest levels seen in millions of years .
Contrarians frequently object that water vapor , not CO 2 , is the most abundant and powerful greenhouse gas ; they insist that climate scientists routinely leave it out of their models .
The latter is simply untrue : from Arrhenius on , climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models .
In fact , water vapor is why rising CO 2 has such a big effect on climate .
CO 2 absorbs some wavelengths of infrared that water does not , so it independently adds heat to the atmosphere .
As the temperature rises , more water vapor enters the atmosphere and multiplies CO 2 ’s greenhouse effect ; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) notes that water vapor may “ approximately double the increase in the greenhouse effect due to the added CO 2 alone . ”
Climate contrarians argue that variation in solar energy reaching the planet is behind global warming .
But human influence has a measurably stronger effect on climate .
Credit : NASA
Nevertheless , within this dynamic , the CO 2 remains the main driver ( what climatologists call a “ forcing ” ) of the greenhouse effect .
As NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt has explained , water vapor enters and leaves the atmosphere much more quickly than CO 2 and tends to preserve a fairly constant level of relative humidity , which caps off its greenhouse effect .
Climatologists therefore categorize water vapor as a feedback rather than a forcing factor .
( Contrarians who do n’t see water vapor in climate models are looking for it in the wrong place . )
Because of CO 2 ’s inescapable greenhouse effect , contrarians holding out for a natural explanation for current global warming need to explain why , in their scenarios , CO 2 is not compounding the problem .
CLAIM 2 : The alleged “ hockey stick ” graph of temperatures over the past 1,600 years has been disproved .
It does n’t even acknowledge the existence of a “ medieval warm period ” around a.d. 1000 that was hotter than today is .
Therefore , global warming is a myth .
It is hard to know which is greater : contrarians ’ overstatement of the flaws in the historical temperature reconstruction from 1998 by Michael E. Mann and his colleagues or the ultimate insignificance of their argument to the case for climate change .
First , there is not simply one hockey - stick reconstruction of historical temperatures using one set of proxy data .
Similar evidence for sharply increasing temperatures over the past couple of centuries has turned up independently while looking at ice cores , tree rings and other proxies for direct measurements , from many locations .
Notwithstanding their differences , they corroborate that the planet has been getting sharply warmer .
A 2006 National Research Council review of the evidence concluded “ with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries ” — which is the section of the graph most relevant to current climate trends .
The report placed less faith in the reconstructions back to a.d. 900 , although it still viewed them as “ plausible . ”
Medieval warm periods in Europe and Asia with temperatures comparable to those seen in the 20th century were therefore similarly plausible but might have been local phenomena : the report noted “ the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain . ”
And a research paper by Mann and his colleagues seems to confirm that the Medieval Warm Period and the “ Little Ice Age ” between 1400 and 1700 were both caused by shifts in solar radiance and other natural factors that do not seem to be happening today .
After the NRC review was released , another analysis by four statisticians , called the Wegman report , which was not formally peer - reviewed , was more critical of the hockey - stick paper .
But correction of the errors it pointed out did not substantially change the shape of the hockey - stick graph .
In 2008 Mann and his colleagues issued an updated version of the temperature reconstruction that echoed their earlier findings .
But hypothetically , even if the hockey stick was busted ...
What of it ?
The case for anthropogenic global warming originally came from studies of climate mechanics , not from reconstructions of past temperatures seeking a cause .
Warnings about current warming trends came out years before Mann ’s hockey - stick graph .
Even if the world were incontrovertibly warmer 1,000 years ago , it would not change the fact that the recent rapid rise in CO 2 explains the current episode of warming more credibly than any natural factor does — and that no natural factor seems poised to offset further warming in the years ahead .
CLAIM 3 : Global warming stopped in 1998 ; Earth has been cooling since then .
This contrarian argument might be the most obsolete and unintentionally hilarious .
Here ’s how it goes : 1998 was the world ’s warmest year , according to the U.K.
Met Office Hadley Center ’s records ; the following decade was cooler ; therefore , the previous century ’s global warming trend is over , right ?
Anyone with even a glancing familiarity with statistics should be able to spot the weaknesses of that argument .
Given the extended duration of the warming trend , the expected ( and observed ) variations in the rate of increase and the range of uncertainties in the temperature measurements and forecasts , a decade ’s worth of mild interruption is too small a deviation to prove a break in the pattern , climatologists say .
If a lull in global warming had continued for another decade , would that have vindicated the contrarians ’ case ?
Not necessarily , because climate is complex .
For instance , Mojib Latif , then at the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Germany , and his colleagues published a paper in 2008 that suggested ocean - circulation patterns might cause a period of cooling in parts of the Northern Hemisphere , even though the long - term pattern of warming remained in effect .
Fundamentally , contrarians who have resisted the abundant evidence that supports warming should not be too quick to leap on evidence that only hints at the opposite .
In any case , the claim that a “ warming pause ” disproved ongoing climate change became completely academic when 1998 stopped being the warmest year on record .
That title now belongs to 2016 , with 2019 right behind it .
In fact , the past 15 years have included all 10 of the hottest years on record .
CLAIM 4 : The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely the real causes of global warming .
After all , Mars is warming up , too .
Astronomical phenomena are obvious natural factors to consider when trying to understand climate , particularly the brightness of the sun and details of Earth ’s orbit because those seem to have been major drivers of the ice ages and other climate changes before the rise of industrial civilization .
Climatologists , therefore , do take them into account in their models .
But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles , there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures .
The IPCC has noted that between 1750 and 2005 , the radiative forcing from the sun increased by 0.12 watt per square meter —less than a tenth of the net forcings from human activities ( 1.6 W / m 2 ) .
The largest uncertainty in that comparison comes from the estimated effects of aerosols in the atmosphere , which can variously shade Earth or warm it .
Even granting the maximum uncertainties to these estimates , however , the increase in human influence on climate exceeds that of any solar variation .
Moreover , remember that the effect of CO 2 and the other greenhouse gases is to amplify the sun ’s warming .
Contrarians looking to pin global warming on the sun ca n’t simply point to any trend in solar radiance : they also need to quantify its effect and explain why CO 2 does not consequently become an even more powerful driver of climate change .
( And is what weakens the greenhouse effect a necessary consequence of the rising solar influence or an ad hoc corollary added to give the desired result ? )
Contrarians therefore gravitated toward work by Henrik Svensmark of the Technical University of Denmark , who argued that the sun ’s influence on cosmic rays needed to be considered .
Cosmic rays entering the atmosphere help to seed the formation of aerosols and clouds that reflect sunlight .
In Svensmark ’s theory , the high solar magnetic activity over the past 50 years shielded Earth from cosmic rays and allowed exceptional heating , but now that the sun is more magnetically quiet again , global warming would reverse .
Svensmark claimed that , in his model , temperature changes correlate better with cosmic - ray levels and solar magnetic activity than with other greenhouse factors .
Svensmark ’s theory failed to persuade most climatologists , however , because of weaknesses in its evidence .
In particular , there do not seem to be clear long - term trends in the cosmic - ray influxes or in the clouds that they are supposed to form , and his model does not explain ( as greenhouse explanations do ) some of the observed patterns in how the world is getting warmer ( such as that more of the warming occurs at night ) .
For now , at least , cosmic rays remain a less plausible culprit in climate change .
And the apparent warming seen on Mars ?
Because it is based on a very small base of measurements , it may not represent a true trend .
Too little is yet known about what governs the Martian climate to be sure , but a period when there was a darker surface might have increased the amount of absorbed sunlight and raised temperatures .
Elevated CO 2 makes oceans acidic , which could have irreversible harmful effects on coral reefs , such as coral bleaching ( shown here ) .

CLAIM 5 : Climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data .
Their so - called consensus on global warming is scientifically irrelevant because science is n’t settled by popularity .
It is virtually impossible to disprove accusations of giant global conspiracies to those already convinced of them ( can anyone prove that the Freemasons and the Roswell aliens are n’t involved , too ? ) .
Let it therefore be noted that the magnitude of this hypothetical conspiracy would need to encompass many thousands of uncontroversial publications and respected scientists from around the world , stretching back through Arrhenius and Tyndall for almost 150 years .
A conspiracy would have to be so powerful that it has co-opted the official positions of dozens of scientific organizations , including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences , the U.K. ’s Royal Society , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the American Geophysical Union , the American Institute of Physics and the American Meteorological Society .
If there were a massive conspiracy to defraud the world on climate ( and to what end ? ) , surely the thousands of e-mails and other files stolen from the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit in England and distributed by hackers in 2009 would bear proof of it .
None did .
Most of the few statements from those e-mails that critics claimed as evidence of malfeasance had more innocent explanations that make sense in the context of scientists conversing privately and informally .
If any of the scientists involved manipulated data dishonestly or thwarted Freedom of Information requests , it would have been deplorable ; however , there is no evidence that happened .
What is missing is any clear indication of a widespread attempt to falsify and coordinate findings on a scale that could hold together a global cabal or significantly distort the record on climate change .
Climatologists are often frustrated by accusations that they are hiding data or the details of their models because , as NASA ’s Schmidt points out , much of the relevant information is in public databases or otherwise accessible — a fact that contrarians conveniently ignore when insisting that scientists stonewall their requests .
( And because nations differ in their rules on data confidentiality , scientists are not always at liberty to comply with some requests . )
If contrarians want to deal a devastating blow to global warming theories , they should use the public data and develop their own credible models to demonstrate sound alternatives .
Yet that rarely occurs .
In 2004 historian of science Naomi Oreskes published a landmark analysis of the peer - reviewed literature on global warming , “ The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change . ”
Out of 928 papers whose abstracts she surveyed , she wrote , 75 percent explicitly or implicitly supported anthropogenic global warming , 25 percent were methodological or otherwise took no position on the subject — and none argued for purely natural explanations .
Notwithstanding some attempts to debunk Oreskes ’s findings that eventually fell apart , her conclusion stands .
Oreskes ’s work does not mean that all climate scientists agree about climate change — obviously , some do not ( although they are very much a minority ) .
Rather the meaningful consensus is not among the scientists but within the science : the overwhelming predominance of evidence for greenhouse - driven global warming that cannot easily be overturned even by a few contrary studies .
( Oreskes currently is a columnist for Scientific American . )
CLAIM 6 : Climatologists have a vested interest in raising the alarm because it brings them money and prestige .
If climate scientists are angling for more money by hyping fears of climate change , they are not doing so very effectively .
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office , between 1993 and 2014 federal spending on climate change research , technology , international assistance and adaptation rose from $ 2.4 billion to $ 11.6 billion .
( An additional $ 26.1 billion was also allocated to climate change programs and activities by the economic stimulus package of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 .
Total federal nondefense spending on research in 2014 exceeded $ 65 billion . )
Yet the scientific research share of that money fell sharply throughout that period : most of the budgeted money went to energy - conservation projects and other technology programs .
Climatologists ’ funding therefore stayed almost flat , whereas others , including those in industry , benefited handsomely .
Surely the Freemasons could do better than that .
CLAIM 7 : Technological fixes , such as inventing energy sources that do n’t produce CO 2 or geoengineering the climate , would be more affordable , prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint .
Critics of standard policy responses to climate change have often seemed to imply that environmentalists are obsessed with regulatory reductions in CO 2 emissions and uninterested in technological solutions .
That interpretation is at best bizarre : such innovations in energy efficiency , conservation and production are exactly what caps or levies on CO 2 are meant to encourage .
The relevant question is whether it is prudent for civilization to defer curbing or reducing its CO 2 output before such technologies are ready and can be deployed at the needed scale .
The most common conclusion is no .
Remember that as long as CO 2 levels are elevated , additional heat will be pumped into the atmosphere and oceans , extending and worsening the climate consequences .
As climatologist James Hansen of the Earth Institute at Columbia University has pointed out , even if current CO 2 levels could be stabilized overnight , surface temperatures would continue to rise by 0.5 degree C over the next few decades because of absorbed heat being released from the ocean .
The longer we wait for technology alone to reduce CO 2 , the faster we will need for those solutions to pull CO 2 out of the air to minimize the warming problems .
Minimizing the scope of the challenge by restricting the accumulation of CO 2 only makes sense .
Moreover , climate change is not the only environmental crisis posed by elevated CO 2 : it also makes the oceans acidic , which could have irreversibly harmful effects on coral reefs and other marine life .
Only the immediate mitigation of CO 2 release can contain those losses .
Much has already been written on why schemes for geoengineering — altering Earth ’s climate systems by design — seem ill advised except as a desperate last - chance strategy for dealing with climate change .
The more ambitious proposals involve largely untested technologies , so it is unclear how well they would achieve their desired purpose ; even if they did curb warming , they might cause other significant environmental problems in the process .
Methods that did not remove CO 2 from the air would have to be maintained in perpetuity to prevent drastic rebound warming .
And the governance of the geoengineering system could become a political minefield , with nations disagreeing about what the optimal climate settings should be .
And of course , as with any of the other technological solutions , reducing the emission and accumulation of CO 2 in the atmosphere first would only make any geoengineering solution easier .
All in all , counting on future technological developments to solve climate change rather than engaging with the problem straightforwardly by all available means , including regulatory ones , seems like the height of irresponsibility .
But then again , responsible action on climate change is what the contrarians seem most interested in denying .
Obesity is a complex issue , and addressing it is important for all Americans .
We at the Coca - Cola company are committed to working with government and health organizations to implement effective solutions to address this problem .
But a number of public - health advocates have already come up with what they think is the solution : heavy taxes on some routine foods and beverages that they have decided are high in calories .
The taxes , the advocates acknowledge , are intended to limit consumption of targeted foods and help you to ...
Despite growing frustration with the way health insurers deny medical treatments , major healthcare bills pending in Congress would give patients little new power to challenge those sometimes life - and - death decisions .
“ Right now , the deck is stacked against patients , ” said Bryan Liang , director of the Institute of Health Law Studies at California Western Law School in San Diego .
“ Healthcare reform is not going to change the ball game . ”
Yet a patient ’s ability to fight insurers ’ coverage decisions could be more important than ever because Congress , in promoting cost containment and price competition , may actually add to the pressure on insurers to deny requests for treatment .
By requiring insurers to cover everyone , regardless of pre-existing conditions , healthcare reform will make it more difficult for insurers to control their costs , or “ bend the cost curve , ” by avoiding sick people .

That leaves insurers with the other big cost - containment tool : turning down requests to cover treatments .
“ There are going to be a lot of denials , ” said insurance industry analyst Robert Laszewski , a former health insurance executive .
“ I am not setting insurance companies up to be villains .
But we are telling them to bend the cost curve .
How else are they going to bend the cost curve ? ”
Experts said the legislation under consideration does not significantly enhance patient protections against insurers refusing to cover requests for treatment .
Most people currently have no right to challenge health insurers ’ treatment decisions by suing them for damages .
Patient advocates point to the continuing struggle of Hilda and Grigor Sarkisyan , whose daughter Nataline died in 2007 when insurance giant Cigna Corp. refused to cover a liver transplant .

The parents ’ wrongful - death suit against Cigna over the transplant denial was thrown out this year by a federal judge , who cited a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the Employee Retirement Income Security Act .
That ruling said ERISA bars suits for damages over health benefit decisions .
The ruling affects 132 million people who get insurance through employers .
The Sarkisyans traveled to Washington a couple of months ago to try to persuade members of Congress to undo the ERISA ruling and allow people with job - based coverage to sue for damages .
The healthcare reform bill pending in the House would extend that right to anyone who buys coverage through one of the health insurance exchanges it envisions .
That could include small businesses .

But the legislation does not remove the barrier to such suits by people in the employment - based insurance market .
Insurers and employers strongly support the ban .
They say any increase in litigation would drive up costs and could force some employers to drop health benefits .
But some members of Congress said the Sarkisyans ’ case illustrates why change is needed .
They said patients would be better protected if insurers feared the possibility of a lawsuit over their treatment coverage decisions .
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) said the ERISA ruling had created an “ unbalanced set of incentives ” for insurance companies .

“ If they fail to fund an operation and then it turns out the operation would not have been useful and was n’t necessary , the patient lives and they save money , ” he said .
“ But if they fail to fund an operation and it turns out the patient dies , their liability is extremely limited . ”
Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D - Burbank ) , who met with the Sarkisyans in Washington , said it was not clear that Congress intended ERISA to bar damage suits against health insurers .
“ They are the only industry in the nation that has that kind of immunity from potentially very wrongful conduct , ” he said .
“ It is a real problem . ”
Still , Schiff said there were not enough votes to overcome industry support for the ERISA ruling .

But a government - sponsored health insurance option could be an antidote , he said .
The so - called public option , though controversial , was not included in the bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee last week .
But it is still under consideration in the House , where Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) favors it .
The idea is that private insurers would be forced to compete with the public option on price and service , which includes the ease with which patients can get needed treatment paid for .
“ Companies would be that much more scrupulous to ensure they provide the care necessary , because if you establish the reputation for denying care , there are not many buyers wanting your plan , ” Schiff said .

Another pair of liver transplants illustrate how that might work .
UCLA doctors told Ephram Nehme , a San Fernando Valley produce market owner , that he could die waiting for a liver in California and encouraged him to go to Indiana , where waits were much shorter .
But Nehme ’s insurer , Anthem Blue Cross of California , refused to pay for an out - of - state operation .
Fearing for his life , Nehme paid $ 205,000 out of his own pocket for the 2007 operation at Clarian Transplant Center in Indianapolis .
But if Nehme , now 61 , had been on Medicare , the public insurance plan for people 65 and older , his Indiana transplant would have been covered .

That ’s what happened last year to Glen Ossiander , a retired Pacific Palisades artist .
Like Nehme , Ossiander was being treated for hepatitis at UCLA .
Like Nehme , he needed a transplant .
And , like Nehme , he faced a long wait .
And , like Nehme , he moved temporarily to Indianapolis where he underwent the transplant operation within two weeks at Clarian .
That ’s where the similarities end .
Ossiander ’s operation was covered , without a hitch -- mostly by Medicare but also by his Medicare supplemental insurance provider , Anthem Blue Cross .
Ossiander , 68 , who knew his hepatitis might eventually require a transplant , said he was relieved when he turned 65 because he knew it would be covered .
“ As soon as I got onto Medicare , the hospital and everybody said , ‘ You really do n’t have anything to worry about now , ’ ” he said .
“ You are on Medicare . ”

Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) said he planned to fight for a public option as the debate moves to the full Senate because insurers have “ failed to meet their obligations to the American people . ”
“ We ’ve seen all the insurance industry tricks -- hiding rules in fine print , cutting people off when they get sick , and refusing to pay for necessary treatment because of pre-existing conditions , ” he said in a statement .
“ This is why I am fighting for a public option -- we need an insurance option out there that puts people first , not profits .
We need a real public option , one that competes with private insurance companies to keep them honest and accountable . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
An unidentified Canadian real estate company was the winning bidder for the Silverdome , snatching it up for a mere fraction of its original value .
A Toronto - based family - owned company bid $ 583,000 for the under - used stadium on Monday , which is currently owned by the City of Pontiac , Mich. , according to auctioneer Williams & Williams .
The company plans to refurbish the Silverdome into a stadium for men's Major League Soccer and women 's professional soccer teams , said the auctioneer .
While the stadium was the former home of the National Football League 's Detroit Lions , it also played host to some of the World Cup games in 1994 .
Brazil 's victory over Italy occurred elsewhere , at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , Calif .
The auctioneer Williams & Williams , based in Tulsa , Okla . , said it will not identify the buyer " until the final details are worked out and the sale closes . "
" The Silverdome will now be in the hands of professionals who can devote their time to transform this high - profile property into a vital asset instead of enabling it to continue to languish as an empty facility , " said Fred Leeb , the emergency financial planner for Pontiac , in a press release .
The sale of the Silverdome takes a large financial burden off the hard - hit city of Pontiac , which has fallen on hard times , with budget shortfalls and high unemployment .
Earlier this year , GM announced it would close a truck plant , taking about 1,400 jobs from the city .
As a result , Leeb said , Pontiac could ill afford to continue paying $ 1.5 million in annual upkeep for the stadium .
With a private owner , the property " will go back on the tax rolls , " he explained .
The 80,000 - seat Silverdome was the biggest stadium in the National Football League when it was built in 1975 for $ 55.7 million .
The stadium , which sits on a 127 - acre plot , is also the former home of the National Basketball Association 's Detroit Pistons .
The stadium reached its football zenith in 1982 as the site of Super Bowl XVI , when San Francisco 's 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals .
The Silverdome has also served as a music venue for some of the hottest acts in show business , including Michael Jackson , Madonna and Elvis .
Another high profile visitor , Pope John Paul II , once delivered Mass from the field .
But the Silverdome 's biggest event was Wrestle Mania III in 1987 , when 93,000 fans packed into the stadium to watch Hulk Hogan body - slam Andre the Giant .
That was the biggest turnout ever for an indoor sports event .
Despite its rich history , the stadium has seen little use since 2002 , when the Lions concluded their last season there .
" We want to convert a major premier asset of the city - convert it from something that 's been languishing into a new , vibrant marquee asset of the city , " said Leeb , in an October interview .
There are more than 1,500 Australian troops in Afghanistan Australian Defence Minister John Faulkner has asked for recommendations on how to complete operations in Afghanistan as early as possible .
The announcement is seen as the clearest signal so far that Australia may withdraw its 1,500 troops deployed in Afghanistan earlier than expected .
The Australian review comes as the top allied general in Afghanistan has called for a large troops increase .
Australia has the largest non-Nato troop presence in the country .
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney says the troop withdrawal could still be years away .
But he says Australia appears to be signalling that it will not send additional troops , following the call for reinforcements by Gen Stanley McChrystal , who heads US and foreign troops in Afghanistan .
' Rock solid ' Australia has confirmed that the soldiers it deployed to provide security during elections in August would stay for the presidential run -off next month .
" I 've certainly asked the Australian Defence Force for any recommendations they have about ensuring we do complete that important role and responsibility both effectively , but in the shortest time - frame possible , " Mr Faulkner told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation .
I 'm not going to talk specifically about the approaches we 'll take but I do acknowledge that there will be impacts on the approach that Nato and Isaf partners will be taking
John Faulkner
Australian Defence Minister Mr Faulkner admitted that Australia 's move would affect the push by Gen McChrystal .
" I 've been discussing these issues with the chief of the Defence Force , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , and obviously it 's a critically important matter for me , " he said .
" I 'm not going to talk specifically about the approaches we 'll take but I do acknowledge that there will be impacts on the approach that Nato and Isaf partners will be taking as a result of Gen McChrystal 's 60 - day assessment . "
The US commander warned last month that the war could be lost within a year without extra resources and President Barack Obama is considering boosting US troops by 40,000 to more than 100,000 .
Later , Mr Faulkner told a parliamentary committee that Australia was not about to start drawing down its troop numbers immediately and would stay in Afghanistan until it can hand over to Afghan forces .
Australia has lost 11 soldiers in Afghanistan .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd insisted the country 's commitment was " rock - solid " following the latest death in July .
However , Mr Rudd also admitted the war was " unpopular " .
He sent an extra 450 troops in April , but last week said Australia would not follow Britain 's move to provide another 500 armed forces .
About 100,000 international troops are deployed in Afghanistan .

The battle among Republicans over what the party should stand for — and how much it should accommodate dissenting views on important issues — is probably going to move from the states to the Republican National Committee when it holds its winter meeting this January in Honolulu .
Republican leaders are circulating a resolution listing 10 positions Republican candidates should support to demonstrate that they “ espouse conservative principles and public policies ” that are in opposition to “ Obama ’s socialist agenda . ”
According to the resolution , any Republican candidate who broke with the party on three or more of these issues– in votes cast , public statements made or answering a questionnaire – would be penalized by being denied party funds or the party endorsement .
The proposed resolution was signed by 10 Republican national committee members and was distributed on Monday morning .
They are asking for the resolution to be debated when Republicans gather for their winter meeting .
The resolution invokes Ronald Reagan , and noted that Mr. Reagan had said the Republican Party should be devoted to conservative principles but also be open to diverse views .
President Reagan believed , the resolution notes , “ that someone who agreed with him 8 out of 10 times was his friend , not his opponent . ”
Hence the provision calling for cutting off Republicans who agree with the party on fewer than eight of 10 items .
The resolution demands that Republicans support “ smaller government , smaller national deficits and lower taxes , ” denial of government funding for abortion , and “ victory in Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
It calls on candidates to oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants and repealing of the Defense of Marriage Act .
The development is going to put pressure on Michael Steele , the party chairman , as he tries to maintain a balance between those in his party who have been saying the road to victory is to include divergent views , and those who say the party needs to embrace conservative principles that have been at its core .
Mr. Steele managed , at his party ’s last meeting , to steer clear of potentially contentious resolutions , including one that equated Democrats with socialists .
Gail Gitcho , a spokeswoman for the committee , said it was not clear what Mr. Steele would do .
“ The deadline for submitting resolutions for the R.N.C. Winter Meeting is more than 30 days away , ” she said .
“ At this point , we do not what resolutions will be submitted nor what the final language of any resolution ultimately submitted may be . ”
Here is the resolution ’s list :
Certainly , while we may have ditched the dogma , the big questions that religion has traditionally answered - Who am I ?
Why am I here ?
What does it all mean ?
- continue to trouble us .
And plenty of people these days embark on a sort of spirituality smorgasbord : trying everything , pushing some things to the side of the plate , sometimes going back for seconds , until they find what nourishes them .
Goldsmith 's own journey has included a degree in the philosophy of religion , a period of Jungian analysis , training in reiki and five years in the Byron Bay hinterland , where the itinerant population brought her into contact with a range of teachers and gurus .
Her practice includes a variety of disciplines but she is reluctant to put a firm label on her current belief system .
" My passion is to be able to hold a space of loving presence for people , for my clients , so they can meet that place within themselves and be free within themselves .
It can sound really esoteric or hippie to say it 's just love and its presence , but the actual realisation of that is the most profound gift of my life . "
Goldsmith is convinced our interest in the spiritual is so strong precisely because the world around us is increasingly rational and material .
" That soul essence part of people is integral .
It 's always reborn with us , " she says .
" When someone has any sort of life crisis , that becomes incredibly apparent .
We can cover it up with our programming , and with material things , but we are paying a price for that in terms of our health and wellbeing . "
It is fair to say not many of us feel comfortable talking about our soul essence or putting our faith in mystical healing .
But few of us are entirely material and rational .
And most of us feel there is something more to us than flesh , bone and organised electrical activity .
Professor John Bigelow of Monash University 's philosophy department thinks that 's only human .
" No one has found a way of explaining the scientific story in a way that taps into our emotions , " he says .
" It has an intellectual thrill , but it does n't hit you in the heart or the gut .
Science is silent on moral and emotional issues .
Whereas the religious and spiritual stories have an emotional truth to them . "
And as religion proper falls from grace , we naturally seek out something to replace it .
" There was some need being filled by religion , and something has to fill the vacuum , " Bigelow says .
" Eddie McGuire said something on this - that now people are n't going to church , football has filled the gap .
That 's why footballers have to be role models . "
If instead of asking , " What would Jesus do ? " we started asking ourselves , " What would Fev do ? " we might find ourselves deep in the seventh circle .
But there 's no doubt people are looking for guidance , often in some pretty peculiar places .
At one extreme is a book such as The Secret , which declares we can control absolutely everything using only the power of our minds .
Other quasi-mystical disciplines can be more benign .
" There are lots of nice people , intelligent people , who believe in astrology , for instance , " Bigelow says .
" And one of the things I think astrology , tarot readings and so on provide is a network of symbols that have deep associations in the mind .
They 're something to think with .
If someone does a tarot reading , you end up having a conversation you would never have had if you were having a conversation about science . "
Even the great philosopher of science Karl Popper believed that in order to have hypotheses to test , you have to generate conjecture from the imagination .
" The ideas do n't have to be rational , as long as you 're rational in the way you test them , " Bigelow says .
Then there are the practices that oblige us to believe in something preposterous , whether that 's the Rosicrucians ( alchemy , clairvoyance ) or the Scientologists ( aliens ) .
But even there , powerful sociological and anthropological forces are at play .
" Historically , tribes scarify their members so they can't leave and join another group , " Bigelow says .
" One thing cults and religions can do is provide rituals that mark you out as a member of one group , and excluded from another group .
If those rituals consisted solely of rational conclusions drawn from the evidence available , where 's the exclusivity in that ?
Then all the religions would be the same .
'' The whole point is to pick some irrational idea .
At random .
And declare : ' We are the people who believe this !'
The irrationality of it is functionally important .
The whole point is to make it hard to believe . "
We all want to be special and part of something and god knows there are plenty of opportunities for people to put their faith in the ludicrous , whether that 's Holocaust deniers , UFOlogists , or past - lifers .
Nor is believing in the unbelievable just something indulged by horoscope - addicted teenage girls .
Attend any event by psychics such as John Edward and you 'll see a hall full of women .
But ask about UFOs , or Big Foot , or historical revisionism , or conspiracy theories , and men are much more likely to believe .
And while we may like to smugly hold to the notion that only the ill - educated and gullible fall for magic and hocus - pocus , there 's much evidence that the reverse is true .
No one could accuse the followers of Scientology of being deficient in IQ , for instance , whatever else you might think of their beliefs .
US studies show that New Age concepts , especially , are dearly held by those with higher intelligence , higher socioeconomic status and higher educational levels ; while psychologist David Wulff found that certain high - achieving personality types are more inclined to believe in mystical experiences ( typically those who score high on personality variables such as complexity , openness to new experience , breadth of interests , innovation , tolerance of ambiguity , and creativity ) .
US science historian and professional sceptic Michael Shermer is particularly interested in why smart people believe the unbelievable ( he has written a book on the subject , Why People Believe Weird Things ) .
In a comprehensive review of the literature , he collated a fascinating precis of the psychology of belief , and came to one basic conclusion : " Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons .
Where evidence is lacking , the mind fills in the gaps , and smart minds are better at gap - filling . "
But perhaps the most interesting - and pertinent - study Shermer quotes is by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski .
Studying island tribes off the coast of New Guinea , Malinowski discovered that the further out to sea they went to fish , the more they developed superstitious rituals .
The safer their environment , the less they relied on magic .
The more dangerous , chaotic and unpredictable the environment , the more the tribesmen invoked complicated rituals to keep bad luck at bay .
In short : " We find magic where the element of danger is conspicuous . "
And that , as much as anything , explains why so many otherwise intelligent , rational people choose to get their horoscopes cast , or consult regularly with their clairvoyants .
In a chaotic world , we feel we need all the help we can get .
But the other intriguing trend , especially among the educated middle class , is the tendency to put our faith in things we do n't actually believe in .
We have our lucky footy scarves and pre-match rituals , even though we know , rationally , it has absolutely no impact on the outcome of the game .
We compulsively read our horoscopes in cheap magazines and then describe ourselves accordingly ( " I'm a typical Sag " ) , while simultaneously accepting that the relation of the planets to the sun on the day we were born can have no actual bearing on our personality .
And we assess potential new homes or design our renovations around feng shui principles we not only do n't believe in , we do n't really understand - much to the ire of the people whose business it is to actually design houses and renovations .
" If you actually believe in feng shui , then by all means go to a feng shui master and have your house designed that way , " says architect Polly Bastow .
" But personally I think you 're better off trusting a strong sense of design and years of experience to give you a great house that responds to your brief , rather than some vague concepts that may or may not have relevance .
If a client wants feng shui feedback , they 've come to the wrong person . "
Maddeningly , that 's precisely what they regularly come to Bastow for anyway .
And clients ' feng shui concerns invariably focus on just the one thing : that your front door should n't face your back door .
" It gets a little bit more abstract when they talk about the money running out the door .
When it comes to renovations , the money is always going to run out the door .
But if you keep the feng shui out of it , it 's going to leave you with some wonderful pieces of design . "
When she 's taking it personally , Bastow sees the feng shui fixation as evidence of a lack of faith in her skills and expertise .
The cynical part of her sees it as a fad clients like to trot out at dinner parties .
More generously , she understands undertaking a major building project is daunting , and people are looking for all the reassurance they can get .
" It 's just an easy thing to say , an easy concept to understand , " she says .
" When a project seems too big , too hard to comprehend , it 's one of those things they can grasp . "
Terry Kelly , president of the Victorian Skeptics Association , says " it seems to be part of the human condition that if it suits us to believe something that does n't make sense , we will ' ' .
Kelly stresses that the association is not anti-religion ( indeed , several of its members are religious , including an Anglican minister ) .
But various members have given a lot of thought to why so many people believe so much that is either patently nonsensical or impossible to prove .
" Astrology 's the classic example of what we think is nonsense .
But a lot of really intelligent people I know believe it , " Kelly says .
" That 's partly because it 's often portrayed in a really generalist way , so it can mean all kinds of things .
People put their own meaning on to it .
And I think this is also part of the human condition .
We are pattern - makers .
We try and establish generalised rules and patterns from observable evidence to help us make sense of the world , but we also tend to make patterns even when they 're not there . "
Kelly also thinks sometimes the smartest people are the most gullible , because they figure if they can't understand something rationally , then it must be magic .
" You get this cognitive dissonance , where people can be rational in one sense , and irrational in another , " he says .
People like Vasilyki Eliades , perhaps , who for 22 years worked as a corporate lawyer while maintaining a not - so - secret double life as a serial attendee of what she calls " woo - woo workshops " .
" And for most of my life I 've been worried that my friends , who are mostly professional , rational people , would think I was a flake .
Until one of them said to me , ' You know what , Vas ?
Everyone knows .
We all know you 're a complete flake . '
That was such a bloody relief . "
Eventually , Eliades ended up doing tarot readings for her managing director and other senior executives .
Then a redundancy gave her the chance to pursue the woo - woo full time .
For the past two years she has combined pro bono and voluntary work with a fully fledged spiritual journey , something she regards with a combination of self - deprecation and seriousness .
" Let 's see .
I 've done dream groups .
My hairy women 's workshops .
Yoga and meditation , which are pretty much standard now days .
All sorts of primal therapy .
Gestalt .
Endless psychologists .
Counsellors - they 're part of my pit stop .
You get a wax , you go to your counsellor , you get your eyebrows done .
" I 've done therapy with drawing and crayons .
Voice dialogue .
Have you done voice dialogue ?
Marvellous .
Totally kooky .
But marvellous .
I studied reiki and became a reiki master .
Which was a much prouder moment than becoming a lawyer .
Crystals .
Past life integration .
Entity clearings .
You name it .
And my own jury is still out on some of that stuff .
But all of these things always only ever lead to greater self - awareness .
To my mind , that is the spiritual Holy Grail . "
The other important thing Eliades ' woo - woo workshops grant her is a sense of belonging .
" Organised religions are based on separateness .
And a lot of these newer things are inclusive .
Which gives me a spiritual home , I guess , a feeling like I 'm not alone on the planet .
'' It also gives me a place , particularly the women 's workshops that I 've done , to just sit with women and really feel connected to the feminine , which in a corporate environment you rarely do . "
But it 's not just about bonding with the girls .
Eliades really does believe in some kind of spiritual dimension .
" My belief in an Other does n't guarantee me any kind of redemption , " she stresses .
" And I do believe this life is all there is .
And the way one evolves in this space is what one takes with one - energetically - when one goes .
But I do believe the essence of people remains . "
So we do have souls ?
" Oh yes .
We each have an essence that is our greater connectedness . "
In that , Eliades is typical of many 21st - century " believers " , combining an unshakeable belief in something more than this mortal coil with what she describes as " a very healthy inner cynic " .
" In the moment , while I am in it , I feel quite connected to whatever 's transpiring . "
Afterwards , she 's not always so sure .
" A lot of it does n't fit comfortably into my belief system , " she says .
" But I also think this planet and this universe are way weirder than any of us are actually willing to admit . "
IMOGIRI , Indonesia — Scattered on a forested hillside in this remote , almost pristine area of Central Java is the Ilmu Giri Pesantren , an Islamic boarding school that six years ago began offering a new kind of curriculum to a handful of local farmers .
Today , students of Islam , young and old and from all over the country , are flocking to this tiny , mostly outdoor campus to hear its founder , Nasruddin Anshory , preach about a Muslim ’s ordained responsibility to protect the environment .
“ As a Muslim , ” he says to the students , who sit cross -legged in the dirt beneath the jungle canopy , feverishly taking notes , “ you must do something . ”
Ilmu Giri rose to prominence during the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali , where Anshory was celebrated for his teachings .
But environmentalism had been taught in Indonesian Islamic boarding schools , known as pesantren , since at least the 19th Century — long before anyone paid attention to melting ice caps or rising sea levels .
On the Island of Madura in East Java is Pesantren Guluk - Guluk , also called Al - Nuqayah , which was established in 1887 .
Its founder , Muhammad Syarqawi , originally opened the school to spread Islam on an island that was then a lawless and often violent place .
He soon found the real problem to be the small island ’s devastated environment .
It was desperately dry and fresh water was scarce , forcing the inhabitants to fight over resources .
So Syarqawi shifted his focus to teaching the island ’s villagers , with the help of the Quran , about conservation .
It was hardly a stretch , says Achmad Suaedy , director of the Wahid Institute , an organization founded by Indonesia ’s former president Abdurrahman Wahid that promotes peaceful and pluralistic Islam , and which has been working to promote “ Green Islam ” within Indonesia ’s pesantrens .
“ There are numerous passages in the Quran that refer to environmental protection , ” he said .
“ There ’s the line , for instance , that equates a human life with that of a tree : ‘ Do not kill women , elders , children , civilians or trees . ’ ”
In fact , the very origins of Islam are thought to be partly rooted in the early Muslims ’ need to preserve scarce resources .
“ The advent of Islam as an organized religion occurred in the desert environment of Arabia , and hence there was considerable attention paid to ecological concerns within Islamic ethics , ” said Saleem Ali , associate dean of graduate studies at the University of Vermont ’s Rubenstein School for the Environment .
“ There is a reverence of nature that stems from essential pragmatism within the faith . ”
Still Guluk - Guluk remained the only one of its kind for more than a century .
It ’s been only in the last five years , just as global awareness of climate change and other environmental issues have increased , that “ Green Islam ” here has really taken root .
Attendance at Guluk - Guluk has ballooned from 1,200 to more than 6,500 students .
And a number of those new environmentalists have gone on to open their own schools in cities all over the country .
There are now ever - growing networks of pesantrens going green , making Indonesia the unlikely pioneer of environmental Islam .
The Indonesian government , recognizing the potential benefits of having the country ’s 17,000 pesantren adopt some form of environmentalist program , has begun to vigorously promote such curriculums .
State Environment Minister Gusti Muhammad Hatta announced earlier this month that about 90 pesantrens in Central Java would take part in his new “ eco- pesantren ” pilot program , with the hope of broadening it to still hundreds more in the coming year .
Hatta said there are about 4 million students attending pesantrens , the world ’s largest network of Islamic boarding schools , who could take what they learn back to their home towns .
“ Indonesia is really the world leader in this area , ” said Ali , adding that Islam generally trails other major religions in faith - based environmental initiatives .
At Ilmu Giri , the results of their environmentalist education have already begun to show .
Not long ago this hillside had been stripped bare by logging , which in turn gave way to a series of landslides that obliterated nearby villages .
“ I remember the stories my parents told me about those landslides , ” said Wardoyo , a young Ilmu Giri student who grew up here .
“ Now , Pak Nasruddin teaches us that if we have to cut down a tree , we must plant two more . ”
Within several years of the school ’s founding , the small farming community managed to “ re- green ” the entire hillside .
Anshory ’s students now plant thousands of trees every year .
Recently by Andrew Gavin Marshall : The Economic Recovery Is an Illusion
In the face of total global economic collapse , the prospects of a massive international war are increasing .
Historically , periods of imperial decline and economic crisis are marked by increased international violence and war .
The decline of the great European empires was marked by World War I and World War II , with the Great Depression taking place in the intermediary period .
Currently , the world is witnessing the decline of the American empire , itself a product born out of World War II .
As the post - war imperial hegemon , America ran the international monetary system and reigned as champion and arbitrator of the global political economy .
To manage the global political economy , the US has created the single largest and most powerful military force in world history .
Constant control over the global economy requires constant military presence and action .
Now that both the American empire and global political economy are in decline and collapse , the prospect of a violent end to the American imperial age is drastically increasing .
This essay is broken into three separate parts .
The first part covers US - NATO geopolitical strategy since the end of the Cold War , at the beginning of the New World Order , outlining the western imperial strategy that led to the war in Yugoslavia and the u201CWar on Terror . u201D
Part 2 analyzes the nature of u201 Csoft revolutionsu201D or u201 Ccolour revolutionsu201D in US imperial strategy , focusing on establishing hegemony over Eastern Europe and Central Asia .
Part 3 analyzes the nature of the imperial strategy to construct a New World Order , focusing on the increasing conflicts in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , Latin America , Eastern Europe and Africa ; and the potential these conflicts have for starting a new world war with China and Russia .
Defining a New Imperial Strategy
In 1991 , with the collapse of the Soviet Union , US - NATO foreign policy had to re-imagine its role in the world .
The Cold War served as a means of justifying US imperialist expansion across the globe with the aim of u201 Ccontaining u201D the Soviet threat .
NATO itself was created and existed for the sole purpose of forging an anti-Soviet alliance .
With the USSR gone , NATO had no reason to exist , and the US had to find a new purpose for its imperialist strategy in the world .
In 1992 , the US Defense Department , under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney [ later to be George Bush Jr.'s VP ] , had the Pentagon 's Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , Paul Wolfowitz [ later to be George Bush Jr. 's Deputy Secretary of Defense and President of the World Bank ] , write up a defense document to guide American foreign policy in the post - Cold War era , commonly referred to as the u201CNew World Order.u201D
The Defense Planning Guidance document was leaked in 1992 , and revealed that , u201CIn a broad new policy statement that is in its final drafting phase , the Defense Department asserts that America 's political and military mission in the post - cold - war era will be to ensure that no rival superpower is allowed to emerge in Western Europe , Asia or the territories of the former Soviet Union , u201D and that , u201CThe classified document makes the case for a world dominated by one superpower whose position can be perpetuated by constructive behavior and sufficient military might to deter any nation or group of nations from challenging American primacy .
u201D
Further , u201 Cthe new draft sketches a world in which there is one dominant military power whose leaders u2018 must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role ' .u201D
Among the necessary challenges to American supremacy , the document u201 Cpostulated regional wars against Iraq and North Korea , u201D and identified China and Russia as its major threats .
It further u201 Csuggests that the United States could also consider extending to Eastern and Central European nations security commitments similar to those extended to Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and other Arab states along the Persian Gulf.u201D [ 1 ]

The wars in Yugoslavia throughout the 1990s served as a justification for the continued existence of NATO in the world , and to expand American imperial interests in Eastern Europe .
The World Bank and IMF set the stage for the destabilization of Yugoslavia .
After long - time dictator of Yugoslavia , Josip Tito , died in 1980 , a leadership crisis developed .
In 1982 , American foreign policy officials organized a set of IMF and World Bank loans , under the newly created Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAPs ) , to handle the crisis of the $ 20 billion US debt .
The effect of the loans , under the SAP , was that they u201 Cwreaked economic and political havoc …
The economic crisis threatened political stability … it also threatened to aggravate simmering ethnic tensions .
u201D [ 2 ]
In 1989 , Slobodan Milosevic became President of Serbia , the largest and most powerful of all the Yugoslav republics .
Also in 1989 , Yugoslavia 's Premier traveled to the US to meet President George H.W. Bush in order to negotiate another financial aid package .
In 1990 , the World Bank / IMF program began , and the Yugoslav state 's expenditures went towards debt repayment .
As a result , social programs were dismantled , the currency devalued , wages frozen , and prices rose .
The u201 Creforms fueled secessionist tendencies that fed on economic factors as well as ethnic divisions , virtually ensuring the de facto secession of the republic , u201D leading to Croatia and Slovenia 's succession in 1991 . [ 3 ]
In 1990 , US the intelligence community released a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , predicting that Yugoslavia would break apart , erupt in civil war , and the report then placed blame on Serbian President Milosevic for the coming destabilization . [ 4 ]
In 1991 , conflict broke out between Yugoslavia and Croatia , when it , too , declared independence .
A ceasefire was reached in 1992 .
Yet , the Croats continued small military offensives until 1995 , as well as participating in the war in Bosnia .
In 1995 , Operation Storm was undertaken by Croatia to try to retake the Krajina region .
A Croatian general was recently put on trial at The Hague for war crimes during this battle , which was key to driving the Serbs out of Croatia and u201 Ccemented Croatian independence.u201D
The US supported the operation and the CIA actively provided intelligence to Croat forces , leading to the displacement of between 150,000 and 200,000 Serbs , largely through means of murder , plundering , burning villages and ethnic cleansing .
[ 5 ]
The Croatian Army was trained by US advisers , and the general on trial was even personally supported by the CIA . [ 6 ]
The Clinton administration gave the u201 Cgreen lightu201D to Iran to arm the Bosnian Muslims and u201 Cfrom 1992 to January 1996 , there was an influx of Iranian weapons and advisers into Bosnia .
u201D Further , u201CIran , and other Muslim states , helped to bring Mujihadeen fighters into Bosnia to fight with the Muslims against the Serbs , ‘ holy warriors ’ from Afghanistan , Chechnya , Yemen and Algeria , some of whom had suspected links with Osama bin Laden ’s training camps in Afghanistan.u201D
It was u201CWestern intervention in the Balkans [ that ] exacerbated tensions and helped to sustain hostilities .
By recognising the claims of separatist republics and groups in 1990 / 1991 , Western elites  the American , British , French and German  undermined government structures in Yugoslavia , increased insecurities , inflamed conflict and heightened ethnic tensions .
And by offering logistical support to various sides during the war , Western intervention sustained the conflict into the mid-1990s .
Clinton ’s choice of the Bosnian Muslims as a cause to champion on the international stage , and his administration ’s demands that the UN arms embargo be lifted so that the Muslims and Croats could be armed against the Serbs , should be viewed in this light .u201D [ 7 ]
During the war in Bosnia , there u201 Cwas a vast secret conduit of weapons smuggling though Croatia .
This was arranged by the clandestine agencies of the US , Turkey and Iran , together with a range of radical Islamist groups , including Afghan mojahedin and the pro-Iranian Hizbullah.u201D
Further , u201 Cthe secret services of Ukraine , Greece and Israel were busy arming the Bosnian Serbs . u201D [ 8 ]
Germany 's intelligence agency , the BND , also ran arms shipments to the Bosnian Muslims and Croatia to fight against the Serbs . [ 9 ]
The US had influenced the war in the region in a variety of ways .
As the Observer reported in 1995 , a major facet of their involvement was through u201CMilitary Professional Resources Inc ( MPRI ) , a Virginia - based American private company of retired generals and intelligence officers .
The American embassy in Zagreb admits that MPRI is training the Croats , on licence from the US government .
u201D
Further , The Dutch u201 Cwere convinced that US special forces were involved in training the Bosnian army and the Bosnian Croat Army ( HVO ) .u201D [ 10 ]
As far back as 1988 , the leader of Croatia met with the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to create u201 Ca joint policy to break up Yugoslavia , u201D and bring Slovenia and Croatia into the u201CGerman economic zone.u201D
So , US Army officers were dispatched to Croatia , Bosnia , Albania , and Macedonia as u201 Cadvisersu201D and brought in US Special Forces to help . [ 11 ]
During the nine - month cease - fire in the war in Bosnia - Herzegovina , six US generals met with Bosnian army leaders to plan the Bosnian offensive that broke the cease - fire . [ 12 ]
In 1996 , the Albanian Mafia , in collaboration with the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) , a militant guerilla organization , took control over the enormous Balkan heroin trafficking routes .
The KLA was linked to former Afghan Mujaheddin fighters in Afghanistan , including Osama bin Laden . [ 13 ]
In 1997 , the KLA began fighting against Serbian forces , [ 14 ] and in 1998 , the US State Department removed the KLA from its list of terrorist organizations . [ 15 ]
Before and after 1998 , the KLA was receiving arms , training and support from the US and NATO , and Clinton 's Secretary of State , Madeline Albright , had a close political relationship with KLA leader Hashim Thaci . [ 16 ]
Both the CIA and German intelligence , the BND , supported the KLA terrorists in Yugoslavia prior to and after the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia .
The BND had KLA contacts since the early 1990s , the same period that the KLA was establishing its Al - Qaeda contacts . [ 17 ] KLA members were trained by Osama bin Laden at training camps in Afghanistan .
Even the UN stated that much of the violence that occurred came from KLA members , u201 Cespecially those allied with Hashim Thaci.u201D [ 18 ]
The March 1999 NATO bombing of Kosovo was justified on the pretense of putting an end to Serbian oppression of Kosovo Albanians , which was termed genocide .
The Clinton Administration made claims that at least 100,000 Kosovo Albanians were missing and u201 Cmay have been killed u201D by the Serbs .
Bill Clinton personally compared events in Kosovo to the Holocaust .
The US State Department had stated that up to 500,000 Albanians were feared dead .
Eventually , the official estimate was reduced to 10,000 , however , after exhaustive investigations , it was revealed that the death of less than 2,500 Albanians could be attributed to the Serbs .
During the NATO bombing campaign , between 400 and 1,500 Serb civilians were killed , and NATO committed war crimes , including the bombing of a Serb TV station and a hospital . [ 19 ]

In 2000 , the US State Department , in cooperation with the American Enterprise Institute , AEI , held a conference on Euro - Atlantic integration in Slovakia .
Among the participants were many heads of state , foreign affairs officials and ambassadors of various European states as well as UN and NATO officials . [ 20 ]
A letter of correspondence between a German politician present at the meeting and the German Chancellor , revealed the true nature of NATO 's campaign in Kosovo .
The conference demanded a speedy declaration of independence for Kosovo , and that the war in Yugoslavia was waged in order to enlarge NATO , Serbia was to be excluded permanently from European development to justify a US military presence in the region , and expansion was ultimately designed to contain Russia . [ 21 ]
Of great significance was that , u201 Cthe war created a raison d’tre for the continued existence of NATO in a post - Cold War world , as it desperately tried to justify its continued existence and desire for expansion .
u201D Further , u201CThe Russians had assumed NATO would dissolve at the end of the Cold War .
Instead , not only has NATO expanded , it went to war over an internal dispute in a Slavic Eastern European country.u201D
This was viewed as a great threat .
Thus , u201 Cmuch of the tense relations between the United States and Russia over the past decade can be traced to the 1999 war on Yugoslavia . u201D [ 22 ]
The War on Terror and the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC )
When Bill Clinton became President , the neo-conservative hawks from the George H.W. Bush administration formed a think tank called the Project for the New American Century , or PNAC .
In 2000 , they published a report called , Rebuilding America 's Defenses : Strategy , Forces , and Resources for a New Century .
Building upon the Defense Policy Guidance document , they state that , u201 Cthe United States must retain sufficient forces able to rapidly deploy and win multiple simultaneous large - scale wars .
u201D [ 23 ]
Further , there is u201 Cneed to retain sufficient combat forces to fight and win , multiple , nearly simultaneous major theatre wars , u201D [ 24 ] and that u201 Cthe Pentagon needs to begin to calculate the force necessary to protect , independently , US interests in Europe , East Asia and the Gulf at all times.u201D [ 25 ]
Interestingly , the document stated that , u201 Cthe United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security .
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification , the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . u201D [ 26 ]
However , in advocating for massive increases in defense spending and expanding the American empire across the globe , including the forceful destruction of multiple countries through major theatre wars , the report stated that , u201CFurther , the process of transformation , even if it brings revolutionary change , is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor . u201D [ 27 ]
That event came one year later with the events of 9/11 .
Many of the authors of the report and members of the Project for the New American Century had become officials in the Bush administration , and were conveniently in place to enact their u201CProjectu201D after they got their u201Cnew Pearl Harbor.u201D
The plans for war were u201 Calready under development by far right Think Tanks in the 1990s , organisations in which cold - war warriors from the inner circle of the secret services , from evangelical churches , from weapons corporations and oil companies forged shocking plans for a new world order .
u201D
To do this , u201 Cthe USA would need to use all means  diplomatic , economic and military , even wars of aggression  to have long term control of the resources of the planet and the ability to keep any possible rival weak .
u201D
Among the people involved in PNAC and the plans for empire , u201CDick Cheney  Vice President , Lewis Libby  Cheney ’s Chief of Staff , Donald Rumsfeld  Defence Minister , Paul Wolfowitz  Rumsfeld ’s deputy , Peter Rodman  in charge of ‘ Matters of Global Security ’ , John Bolton  State Secretary for Arms Control , Richard Armitage  Deputy Foreign Minister , Richard Perle  former Deputy Defence Minister under Reagan , now head of the Defense Policy Board , William Kristol  head of the PNAC and adviser to Bush , known as the brains of the President , Zalmay Khalilzad , u201D who became Ambassador to both Afghanistan and Iraq following the regime changes in those countries . [ 28 ]
Brzezinski's u201CGrand Chessboardu201D
Arch - hawk strategist , Zbigniew Brzezinski , co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller , former National Security Adviser and key foreign policy architect in Jimmy Carter 's administration , also wrote a book on American geostrategy .
Brzezinski is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group , and has also been a board member of Amnesty International , the Atlantic Council and the National Endowment for Democracy .
Currently , he is a trustee and counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , a major US policy think tank .
In his 1997 book , The Grand Chessboard , Brzezinski outlined a strategy for America in the world .
He wrote , u201CFor America , the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia .
For half a millennium , world affairs were dominated by Eurasian powers and peoples who fought with one another for regional domination and reached out for global power .
u201D Further , u201 Chow America u2018 manages ' Eurasia is critical .
Eurasia is the globe 's largest continent and is geopolitically axial .
A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world 's three most advanced and economically productive regions .
A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail African subordination . u201D [ 29 ]
He continued in outlining a strategy for American empire , stating that , u201 Cit is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges , capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America .
The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book .
u201D [ 30 ]
He explained that , u201CTwo basic steps are thus required : first , to identify the geostrategically dynamic Eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them : [ and ] second , to formulate specific U.S. policies to offset , co-opt , and / or control the above .u201D [ 31 ]
What this means is that is it of primary importance to first identify states that could potentially be a pivot upon which the balance of power in the region exits the US sphere of influence ; and secondly , to u201 Coffset , co-opt , and / or controlu201D such states and circumstances .
An example of this would be Iran ; being one of the world 's largest oil producers , and in a strategically significant position in the axis of Europe , Asia and the Middle East .
Iran could hold the potential to alter the balance of power in Eurasia if it were to closely ally itself with Russia or China , or both — giving those nations a heavy supply of oil as well as a sphere of influence in the Gulf , thus challenging American hegemony in the region .
Brzezinski removed all subtlety from his imperial leanings , and wrote , u201CTo put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires , the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals , to keep tributaries pliant and protected , and to keep the barbarians from coming together . u201D [ 32 ]
Brzezinski referred to the Central Asian republics as the u201CEurasian Balkans , u201D writing that , u201CMoreover , they [ the Central Asian Republics ] are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors , namely Russia , Turkey and Iran , with China also signaling an increasing political interest in the region .
But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize : an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region , in addition to important minerals , including gold .
u201D [ 33 ]
He further wrote that , u201CIt follows that America ’s primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it .u201D [ 34 ]
This is a clear example of America 's role as an engine of empire ; with foreign imperial policy designed to maintain US strategic positions , but primarily and u201 Cinfinitely more important , u201D is to secure an u201 Ceconomic prizeu201D for u201 Cthe global community .
u201D
In other words , the United States is an imperial hegemon working for international financial interests .
Brzezinski also warned that , u201 Cthe United States may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push America out of Eurasia , thereby threatening America ’s status as a global power , u201D [ 35 ] and he , u201 Cputs a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge America ’s primacy .
u201D
Thus , u201CThe most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the United States from Eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role .u201D [ 36 ]
The War on Terror and Surplus Imperialism
In 2000 , the Pentagon released a document called Joint Vision 2020 , which outlined a project to achieve what they termed , u201CFull Spectrum Dominance , u201D as the blueprint for the Department of Defense in the future .
u201CFull - spectrum dominance means the ability of U.S. forces , operating alone or with allies , to defeat any adversary and control any situation across the range of military operations .
u201D
The report u201 Caddresses full - spectrum dominance across the range of conflicts from nuclear war to major theater wars to smaller - scale contingencies .
It also addresses amorphous situations like peacekeeping and noncombat humanitarian relief .
u201D Further , u201CThe development of a global information grid will provide the environment for decision superiority .u201D [ 37 ]
As political economist , Ellen Wood , explained , u201CBoundless domination of a global economy , and of the multiple states that administer it , requires military action without end , in purpose or time .
u201D [ 38 ]
Further , u201CImperial dominance in a global capitalist economy requires a delicate and contradictory balance between suppressing competition and maintaining conditions in competing economies that generate markets and profit .
This is one of the most fundamental contradictions of the new world order .u201D [ 39 ]
Following 9/11 , the u201CBush doctrineu201D was put in place , which called for u201 Ca unilateral and exclusive right to preemptive attack , any time , anywhere , unfettered by any international agreements , to ensure that u2018 [ o ] ur forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build - up in hope of surpassing , or equaling , the power of the United States '.u201D [ 40 ]
NATO undertook its first ground invasion of any nation in its entire history , with the October 2001 invasion and occupation of Afghanistan .
The Afghan war was in fact , planned prior to the events of 9/11 , with the breakdown of major pipeline deals between major western oil companies and the Taliban .
The war itself was planned over the summer of 2001 with the operational plan to go to war by mid-October . [ 41 ]
Afghanistan is extremely significant in geopolitical terms , as , u201CTransporting all the Caspian basin ’s fossil fuel through Russia or Azerbaijan would greatly enhance Russia ’s political and economic control over the central Asian republics , which is precisely what the west has spent 10 years trying to prevent .
Piping it through Iran would enrich a regime which the US has been seeking to isolate .
Sending it the long way round through China , quite aside from the strategic considerations , would be prohibitively expensive .
But pipelines through Afghanistan would allow the US both to pursue its aim of u2018 diversifying energy supply ' and to penetrate the world ’s most lucrative markets .u201D [ 42 ]
As the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out a mere two weeks following the 9/11 attacks , u201CBeyond American determination to hit back against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks , beyond the likelihood of longer , drawn - out battles producing more civilian casualties in the months and years ahead , the hidden stakes in the war against terrorism can be summed up in a single word : oil.u201D
Explaining further , u201CThe map of terrorist sanctuaries and targets in the Middle East and Central Asia is also , to an extraordinary degree , a map of the world ’s principal energy sources in the 21st century .
The defense of these energy resources  rather than a simple confrontation between Islam and the West  will be the primary flash point of global conflict for decades to come.u201D

Among the many notable states where there is a crossover between terrorism and oil and gas reserves of vital importance to the United States and the West , are Saudi Arabia , Libya , Bahrain , the Gulf Emirates , Iran , Iraq , Egypt , Sudan and Algeria , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan , Chechnya , Georgia and eastern Turkey .
Importantly , u201 Cthis region accounts for more than 65 percent of the world ’s oil and natural gas production .
u201D Further , u201CIt is inevitable that the war against terrorism will be seen by many as a war on behalf of America ’s Chevron , ExxonMobil and Arco ; France ’s TotalFinaElf ; British Petroleum ; Royal Dutch Shell and other multinational giants , which have hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the region .u201D [ 43 ]
It 's no secret that the Iraq war had much to do with oil .
In the summer of 2001 , Dick Cheney convened an Energy Task Force , which was a highly secret set of meetings in which energy policy was determined for the United States .
In the meetings and in various other means of communication , Cheney and his aides met with top officials and executives of Shell Oil , British Petroleum ( BP ) , Exxon Mobil , Chevron , Conoco , and Chevron . [ 44 ]
At the meeting , which took place before 9/11 and before there was any mention of a war on Iraq , documents of Iraqi oilfields , pipelines , refineries and terminals were presented and discussed , and u201CSaudi Arabian and United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) documents likewise feature a map of each country 's oilfields , pipelines , refineries and tanker terminals .
u201D [ 45 ]
Both Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum have since received major oil contracts to develop Iraqi oilfields . [ 46 ]
The war on Iraq , as well as the war on Afghanistan , also largely serve specifically American , and more broadly , Western imperial - strategic interests in the region .
In particular , the wars were strategically designed to eliminate , threaten or contain regional powers , as well as to directly install several dozen military bases in the region , firmly establishing an imperial presence .
The purpose of this is largely aimed at other major regional players and specifically , encircling Russia and China and threatening their access to the region ’s oil and gas reserves .
Iran is now surrounded , with Iraq on one side , and Afghanistan on the other .
Concluding Remarks
Part 1 of this essay outlined the US - NATO imperial strategy for entering the New World Order , following the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
The primary aim was focused on encircling Russia and China and preventing the rise of a new superpower .
The US was to act as the imperial hegemon , serving international financial interests in imposing the New World Order .
The next part to this essay examines the u201 Ccolour revolutionsu201D throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia , continuing the US and NATO policy of containing Russia and China ; while controlling access to major natural gas reserves and transportation routes .
The u201 Ccolour revolutionsu201D have been a pivotal force in geopolitical imperial strategy , and analyzing them is key to understanding the New World Order .

A former bank manager has been sentenced to six months ' jail in Victoria for stealing and causing the death of a pedigree dog that was found hanging from a tree .
Barry Patrick Rochford , 49 , was sentenced in the Bendigo Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to causing the dog 's death .
Rochford , a keen dog breeder , stole two Irish wolfhounds from a property near Ballarat two years ago .
One has never been found .
Magistrate William Gibb said Rochford 's crimes " beggared belief " .
He will serve three months for animal cruelty and three months for stealing the dogs .
The sentences will be served cumulatively .
A passer - by found an Irish wolfhound hanging from a tree at Lake Eppalock , south - east of Bendigo , on Christmas Day in 2007 .
It is unclear how long the dog had been there .
His six - month sentence is on top of a jail term he is currently serving for arson offences , also committed two years ago .
He will be eligible for parole in February 2011 .
Rochford appeared in court via video link from jail .

Editor 's Note : Arsalan Iftikhar is an international human rights lawyer , founder of TheMuslimGuy.com , and contributing editor for Islamica magazine in Washington .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Most of the world 's 1.57 billion Muslims know that the Holy Quran states quite clearly that , " Anyone who kills a human being ... it shall be as though he has killed all of mankind .
...
If anyone saves a life , it shall be as though he has saved the lives of all of mankind . "
Accordingly , it should come as little surprise to any reasonable observer that when Army Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan recently committed his shocking acts of mass murder at Fort Hood , Texas , America 's Muslim community of over 7 million felt an added sense of horror and sadness at this senseless attack against the brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces .
True to form , many conservative media pundits wasted little time in pointing to reports that Hasan had said " Allahu Akbar " ( Arabic for " God is great " ) at the start of his murderous rampage .
News coverage continuously showed the looping convenience store black - and - white videotape footage of Hasan wearing traditional white Islamic garb .
First of all , someone simply saying " Allahu Akbar " while committing an act of mass murder no more makes their criminal act " Islamic " than a Christian uttering the " Hail Mary " while murdering an abortion medical provider , or someone chanting " Onward , Christian Soldiers " while bombing a gay nightclub , would make their act " Christian " in nature .
Simply put ; murder is murder and has no religion whatsoever .
Professor Juan Cole of the University of Michigan once wrote that , " One most certainly does insult Muslims by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism .
Muslims perceive a double standard in this regard : Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols would never be called ' Christian terrorists ' even though they were in close contact with the Christian Identity Movement .
No one would speak of Christo - fascism or Judeo - fascism as the Republican [s ] ... speak of Islam - o - fascism .
... [ Many people also ] point out that [ it was ] persons of Christian heritage [ who ] invented fascism , not Muslims . "
According to Pentagon statistics , there were over 3,400 American Muslims serving in the active - duty military as of April 2008 .
The Wall Street Journal reported that many officials believe " the actual number of [ American ] Muslim soldiers may be at least 10,000 higher than the Pentagon statistics . "
Thus , with thousands of patriotic American Muslim women and men proudly serving in our United States Army in places like Iraq and Afghanistan , perhaps it would behoove our army leaders to consider sending a strong message of American unity by appointing an American Muslim to be a part of the prosecution team against Hasan .
This would help show that the mass murders allegedly committed by Hasan have nothing to do with the teachings of our religion .
The United States Army can send a resounding message to all Americans and the rest of the world that the social fabric of our country will never become unraveled by murderous ( and irreligious ) gun-wielding felons -- whether it is a Muslim in Fort Hood , Texas , or a non-Muslim on a shooting rampage in an Orlando , Florida , high - rise less than a day later .
By appointing a multicultural ( and multireligious ) legal prosecution team made up of military lawyers of all races and religions , we can set a good example to show the rest of the world that our American legal justice system is truly equal for all people , regardless of their race , religion or socioeconomic status .
The larger point is that Muslims in America completely disavow and wash our hands of any acts of murder ( or terrorism ) claimed to be performed in the name of our religion .
Acts of mass murder , regardless of their time or place , are simply ungodly criminal acts that have no religion whatsoever .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar .

U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue on Friday pushed back on the effort of two senior House Democrats to get large amounts of potentially embarrassing financial information from health insurance companies .
In a Friday letter , Donohue told House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of that panel ’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , that he was “ deeply troubled ” by lawmakers ’ request for the information and asked that they withdraw it immediately .
Waxman and Stupak on Monday sent letters to more than 50 health insurers asking them to hand over by early September details of their executive compensation packages , conferences and retreats they sponsored , and the profitability of their products .
Donohue blasted the request as “ ill - advised and economically destructive . ”
“ No citizen — individual or corporate — should be singled out for harassment and intimidation by the government simply because they disagree with powerful committee chairmen or seek to persuade others to embrace their viewpoint , ” he wrote .
HOW LONG BEFORE WE BECOME A NATION OF 50 CALIFORNIAS ?

While you discovered the dreary reality of Detroit , Michigan — that ’s only one American city !
Commensurately — Miami , Chicago , Houston , New York , Los Angeles and others follow toward a range of similar futures .
Ask yourself , with 15 million Americans unemployed and 35 million subsisting on food stamps , does it make sense to import 160,000 legal immigrants into this country every 30 days and a total of 1.5 million plus annually ?
Especially when those immigrants cost American taxpayers ( you ) a total of $ 346 billion in resettling services across 15 federal agencies annually ?
At this point in time , with 10 million legal and unlawful immigrants , California suffers a $ 24 billion debt .
It can not pay its bills .
It sinks deeper into collapse as it adds 1,700 people per day , every day of the year .
Next question : what if all of our states turned into Californias ?
Given enough time , they will !
Remember that U.S. population projections show immigration adding 100 million people to the USA in 26 years .
( Source : Fogel / Martin March 2006 , “ US Population Projections , ” )
In a brilliant expose ’ famed economist Edwin Rubenstein wrote , “ As California Goes - Facts behind California ’s Fiscal Meltdown . ” ( Volume 19 , Number 4 , summer 2009 , )
In it , Rubenstein illustrates California ’s plight as the canary in the coal mine .
Why California ?
“ The state ’s top income tax rate — 10.3 percent — is the highest in the nation , and this surely explains why the richest 1 percent of residents end up contributing half of all the personal income taxes the state collects , ” Rubenstein said .
“ Even the state sales tax rate — a poor man ’s levy — is well above the national average .
“ The usual suspects — high spending and low taxes — are not to blame .
In their place stands something far more fundamental : demographic change .
An ever - growing share of California residents are immigrants .
The vast majority of immigrants are from Latin America ( 56 percent ) and Asia ( 35 percent ) .
They are generally young , poorly educated , and mired in low - income jobs that do not provide health insurance .
Their English is often rudimentary .
They depend on state social services at far higher rates than natives or earlier immigrant cohorts . ”
A whopping third of California ’s immigrants entered unlawfully !
At least half of them work off the books thereby not paying any taxes into the system , but their children tap into education , food and health care at an astounding cost to the state .
In the last eight years , 86 hospitals and ER wards bankrupted out of business .
“ Latino families are larger than those of other immigrant groups .
Their children swell elementary schools but are less likely than other groups to graduate high school or finish college , ” Rubenstein said .
“ Second - generation Latinos are also less likely to grow up with two parents , and more likely to go to jail or become teenage mothers .
“ Many observers — including prominent Latin Americans — have concluded that the same traditional values that lie behind Latin America ’s difficulties in achieving prosperity and political stability are being substantially perpetuated among Hispanic immigrants and their descendants in California .
This implies that the problem is primarily cultural , not economic , and that fiscal measures alone will not suffice to solve it . ”
California ’s Immigration Tsunami
“ Between 1970 and 2006 the number of California residents born abroad increased by more than five - fold , from 1.8 million to 9.9 million , ” said Rubenstein .
“ Currently the state has a much higher share of immigrants in its population than the U.S. as a whole . ”
For more than a century California has set the immigration trend for the nation :
“ Using official state figures , demographer Leon Bouvier concluded that immigration accounts directly and indirectly for 98 percent of California ’s population growth between 1990 and 2002 .
Direct immigration contributed 57 percent of the rise , while the rest came from births to foreign - born women , ” said Rubenstein .
“ Behind the headline statistics are two telling factoids .
First , net migration from other states has virtually ceased .
Traffic congestion , schools , the water crisis , the state ’s fiscal meltdown , are all a big turn - off to citizens of other , less troubled parts of the country .

“ Second , the average California mother is expected to give birth to 2.1 children over her lifetime .
This is the so - called “ replacement ” fertility rate which , if sustained over time , will result in a stable population .
The devil is in the details : established residents and immigrants from non-Hispanic groups — Asians , Blacks , Whites , American Indians , and Pacific Islanders — are all reproducing at below replacement rates .
Hispanic mothers , by contrast , are on course to have 3.25 children over their reproductive lifetimes . ”
The Immigration Deficit
Once upon a time political correctness did not prevent Californians from discussing the fiscal burden imposed by illegal aliens .
In the early 1990s California faced a sinking economy not unlike today’s .
Social welfare caseloads exploded , state revenue declined by more than 25 percent , and the state ’s budget deficit was an unprecedented one - third of total general fund spending .
“ Caseloads continued rising even after the recession ended , a trend many officials blamed on illegal immigrants , ” said Rubenstein .
“ In 1993 California Gov. Pete Wilson sued the federal government for the costs of state services to illegals — widely estimated at $ 2 billion ( $ 2.9 billion in 2009 dollars ) — arguing that Washington mandated the provision of such services while failing to prevent the illegal influx .
Five other magnet states — Arizona , Florida , New York , New Jersey , and Texas — joined the suit .
“ The issue propelled the drafting of Proposition 187 , a state initiative denying certain services to illegal aliens .
A firestorm ensued .
Besides racism and anti-Latino bias , immigrant groups charged the Wilson administration with grossly exaggerating the net cost of illegal aliens on the state ’s budget . ”
The 1994 study found that the 1.7 million illegal aliens then residing in California and their U.S. - born children :
• Received $ 4.3 billion in state services
• Paid $ 739 million in state taxes
• Received about $ 3.6 billion more than they paid in taxes .
“ K - 12 education is the largest state expenditure , accounting for 40 percent of the budget , ” Rubenstein said .
“ Enrollments have increased dramatically since 1994 , swelled primarily by Hispanic immigrants and their U.S. - born children .
Consider this : between 1994 and 2005 California K - 12 enrollment grew by 1,054,806 ; Hispanic student enrollment rose by 1,009,489 , accounting for 96 percent of the total increase .
White enrollment declined by 246,220 students over the same period . ”
( See article . )
California Is Our Canary
California still has the nation ’s largest immigrant population .
But its lead is shrinking :
In 1994 32 percent of the nation ’s foreign - born lived in California ; today about 26 percent do .
Only 17 percent of immigrants arriving in the U.S. between 2005 to 2006 settled in California .
“ Unfortunately , the same social pathologies that attend the foreign - born in California travel to other U.S. destinations , ” said Rubenstein .
“ In every instance immigrants are , on average , poorer than natives , more dependent on public largesse , more likely to require remedial education , less likely to finish high school , and more likely to evade taxation and to be incarcerated .
Throughout the nation native - born citizens are digging ever deeper into their pockets to subsidize public services for immigrants . ”

This image shows the process by which Photosystem I in thermophilic blue - green algae can be catalyzed by platinum to produce a sustainable source of hydrogen .
The system was highlighted in a paper by University of Tennessee , Knoxville research Barry Bruce , et al. in Nature Nanotechnology .

In the quest to make hydrogen as a clean alternative fuel source , researchers have been stymied about how to create usable hydrogen that is clean and sustainable without relying on an intensive , high - energy process that outweighs the benefits of not using petroleum to power vehicles .
New findings from a team of researchers from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , and Oak Ridge National Laboratory , however , show that photosynthesis - the process by which plants regenerate using energy from the sun - may function as that clean , sustainable source of hydrogen .
The team , led by Barry Bruce , a professor of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology at UT Knoxville , found that the inner machinery of photosynthesis can be isolated from certain algae and , when coupled with a platinum catalyst , is able to produce a steady supply of hydrogen when exposed to light .
The findings are outlined in this week 's issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
Bruce , who serves as the associate director for UT Knoxville 's Sustainable Energy and Education Research Center , notes that we already get most of our energy from photosynthesis , albeit indirectly .
The fossil fuels of today were once , millions of years ago , energy - rich plant matter whose growth also was supported by the sun via the process of photosynthesis .
There have been efforts to shorten this process , namely through the creation of biomass fuels that harvest plants and covert their hydrocarbons into ethanol or biodiesel .
" Biofuel as many people think of it now -- harvesting plants and converting their woody material into sugars which get distilled into combustible liquids -- probably cannot replace gasoline as a major source of fuel , " said Bruce .
" We found that our process is more direct and has the potential to create a much larger quantity of fuel using much less energy , which has a wide range of benefits . "
A major benefit of Bruce 's method is that it cuts out two key middlemen in the process of using plants ' solar conversion abilities .
The first middle man is the time required for a plant to capture solar energy , grow and reproduce , then die and eventually become fossil fuel .
The second middle man is energy , in this case the substantial amount of energy required to cultivate , harvest and process plant material into biofuel .
Bypassing these two options and directly using the plant or algae 's built - in solar system to create clean fuel can be a major step forward .
Other scientists have studied the possibility of using photosynthesis as a hydrogen source , but have not yet found a way to make the reaction occur efficiently at the high temperatures that would exist in a large system designed to harness sunlight .
Bruce and his colleagues found that by starting with a thermophilic blue - green algae , which favors warmer temperatures , they could sustain the reaction at temperatures as high as 55 degrees C , or 131 degrees F .
That is roughly the temperature in arid deserts with high solar irradiation , where the process would be most productive .
They also found the process was more than 10 times more efficient as the temperature increased .
" As both a dean and a chemist , I am very impressed with this recent work by Professor Bruce and his colleagues , " said Bruce Bursten , dean of UT Knoxville 's College of Arts and Sciences .
" Hydrogen has the potential to be the cleanest fuel alternative to petroleum , with no greenhouse gas production , and we need new innovations that allow for hydrogen to be readily produced from non-hydrocarbon sources .
Professor Bruce and his team have provided a superb example of how excellence in basic research can contribute significantly to technological and societal advances . "

Chris Matthews , Democrat operative and former Carter speechwriter , and Mark Potok , director of the fear - mongering Southern Poverty Law Center ’s Intelligence Project , ganged up on Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers the other day on MSNBC .
Out of the gate , Matthews tried to portray Rhodes as a gun nut and a rightwing extremist .
He characterized Oath Keepers as a “ vigilante group ” and attempted to connect the organization to the “ birthers ” and the shooting at the Holocaust museum in Washington by a deranged white supremacist .
Matthews standard tactic is to put words in the mouths of the guests he is assigned to malign and discredit and then allow them a few seconds to respond and defend themselves before interrupting and moving on to the next accusation disguised as a question .
Matthews , a former police officer with the United States Capitol Police , has the interview finesse of a bullying cop interrogator .
He accused Rhodes and the Oath Keepers of stockpiling weapons to be used in a plot to attack the federal government .
Rhodes emphatically stated that the Oath Keepers are not organizing people to engage in armed rebellion against the government .
Oath Keepers are asking police officers and military personnel to disobey orders that violate the Constitution .
Matthews accused Rhodes and the Oath Keepers of harboring paranoid fantasies about foreign troops on U.S. soil .
In fact , foreign troops have conducted training exercises and other functions with the U.S. government within the United States .
In July , the FEMA website admitted the presence of foreign troops inside the country when it posted a factsheet about National Level Exercise 2009 ( NLE 09 ) .
The NLE 09 exercise focused “ on terrorism prevention and protection , as opposed to incident response and recovery ” and included the participation of troops from Australia , Canada , Mexico and the United Kingdom .
The NLE 09 “ scenario enables participating senior officials to focus on issues related to preventing terrorist events domestically and protecting U.S. critical infrastructure , ” according to the factsheet .
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , armed Mexican troops were brought into the United States under cover of providing aid to the victims .
In November , 2005 , Congressman Ron Paul appeared on the Alex Jones Show and expressed concern that foreign troops are mobilizing outside and inside America to be used as assets in a martial law takeover .
“ It ’s a horrible precedent and it ’s all part of the NAFTA scheme and globalization and world government , ” Paul told Jones .
Matthews also dismissed the fact there are concentration camps in the United States .
He shares this task with Glenn Beck and Popular Mechanics .
In January , HR 645 was introduced in the House .
The bill would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network camp facilities located on military bases to be used to intern U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency .
“ Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees , ” write Dan Hamburg , a former former Democratic Party Congressman and Green Party Gubernatorial candidate from California , and Lewis Seiler for The San Francisco Chronicle .
The KBR camps are part of a Homeland Security plan called Endgame , which sets as its goal the removal of “ all removable aliens ” and “ potential terrorists . ”
The government has planned to intern American citizens for some time .
Readiness Exercise 1984 ( REX - 84 ) is an emergency response program involving the implementation of martial law , the movement of civilian populations and the arrest and detainment of segments of the population .
A rehearsal of the program was carried out April 5 - 13 , 1984 .
It was led by FEMA and the Department of Defense and involved the coordination of 34 other federal departments and agencies .
More recently , the Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress .
It permits the government to imprison indefinitely individuals the president deems “ enemy combatants . ”
It also denies non-military tribunal judicial review of detainment .
It ’s too bad Matthews did not give Stewart Rhodes a chance to mention any of this .
Mark Potok of the SPLC said the Oath Keepers is a group “ driven by conspiracy theories … very much like the militia conspiracy theories . ”
For Potok and the fear - mongering cottage industry known as the SPLC , “ militia ” is a codeword for white supremacist racism .
It also raises the specter of the government operative and patsy Timothy McVeigh and the OK City bombing .
It relives the government and corporate media myth of a terrorist militia movement , a myth rekindled recently by the MIAC and DHS reports on “ rightwing ” terrorism .
As to be expected , Matthews provided scant time for Stewart Rhodes to make his case .
But then MSNBC , owned by one of the largest terrorist organizations on the planet — the death merchant General Electric — is not interested in providing a forum for Rhodes and the Oath Keepers .
It is about propaganda and fear .
It is about portraying constitutionalists as dangerous domestic terrorists .
MSNBC is the “ liberal ” side of the New World Order ’s propaganda machine .
Chris Matthews is a prized and handsomely paid operative tasked with slandering and mischaracterizing patriotic Americans opposed to a renegade and unconstitutional federal government .

Detonation of my brain was approximately three seconds away , as I left a party on the weekend .
It was not the raucous children overloaded on sugar that was leading me to want to neck myself , rather one of the parents .
I am a friendly kind of chick .
I could talk the leg off an iron pot , make conversation with a potato chip and smile at the wind .
I do n’t have a problem speaking to complete strangers about total and utter rot .
In fact it ’s usually me instigating the rot .
Unfortunately conversing with a particular stranger at the party was about as painful as inner - thigh chafing on a sweaty day .
This woman had one daughter .
Listening to her drone on about how boys are so out of control , how they fight ALL THE TIME and how thankful she is to have a girl , was making me feel not so friendly .
Clearly , she would know all about boys with her vast research into the topic , having one child of the opposite sex .
She should have gauged her audience prior to making those sweeping statements for when I threw in that I am the mother of three boys and I ’m not sure all these generalisations apply , she looked absolutely horrified .
Not at the potentially awkward situation of just bagging out an entire gender to a mother who solely has that gender but more at the thought of me raising three of the “ critters ” .
She even cocked her nostril up a little and physically shivered when I mentioned my brood , telling me I deserved a medal ( if only I had a chest to pin it on ... ) .
The idea that a child could be something other than a stereotype , was foreign to her .
Snakes and snails , and puppy dogs tails ...
Let me welcome you to 2009 , where boys play with dolls and girls race cars .
As the cake was placed on the table , the four girls jumped up on the seats to adore it ( despite having dinosaurs all over it ) , proceeded to poke the cake and lick the cake .
Yes , I said lick .
Meanwhile , four of the six boys ran laps around the table shooting each other .
The other two boys were inside , sharing a book .
Dragon stranger rolled her eyes and reiterated how “ out of control ” the boys were and implored me to “ look at the girls sitting so nicely . ”
Licking the cake ?
I resisted the temptation to point out their not - so - angelic table manners .
I ’ll admit I am a little more sensitive to the popular trend of categorising boys and girls .
Strangers frequently offer me sympathy for the lot I ’ve been given .
Three boys .
Wow .
Yes , my hands are full .
Yes , they like to be active .
Yes , they fart .
And sometimes they smell .
But so do my nieces .
What ’s your point ?
Having three very different boys has driven my quest to break down stereotypes .
We love to think boys are rowdy , messy , dirty and smelly while girls are pretty , calm , and quiet .
Sure , boys can be more physical and as a whole , they seem to find it more difficult to sit still .
This does not mean there are boys out there who are incapable of completing an activity quietly and thoroughly .
My eldest has recently embraced the joy of drawing and loves writing stories .
He will sit at his desk in his room inventing characters and illustrations to match .
There are no signs of ants in pants .
Curiously , he does n’t shoot random strangers with imaginary guns and his desire to wrestle , anyone , is non-existent .

My second born is more of what the party lady would consider a stereotypical boy .
I think he was born with his index finger pointed in the shooter position .
He finds toilet humour hilarious , loves to climb , jump , wrestle and run .
He has a whole repertoire of superhero slingshot type noises .
He is able to sit still when there is chocolate on offer .
Conversely , he loves to play with his cousin ’s doll ’s house and is partial to a game of “ mums and dads ” .
He seems sufficiently in touch with his feminine side .
Go figure .
Last child is too young to stereotype .
He does have a penis though so that automatically puts him in the boy camp .
We are considering buying him a doll for Christmas because he has taken a liking to dragging one round the house whenever we visit a friend who has all girls .
I have n’t raised girls so I ca n’t pass comment on my experience .
I am a girl , though ( did I need to point that out ? ) .
I have nieces and friends with girls and have witnessed a whole array of behaviours , just like boys .
Girls who both sit still and quietly , and those that are loud and cannot concentrate for the length of time it takes to paint a fingernail .
Snakes and snails , and puppy dogs tails
That 's what little boys are made of ! "
What are little girls made of ?
" Sugar and spice and all things nice
That 's what little girls are made of ! "

It seems some people are still living by a nineteenth century rhyme [ origin ] .
Let me welcome you to 2009 , where boys play with dolls and girls race cars .
Why must we insist on stereotyping our kids ?
Sadly , we are guilty of doing it right into adulthood .
Women love to shop , chat on the phone and spend hundreds of dollars on makeup , they ca n’t read maps or program a DVD , apparently .
Evidently , men scratch their balls whilst watching 24 straight hours of football , drinking beer and having belching contests .
They love a challenge and therefore never ask directions and do n’t need to read instructions to put together an IKEA bookcase .
My husband is only guilty of a couple of these things .
Does that make him half - man ?
Unless you ’ve had a lobotomy and been raised by nuns , you ’d recognise men and women , boys and girls , are quite different in the way we operate .
I ca n’t do a bush wee as easily as my husband , for example .
It does n’t mean we fit in neat boxes of how genders should behave .
Why on earth do we place these kind of pressures on our kids ?
Girls who wo n’t wear dresses , who prefer to roll around in the dirt and drive cars through the sandpit and smash them into the walls , are still girls .
Boys who like to sit still and colour in , concoct imaginary games with dolls and teddies and mime to the latest pop music still qualify to be boys .
The strong irritation I felt towards the mother at the party who had dissed all boys before actually spending any quality time with them , led me to dreams of wielding a pillow and gently lowering it over her mouth .
Not really .
I would love to get the pillow onto the stereotypes though .
Do your children fit the stereotypes of their genders ?
Do you offer your children all types of experiences & toys despite their gender , or do you prefer to stick to what you think is " gender appropriate " ?
Do you think we add to the problem by raising our boys and girls with clear gender distinctions ?

What divides us By Alisa Craddock
web posted November 16 , 2009 A few days ago , someone said to me that Pres .
Obama does n't know what he 's doing .
" He does n't know how to be our president , " she said to me .
What this lady ( and much of America ) does n't understand is , that is n't his job .
Oh , that 's what we elected him to do .
That 's his title — President of the United States — but that 's not what he is there for .
Those who chose and groomed him , who have bankrolled his rocket ride to the White House , have a different job for him , and in that he knows exactly what he is doing .
Obama 's job is to prepare America to become part of the global government , to cut us down to size , to cripple us , humiliate us , socially destroy us , so that we will need , as a nation , to become part of the global nanny state .
He is to shore up the power of his coalition by filling it with those who share his objective ( such as transferring authority and power from Congress to his czars , and by eliminating those in civil service who are not on board with the agenda ) .
He is to seize power over businesses and extort the business world to comply with this agenda , or face destruction by the government .
He is to create laws that will bring the American people under absolute subjection , so that their compliance can be assured .
And he is to disarm us .
And this agenda has been laid out for decades .
Since the early 1960's , the final phase of this agenda has been in motion .
In addition , our foreign policy shifted from one of helping less developed countries to develop their people and resources , to become productive and self - sustaining , to one of exploitation :
Our wealthiest elite have set sights on their natural resources , and population control is the means to prevent the depletion of those resources .
It is not only the US , of course , but the wealthy elite of the world , who are complicit in this goal .
But by promoting a " myth " of overpopulation , and an " environmental " crisis , they have succeeded in getting much of the world ( including many in the U.S. ) to go along with it , believing it is necessary to save the planet .
Once upon a time , the US had a conscience .
The people opposed contraception , and certainly abortion .
At the very least they believed these were private issues , not the government 's business .
President Kennedy has opposed the use of government funds for what is euphemistically called " family planning " precisely because it would make it look as though the government was trying to control the population of black , Hispanic and Asian people .
( In point of fact , that is precisely what the goal is .
It is right out of Margaret Sanger 's stated objectives . )
After Kennedy 's assassination , as reported in the EIR Special Report , The Genocidal Roots of Bush 's New World Order , American policy shifted to a disasterous " post - industrial policy , an absurd idea , abandoning the formula that had made America a superpower .
America 's foreign policy changed from one of assisting LDC's ( less - developed countries ) to develop and become self - sustaining , to one responding to the new ideology of " limits to growth " .
( I want to jump in here and point out that George Bush Sr. 's name is in the title because of his public invocation of the term " New World Order " , but the agenda that is described herein is not a " Republican " agenda , nor a " Democrat " agenda .
The wealthy elite propelling this agenda are on both sides of the aisle . )
It was Jimmy Carter ( Democrat ) who signed the Global 2000 report , and it was Henry Kissinger ( Republican ) who penned the National Security Study Memorandum 200 , ( NSSM 200 ) also known as the Kissinger Report , both of which laid the groundwork for this transition and the new agenda .
Controlling population has become an ugly obsession that has spawned all sorts of perverse and twisted social objectives .
The so - called " Population Bomb " was touted as a threat to our very survival .
We had to bring our rate of population growth to zero ( or less ) or we were doomed , according to the propaganda , because there were n't enough resources left to provide for all of us .
Hand in hand with the zero population agenda was the agenda to end all economic progress .
Now this is key :
One of the most influential figures promoting stringent population control measures , Paul Ehrlich ( author of The Population Bomb ) , also urged that , in order to restore a " quality environment " in North America , the U.S. must be " de - developed " — that is , " bringing our economic system ( especially patterns of consumption ) into line with the realities of ecology and the world resource situation . "
( Does this sound a bit like " Cap and Trade " ? )
Who else can you think of who is in favor of de-development .
Does the name John Holdren ( Obama 's science czar , and another fierce population control advocate ) ring a bell ?
Ehrlich goes on to say that " This campaign ( for de- development ) would be largely political , especially with regard to our overexploitation of world resources , but the campaign should be strongly supplemented by legal and boycott actions against polluters and others whose activities damage the environment . "
The de-development strategy also , of course , funneled money into minority neighborhoods for " family planning " clinics where this " social service " as the family planning clinics would like you to believe , included forced sterilizations .
America became the chief exporter of population control programs , and , as advised in the NSSM 200 report , tied economic aid to a country 's willingness to accept population control programs that included contraception , abortion , and sterilization .
It is reprehensible how many poor women were baited with a few dollars to have their tubes tied .
It is reprehensible that people in need of aid , especially in a natural disaster , are faced with the agonizing choice of sacrificing their moral convictions for much needed emergency aid , or holding fast to them , and suffering disease , starvation , and death as a godless world turns its cold back on them .
Here at home , the Roe v.
Wade decision has resulted now in some 50 million abortion deaths .
In some other countries , the percentages are much higher , with , in some cases , 30 - 50 % of all pregnancies resulting in abortion .
In Europe , Japan , Russia , Thailand , and here in the US , along with a significant number of other countries , we are beginning to see the poisonous fruit of the culture of death they have created with their propaganda as they now face the prospect of demographic suicide in those countries .
How do you suppose our leaders will deal with the imbalance of young to old people in this country ?
Well , in 1987 , the director of the population think tank called the Hastings Institute , Daniel Callahan , suggested , in a book called Setting Limits , that the government must aggressively promote euthanasia and the " right to die " .
As the EIR report described it , he claimed that human beings have a natural lifespan of approximately 75 years , and that the government should not spend one penny on any life - extending medical treatment for people over that age .
As EIR reports , " Callahan justified his homicidal mania on two grounds : the " philosophical " grounds that man should be content with dying at the age of 75 or so , and the other , that the growing disproportion of elderly to young people in the United States necessitated draconian cutbacks in medical treatment of the aging !...
In other words … the aborting of [ 50 million ] potential young Americans over the last [ 36 years ] has led to a situation in which it became " necessary " to kill off the elderly ! " ( EIR Special Report , page 9 ) .
Remember , this report was written in 1992 , 17 years ago .
Thus , we have the drive to ram through a health care bill that will ration health care to the elderly .
Since it is financially unsustainable , any promises they make about not rationing will be empty .
There are already bureaucrats in place ( appointees of this administration , and paid for by Stimulus money ) who are rationing our health care .
Medicare is already way beyond any private insurance company with respect to what sort of treatments they deny payment for .
Cut $ 500 billion from the funds available to pay for geriatric healthcare , and you have a situation where people will be receiving far less treatment than they did before .
It is easy for us to fall into the trap of believing that overpopulation is the problem , and population control the answer .
The world is in turmoil .
It feels like it 's about to explode .
We are inundated with gangs and murderous atrocities , we 've seen a horrendous increase in unwed pregnancies , children growing up without proper guidance , raised in the tender mercies of the nanny state , most ending up in trouble with the law .
Our relations with other countries are strained with starving people in third world countries , genocide , war , terrorism .
But is population the problem ?
No .
It is government policies that have created this situation , both at home and abroad .
Contraception and Roe v.
Wade created the out of wedlock pregnancy problem in America , which caused the crime problem and the 9 trillion dollar welfare problem .
( Contraception and abortion provide the delusion of risk - free sex , which leads to risky behavior , which leads to more pregnancies .
But the reality of pregnancy and the abhorrence for abortion most women feel when actually faced with the decision , and society 's destigmatization of out - of - wedlock pregnancy , have given rise to an increase in children born out of wedlock . )
Since most of these kids will grow up without a father , and consequently in poverty , most will get into unlawful activity .
Illegal immigration has caused a significant increase in violent crime , in addition .
The government , of course , knows all this .
They have the Moynihan report , among others , to point it out to them .
But our government seems to want to foment social discord , perhaps as an antidote to charity , which would enhance civil society , rather than de -develop it .
But the government seems also to have a vested interest in encouraging sexual activity out of wedlock : it is the most powerful weapon against Christianity , which teaches chastity and family values .
Would it surprise us to learn that at a recent meeting between a number of population control NGO's ( in which pro-life participation was shut out ) , the issue of the obstacle that religion ( read Catholic religion ) played in resisting the population control measures came up .
The question arose of how they might combat the influence of religion .
The response was to encourage young people to become sexually active .
This is done through sex ed courses , and a generous provision of birth control measures .
Once young people engage in sexual activity , their consciences are scorched , and often religious values are abandoned .
So you see , our government here at home knows that teaching abstinence actually does discourage premarital sex , but that would interfere with the anti-life , anti-family , pro-environmentalist attitude they wish to instill .
Otherwise the young people might actually recognize that the healthcare bill , and the Cap and Trade legislation are both aimed at the same goal : Absolute control over you and all other resources .
In essence , they want us all to churn their butter , while they lap up the cream .
The Population Bomb is a myth .
The Population Research Institute , The Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute* , Human Life International , all concur that " overpopulation " is a myth devised by global elites to keep for themselves and their use , the natural and mineral resources of the world .
So what is the answer .
Christians know .
We need to stop killing our children .
We need to restore a culture of life .
We need to help those in need , not kill them off .
Abstinence education , and natural family planning will help encourage healthy families without sacrificing human dignity and morality .
Education can create useful citizens instead of " useless eaters " as they are called .
America can lead the way , if her people wake up and recognize that this evil has grown out of a lie , an insidious anti-life agenda which , by propaganda , became internalized in the collective conscience of our nation .
It has to end .
Abortion must end .
Assisted suicide ( which will inevitably give rise to euthanasia ) must end .
We must stop it here , and we must stop promoting it abroad .
It is a gross violation of the rights and dignity of human beings .
It is a denial of God .
It is a rejection of charity in the most brutal , evil way possible .
There can be no excuse for it .
Our political leaders in both parties have countenanced this obscene agenda .
The division in this country is not between the Republican Party and the Democrat Party .
The division within the Republican Party is not between " right wing extremists " and more sane , sensible centrists .
The division is between those who support the global government , and all its evil designs , and the ones who respect our own Constitution , and , yes , who recognize and embrace our Christian moral law as the foundation upon which this country 's laws arose .
The Republican Party needs to recognize that we ( the people ) cannot compromise on the moral principles of our tradition and history .
We cannot survive as a nation , as a people , if we accept that compromise .
Our present circumstances prove that .
So as Conservatives , we will not vote for you anymore .
We wo n't take the lesser of two evils anymore .
We will vote for the guy that says America is a sovereign , Christian nation , and who will take an oath to defend her and mean it .
And we 'll vote for the guy who will reinstall , if you will , her original operating system , and be very careful what sort of software s/he uploads , careful to quarantine and eliminate whatever viruses may be embedded in that software .
Our new leaders will be men and women who will restore Truth , Justice , and the American Way .
We 'll have American Heritage Programs at school again .
We 'll have a Christmas pageant .
We 'll remember our honored dead and our wounded living , and we 'll fight the right battles for the defense of our country .
We 'll honor our elderly , we 'll teach our youth right from wrong , good from evil .
We 'll not just be a proud nation , but a good nation again .
But only if we repent of this evil we have done , and turn back to the Living God , who is all forgiving to those who fear Him .
" Without Me , you can do nothing , " the Lord says .
Well , certainly without Him , we can do nothing good .
So what will we choose ?
Evil ?
Death ?
Exploitation ?
Slavery ?
Or will we choose Truth , virtue , life and liberty ?
This is our nation 's moment of truth .
Do we perish as a nation , or will we be " born again . "
Those words have never been more poignant in our history .
Therefore , choose life , not just for yourself , but for all those who will come after .
We must stand our ground without wavering .
If not , we will perish .

For years , government officials have urged people to protect their Social Security numbers by giving out the nine - digit codes only when absolutely necessary .
Now it turns out that all the caution in the world may not be enough :
New research shows that Social Security numbers can be predicted from publicly available birth information with a surprising degree of accuracy .
By analyzing a public data set called the " Death Master File , " which contains SSNs and birth information for people who have died , computer scientists from Carnegie Mellon University discovered distinct patterns in how the numbers are assigned .
In many cases , knowing the date and state of an individual 's birth was enough to predict a person 's SSN .
" We did n’t break any secret code or hack into an undisclosed data set , " said privacy expert Alessandro Acquisti , co-author of the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We used only publicly available information , and that ’s why our result is of value .
It shows that you can take personal information that ’s not sensitive , like birth date , and combine it with other publicly available data to come up with something very sensitive and confidential . "
With just two attempts , the researchers correctly guessed the first five digits of SSNs for 60 percent of deceased Americans born between 1989 and 2003 .
With fewer than 1,000 attempts , they could identify the entire nine digits for 8.5 percent of the group .
There 's only a few short steps between making a statistical prediction about a person 's SSN and verifying their actual number , Acquisti said .
Through a process called " tumbling , " hackers can exploit instant online credit approval services — or even the Social Security Administration 's own verification database — to test multiple numbers until they find the right one .
Although these services usually block users after several failed attempts , criminals can use networks of compromised computers called botnets to scan thousands of numbers at a time .
" A botnet can be programmed to try variations of a Social Security number to apply for an instant credit card , " Acquisti said .
" In 60 seconds , these services tell you whether you are approved or not , so they can be abused to tell whether you 've hit the right social security number . "
To keep identity thieves from exploiting their research , the scientists left a few key details about their method out of the paper , and they released the document to government agencies before making it public .
After developing an algorithm using the Death Master File , the researchers tested their results using information on birthday and hometown taken from a social networking site ( the researchers declined to say which one ) .
Again , they were able to predict Social Security numbers with a high degree of accuracy .
" It worked a little worse in the online social test for obvious reasons , " Acquisti said .
" Some people may not reveal the right date of birth , or they may call hometown where they went to high school , not where they were born .
There 's more noise in online social networking , but nevertheless the two studies confirmed each other . "
It also turns out that some SSNs are easier to predict than others .
Because of the way numbers are assigned , younger people and those born in less populated states are more at risk , Acquisti said .
Before 1988 , many people did n't apply for an SSN until they left for college or got their first job .
But thanks to an anti-fraud effort in 1988 called the " Enumeration at Birth " initiative , parents started applying for their child 's number at birth , making it much easier to predict based on a person 's birthday .
The new findings remind consumers that they should use caution when sharing data online , even when the information itself does n't seem particularly sensitive .
But Acquisti said his real message is for policymakers .
" We really wanted to come public with this result because the issue goes way beyond individual response , " he said .
" It ’s not just about remembering to shred your documents or to remove personal identification off your mail .
As much as you try to protect your personal info , the info is already out there . "
According to information privacy experts , Social Security numbers were never meant to be used for authentication purposes , and using them as passwords puts all consumers at risk for identity theft .
" I have long argued that Congress or the Federal Trade Commission should prohibit companies from using SSNs as a means to verify identity , " Daniel J. Solove , professor of law at George Washington University Law School , wrote in an e-mail .
" Merely protecting against their disclosure is insufficient since Acquisti and Gross demonstrate that they can readily be predicted . "
As a first step , the researchers suggest that the Social Security Administration start randomizing the assignment of SSNs .
But randomization is only a Band - Aid , Acquisti said .
" It can buy us more time , but it is n’t going to change the underlying problem , " he said .
" These numbers are supposed to be secret , but your bank has it , your insurance company has it , even your doctor has it .
As long as we rely on numbers that are used as both identifiers and authenticators , then we are a system that remains insecure . "
Privacy law expert Chris Hoofnagle of the University of California , Berkeley , says the response must be drastic .
" Their paper points to a radical solution : Perhaps we should stop trying to protect the secrecy of the SSN , and just publish all of them to prevent their use as passwords . "

Only five months later did the Government produce revised figures to show that , with the new target , the benefits would now be nearly ten times greater than its original estimate , at over £ 1 trillion - while the costs had now only doubled , to a total over 40 years of up to £ 734 billion ( or £ 18 billion a year ) .
The MPs had of course not known this when they voted for the amended Bill but at least the Government now had figures showing that the benefits exceeded the costs .
Even so , short of some unimaginable technological revolution , such a target could not possibly be achieved without shutting down almost the whole of our industrialised economy , changing our way of life out of recognition .

Out of his 5 - year voyage on the HMS Beagle , Charles Darwin only spent 5 weeks at the Galapagos Islands .
However , he left the islands with the discovery of a lifetime .
While observing the island ’s flora and fauna , Darwin noticed the difference in local finches ’ beaks depending on the environment and food source of each island .
Later on , the English naturalist used this observation as a basis for the theory of evolution presented in ‘ On the Origin of the Species . ’
Isla Santa Cruz houses the largest human population in the Galapagos Islands .

PARIS , France —
The men and women who committed suicide while employed by communications giant France Telecom sent a clear message in the letters they left behind :
They unequivocally blame the company for their demise .
The deaths have provoked outrage over the firm ’s management practices and have led to the resignation of the company ’s deputy CEO .
In a note to his wife and children , a 51 - year - old father of two said it was “ the climate ” at the call center where he worked that drove him to take a fatal jump from a highway overpass .
He became the latest and the 24th employee since February 2008 to end his life .
His death prompted the company to rescind a policy of systematically moving staff to new posts every three years .
One worker this summer wrote about the company ’s “ lack of training ” and “ management by terror ” in his note , stating his inability to further cope with the job as the reason for ending his life .
An email message sent by a 32 - year - old woman to her father before she jumped from a fifth - floor window at work said she was committing suicide because she did n’t want to work with a new boss .
She reportedly had been undergoing treatment for depression for the last five years .
“ I can't accept the new reorganization in my department .
I 'm getting a new boss and I 'd rather die , ” said the message addressed to her father in September and later published by the magazine Paris Match .
“ I 'm leaving my handbag with my mobiles and keys in the office , but I 'll take my donor card with me , you never know . ”
Workplace suicides are not without precedent in France as they have been known to occur for the last dozen or so years , said Christophe Dejours , a psychiatrist and occupational health expert with 30 years of experience who has studied the phenomenon .
Automakers Peugeot and Renault experienced a similar period of employee deaths blamed on job stress a few years ago .
But Dejours said what he has noted is a progression toward a more violent reaction to work - related pressures .
“ Suicides and violence are appearing more than in the past ” as a form of expression of how the relationship to work is changing , he said , also citing labor demonstrations that become violent as further proof .
Just this Tuesday , as the company works on implementing better social policies and repairing the damage to its reputation , a 50 - year - old employee showed up to work with a rifle to settle a dispute with his manager .
The man was disarmed and no one was hurt in the incident Tuesday in northwestern France , according to Le Parisien , citing union sources and the firm ’s management .
A labor union official said the man , who is a well - regarded worker , was under a lot of stress and the gun was not loaded .
A France Telecom spokesman said the man has apologized and the company will not be filing charges .
The man was placed on leave until Oct. 18 .
A key factor in the deterioration of the working conditions at France Telecom , Dejours said , was the introduction of individual , performance - based evaluations as part of the company ’s modus operandi following its restructuring .
The government - owned monopoly became a predominately private - owned company in 2004 and has had to cut costs while remaining competitive .
France Telecom , which has about 100,000 employees , has shed about 22,000 jobs in two years , leaving those who remain to pick up the slack .
Employees have cited “ moral harassment ” as one tactic used to pressure workers who are unable to adapt to quit .
Job descriptions change at a frenetic pace and workers have complained of being constantly supervised .
Employees are working more and more , giving more of themselves and are not seeing recognition for their efforts , said Dejours , the psychiatrist .
A letter from the firm ’s chief executive , Didier Lombard , to shareholders in April said the company added 12 million new customers in 2008 , bringing the total number to 182 million worldwide .
The letter said that the company had met all of its objectives for the year confirming that it was “ equipped to withstand the impact of a very unstable environment . ”
But at what price ?
“ When we measure performance , we do n’t measure the work , ” Dejours said .
“ We measure results . "
Furthermore , an atmosphere where people formerly worked in teams and relied on each other for support has become an isolating place where people have had to adopt an attitude of “ every man for himself , ” a shift that can lead to fear , mistrust and backstabbing among employees .
“ Now , what you have is more competition among workers , ” Dejours said .
“ When an evaluation is linked to sanctions , whether positive or negative , this leads very quickly to people turning on each other . ”
Respect and all forms of solidarity are destroyed , Dejours said , and everyone is left alone to confront the pressures , big and small .
When a person feels harassed at work , he is less likely to confide in colleagues or seek help .
“ It is a kind of great loneliness that settles in the workplace , " he said .
Labor union representatives have called for two days of strikes this week and , along with several Socialist party members , for Lombard to resign .
Instead , he accepted the resignation Monday of his deputy , Louis - Pierre Wenes , credited with being the architect of the changes that led to the stress in the first place .
Stephane Richard , previously an aide to the finance minister , Christine Lagarde , was named as Wenes ’ replacement , according to a brief company statement .
The move was called a step in the right direction by the some and symbolic by others .
Lombard , who met with Lagarde last week and has the government ’s full support , has promised to freeze job transfers , review personnel policies and offer more counseling to employees .
He seemed to have learned from an earlier misstep of calling the rash of suicides a “ fad ” and distancing the company from any responsibility .
Dejours said it was possible for the company to change the work climate and prevent more tragedies by understanding why employees were taking their own lives and adopting changes instead of simply encouraging people to “ take deep breaths ” to relieve stress .
Instead of sweeping the matter under rug , the company would benefit from frank discussions with those left behind and a recognition that they may be more fragile , especially as suicide becomes part of the banality of everyday work life or is seen something that could happen to anyone .
“ After a series of suicides , we ca n’t just remove the corpse and do nothing , ” he said .
Have n't bought a Kindle 2 yet ?
Good .
Amazon.com , which knocked the price of its e-book reader down by $ 60 only last July , has cut it by another forty bucks .
You can now buy one for $ 259 -- and while that may not be a magic price point , it 's a lot more tempting than the $ 400 that the original Kindle cost when it debuted a couple of years ago .
The big Kindle DX , with its 9.7 - inch screen , remains a pricey $ 489 .
The price cut may be in part a reaction to Sony 's renewed vigor as a Kindle competitor , although the Kindle was already a deal by comparison to any of Sony 's models .
( The cheapest Sony is $ 199 but has a smaller screen than the Kindle and no wireless ; the wireless Sony costs $ 399 . )
More intriguingly , Amazon has added a $ 279 variant that uses a GSM radio to let you download content in a hundred countries around the world .
( In the U.S. , it 's powered by AT&T ; other Kindles use Sprint 's network . )
You pay a $ 1.99 surcharge to download books outside the U.S. ( reasonable enough ) and the same free to download a single issue of a magazine ( pricey ! ) .
Amazon is taking pre-orders now says the new version will ship on October 19 .
Folks in many countries outside the U.S. can buy this model , but Amazon has n't truly internationalized the Kindle : Non-U.S. buyers apparently have to order their readers from the U.S. , and get a device with an interface and content in English , with a U.S. wall adapter .
One presumes that now that Amazon has engineered a GSM electronic reader , we 'll see it start to roll out some truly localized versions in other countries before long .

Mastering Human Relationships
The most important and the most highly paid form of intelligence in America is social intelligence , the ability to get along well with other people .
Fully 85 percent of your success in life is going to be determined by your social skills , by your ability to interact positively and effectively with others and to get them to cooperate with you in helping you to achieve your goals .
Learning how to develop and maintain superior human relationships can do more for your career and for your personal life than perhaps anything else you can accomplish .
The bad news is that the inability to get along with others is the primary reason for failure , frustration and unhappiness in life and work .
According to one study , more the 95 percent of men and women let go from their jobs over a ten year period were fired because of poor social skills rather than lack of competence or technical ability .
According to psychologist Sydney Jourard , most of your joy in life comes from your happy relationships with other people , and most of your problems in life come from unhappy relationships with them .
Most of your problems in life are people problems .
Fortunately , you can become extremely skilled at getting along with others , and in this chapter , you will learn how .
You ’ll learn a variety of proven methods to immediately improve your relationships with virtually anyone , under almost any circumstances .
The Law of Indirect Efforts
The Law of Indirect Effort states that you get almost everything in your relationships with others more easily by approaching them indirectly rather than directly .
For example , if you want to impress people , the direct way of going about it is to try to convince them of your admirable qualities and accomplishments .
But trying to impress another person by talking about yourself usually makes you feel a little foolish , and sometimes embarrassed .
The indirect way of impressing another person ; however , is simply to be impressed by the other person .
The more you are impressed by the other person , by who he or she is , or what he or she has accomplished , the more likely it is that the other person will be impressed by you .
If you want to get someone interested in you , the direct way is to tell him or her all about yourself .
But the indirect way works better .
It is simply to become interested in him or her .
The more interested you become in another person , the more likely it is that the other person will become interested in you .
If you want to be happy , the direct way is to do whatever you can think of that will make you happy .
However , the most enjoyable and lasting form of happiness comes from making someone else happy .
By the Law of Indirect Effort , whenever you do or say anything that makes someone else happy , you feel happy yourself .
You boost your own spirits , your own self - esteem .
How do you get another person to respect you ?
The best way is to respect him or her .
When you express respect or admiration for another person , he or she feels respect and admiration for you .
In human relations , we call this the Principle of Reciprocity .
Whenever you do something nice for someone else , the other person will want to reciprocate by doing something nice for you .
Most of our romances and friendships are based on this principle .
How do you get a person to believe in you , given the Law of Indirect Effort ?
The answer is to believe in him or her .
Whenever you show that you believe or have confidence in another person , he or she will tend to believe in and have confidence in you .
You get what you give .
What you send out , you get back .
Applying the Law of Indirect Effort
The most important applications of the Law of Indirect Effort have to do with developing a healthy personality in yourself .
You are structured in such a way that everything you do to another person has a reciprocal effect on yourself .
Everything you do to raise the self - esteem of another person raises your own self - esteem at the same time , and in the same measure .
Since self - esteem is the hallmark of the healthy personality , you can actually improve the health of your own personality by taking every opportunity to improve the health of the personalities of others .
What you sow in the lives of others , you reap in your own life .
Everyone you meet is carrying a heavy load .
This is most true in the area of self - esteem and self - confidence .
Everyone grows up with a feeling of inferiority and throughout most of our lives we need to be praised and recognized by others .
No matter how successful or how elevated people may become , they still need their self - images reinforced .
There is a line that says , “ I like you because of the way I feel about myself when I am with you . ”
This line contains the key to excellent human relations .
The most happy men and women are those who make other people feel good about themselves when they are with them .
When you go through life raising the self - esteem of others , opportunities will open up successful and before you , and people will help you in ways you can not now imagine .
Practice the Law of Indirect Effort .
Take every opportunity to say and do things that make people feel more valuable .
Each time you express a kindness toward another person , your own self - esteem improves .
Your own personality becomes more positive and healthy .
You impress into your own mind whatever you express toward someone else .
Make Others Feel Important
The key to raising the self - esteem of others , using the Law of Indirect Effort , is simply to make others feel important .
Everything you do or say that makes another feel more important boosts his or her self - esteem at the same time .
When you go throughout your day looking for ways to make others feel important you will be popular and welcome everywhere .
You will be healthier and happier and get more real satisfaction from life than others do .
You will have lower levels of stress and higher levels of energy .
Above all , you will genuinely like and respect yourself more and experience greater peace of mind .

Alan Grayson Money Bomb Nets $ 500k
Freshman Congressman Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) just raked in half a million dollars on a non-election year money bomb .
The fundraising effort was coordinated through ActBlue , and demonstrates the truth behind the ancient Latin proverb : fortune favors the bold .
“ The Republican health care plan is simple : Do n’t get sick .
The Republicans also have a backup plan .
If you do get sick , die quickly . ”
Grayson recently became famous in American politics , particularly for his bold condemnation of Republican obstruction to health care reform .
However , the first term Florida Democrat from the Orlando area has also done important work fighting against Iraq War profiteering and fighting for transparency in the Federal Reserve .
His work in the Whistleblower Cases led a Wall Street Journal reporter to describe Grayson as “ waging a one - man war against contractor fraud in Iraq . ”
Grayson ’s direct style has come to the forefront during a couple hearings on Fed transparency , including exchanges with Federal Reserve System Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and Elizabeth A. Coleman [ video ] , the Inspector General for the Federal Reserve System .
He is also one of the people behind the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 , which would audit the Federal Reserve .
Despite the progress he has made , or perhaps because of it , he has gained a number of critics in the GOP , beltway , and media .
Some opinion pieces have tried to cast Grayson as the left ’s version of a wingnut like Michele Bachmann .
There was an opinion piece in the New York Times that called him the ‘ liberals problem child . ’
However , his blunt manner seems to have revitalized the progressive movement , which had lost some steam since the inauguration of President Obama last January .
While many seemed worried that the ideals of change and reform were losing out to pragmatism and appeasement , Grayson has energized the progressives that were instrumental in the 2006 and 2008 election victories for Democrats .
Grayson explained the reason for the money bomb on the Huffington Post :
“ I became the Republican ’s # 1 target to defeat next year .
D.C. election forecasters , like Charlie Cook , downgraded my re-election chances , which is a signal to corporate interests to go after me .
And Bill O’Reilly began obsessing over me , even going as far as sending Fox News stalker specialist , Griff Jenkins , to wait outside my office all evening last Wednesday .
I scare them .
More accurately , you scare them .
Progressives standing up for what we believe and not backing down when our beliefs get challenged . ”
To this end , a new website has been set up .
The $ 500,000 raised in one day exceeded expectations and suggests that the progressive movement is still gaining ground .
According to DownWithTyranny :
“ In the 2006 cycle the candidate who attracted the most support from Blue America donors was Ned Lamont , with his campaign that served notice on the Democratic Establishment that the grassroots was unwilling to just eat up whatever crap it was served up from Inside the Beltway hacks .
Blue America raised over $ 77,000 for him in our first year in action .
The following cycle , saw another inspiring progressive primary challenger , Donna Edwards , attract the most donors and the largest amount ( almost $ 65,000 ) .
It may be too early to tell but it looks like 2010 cycle will mark the year of Alan Grayson . ”
There have been numerous criticisms of the Democrats over - eagerness to compromise for many years .
However , the end result of Grayson ’s money bomb might be to confirm the words of Basil King : “ Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid . ”
The current tally of the money bomb can be found below .

In defense of the emerging freelance economy
As technology becomes cheaper and more powerful , an entrepreneur can have a very profitable business without having any employees .
This has always been true for many professionals , but now it applies to many more people .
For example , many lawyers had to rely upon secretaries in the past .
Yet now you can learn how to use a powerful word processing program and there ’s no need for staff .
With today ’s tough economic conditions , it ’s likely this trend is accelerating , as many people are finding ways to pay the bills by offering up their services on an independent contractor basis in lieu of finding a new job .
As pointed out in Forbes , this new trend is making it more difficult to get accurate employment statistics .
Steinberg works 30 to 40 hours a week .
But along with millions of other contractors , she may not show up on the radar of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , which compiles unemployment statistics by surveying households and counting pay stubs .
No one knows how many freelancers , part - timers and consultants there are –the Government Accountability Office took a stab in 2006 , guesstimating that the group made up 30 % of all workers –much less how many escape the notice of the BLS .
“ It ’s difficult to track , and is often misclassified or not accounted for by the Department of Labor , ” says Sarah Horowitz , director of the Freelancers Union in Brooklyn , N.Y .
One thing is certain :
The shape of the so - called informal economy is changing .
For some , this obviously involves unreported income , yet I suspect that ’s not true for most of the new entrepreneurs .
Many of them want to work at home , do something they love or want the freedom of being their own boss .
In many cases they are selling goods and services that are n’t purchased on a cash basis , so hiding income really is n’t an option .
Also , many people want to have a legitimate business that they can grow , and worrying about hiding income from the IRS is not part of the plan .
Some like Scott Shane are concerned by this trend .
Myth :
The total number of businesses created is what matters , not the types of businesses that are being created .
Reality : I ’ve noticed a disturbing trend in what entrepreneurship in America is becoming .
Over the past decade , we have been creating more non-employer businesses and fewer employer businesses per capita .
( Employer businesses are companies that the Census Bureau reports have at least one employee ; non-employer businesses have no employees . )
As a result , the employer business share of the total businesses has slipped four percentage points since 1997 , from 26.4 % of the total in 1997 to 22.4 % in 2007 ( see figure to the right ) .
Moreover , there is nothing in the data to suggest that this trend is going to reverse itself anytime soon .
Why am I concerned about this trend ?
Non-employer businesses are n’t the source of job or wealth creation that employer businesses are , which means the U.S. economy does n’t benefit as much from them .
By definition , non-employer businesses do n’t create any jobs , and their sales and profits are quite low .
So low , in fact , that the Census Bureau ’s 2002 Survey of Business Owners indicated that only 44 % of non-employer businesses were the primary source of income for their owners .
To boot , non-employer businesses ’ are becoming less substantial over time .
According to Census data , the average revenues at these firms have declined about 12 % in real terms since 2000 , when they were less than $ 50,000 per year to begin with .
Of course you ’d rather have businesses that hire plenty of employees , but that does n’t mean one - person operations do n’t have a net positive effect on the economy .
First , it provides a lucrative and appealing option for many people .
It offers them a lifestyle that they might not be able to achieve working for a company , and it allows many to do something they love as well .
That ’s a good thing .
Also , these small business offer services that other companies value .
In many instances they can offer better services for a better price as they do n’t have overhead and can be very efficient with today ’s technology .
Again , more efficiency helps the overall economy and lowers prices for everyone .
Small operations also unleash creativity , as people working for themselves are very motivated and are n’t constrained by the bureaucracy of a larger organization .
Imagine where the Internet would be today without these types of entrepreneurs .
Finally , some of these one - person operations will grow and perhaps lead to larger companies with employees , or at least relationships with other service providers .
We should focus on measuring this trend better , but in many ways this can be a net plus for the growth of a modern , dynamic economy .

[ As usual , click it to embiggen . ]
Very pretty !
This image is a composite of five separate images taken with two cameras ( PACS and SPIRE ) , which together cover a wavelength range of light of 70 out to 500 microns -- and , bearing in mind the reddest wavelength the human eye can see is about 0.8 microns , you can see that this is way , way out in the infrared .
What you 're seeing here are cold dust clouds in the constellation of Crux , the Southern Cross .
It was thought these regions would be fairly smooth on these scales , but Herschel is revealing that in fact they 're pretty turbulent .
You can see ribbons and filaments of material here , caused by stars forming deep in these dense clouds .
You can the odd proplyd or two ; small ( well , much bigger than our solar system but small - looking here ) disks of matter , very dense clouds with stars forming in their cores .
Proplyd is short for protoplanetary disks , because these structures are in the process of forming solar systems much like ours .
And you can also see long fingers of material ; towers of matter where newly - born stars are eroding and blowing away the dust with their stellar winds .
In a sense , these are like cosmic sandbars , material being sculpted by fluids flowing past them .
Star formation can take place in such thickly - choked regions , but visible light cannot penetrate them ; even to Hubble this would be dark material and we could only see the very surface of these clouds .
But Herschel sees the kind of infrared light that passes right through the dust , so astronomers can look into the hearts of these areas and learn about star formation .
We know quite a bit already , but there are still gaps in our knowledge because these clouds are so thick and difficult to study .
With Herschel now on the prowl , we can expect to find out a lot about how stars are born ... and also to see more pretty images like this one .

If you have ever visited a blog or on - line discussion group on the Middle East you have doubtless had the misfortune to run into them .
[ or if you spend some time in the comments section of this seemingly extra popular PooTube video here :

where a fierce and fascinating international argument has been raging unabated since Israel killed 1,500 people with military and chemical weapons at the start of this year
– then you can see for yourself the desperate and unpleasant lengths these # %@ks will go to – to try and polish the inhuman turd that is Israeli Foreign Policy ]
They are known by the language they use : depraved sexual insults , bile , bigotry , threats , disinformation and character assassination .
That ’s right : I ’m talking about “ hasbarats , ” zionist trolls who infect the Internet with hasbara , pro-Israel propaganda .
Of course , mainstream media hasbarats have been around for decades , as have “ hasbaratchiks , ” fifth - columns in foreign governments who subvert national policies to serve Israel .
The Internet , though , is the latest , some might say the greatest , propaganda playground , and Israel cannot cope with factual , passionate , well - documented stories that expose its war crimes and unrepentant criminality .
If you ’ve come across a hasbarat , on - line or otherwise , you have learned that no amount of reasoned argument or intellectual maturity has any effect .
That ’s because hasbarats do n’t care if they come across as ignorant , obnoxious , nasty or inane .
All that matters for them is sabotaging criticism of Israel and support for Muslims .
They ’re like anti-intellectual stink bombs : designed to cause maximum discomfort but have little if any real power .
This deliberate proliferation of on - line hasbarats raises two points .
The first concerns why anyone would spend hours a day to prostitute themselves for Israel .
Money , of course .
Ilan Shturman , deputy director of the Israeli foreign ministry ’s hasbara department (! ) , told an Israeli business newspaper in July that US $ 150,000 had been allocated for the first stage of a campaign to seed the Internet with hasbarats :
“ Our people will not say : ‘ Hello , I am from the hasbara department of the Israeli foreign ministry and I want to tell you the following . ’
Nor will they necessarily identify themselves as Israelis .
They will speak as net - surfers and as citizens , and will write responses that will look personal but will be based on a prepared list of messages that the foreign ministry developed . ”
The second point is why Israel felt it had to resort to intellectual fraud on an international scale .
The Internet has shown that Israel is a failed oppressor state that commits crimes against humanity as a matter of policy .
The last straw for many was “ Operation Cast Lead , ” an act of such unspeakable unapologetic sadism that allusions to Nazi Germany are entirely appropriate .
Every day , it seems , the mythic foundations of Israel ’s legitimacy — the holocaust , Jewish victimhood , Jewish “ people , ” Israeli “ democracy , ” “ evil ” Muslims — are exposed for all to see .
In January , Amir Gissin , Israel ’s consul - general in Toronto , sent out a hasbara recruitment letter , which read in part : “ If you are frustrated or concerned with the portrayal of Israel in Canadian News and with biased [ sic ] depictions , your voice can be heard .
Now , think that you ’re not alone 10,000 voices like yours can respond every day : praise , protest , inform , correct on leading Canadian news websites , in real time , effectively . ”
The weakness with this tactic , as you probably figured out , is that hasbarats will inevitably shout and whine themselves into irrelevance .
Eventually , intelligent people will tune out the zionist boilerplate , the anti-Muslim smears , and the interminable drone about the holocaust .
Already , the once - dreaded epithet “ anti-Semite ” has lost all significance , as if it ever had any , and the person who hurled it is more likely to be mocked than feared .
Two recent events demonstrate the growing desperation and ineptitude of Israel ’s propaganda industry .
Today , we look at an example of “ positive hasbara . ”
A major tactic of hasbarats is to project the illusion that Israel is a normal Western democracy , thereby taking focus away from Israel ’s mistreatment of Palestinians .
Also , countries that buy into the deceit will be unwilling to criticize Israel for fear of calling into question their role in covering up zionist war crimes .
This tactic was tried at the recent Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) as Tel Aviv was spotlighted in a City - to - City program with Toronto .
The ostensible purpose was to use an apolitical , cultural event to obscure the tyranny that Tel Aviv represents , but more than 1,000 filmmakers and performers , were n’t fooled .
They put their names to The Toronto Declaration : No Celebration of Occupation , an open letter to the TIFF that protested the co-optation of the festival by the Israeli propaganda machine .
The protest accomplished precisely what the hasbarats tried to prevent .
“ Rather than talking about Israel ’s rich cinematic culture , the buzz this week in Toronto has centered on the one thing Israeli officials had sought to avoid : the conflict with the Palestinians , ” reported the Jewish Telegraph Agency .
The hasbara campaign to ‘ re - brand ’ Israel during the Toronto International Film Festival failed miserably .
So much attention was paid to the protest that it overshadowed the political objectives of Israel ’s propaganda machine .
Another major defeat for Israel came courtesy of Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert .
After offering a knee - jerk condemnation of the City - to - City protests , he reversed himself the next day :
“ I was n’t prepared with enough facts about the events leading up to the Festival ’s decision to showcase Tel Aviv in the City - to - City section .
I [ initially ] thought of it as an innocent goodwill gesture , but now realize it was part of a deliberate plan to ‘ re - brand ’ Israel in Toronto , as a pilot for a larger such program .
The Festival should never have agreed to be used like this .
It was naïve for the plan ’s supporters to believe it would have the effect they hoped for . ”
Speaking of naïve , how about Ron Huldai , mayor of Tel Aviv !
Whether out of overconfidence or stupidity , he publicly admitted the underlying hasbara in an interview with the JTA : “ While the City to City program was initiated by the festival , the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs was involved as part of its Brand Israel media and advertising campaign , which was launched last year . ”
Quite obviously , Israel would have been better off if the hasbarats had not tried to manipulate the festival .
Even the predictable pro-Israel counterprotest merely added to the protest ’s notoriety and detracted from the cultural propaganda .
Moreover the standard claim that the protest was an attack on Israel and artistic freedom was demonstrably false .
If anything , the protest highlighted Israel ’s active suppression of Palestinian culture .
According to the authors of the Toronto Declaration :
“ Many Palestinian artists and filmmakers , denied freedom of movement by Israel ’s Occupation and pass system , are de facto boycotted , unable to communicate with their communities or travel freely .
The double standard is mind - boggling and , slowly , these are the issues we are helping to put under a spotlight . ”
Finally , it is important to note that the Declaration ’s authors succeeded without any media help .
They had no money to place ads , and no newspaper would publish their open letter .
On the other hand , hasbarats had the full support ( read : “ obedience ” ) of Canada ’s national media , and lost .
If a modest , unfunded , popular protest can effectively defeat an orchestrated propaganda campaign , what does that say about Israel ’s ability to pose as a legitimate , democratic state ?
Even though hasbarats get their disinformation out with relative ease , it is not clear that is generally accepted .

Guarding the U.S. Embassy in Kabul sounds like a high - risk , war zone job with lots of responsibility , right ?
Well , according to recent Congressional reports and an investigation by government watchdogs , it 's more like Animal House with automatic weapons .
The Project on Government Oversight yesterday fired off a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complaining of a " pervasive breakdown in the chain of command and guard force discipline and morale " in the contracted security force at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul .
But that 's putting it politely .
According to evidence compiled by POGO , the misbehavior by guards includes " peeing on people , eating potato chips out of ass cracks , vodka shots out of ass cracks " and other fratboy - style antics .
An e-mail from a whistleblower – posted on the POGO website – spells it out .
" You will see that they have a group of sexual predators , deviants running rampant over there , " the whistleblower wrote .
" No , they are not jamming guys in the ass per say [ sic ] , but they are showing poor judgenment [ sic ] . "
Guards were also kind enough to provide photo evidence , which POGO released to Gawker .
It 's not the first time that investigators have raised questions about the management of embassy security in Kabul .
In Senate testimony last year , William Moser , deputy assistant secretary of State for logistics management , conceded that there were " deficiencies in personnel , training , equipment , and performance " by security contractors .
Security for the Embassy in Kabul is provided by ArmorGroup North America , now owned by Wackenhut Services ; the previous contract , held by MVM , was cancelled due to poor performance .
It 's yet another black eye for the private security industry – but it raises even bigger questions about the Department of State 's ability to manage and monitor its hired guns .
After the jump , another image ( semi - NSFW ) , and the State Department 's lame response .
Update : Allegations of poor contractor performance surfaced over two years ago .
For laughs , read the transcript of yesterday 's State Department briefing , in which spokesman Ian Kelly struggles to explain why the department has failed to take serious action , despite repeat warnings .
A few excerpts from the press conference really are eye - opening :
" QUESTION : If I might , I ’d like to quote from a letter from the State Department to the contractor in June of 2007 .
So this was two years ago that you recognized that some of these deficiencies exist and you said these deficiencies endanger the performance of the contract to such a degree that the security of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is in jeopardy , and that you threatened to terminate the contract .
Yet over the last two years , there are about 11 letters that have been released not just by the project , but by Senator [ Claire ] McCaskill ’s office , who is in charge of the Subcommittee on Government Oversight , that you continued to warn the contractor about these deficiencies and that you said that the security of the Embassy is in jeopardy , yet why did you continue to extend the contract ?
MR .
KELLY : Well , as I say , these are serious allegations .
What you just read me , I would – I think they ’re very serious too .
* QUESTION : These are n’t allegations .
These are your own words .
These are your own words .
* [... ]
** QUESTION : But over the last two years , you ’ve been continuing to warn this contractor about its performance .
So does it take an independent nongovernment organization to cast light on what you ’ve been kind of overlooking for the last two years ?
MR. KELLY : Yeah .
I mean , look , as I understand it , we have – we ’ve been investigating this organization for some time now .
We understand that we have made some – we have pointed out to them some of the deficiencies .
And I ca n’t answer right now from this podium exactly what they have done in response to this letter .
Well .
I guess it takes pictures of contractors ' ass cracks to get the State Department to start exercising oversight .

Richmond , California ( CNN ) --
Police investigating the gang rape of a 15 - year - old girl have arrested five people , a police spokesman said Wednesday .
Three juveniles and two adults are in custody in the rape on Saturday , said the Richmond police spokesman , Lt. Mark Gagan .
The three juveniles will be charged as adults , he said .
Gagan said the suspects will face several felony charges in the incident , including " rape in concert , " and that the suspects would all face the possibility of life in prison if convicted .
Gagan also said the victim was released from a hospital Wednesday , four days after the attack .
Authorities have described the incident as a two - and - a - half - hour assault that occurred on the Richmond High School campus , in the Richmond community north of Oakland on San Francisco Bay .
Gagan said police arrested three of the suspects Tuesday night .
They included Salvador Rodriguez , 21 , as well as a 16 - year - old and a 17 - year - old whose identities were not released because they are juveniles , he said .
A 19 - year - old , Manuel Ortega , and an unidentified 15 - year - old were arrested earlier , he said .
On Wednesday , students , teachers and area residents gathered to defend their city 's image .
Those gathered at Richmond High School witnessed " a response that is really from the heart , and also from the gut , given the mourning , the sadness , the anger that has arisen since Saturday , " Prishni Murillo , executive director of Youth Together , an area youth leadership organization , said at a news conference .
" We do not want this incident to be an excuse to further criminalize the young people of this city , " Murillo said .
Senior Norma Bautista echoed that sentiment .
" We are not criminals , " she said .
" We come here to this school because we want [ there ] to be a change . "
Lorna McClellan , a Richmond High teacher , said it was wrong that the community was being portrayed as a place that does not stand up for victims .
" Yes , something horrible and atrocious happened on our campus , and yes , blame lies with the school officials , with the teachers , with the district , with the police , with the students were afraid to speak up .
But it 's important to realize that our community realizes this is a problem , and we are taking active steps to fix it , " McClellan said .
Gagan said Wednesday that police expect to make further arrests .
Watch a discussion with Gagan
As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lighted back alley at the school , police have said , while another 10 people watched without calling 911 to report it .
A 1999 California law makes it illegal not to report a witnessed crime against a child , but the law applies only to cases in which the child is 14 or younger .
Police have posted a $ 20,000 reward for anyone who comes to them with information that helps arrest and convict those involved in the attack .
The victim was found unconscious and " brutally assaulted " under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday , after police received a call from someone in the area who had overheard people at the assault scene talking about the incident , police said .
The girl was flown by helicopter to a hospital , where she was admitted in critical condition .
Warner Bros has banned a woman who runs a restaurant at her home in west London from hosting a Harry Potter Night to celebrate Hallowe'en .
The owner of The Underground Restaurant , who uses the pseudonym Ms Marmite Lover , regularly holds themed evenings and for her latest event she had planned a menu of food and drink enjoyed by Harry Potter and his friends in the JK Rowling stories : from dandelion wine and pumpkin soup to Dumbledore 's favourite sweets , such as mint humbugs .
Guests were to be taken down Diagon Alley ( the side of the house ) before entering and would be met by a portrait of the " Fat Lady " to whom they would have to give a password .
However , Warner Bros has written to her warning that it owns all things Harry Potter : the " name , stylised logo , the name of the characters , themes , incidents and other associated indicia from the series of ... books and films " .
The letter from the company 's legal and business department says : " Dear Ms Marmite Lover .
While we are delighted you are such a fan of the Harry Potter series , unfortunately your proposed use of the Harry Potter properties ... without our consent would amount to an infringement of Warner 's rights . "
Ms Marmite Lover has now renamed the event , as Warner Bros suggested , " Generic Wizard Night " .
The Underground restaurant is one of the first of a new trend of " pop - up restaurants " – dining experiences operated out of people 's homes and advertised via Facebook and word - of - mouth .
However , the publicity it has generated also brought it to the attention of Warner Bros .
Ms Marmite said : " I understand that you need to protect the rights but this is two dinners , one - offs , from which I am not making a profit , inspired by the books and the mentions of food in them .
My daughter is a huge fan , even an obsessive . "
Feeling the corporate might of Warner Bros is quite a surprise for the new chef .
When she hosted a Marmite night at The Underground Restaurant , with the spread included in every dish , the company was more than a little pleased .
Instead of warning her about its copyright position , it made sure she was stocked up with plenty of marmite – and all for free .
“ What we are measuring as productivity gains may in fact be changes in trade , ” said William Alterman , assistant commissioner for international prices at the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The federal agencies that compile the nation ’s statistics increasingly acknowledge that they lack the detailed data needed to calculate the impact of imported goods and services as imports rise from an insignificant 5 percent of all economic activity 35 years ago to more than 12 percent today , not counting petroleum .
As a result , many imports are valued as if they were made in the United States and therefore higher in price than their imported counterparts .
The problem is particularly acute in manufacturing .
Imported components constitute an ever greater share of the computers , autos , appliances and other finished merchandise that roll off assembly lines in the United States  and an ever greater share of all of the nation ’s imports .
But the statistical system is not yet up to the task of sorting out which components are made here , which are made overseas and the resulting impact on employment .
As Lori G. Kletzer , an economist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , put it , “ We do n’t know what jobs have been offshored . ”
The same holds for services .
An accounting firm in New York with 50 employees outsources some of its functions to less expensive accountants in India : the paperwork on an income tax return , for example .
That work comes back to New York by computer transmission and is billed at New York rates , as if it were value added in this country .
Grappling with these blind spots , nearly all of the 80 experts at the conference , which was sponsored by the Upjohn Institute and the National Academy of Public Administration , agreed that the statistics now published tend to overstate the strength of the economy .
That view was shared by those who attended from the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve , all big players in measuring economic performance .
The stated goal , among those at the conference , is to repair the statistics , but that requires several years , lots of money ( from Congress ) to gather more information about what companies are doing , and whole new procedures for measuring imports .
Much of the conference was devoted to an analysis of the gap between existing data and reality , and ways to close that gap .

( Updates number of missiles )
SEOUL , Oct 12 ( Reuters ) - North Korea has fired five short - range missiles off its east coast and declared a ‘ no sail ’ zone in the area from Oct. 10 - 20 , South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency quoted a government source as saying on Monday .
South Korean government officials were not immediately available for comment .
The latest launches , the first in about three months , come as Pyongyang has said it is ready to return to international talks on its nuclear weapons programme , though it has insisted it holds talks first with the United States .
It was not clear whether these were routine military exercises .
But they coincided with local media reports that the United States is planning to send its aircraft carrier USS George Washington to the South Korean port of Busan on Tuesday .
The reclusive North has hundreds of short - range range missiles , with the ability to strike the South Korean capital Seoul and its sprawling urban surroundings which are home to around 25 million people .
( For a factbox on North Korea ’s missile arsenal , click on [ ID : nSEO187992 ] )
A nuclear test in May and a spate of missile tests around the same time triggered a tightening of sanctions against the North , whose desperate economic straits some analysts have said are partly behind its recent attempts to get on better terms with the outside world .
A U.N. resolution bans North Korea from launching ballistic missiles , but there are no international agreements that bar it from test - launching short - range missiles .
Sellafield nuclear plant has the world 's largest store of separated plutonium
The UK 's plan to cut its stockpile of separated plutonium is in " disarray " , a group of scientists has warned .
The British Pugwash Group ( BPG ) says the way 100 tonnes of the deadly powder is being stored is " ludicrous " .
Its experts fear the stockpile at the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria - the largest in the world - could be a target for terrorists .
The government said the plutonium was stored safely and securely but recognised the need to make progress .
' Manifestly ludicrous '
The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it would consider the points raised in a forthcoming consultation .
One of the authors of the BPG report , retired general Sir Hugh Beach , said : " It 's a total absurdity that we should have 100 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting up at Sellafield in tin cans ... that is manifestly ludicrous . "
The report also said the failure of a taxpayer - funded facility to make nuclear fuel from the plutonium was " scandalous " .
It said the UK had no policy to deal with the deadly material , which was reclaimed from used nuclear fuel by reprocessing , because there are no UK reactors which can use it .
In malicious hands , the report added , it could help make a " catastrophic " nuclear weapon , and there was also the risk of a 11 September - style attack on stores , causing a radiological release .
The BPG , an international group of scientists and non-proliferation experts , is named after a 1957 conference .
As a child , I never pictured the adult " me " journeying to other planets and having a fantastic time of it .
Instead I pictured myself dying in a nuclear inferno .
The future me was a screaming skeleton decorated with chunks of carbonised flesh and the occasional sizzling hair .
Not really someone you 'd have round for dinner .
Still , at least my premonition suggested I 'd live an exciting life , albeit a short one .
The reality is less spectacular .
I never pictured myself as I was last week : a fully grown adult : alive , yet slowly losing the will to live while attempting to buy a washing machine from a high - street electrical retailer .
Let 's be clear about this .
Buying a washing machine is not the stuff dreams are made of .
It 's not a device you 're going to fall in love with .
It 's a white box with a round mouth you shove dirty pants into .
Hardly a new member of the family , unless you 're a troupe of extreme performance artists .
Buying a mobile phone is easier than buying a washing machine because some phones have the decency to look ugly , thereby simplifying the decision - making process .
Washing machines all look the same .
Some eat bigger loads or have a more complex array of pre-wash options : whoopee doo .
Some doubtless perform better than others : I would n't know .
Bet it 's all a con .
Bet there 's only one type of washing machine in the world , and they 're all shipped from the same warehouse in slightly different packaging and sold at randomly generated prices .
I buy washing machines the same way I order wine in a restaurant : avoid the very cheapest on the basis that it 'll be nasty , avoid the second cheapest on the basis that it 's probably even worse , avoid the expensive options at the top of the list on the basis that they can't possibly be worth it , and wind up randomly picking something from the middle instead .
Just to make you feel even more uncertain about buying one , they do n't have proper names .
Once you strip the familiar manufacturer trademarks away , all you 're left with is a meaningless series of model numbers chosen specifically to confuse you .
Did you order a BD4437BX or a BD3389 BZ ?
Face it : you have no idea .
Ring up to place an order and it sounds as if you 're discussing chemical weapon formulae .
This is why buying a washing machine never feels " real " .
If you walk around Battersea Dogs Home , brown - eyed puppies with names such as Timbo and Ookums softly yelp for your attention .
Walk around Comet and you 're confronted by a wall of emotionless monoliths with incomprehensible names .
And that 's just the staff !!!!!??!!!!?!
I got caught in a high - street retail delivery trap recently ; one of those Kafkaesque scenarios in which you pay for something on the basis that it will arrive at a certain time , only to find out it wo n't , and soon you 're sucked into a spiral of helpline calls and telephone keypad options and complaints and counter - complaints until eventually you realise that you 're both in a loveless relationship ; needing each other , hating hate each other , revolving for hours in a weepy embrace , listlessly kicking at one another 's shins .
But this time something new and modern happened .
Shortly after one of our bitter rows , while waiting for them to call back , I went on Twitter ( yes , bloody Twitter ) and angrily compared the Currys electrical retail chain to the Nazis .
The next day a mysterious message arrived with a number for me to call ; this turned out to belong to one of their heads of PR , who 'd spotted my outburst and tracked down my contact details .
It 's a bit embarrassing when you find yourself talking to someone high up in a company you 've loudly and publicly likened to the Third Reich only the night before .
Fortunately for me , she was polite and savvy enough not to mention it .
Instead she quickly sorted out my complaint , which is the closest I 've ever come to feeling like a VIP , or Michael Winner .
Nice for me , annoying for anyone reading about it who has n't been afforded that kind of treatment , ie , you .
Perhaps , if I was principled , I 'd have yelled " I demand to be treated as a regular customer ! " and slammed the phone down .
But I did n't .
Still , if buying a big boring box from a big boring shop is a harrowing experience , is n't it time retailers were honest about it ?
There 's no point in pretending to be fun , happy - go - lucky institutions .
We 're British .
We know the truth and we can handle it .
Dixons is running a campaign describing itself as " the last place you want to go " , which is meant to be a clever reference to its low prices ( ie , go and look at it in Harrods , then buy it from us ) , but effectively describes every electrical retail chain I 've ever visited .
Someone needs to go further and launch a chain called Shambles , where all the familiar shortcomings are actively promoted as part of the " experience " .
The staff wear ironic dunce caps and vulture costumes ; if you want to actually buy something , they walk to a stockroom 10 miles away in a neighbouring county to check its availability , methodically harass you into taking out five - year cover using a subtle combination of CIA " extraordinary rendition " psychological techniques and unashamed sulking , then arrange for it to be delivered at 7 am by a surly man who'll arrive 10 hours late on purpose , deliberately bring a BD4437BX instead of the BD3389 BZ you ordered , attach a magic hidden " hobbling " device that causes it to malfunction immediately before the next bank holiday weekend , screw your partner , scare your kids , wreck your life , and break wind on your doorstep as he 's leaving .
All of which is heavily advertised as an integral part of the service .
It 'll be miserable .
But at least you 'll enter the transaction with your eyes wide open .

Zach Mason explains how aggressive moves by the U.S. in Latin America are ratcheting up the conflict between Colombia and Venezuela .
RECURRING TENSIONS between neighboring South American countries Venezuela and Colombia have reached new heights in recent weeks .
The current conflict centers around the October 30 signing of a military pact between Colombia and the U.S. that gives the American armed forces the use of seven military bases in Colombia , and grants immunity to U.S. soldiers operating in there .
Colombian President Álvaro Uribe and President Barack Obama claim that the U.S. military presence in Colombia will serve only to combat narco - traffickers and leftist guerillas , not threaten Colombia 's neighbors .
Yet as the Venezuelanalysis.com
Web site reports , this claim " is contradicted by the 2010 fiscal year budget of the U.S. Air Force Military Construction Program , which states that ... the pact ' provides a unique opportunity for full - spectrum operations in a critical sub-region of our hemisphere ' and ' supports mobility missions by providing access to the entire continent . ' "
What 's more , the agreement on military bases follows the reactivation of the U.S. Navy 's Fourth Fleet , historically used by Washington to intimidate and attack countries that challenge its agenda in the Caribbean and Latin America .
Colombian armed forces on patrol
For years , the U.S. has pumped money and weapons into Colombia and sent military advisers there in the name of fighting " narco- terrorism . "
As a wave of left or center - left governments have been elected in Latin America , military aid to Colombia has swelled , making it the third - largest recipient of U.S. military aid in the world .
The October 30 U.S. - Colombia pact will dramatically escalate ongoing U.S. military intervention in the region .
In this context , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has called on his country 's armed forces to prepare for the possibility of conflict , declaring that " we must prepare for war ... This will be the guarantee for peace . "
Chávez also took the opportunity to call on Obama to give back his Nobel Peace Prize , saying , " He keeps sending more troops to Afghanistan , and the war is spreading across this part of Eurasia , Pakistan , [ and ] in Iraq , they are still bombing children and entire families , and they are supporting the coup in Honduras . "
The U.S. refusal to try to reverse the right - wing Honduras coup has given a big boost to right - wing opposition groups across Latin America .
So it was little wonder that Venezuela rejected an offer by the U.S. State Department to mediate the dispute between Colombia and Venezuela by helping to find " practical solutions . "
Chávez responded by calling the U.S. government " the champion of cynicism , " saying , " United States , if you want practical solutions , withdraw the Yankee bases in Colombia and free those fraternal people , free Colombia . "
A statement issued by the Venezuela Ministry of People 's Power for Foreign Affairs noted , " The strengthening of the U.S. military presence is aimed at demonstrating its global power to dissuade , under the threat of military intervention , countries like the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that are critical of imperialist U.S. policies . "
VENEZUELA FROZE diplomatic relations with Colombia back in July when the latter first announced plans to allow U.S. military access to its bases .
This was the third such diplomatic clash since 2005 .
In that year , Venezuela recalled its diplomats from Bogota after it was discovered that Colombian agents had been operating illegally inside Venezuela .
Again , and more seriously , relations were frozen in March 2008 when Colombian forces bombed a guerilla encampment inside Ecuador , killing leftist rebels .
The attack violated both international law and the sovereignty of Ecuador , an ally of Venezuela .
Since the signing of the U.S. - Colombian pact on bases , tensions have continued to mount , with a series of incidents on the Venezuela - Colombia border .
On November 2 , two soldiers in the Venezuelan National Guard were shot dead at a border crossing , most likely by Colombian paramilitaries who have been increasingly active inside Venezuela .
Venezuela responded by closing and occupying the border crossing in question and sending thousands of troops to border regions .
The pressure rose still further in mid-November when Colombian armed forces captured four members of the Venezuelan National Guard on a boat on the Meta River , part of which constitutes the border between the two countries .
The men were later deported to Venezuela , but Venezuela responded by blowing up two border bridges in the area that authorities claimed were being used by Colombian drug traffickers .
Whatever the details of the confrontation on the Meta River , Venezuela 's decision to brace for possible military conflict is based on a credible threat from across the Colombian border .
Right - wing paramilitary groups have been a powerful force within Colombia for decades .
Formed by local oligarchs , these private armies are the result of a narco - economy in which the line between traditional capitalists and drug lords is blurred -- if it exists at all .
There 's also a great deal of overlap between the paramilitaries and the official Colombian military .
Colombian President Uribe has himself been linked to the paramilitaries .
A U.S. intelligence document from 1991 lists then - Senator Uribe as a " close personal friend of Pablo Escobar , " the notorious drug lord killed in 1993 .
Since Uribe became president in 2002 , a number of Uribe 's close political allies have been questioned or charged in relation to paramilitary activity .
So while Colombia acts as a proxy of U.S. imperialism , paramilitaries act as a proxy of the Colombian state and ruling class .
This makes Colombian paramilitaries operating in Venezuela a literal vanguard of reaction .
Venezuelan Vice President Ramón Carrizález called the recent killings " part of a destabilization plan that we 've been reporting . "
In 2004 , dozens of Colombian paramilitaries were captured deep inside Venezuela when a plot to overthrow the government was uncovered .
Whether or not these forces are in direct contact with U.S. intelligence , they are clearly working in concert with U.S. interests .
The prospect of a dramatic increase in the U.S. military presence in Colombia is certainly ominous for the region 's leftist governments -- Ecuador and Bolivia as well as Venezuela .
These countries are already under pressure from both internal right - wing oppositions and imperialist intervention .
Even the center - left government of Brazil , which has done Washington 's bidding by running the United Nations occupation of Haiti , expressed sharp opposition to the U.S. - Colombian deal on military bases .
The growing U.S. military presence in Latin America poses a challenge to the antiwar movement and the left in the U.S.
We must be prepared to oppose the imperialist war machine , wherever and whenever it goes on the offensive -- whether directly in Afghanistan and Iraq , or indirectly through its clients like Colombia .

From a reddit discussion I ended up discovering a post from Kevin Carson who expresses amazingly well the reason why I keep getting annoyed when discussing with propertarians of various forms .
It ’s the implicit double standard that is implied every time I ’m accused of wanting to steal stuff , of having no respect for the capitalist ’s “ labour ” , of being authoritarian .
I ’ll let Carson put it best .
Here ’s an opposing case for you : Imagine I ’m renting a house under a Lockean property system , and get permission to plant a garden on it .
I invest a lot of effort in composting and green manuring , and even spend money on granite dust , greensand , rock phosphate and the like to improve the soil .
When I get done with it , what was hardpan clay has been transformed into rich , black , friable soil .
And when I cease renting , I lose the value of all the improvements I made .
That ’s the sort of thing that happens all the time under Lockeanism .
But I suspect that Reisman would say that I made the improvements with my eyes open , and am entitled to no sympathy because I knew what the rules were .
I certainly doubt that he ’s shedding any tears over the invested labor that the South Central Farmers are in danger of losing .
The difference is , when it happens under the system he ’s defending , it ’s just life ; when it happens under the system he ’s demonizing , it ’s an outrage .
And this here above is exactly the thing you get to hear all the goddamn time !
The wage - worker not keeping the full value of his labour or his labour not being enough to ensure his subsistence ?
That ’s just life .
A wannabe - capitalist not being able to extract a profit from his workers ?
Outrage !
A tenant - farmer ’s labour not being enough to homestead the land he ’s working on because a landlord has already a claim to it ?
That ’s just life .
Someone not being able to claim ownership on more land than he can possibly use himself ?
Outrage !
Capitalists requiring a special class of wealthy judges to interpret the “ libertarian law ” and a private defense complex to enforce them ?
That ’s not a state , just life .
Workers banding together and using means such as peer pressure and ostracism to enforce that nobody exploits and dominates anyone else ?
Outrage !
Statism !
I could go on and on but you get the idea .
It would be funny if it was n’t depressing to have to argue against this so often .
This whole thing starts from the classic error of the propertarians taking their chosen system of ownership as given and a “ natural law ” .
Once you start by assuming that Private Property is an objective rule set then it ’s not difficult to jump to the conclusion that act that violates those rights is an outrage .
The fact that it is not a violation when the whole system has been rejected simply does not cross one ’s mind .
It reminds me of some Liberal lawyers arguing that a violation of copyrights was wrong because it ’s the law and not being able to grasp that we challenged the validity of the law in the first place .

There was something this past weekend in the NFL that caught my attention and that was the fight on the Dallas Cowboys sideline .
That fight ?
It was between Terrence Newman and his coach Dave Campo .
While fights on the sideline are n’t uncommon they are n’t caught to the level of this one .
The forthcoming video will show that .
What that fight did do was make me think of how many truly good fights in the NFL have their been on the field .
To be honest there have n’t been many .
Think about the guys are in full pads , rarely leave their bench and when they do its a bunch of pushing .
To be honest its worst then a fight in baseball and who ’d expect that with some of the toughest guys in sports .
So what I did was browse You Tube to find some legitimate NFL fights .
Fights with throw downs .
Punches with the helmet off .
Benches clearing and guys actually getting involved , not that pussy MLB push you around type stuff .
Here ’s a few of those videos .
The first is from this season , the NY Giants vs Washington Redskins .
Corey Webster vs Santana Moss .
This was one hell of a pushing and shoving contest when it comes to NFL standards .
While we ’re talking about the NY Giants who can forget this move by Philadelphia Eagles kicker David Akers not too long ago .
He decided to throw a full hit to a Giants coach and paid the price for it .
Then again we do got bitch moves in the NFL like that of the New England Patriots own Matt Light , who decided to take numerous shots at the Miami Dolphins own Channing Crowder , punching him numerous times in the head after his helmet had come off .
To be honest thou with all these minor fights we see in the NFL , the best come during the preseason .
You know the those intrasquad scrimmages .
Who can forget when New Orleans Jeremy Shockey took on the Houston Texans .
Even better thou is when those teammates fight each other , much like when San Francisco ’s Vernon Davis took on his own teammates .
For those who do n’t like foul language do n’t watch this last one .
Intel will soon offer a two - core ' Clarksdale ' processor rated at a mere 30W , aiming to slip this low - power chip into the super - svelte " microservers " it first trumpeted at its developer forum last month .
Speaking with reporters at an event in San Francisco this morning , Intel high - density computing boss Jason Waxman said the chip will be available " in a couple of months . "
Chipzilla mentioned the new 30 W Nehalem chip at IDF in rolling out a reference design for its new breed of low - power microserver , and Waxman now tells The Reg it will clock at 2.26GHz .
The company 's current reference system - made up of hardback - sized PCBs ( printed circuit boards ) packed with a CPU and four memory DIMMs - uses a 1.86GHz , 45W quad - core ' Lynnfield ' chip already on the market .
" We 're looking to define a new form factor that allows companies to come up with a uni-processor [ machine ] that 's reasonably capable ... and cost - effective and easy to deploy , " Waxman said .
" We want this to become a new building block for the types of applications where you have lots of web servers or a hosting type of environment or something where you need many images of a server . "
Intel hopes to hone these PCBs to the point where they idle at a total of 25 W and top out at 75 W when performance is cranked to 11 .
With the reference system Intel demonstrated today , sixteen of the PCBs slot into a master chassis that also houses storage drives .
How is this different from a blade ?
" A blade system to me is when you have centralized management , a fabric , and you 're trying to manage storage , networking , and compute all through a common interface , " Waxman says .
" The reality is that these [ microservers ] are just servers . "
In other words , a simpler , low - cost system for simpler , low - cost setups .
" What we 're really trying to do is drive low costs .
You can come up with a system that gives reasonable performance that still drives low power . "
And why not just virtualize ?
" For some service providers , virtualization is messy .
You may need to have central storage for example , " Waxman says .
" And it may come down to comfort level .
A lot of customers [ of service providers ] like to own a piece of metal .
They want to have something that they know is dedicated to them .
It 's not necessarily justified , but some have the belief that it 's a little bit more of a secure type of solution if they 're the only one with root - access to the server . " ®
Thomas Paine once wrote : “ He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression ; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself . ”
Paine ’s truth is not idealistic handwaving , it is brutal pragmatism .
Justifications for censorship , even the best - intentioned kind , have a way of expanding until they become instruments of abuse .
Therefore , if we truly care about freedom of speech , it is not sufficient to defend that freedom when it is comfortable to do so — when the censors are ugly and the victim is appealing .
It is necessary , sometimes , to speak up in defense of ugly victims of censorship .
I have found myself placed under that necessity in the last week .
A member in good standing of the open - source community , one Beth Lynn Eicher , had sought and achieved the suppression of public speech by one Mikhail Kvaratskhelia , aka ‘ mikeeeUSA ’ , aka serveral other aliases .
When I first approached her privately on the matter , she refused to apologize or retract .
In my judgment , she was committing a crime against our community ’s future by setting a precedent which might one day reach to all of us .
This put me in a difficult position .
I had received an explicit appeal for redress in my capacity as one of our tribal elders , and I felt the appeal was in the right and Ms. Eicher in the wrong .
But I knew — for various reasons which will become very clear — that making that case would involve me in a batter and divisive wrangle .
I was prepared to do it anyway , because my conscience would not permit otherwise , but I knew it was going to be hell .
Fortunately , after several days of debate among myself and some friends of mine who leapt to Ms. Eicher ’s defense , Ms. Eicher proved to be cleverer than either them or me .
While Ms. Eicher ’s defenders were still flaming me for intransigence on the free - speech issue , she designed a solution which I consider totally appropriate , and which I actually hope will set a precedent .
Mikhail Kvaratskhelia is what constitutional lawyers sometimes call a werewolf – the most unappealing possible victim .
He is a creepy , repellent , misogynistic crank , given to uttering threats of violent death against female Linux hackers , and quite possibly clinically insane .
I first became aware of his existence last week when he sent a long letter of complaint to Richard Stallman , Linus , Bruce Perens , and myself asserting that his speech rights had been trampled on and linking to blog entries by Ms. Eicher and one other person .
The letter was disturbing – intelligent in a feral way , but unhinged .
I was eyeball - deep in a new coding project ; I read both blog posts , finding the story therein sad and troubling .
Kvaratskhelia had posted level maps for a first - person - shooter game called Nexuiz on SourceForge ; possibly also executable code , the accounts are unclear .
The accounts concur that the maps contained violent imagery and slogans attacking women ’s rights , and this creep ’s ugly and hate - filled letter leaves me in no doubt that the maps were ugly and hate - filled as well .
I did not pursue the matter until RMS replied on 15 October asking whether Kvaratskhelia had made backups of the censored material .
I thought this was a sensible question ; it was the first one that had occurred to me , anyway .
Following this , I searched the web for relevant material ( I had deleted Kvaratskhelia ’s letter rather quickly – my eyeballs felt soiled by it ) and found Ms. Eicher ’s original blog entry .
I felt , at that point , the pricking of my conscience for not having responded to Kvaratskhelia ’s earlier complaint immediately .
I wrote Ms. Eicher an email condemning the suppression of speech and expressing my judgment that she owed Kvaratskhelia an apology for her suppressive conduct – which she refused to do .
This is not , at first blush , a situation in which the law offers much guidance .
Censorship in the strictest sense is not involved , as no government force or threat of force was involved in the suppression .
SourceForge was within its property rights and terms of service to delete the offensive material , and there was certainly no law barring Ms. Eicher from asking that they do so .
My position was nevertheless that Ms. Eicher ’s specific request for suppression of Kvaratskhelia ’s public speech was , though within the law , consequentially and ethically wrong , because it set a precedent legitimizing suppression of public speech as a political tool .
Ms. Eicher , and her friends , maintained that her action was justified by the death threats that Kvaratskhelia has been uttering since 2005 .
Taking them at their word about the facts , I agree that those threats were gravely wrong , injurious , and probably criminal .
But the material on SourceForge that was actually censored is not represented to have constituted a death threat , merely a political argument that Ms. Eicher and her friends found obnoxious .
I am pretty sure I ’d have found it obnoxious myself … but on this , law and ethics are both clear .
Nazis threaten death to Jews , but they can march in Skokie anyway – the mere fact that one has an ideology that is crazed and bigoted and potentially violent does nothing to dissolve or abrogate one ’s free - speech rights .
Nor should it .
The rules of engagement that protect mikeeeUSA ’s right to utter controversial political speech are the same rules that protect Ms. Eicher ’s ; we can not deny one without the other .
And as for violent misogyny in games – I remember what side most of the hacker community was on in the running PR and legal battles over Grand Theft Auto .
I think that was the right side to be on , and any of us who would choose the side of the censor now , simply because it ’s one of our people demanding suppression instead of some grandstanding redneck DA , would be at best succumbing to special pleading and at worst an outright hypocrite .
I was ( and am ) not happy about appearing to defend Kvaratskhelia .
To judge by the letter and the reports of his past behavior , he is a vile piece of scum ; if he were to threaten harm to Ms. Eicher in my presence , I would cheerfully shoot him .
But the way to deal with death threats is to ( a ) report them to law enforcement , and ( b ) be prepared to defend yourself against the very likely contingency that the authorities wo n’t be around when you need them .
It is not to seek suppression of the threatener ’s public speech .
By doing that , Ms. Eicher put herself in the wrong ; worse , she put this odious character — at that moment , and on this issue — in the right .
For , if we deem suppressing his speech acceptable , where does it stop ?
Today it ’s tirades against sexual equality that are supposed to accept as bad enough to warrant booting someone off a hosting site .
But tomorrow , what will it be ?
Advocating restrictions on abortion ?
Denying global warming ?
Dissing vegetarians ?
Wearing fur ?
The precedent Ms. Eicher apparently wanted us to accept , whether she intended it or not , would have been unacceptably dangerous to liberty in general and our community in particular .
The hacker culture is more delicately dependent on the unfettered flow of creativity and conversation , more functionally threatened by the possibility of systematic censorship , than any other I can think of in human history .
Thus , our need and our responsibility to defend freedom of expression — even when we find it uncomfortable , even when it ’s being exercised by werewolves — becomes greater rather than less .
We cannot hold ourselves to lower standards than a court interpreting the First Amendment would apply ; if the Nazis can march in Skokie , we must respect mikeeeUSA ’s right to make vile political arguments in our public spaces .
Ms. Eicher ’s blog is not a public space , but SourceForge was intentionally designed to function as one and our community uses it in that way ; thus , the rules of the public square apply .
I was very concerned that Ms. Eicher ’s original action not become a precedent for how we deal with trolls and nutjobs in the future .
For if we censor public speech in aid of our own political positions , we forfeit the right to object when others censor our public speech in aid of theirs .
There is only one place that road can end , and it ’s not anywhere we want to be .
That was why I might have ended up in a very ugly , very public fight over this .
But while others where flaming , Ms. Eicher was listening .
And thinking , to far better effect than the flamers .
Just a few few hours ago , without consulting me , she undertook to host the offending material herself .
This is what I had to say when I learned of this :
Ms. Eicher , * well done *!
A creative and even brilliant solution !
Hosting the creep ’s stuff with a loud warning that it is vile and possiblly criminal attached to it is * exactly * the correct response !
* Exactly *!
The best remedy for hate speech is not suppression of that speech but counterpropaganda that makes the hater look both vile and ridiculous .
The fact that you publicly held yourself out as an offended party gives the act of turning around to host his stuff even more force as a gesture of both contempt for him and principled opposition to censorship than it would have had otherwise .
Yes , host his stuff .
And , I advise , mock him mercilessly .
Do n’t dignify the filth on your disks with sober hatred ; * laugh * at the poisonous fuckwit .
Your choice makes you larger than him ; grind that in mercilessly .
I can live with a community rule that if you successfully have someone ’s stuff booted from a public space for vileness , custom requires you to carry it yourself .
But do n’t drop the ball .
Honor now demands that you host it as reliably as your own content .
Now I will post about this , but instead of condemning you for setting a bad precedent , I will praise you for setting a good one .
It is ethically , rhetorically , and pragmatically perfect ; the only tiny cloud on my happiness is that I was n’t imaginative enough to think of it myself .
I ’ll add one point to that now .
In an ironic and lovely way , Ms. Eicher ’s sacrifice of her own disks and bandwidth to carry Kvaratskhelia ’s misogynist crud is exactly the apology and retraction I originally hoped for — but delivered in a way that will give the creep no comfort in the end .
I really could not ask for a better outcome .
Ms. Eicher has earned my respect for avoiding the harm of censorship , and my personal gratitude for navigating us both out of a collision neither of us wanted .
And I hope her solution will indeed set a precedent that will enable us to never , ever advocate the suppression of public political speech , no matter how vile we find it .
New York ( CNN ) --
Authorities on Sunday released the name of a woman who turned up in New York this month saying she had no memory of her name or family .
She is Kacie Aleece Peterson , 18 , of Hansville , Washington , according to Paul Browne , deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department .
Police a day earlier said a CNN viewer in Maryland identified the woman , who was found in Midtown Manhattan on October 9 outside a youth shelter .
A photo of Peterson , who had been referred to as Jane Doe , was circulated by police and aired on CNN this week .
Authorities did n't release Peterson 's name until Sunday .
Browne said Peterson 's mother is dead and that her father is heading to New York .
CNN affiliate KOMO - TV in Seattle , Washington , reported that her father went to New York on Sunday to bring her home .
The family said it's not the first time she disappeared and then later was found with apparent memory loss , the station reported .
Peterson is from Colville in eastern Washington , KOMO reported .
She had been living with a friend in Hansville and attending Kingston High School .
The father said the daughter had gone to live temporarily with a friend of her late mother , the station reported .
Scott Wilson , spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff 's Office , said Peterson was reported missing by her father on October 1 , KOMO reported .
Detectives later discovered bank activity and other evidence that she was alive , he said .
The woman was found outside Manhattan 's Covenant House youth shelter around 12:30 a.m. October 9 .
The organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility .
A security guard for the shelter noticed the woman walking on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her .
Finding her unresponsive , he called the New York City Police Department .
Police officers interviewed the woman , but it became clear that she could n't provide authorities with any information about herself .
Police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants , a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered .
The CNN viewer who identified her was familiar with her situation and knew she had been missing this month , police said .
Police said they do not know how she lost her memory .
" I just want to know who I am and what happened to me , " the young woman said in a statement previously released by the New York City Administration of Children 's Services .
Evan Buxbaum , Susan Candiotti and Vanessa Juarez contributed to the report .
MINSK , Nov 27 ( Reuters ) - Russia and United States will ink a new nuclear weapons reduction pact this year but may not manage to sign the treaty by a Dec 5 deadline , a Kremlin source told Reuters on Friday .
The agreement will be signed “ in a European country ” in December , the source said .

Son cientos , sino miles , los artículos en blogs que hablan sobre el posicionamiento web , posicionamiento en buscadores o SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) , pero se basan en dos pilares fundamentales .
Las claves básicas para conseguir un sin número de visitantes a su web se dividen en dos categorías fundamentales :
SEO on - page , es dedir , lo que puedes hacer para optimizar tu página
SEO off - page , o lo que debes hacer fuera de tu página para que resulte lo que has hecho en tu página
SEO on - page
El SEO on - page , como brevemente hemos expuesto , son las técnicas que has de realizar , para que tu página sea atractiva a tus posibles clientes o visitantes , y por ende , a los buscadores .
Pero , ¿qué es lo que debemos hacer para que seamos atractivos a los buscadores ?
Bueno , esta es la pregunta del millón , si supiéramos la respuesta exacta a este dilema , todos nuestros clientes ocuparían los primeros puestos para todas las palabras clave que necesitasen .
Pero para poder acceder a saber lo que hay que hacer , lo primero es realizar una auditoría SEO .
Auditoría SEO
La auditoría SEO consiste en saber en qué estado se encuentra nuestra página web , tanto en el lado que depende directamente de nosotros , es decir , contenidos , indexación , velocidad de carga , analíticas , código , estructura , etc… , como de lo que ya no depende tan directamente de nosotros , como es la cantidad de dominios que enlazan a nuestra página web , así como el anchor text con el que nos enlazan .
Pero comencemos por el principio :
Estado de indexación
Lo primero que tenemos que hacer es saber cómo está indexado nuestro proyecto .
Si estamos preparando un nuevo proyecto de posicionamiento web , es sin duda porque , o la web es nueva , o nuestra exposición a nuestros posibles clientes , en cuanto a las posiciones que ocupan las palabras clave que nos interesan en los buscadores , sobre todo en Google .
Lo primero que hará nuestro equipo , será la creación , e instalación , de Google Analytics y la Search Console , si es que no lo están ya .
La primera opción , la instalación de Google Analytics , nos permitirá , saber el número de visitas , de donde vienen , a donde van , y si se cumplen los objetivos que necesitamos para que nuestro proyecto web prospere .
La Search Console nos permitirá saber para qué palabras clave , en nuestra página web , y qué secciones consiguen rankear , y en qué posiciones .
Todo esto , en un principio , nos permite saber qué secciones de nuestra página web funcionan , y cuales no .
Una vez esto , utilizaremos nuevas herramientas , como Screaming Frog , site audit de Ahrefs.com , Semrush , para saber datos técnicos que se nos escapan a primera vista .
¿ Qué datos nos proporcionarán estas herramientas ?
Lo primero que nos darán estas herramientas , será la cantidad de enlaces internos y externos rotos que tiene nuestra web .
Esto es un problema bastante grave , fácilmente subsanable .
Lo segundo , la estructura de enlaces internos , que nuestra web presenta , para saber como se distribuye el link juice , para que las páginas de nuestra web , reciban , la importancia que merecen , o necesitamos .
Tercero , el contenido duplicado , que puede aparecer , en la web .
Con el tiempo , es bastante común , que se cree contenido que aumenta , especifica , o mejora , actualizando el contenido que pudo ser creado tiempo atrás en otra página de nuestro sitio web .
Cuarto , etiquetas repetidas , que faltan , o que están mal incrustadas en el código de la web .
Es bastante común , que nuestro código esté lleno de errores en las etiquetas < h1 > , < h2 > , etc… , etiquetas alt en las imágenes y otros mucho más errores .
Otro de los datos que estas herramientas nos proporcionarán será otra de las claves que hacen que nuestra web consigan mejores puestos en los buscadores , la velocidad de carga .
¿ Por qué nuestra web puede ser lenta cargando ?
Las principales razones para esto , es el tamaño de las imágenes , o que haya muchas imágenes , errores de código , css en muchos archivos diferentes , mucho código JavaScript , servidor lento , o muchas más …
For almost 20 years , Houstonians have learned to depend on Robb Walsh ’s articulate enthusiasm for food , particularly Texas food .
We ’re not talking fancy — Walsh writes about roadside barbecue , venerable Tex - Mex , sandwiches wrapped in greasy paper , the beautiful varieties of hot sauce and chile peppers .
As the food writer for the Houston Press , Walsh surveys the wild array of Cajun , Asian , African , and Caribbean cafes that seem to pop up every other week .
Walsh is a natural storyteller when it comes to unearthing Texas delicacies , but his new book , devoted to his obsession with the many varieties of growing , harvesting and consuming of oysters , is more personal than his other work and takes him way outside Harris County .
He begins his study of the bi-valve riding on a diesel - powered oyster boat in Galveston Bay , on a winter day when the water temperature is 60 degrees .
He calls it perfect oyster weather .
The boat belongs to Walsh ’s friend , Misho Ivic , and is named the Trpanj after his home village in Croatia .
As the diesel engine roars , the Trpanj ‘s dredge scrapes the bay ’s bottom .
Detritus and smaller oysters are thrown back into the water .
Walsh eats an oyster just brought up ( briny , a little metallic and surprisingly sweet ) and addresses the bad reputation of Gulf oysters in general and Galveston Bay oysters in particular .
“ East Coast and West Coast oystermen say that the waters of the Gulf of Mexico are filthy .
And maybe they are .
But oysters live in brackish water in freshwater estuaries , not in the Gulf of Mexico .
And the scientists I interviewed said that Galveston Bay was in pretty good shape . ”
Conscientious fishermen like Ivic have no interest in selling tainted oysters , and adhere to a fishing - zone system enforced by coastal game wardens .
Reefs close to the shore are off limits because of wastewater and runoff from lawns and cow pastures .
Do not , Walsh says , be alarmed by the muddy brown color of the water — fisherman say it is full of plankton and other goodies that make oysters and crabs thrive .
What makes the eater of raw oysters sick is the bacterium vibio cholorae , which grows in warm polluted water .
If you have ever eaten a “ bad oyster , ” you know the symptoms that feel like food poisoning , only worse — it can even lead to cholera .
Raw oysters are a seasonal food , especially in hot climates and anyone tempted to eat Galveston or Gulf oysters in August will not do so after reading Walsh .
The quality of Texas oysters is lost on much of the country .
Walsh is robustly attacked for being an oyster writer from Houston when he visits New England and the West Coast , particularly San Francisco .
There he meets an egomaniac oyster entrepreneur named Billy Martinelli , who greets Walsh by saying , “ Gulf oysters are criminal . ”
Walsh manages to change the subject and in a few days accompanies Martinelli to an oyster picnic on Hog Island in Tomales Bay , on the coast west of Sonoma County .
Like this idyllic Northern California scene , much of Sex , Death , and Oysters is a travelogue punctuated with shellfish .
Walsh goes to New Orleans , before and after Katrina , to visit famous eateries like the Acme Oyster House and Felix ’s Oyster Bar in the French Quarter and Casamento ’s on Magazine Street .
On a trip with his wife and daughters , Walsh makes it onto the Acme ’s wall of fame by eating 180 oysters in two hours .
The only aftereffect he reports is an audible sloshing noise as he walks up Iberville Street .
Before the hurricane , Louisiana had by far the most productive oyster beds in the country .
Katrina destroyed more than 50 percent of the oyster beds in the estuaries and most of the piers and oyster boats in places like Plaquemines Parish and Grand Isle .
Walsh meets Cajun and Croatian oystermen on Grand Isle , who all pointed out that after major storms there is a frenzy of reproduction among oyster seedlings ( this is part of the sex in the title ) .
After three years or so , production is back up .
It remains to be seen whether that happens in Galveston Bay after Hurricane Ike .
Not everyone loves oysters , a fact that ’s reflected in Walsh ’s trip to England , where he visits Colchester , in Essex County , northeast of London .
Planning the English leg of his international oyster survey , Walsh had trouble finding out anything about the Colchester Oyster Festival , an annual event since 1618 .
When he arrives , he discovers why — no one in the town actually eats oysters from the beds that fed the ancient Romans .
He learns that the famous oyster banquet , presided over by Colchester ’s mayor , is an anachronistically formal event .
The 200 or so guests are seated according to social rank inside a room that looks “ like a cross between a ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria and the inside of a cathedral . ”
Walsh manages to get a cheap media seat .
When he notices that more than half the guests do n’t touch the delicious Colchester oysters , he grabs a couple of plates and some bread and butter .
He joins two elderly nurses drinking tea at a first aid table .
“ When they noticed the oysters , they were horrified .
One said she had never seen an oyster before , never mind eaten one .
She looked at mine and declared them disgusting . ”
After some successful oystering in London , Walsh describes Christmas in Paris with his wife , Kelly , on their honeymoon in 2005 .
They had planned this trip after their wedding six months earlier , Walsh knowing the holidays are the height of the oyster season in Paris — but what bride could refuse a wedding trip to the city of lights ?
The only hitch is that Kelly is now pregnant , has raging morning sickness , and an opened - up oyster makes her gorge rise .
The trip also coincides with a serious snowstorm that becomes a blizzard .
The intrepid shellfish journalist fulfills his mission in one famous oyster restaurant ( Le Dome ) and one hidden little place ( Brasserie Flo ) , and finds Kelly the best puff pastry dessert in the city , demonstrating that he does have some common sense .
Back home , Robb and Kelly start serving big quantities of oysters at their Super Bowl parties .
He gives instructions on how to shuck them without destroying your hands .
We learn that some of his travels have paid off .
Walsh reports that during the winter months , when it is too cold for Canadian oysters , Rodney ’s Oyster House in Toronto , run by his friend Rodney Clark , runs a special on Galveston Bay oysters .
Rodney ’s is among the 25 eating places Walsh recommends , and the book is full of recipes for dishes like oyster and artichoke soup .
Sex , Death , and Oysters was a labor of love , written while Walsh was working on other projects , including his fine study of our native hybrid food , The Tex Mex Cookbook .
He understands the reluctance of some eaters to ingest the mysterious fruits de mer that can kill you , and in explaining the attraction Walsh fully reveals himself to be a sensualist as well as a gourmand :
Eating raw oysters is at once perverse and spiritual .
A freshly shucked oyster enters your mouth while it is still alive and dies while giving you pleasure .
As I savored the wonderfully slick texture , delicate briny flavor , and marine aroma , it was easy to see how oysters came to be associated with the tenderest portion of the female anatomy .

FOSSIL fuels have a new crime to live down .
A frenzy of hydrocarbon burning at the end of the Permian period may have led to the most devastating mass extinction Earth has ever seen , as explosive encounters between magma and coal released more carbon dioxide in the course of a few years than in all of human history .

Shaun Joseph analyzes the upcoming elections in Honduras -- a sham vote orchestrated by the coup regime after it broke its commitment to restore Manuel Zelaya .
JUST OVER five months since the June 28 coup d'etat against Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , elections scheduled for November 29 will complete the current phase of the struggle over Honduras ' future -- but only by opening another , perhaps darker , period .
A " peaceful " resolution to the Honduran drama was widely expected after October 30 , when U.S. negotiators brokered the Tegucigalpa / San José Accords between representatives Zelaya and the golpista ( coup - maker ) government headed by Roberto Micheletti .
But Washington 's hands - off behavior in the following week allowed Micheletti to break the agreement by unilaterally announcing the formation of a " unity government , " headed by himself , while the golpista - controlled Congress deliberately dithered on the question of restoring Zelaya to office , which was the prime condition of the opposition to the coup regime to recognize the elections .
Although the Accords are obviously in tatters -- members of the " unity government " are n't even known , nearly three weeks after they were supposed to be installed -- the U.S. insists on acting as if everything is still going according to plan .
This is because the agreement , were it not a fiction , would legitimize the upcoming elections and lead to the normalization of Honduras ' international relations , which is important for North American corporations , especially in the fruit , textile and mining sectors .
The head of the Honduras ' coup regime Roberto Micheletti
Although the concessions to Zelaya - - which were actually minor and largely symbolic -- have been voided by the golpistas , the U.S. wants to retain the provisions dear to its own capitalist interests .
But while the U.S. plans to recognize the November 29 elections , it has so far found no other country willing to join it , at least publicly .
On the contrary , a number of Latin American countries have openly stated that they wo n't recognize elections carried out under the golpista dictatorship .
These countries include Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Ecuador , Guatemala , Nicaragua and Venezuela .
It will be difficult for the U.S. to carry any Latin American countries with its line , even traditional allies .
Not only is Latin American popular opinion solidly opposed to the Honduras coup , but a section of the region 's elite also understands the toppling of Zelaya as an attack on attempts to build capitalist links independent of U.S. imperialism .
The Organization of American States ( OAS ) , traditionally a U.S. instrument , has refused to send observers or provide technical assistance for the elections .
So the Obama administration -- supposed advocates of " smart power " in contrast to the Bush presidency -- have demonstrated their " smartness " by devising a diplomatic fiasco in Latin America much worse than anything its predecessor ever bumbled into .
Of course , U.S. imperialism 's priorities of defending American power limit its prospects for success in any circumstance .
But the Obama administration has cut a sorry figure , even on the tactical level .
The clearest statements on Obama 's Honduras policy seem to be funneled through Republican senators : Jim DeMint of South Carolina was first to announce Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's promise to recognize the Honduran elections , regardless of Zelaya 's status , and Richard Lugar of Indiana announced that the State Department would fund " election observation missions " organized by the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute ( international fronts of the Democratic and Republican Parties , respectively ) .
In the meanwhile , the administration had no response to two letters from Zelaya himself , despite the fact that he is Honduras ' legitimate head of state , according to every nation and international body in the world .
The Obama administration seems to think it can erase five months of dictatorship through a ready - to - order election .
In reality , they are inviting a more severe crisis .
THE CALL of the National Resistance Front Against the Coup d'Etat to boycott the coming elections has been widely taken up across Honduran civil society .
A letter renouncing the elections signed by over 300 candidates was delivered by U.S. Rep.
Jan Schakowsky to Obama , although the names have n't been released due to fear of reprisals from the golpista regime .
Among those known to have withdrawn from the vote are independent presidential candidate Carlos H. Reyes ; Rodolfo Padilla Sunceri , the incumbent Liberal Party mayor of San Pedro Sula , Honduras ' second city ; Elvia Argentina Valle Villalta , the incumbent Liberal Congress deputy from Copán ; and Margarita Zelaya de Elvir , the Liberals ' vice presidential candidate .
There have been resignations by candidates of all parties -- including , incredibly , at least one from the center - right National Party .
Unfortunately , the leftist Democratic Unification Party ( UD ) , which previously associated itself with the anti-coup resistance , made the astonishing decision to participate in the elections , affirmed a party conference on November 21 .
UD claims that it does n't want any offices vacated by its members to fall into golpista hands .
But in the unlikely event that UD kept all its positions , or even gained more , its officials would have zero effect in a regime spawned by a military dictatorship .
To be sure , as the sole organized party of the left , UD would lose a great deal by withdrawing from the elections , as the party would certainly be stripped of its legal status .
But now , UD will lose something far more precious : the respect of the most politically conscious militants in Honduras .
( Some individual UD candidates have withdrawn from the vote . )
Naturally , the boycott question is forcing everyone in and around the anti-coup resistance to take sides .
More surprising , however , is that the elections , instead of giving the oligarchy 's leadership the opportunity to regroup and reorient , seem to be tearing them apart .
The key fault lines lie between the two major parties on the one hand , and between the politicians and the military on the other .
Both Zelaya and Micheletti are members of the Liberal Party .
After the coup , a " melista " ( Zelaya - supporting ) faction of the Liberals went over to the resistance , where it tended to constitute a more conservative , compromising wing of the grassroots opposition to the golpistas .
If the Accords had been implemented , the melistas would have been a natural bridge back to electoralism and rapprochement with the Liberal mainstream .
In the face of golpista intransigence , though , the Liberal Party is now hopelessly split -- its presidential candidate , Elvin Santos , is running a distant second to Porfirio " Pepe " Lobo of the National Party .
Unfortunately for Lobo , the fact that the elections will not be monitored by any credible organizations , but a motley crew of pro-coup kooks and flunkies , greatly increases the chances for fraud .
Suspicious results could have the two golpista parties at each others ' throats .
The second , perhaps graver , division is between the politicians and top military officers .
As Andrés Pavón of the Honduran human rights organization CODEH said in a statement on November 14 :
The military command feels profoundly nervous about the current situation they confront , as the politicians have left them alone for weeks , and [ the commanders ] have sniffed out , with good reason , the incapacity of the new government , which will be derived from the fraudulent electoral process , to completely protect them from the consequences of their criminal actions at the national and international levels .
No government in Honduras will willingly accept economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed on the country just to protect military officers from jail .
So the military could become convenient scapegoats to calm cries for justice in the wake of the election .
Pavón says that inside sources leaked to him plans for a military provocation on November 29 - - with paramilitary units , disguised as a fictitious " Armed Command of the Resistance , " committing a massacre .
The massacre will then be used as justification for a campaign of terror against the National Resistance Front .
The plan is said to have been devised by Gen. Romeo Vásquez Velásquez , head of the Honduran military and a graduate of the School of the Americas .
Pavón 's credibility is impeccable , so it is likely that this heinous scheme is at least being discussed in military circles .
The Front apparently considers it a serious threat and referred to the plot specifically in its most recent communiqué .
Indeed , there is a distinct possibility of a " coup within a coup , " with the military taking direct power and demagogically blaming the politicians for the crisis .
Micheletti's bizarre declaration that he intends to " absent [ himself ] from the exercising of [ his ] public functions " from November 25 to December 2 increases the chances of such a military seizure of power .
This would truly take Honduras back to the dark ages , turning the clock back further than even the golpistas intended .
Repression everywhere , plans for possible bloodbaths , rumors of coups , free speech trampled , an election that promises more violence than voting -- and the U.S. government clings to the idea that the November 29 elections will be a step forward for stability and democracy !
INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY is critical -- the resistance needs the time and political space to reorient itself for a new period in the struggle .
Simply exposing the plans for provocations can help defeat them , since they require some degree of secrecy to work .
Activists in the U.S. should also agitate against recognition of whatever regime emerges after November 29 , against special trade status for Honduras ( such as membership in CAFTA ) , and against all international aid ( including " humanitarian " aid that cannot be trusted to an anti-popular regime ) .
One remarkable victory for international solidarity came November 17 , when Russell Athletic agreed to rehire 1,200 Honduran workers who had been fired after they formed a union at their factor .
The victory was a result of a campaign by United Students Against Sweatshops , which got several universities to sever licensing deals with Russell and exposed the company 's misdeeds at a series of public events .
This should serve as an inspiration .
The stakes are much higher in the struggle over the coup .
It involves not just an economic struggle in one factory , but the political class struggle nationally and internationally .
Still , for all its power , U.S. imperialism is isolated , exposed and discredited in Latin America today .
An international resistance can win .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday denied that Omar Hassan al - Bashir was responsible for genocide in Darfur and said he would be more comfortable talking to the indicted Sudanese president than to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the state - run news agency Anatolian reported .
" I would n't be able to speak with Netanyahu so comfortably but I would speak comfortably with Bashir .
I say comfortably " What you 've done is wrong " .
And I would say it to his face .
Why ?
Because a Muslim could n't do such things .
A Muslim could not commit genocide , " Anatolian quoted Erdogan as saying .
Stalled Talks
Turkey ready to further Syria - Israel dialogue AFP During joint press conference with French counterpart in Paris , FM Davutoglu says , ' All countries that seek peace are our strategic allies , including Israel of course '
Turkey ready to further Syria - Israel dialogue
Turkish government officials said Bashir would not attend an Islamic summit in Istanbul as planned , after the European Union raised objections to his visit .
Bashir , against whom the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has issued an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity in Sudan 's Darfur region , had announced plans to attend a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) on Monday .
" We have learned that he is not coming , " a Turkish government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity , without elaborating .
Other Turkish officials , visibly relieved at the news , also confirmed that Bashir was not attending .
The ICC indicted Bashir in March on seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , but stopped short of including a charge of genocide .
The United Nations says as many as 300,000 people have been killed since conflict erupted in Darfur in 2003 , although Sudan rejects that figure .
Fraught ties
Erdogan 's comments could further damage Turkey 's already fraught ties with Israel , which have deteriorated since Israel 's offensive earlier this year in the Palestinian Gaza Strip .
Turkey , which has deepened economic ties with Sudan , has not ratified the statute that established the ICC and had said it had no plans to arrest Bashir .
The mainly Muslim country , which is seeking EU membership , had come under pressure from Brussels and international human rights groups to drop Bashir from the guest list .
Campaigning group Human Rights
Watch had said that NATO member Turkey 's international image would " plummet " if Ankara did not bar Bashir 's entry .
Bashir has travelled to African countries since his arrest warrant was issued by the ICC in March .

Iran 's anti-American President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose country is engaged in a standoff with the West over Tehran 's nuclear program , arrived in Istanbul on Sunday to attend the one - day OIC meeting .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai , in his first trip abroad since his re-election was announced this week following a fraud - marred ballot , also arrived earlier on Sunday and held bilateral talks with Turkey 's President Abdullah Gul .
Western powers are seeking to exert pressure on Tehran for concessions on its nuclear program , and Ahmadinejad could use the summit to undermine efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic .
Meanwhile Sunday , Syrian President Bashar Assad said that if Turkey wished to help his country , it must maintain good relations with Israel .
Assad told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet that Ankara had been successful in mediating between Jerusalem and Damascus fir eight months and had conveyed an important message to the West .
" Turkey must maintain good relations with Israel , otherwise how can it fill a significant role in the peace process ? " he said .
Trent Reznor is well known for being a flip - flopper , but he ’s doing his best to keep his promise about hauling Nine Inch Nails off the road .
Reznor claimed that Nine Inch Nails played their last ever live show in September , and he is now selling off the band ’s equipment in an attempt to put the past firmly behind him .
Several instruments used by the band are already for sale on EBay , and “ hundreds ” more pieces of equipment are expected to be put up on the auction site in the coming weeks .
At present , it ’s mostly guitars that are on the site , and many of them have already reached four - figure sums .
A statement about the sale has been issued on the Nine Inch Nails website :
“ We ’ve been going through the NIN touring and studio rigs and are getting rid of a large selection of gear and equipment the band is no longer in need of .
We do not know which ( if any ) tour these items are from unless specified , nor can we get any items autographed , so please do not ask . ”

Sean Harrington , owner of
in downtown Detroit , says he was arrested on false accusations he hit an employee and forced to spend 24 - hours behind bars before he was charged with misdemeanor assault .
Harrington
his holding cell was smeared with vomit and diarrhea , comparing it to " a gulag . "
Police say Harrington hit and employee after accusing him of stealing .
Harrington says video surveillance footage shows otherwise .
Because he was locked up for less than 48 hours , police spokesman John Roach told the Free Press , " I do n't see any problem at all with the actions that were taken . " '
In 2003 , The U.S. Department of Justice and the City of Detroit agreed to two consent decrees related to unlawful conditions of confinement in Detroit Police Department holding cells and unlawful use of force by DPD officers .
The decrees were supposed to expire in 2008 if both sides had met requirements , but Detroit has n't , and Harrington 's said he 'll contact the federal monitor overseeing the reforms .
Harrington is due in court today on the misdemeanor assault charge .
German telco NetCologne wants to introduce high speed internet access with a data rate of up to 1 Gbit/s in early 2010 , managing director Werner Hanf announced at the annual meeting of the association of fibre optic network operators Bundesverband Glasfaseranschluss .
The demand for such a service exists , said Hanf , explaining that 10 percent of the company 's approximately 70,000 customers already use the maximum speed of 100 Mbit /s .
The additional capacity could be used for downloading large video files or for HDTV reception via internet , he said .
The high speed access will be made available to all of the approximately 26,000 buildings in the inner-city area of Cologne connected to the company 's fibre - to - the - building ( FTTB ) network CityNetCologne .
NetCologne plans to add a further 30,000 buildings by the end of 2012 , for which around € 120 million will be invested .
The launch date and prices for the 1 Gbit /s offer will be announced at the beginning of next year .
The fastest internet access currently available in the Cologne area is offered by cable company Unitymedia with 120 Mbit/s .
As part of the triple play offer of a telephone connection and digital TV , the high speed package costs € 80 per month .

Ils ne croyaient pas si bien dire .
Ils , ce sont les critiques qui ont parlé de " déjà vu " à propos du discours sur l'agriculture prononcé mardi 27 octobre à Poligny ( Jura ) par Nicolas Sarkozy .
Mercredi sur Canal + , " Le Petit Journal " de Yann Barthès a relevé les nombreuses similitudes entre ce discours et celui prononcé huit mois plus tôt , le 19 février 2009 à Daumeray ( Maine - et - Loire ) .
Plusieurs phrases étaient ainsi calquées mot pour mot , à commencer par une longue définition de l'agriculteur : " un chef d'entreprise qui doit s'adapter en permanence au climat , aux marchés , aux technologies , aux réglementations . "
On retrouve également dans les deux discours une référence à l'identité nationale : " Le mot ' terre ' a une signification française et j'ai été élu pour défendre l'identité nationale française . "
Si cette phrase a été largement reprise mardi , en raison du débat relancé par Eric Besson , elle était passé inaperçue en février .
Par deux fois , Nicolas Sarkozy a affiché son soutien à son ministre de l'agriculture .
En février , il affirmait avoir " une totale confiance " en Michel Barnier .
Sauf qu'entretemps , le ministère a changé de main .
Bruno Le Maire a remplacé Michel Barnier en juin .
La différence réside toutefois dans les annonces faites pour venir en aide au secteur agricole .
Mardi , Nicolas Sarkozy a dévoilé un plan d'un milliard d'euros de prêts bancaires à taux bonifiés et de 650 millions d'euros d'aides supportées par les finances publiques .
Sollicité jeudi sur les surprenantes redites du discours présidentiel , l'Elysée n'avait toujours pas réagi dans la soirée .

FARMINGTON --
A woman who had sex with teenage boys was sentenced to a year in jail .
Kimberlee Arigot , 41 , came to court Wednesday prepared for possible jail time but was hoping for home confinement .
The judge ordered her to a year in jail .
Arigot engaged in sexual activity with three teenage boys .
Syracuse police initially started investigating Arigot because they believed she sent nude pictures to one teen .
She was arrested last November .
When they interviewed her , she gave them more information about sex acts with a 15 - year - old and two 17 - year - old boys .
Police have said the victims were either her daughter 's friends or neighborhood boys .
Both the prosecutor and defense attorney seemed pleased with the outcome .
Deputy Davis County Attorney Richard Larsen said , " In speaking with the victims , they 're pleased .
This was the outcome they were hoping for .
They 're pleased with the outcome . "
" Honestly , I think it was a fair sentence , " said defense attorney Ryan Bushell .
" That 's what we 'd come in prepared for .
We knew there would be some jail time . "
Arigot 's defense attorney said she was remorseful for what happened .
He said she was going through a tough time in her life and acted inappropriately .
He said , " She was getting some attention , relished in that attention and obviously took it way too far .
And when these young men approached her about doing things , it set her off and , unfortunately , acted on them . "
In addition to the year in jail Arigot will serve 36 month probation , and in 90 days , she 'll qualify for work release from jail .

Tony Blair 's bid to become president of the European Union has united the left in revulsion .
His enemies argue that he divided Europe by launching an illegal war ; he kept the UK out of the eurozone and the Schengen agreement ; he is contemptuous of democracy ( surely a qualification ? ) ; greases up to wealth and power and lets the poor go to hell ; he is ruthless , mendacious , slippery and shameless .
But never mind all that .
I 'm backing Blair .
It 's not his undoubted powers of persuasion that have swayed me , nor the motorcade factor that clinched it for David Miliband – who claims that no one else could stop the traffic in Beijing or Washington or Moscow .
I have a different interest .
You could argue that I 'm placing other considerations above the good of the EU .
You'd be right , but this hardly distinguishes me from the rest of Blair 's supporters .
I contend that his presidency could do more for world peace than any appointment since the second world war .
Blair has the distinction , which is a source of national pride in some quarters , of being one of the two greatest living mass murderers on earth .
That he commissioned a crime of aggression – waging an unprovoked war , described by the Nuremberg tribunal as " the supreme international crime " – looks incontestable .
I will explain the case in a moment .
This crime has caused the death – depending on whose estimate you believe – of between 100,000 and one million people .
As there was no legal justification , these people were murdered .
But no one has been brought to justice .
Within the UK , there is no means of prosecuting Blair .
In 2006 the law lords decided that the international crime of aggression has not been incorporated into domestic law .
But , elsewhere in the world , it has been .
In 2006 the professor of international law Philippe Sands warned that " Margaret Thatcher avoids certain countries as a result of the sinking of the Belgrano , and Blair would be advised to do likewise " .
Has he ?
I do n't know .
Blair 's diary and most of his meetings are private .
He has no need to travel to countries where he might encounter a little legal difficulty .
So he goes about his business untroubled .
He seldom faces protests , let alone investigating magistrates .
His only punishment for the crime of aggression so far is a multimillion - pound book deal , massive speaking fees , posh directorships and an appointment as Middle East peace envoy , which must rank with Henry Kissinger 's receipt of the Nobel peace prize as the supreme crime against satire .
I have spent the past three days trying to discover , from legal experts all over Europe , where the crime of aggression can be prosecuted .
The only certain answer is that the situation is unclear .
Everyone agrees that within the EU two states , Estonia and Latvia , have incorporated it into domestic law .
In most of the others , the law remains to be tested .
In 2005 the German federal administrative court ruled in favour of an army major who had refused to obey an order in case it implicated him in the Iraq war .
The court 's justification was that the war was a crime of aggression .
A study of the constitutions of western European nations in 1988 found that if there 's a conflict , most of them would place customary international law above domestic law , suggesting that a prosecution is possible .
President Blair would also be obliged to travel to countries outside the EU , including the other states of the former Soviet Union , many of which have now incorporated the crime of aggression .
He would have little control over his appointments , and everyone would know when he was coming .
It 's just possible that an investigating magistrate , like Baltasar Garzon , the Spanish judge who issued a warrant for the arrest of General Pinochet , would set the police on him .
But our best chance of putting pressure on reluctant authorities lies in a citizen 's arrest .
To stimulate this process , I will put up the first £ 100 of a bounty ( to which , if he gets the job , I will ask readers to subscribe ) , payable to the first person to attempt a non-violent arrest of President Blair .
It should n't be hard to raise several thousand pounds .
I will help set up a network of national arrest committees , exchanging information and preparing for the great man 's visits .
President Blair would have no hiding place : we will be with him wherever he goes .
Here is the case against him .
The Downing Street memo , a record of a meeting in July 2002 , reveals that Sir Richard Dearlove , director of the UK 's foreign intelligence service MI6 , told Blair that in Washington : " Military action was now seen as inevitable .
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . "
The foreign secretary ( Jack Straw ) then told Blair that " the case was thin .
Saddam was not threatening his neighbours , and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya , North Korea or Iran " .
He suggested that " we should work up a plan " to produce " legal justification for the use of force " .
The attorney general told the prime minister that there were only " three possible legal bases " for launching a war : " self - defence , humanitarian intervention , or UNSC [ security council ] authorisation .
The first and second could not be the base in this case . "
Bush and Blair later failed to obtain security council authorisation .
This short memo , which should be learned by heart by every citizen of the United Kingdom , reveals that Blair knew that the decision to attack Iraq had already been made ; that it preceded the justification , which was being retrofitted to an act of aggression ; that the only legal reasons for an attack did n't apply , and that the war could n't be launched without UN authorisation .
The legal status of Bush 's decision had already been explained to Blair .
In March 2002 , as another leaked memo shows , Jack Straw had reminded him of the conditions required to launch a legal war : " i ) There must be an armed attack upon a State or such an attack must be imminent ; ii )
The use of force must be necessary and other means to reverse / avert the attack must be unavailable ; iii )
The acts in self - defence must be proportionate and strictly confined to the object of stopping the attack . "
Straw explained that the development or possession of weapons of mass destruction " does not in itself amount to an armed attack ; what would be needed would be clear evidence of an imminent attack . "
A third memo , from the Cabinet Office , explained that " there is no greater threat now than in recent years that Saddam will use WMD … A legal justification for invasion would be needed .
Subject to Law Officers ' advice , none currently exists . "
It 's just a matter of getting him in front of a judge .
The crazy plan to make this mass murderer president could be the chance that many of us have been waiting for .
The high - pitched whine of a low - flying jet engine fills the air as the camera tracks across images of shimmering glass buildings , the Towers of Mammon in an unidentified urban CBD .
No , this is not the opening credits of The Apprentice , and dropping out of the sky is not UK Business Czar " Sralan " Sugar in his helicopter , but huge , hairy half - tonne polar bears .
Their falls are ( presumably deliberately ) reminiscent of jumpers from the 911 towers and with visceral violence the poor ursine beasts crash cruelly into the concrete and tarmac with sickening thuds .
The effect is shocking ; the message brutal : every short haul flight you take emits four hundred kilogrammes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent weight of an adult polar bear .
This is the new promotional film from anti-aviation expansion campaigners Plane Stupid .
It 's the latest in a series of climate change " shock ads " ranging from Greenpeace 's now slightly dated Friday the 13th in which a hijacked plane is flown into Sizewell nuclear power station while a family playing on the beach stands agog , to the government 's own recent Bedtime Stories short that ran as part of the wider , ongoing ACT on CO2 campaign .
We expect Greenpeace and Plane Stupid to be a bit more challenging in their approach , but in Bedtime Stories , as my colleague Henry put it rather eloquently it's as if the " green police " are climbing into bed with your children and telling them that , unless daddy turns the TV off standby , Mr Snuggles the dog sleeps with the fishes .
Stop climate change or the puppy gets it is not exactly the best motivational message ever .
And this inevitably begs the question do these shock tactics actually work to shift the public 's attitudes and behaviours ?
Conventional psychological theory suggests that shock ads used to work because their message wormed its way so deeply into our consciousness that we 're eventually compelled to act on it .
However we swiftly become desensitized and I 'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the over - hyped plight of the plucky polar bear in the context of climate change and the role of flying in fuelling the phenomenon .
But maybe the ad works by ramming home this link between high - carbon short haul flights and the fate of the Arctic ?
Certainly it 's controversial imagery will garner press interest , after all I 'm writing this analytical blog for starters , and for campaigning organisations with limited budgets and only one bite at the media cherry this is crucial .
However I 'm still not sure it will change behaviour , the danger is that by pumping up the high octane drama of an ad , you increase the risk of viewers feeling manipulated and dismissing it as pure propaganda .
Or lapsing into highly questionable failures of tact and taste in pursuit of ' edginess ' .
Far more effective I believe are the Airplot campaign by Greenpeace , led by the positive , party - style property - buying intervention in Sipson or the Trains vs Planes virals from the Campaign for Better Transport .
Shock ads work best when the consequences of the behaviour we wish to change are immediate , tangible and personal such as using a condom to prevent STDs or not drink driving .
They are less effective when the " costs " are long term , uncertain and shared such as with passive smoking or climate change .
This is why health campaigns like Change4life on obesity have concentrated on helping people do something positive rather than dwelling on the negative outcomes of inaction .
As climate evidence mounts up and the likelihood of anything meaningful coming out of the formerly crucial Copenhagen negotiations in December diminishes with every passing day the temptation to become shriller , angrier and more shocking in climate campaigning communications will only grow .
The risk is that this will simply step up the vilification of public behaviour , leading to people increasingly ignoring the very real threat of climate change and their responsibility in driving it .
Now that really would be shocking .

Help !
Baby elephant stuck after falling down manhole in Thailand
His startled expression and pleading eyes say it all .
Left stranded in a rather undignified position , this poor baby elephant was in need of some urgent help after he managed to wedge himself in a manhole in Thailand .
After missing his footing and falling down the gaping manhole of a drainage ditch the poor animal was left well and truly stuck .
Help :
The baby elephant had to be helped out of the hole by a bulldozer
The unfortunate accident took place while the elephant was out walking in the street with its owner in Rayong province , in the east of the country .
The baby had been taken out to work in the street by a mahout - the men who drive the elephants - but must not have been looking where he was going .
Rescuers spent three hours freeing the elephant , who was unharmed , by using a bulldozer to widen the hole .
While elephants are used to move large heavy objects in Thailand , many of the animals in Rayong province are trained to carry tourists on elephant treks through the jungle .
Mahouts also use elephants to beg on the streets of many large Thai cities and baby elephants , with their cute eyes and hairy heads , are among the most sought after .
Baby elephants are often taught tricks to appeal to tourists and , although it is illegal in many cities , work the streets with their owners from early in the morning to late at night .
Mahouts control the elephants using a small number of commands and a sharp hook , known as an angkus .
A Baptist Church near Asheville , N.C. , is hosting a “ Halloween book burning ” to purge the area of “ Satan ’s ” works , which include all non-King James versions of the Bible , popular books by many religious authors and even country music .
The website for the Amazing Grace Baptist Church in Canton , N.C. , says there are “ scriptural bases ” for the book burning .
The site quotes Acts 19:18 - 20 : “ And many that believed , came and confessed and shewed their deeds .
Many of them also which used curious arts , brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed . ”

Church leaders deem Good News for Modern Man , the Evidence Bible , the New International Version Bible , the Green Bible and the Message Bible , as well as at least seven other versions of the Bible as “ Satan ’s Bibles , ” according to the website .
Attendees will also set fire to “ Satan ’s popular books ” such as the work of “ heretics ” including the Pope , Mother Teresa , Billy Graham and Rick Warren .
“ I believe the King James version is God ’s preserved , inspired , inerrant and infallible word of God , ” Pastor Marc Grizzard told a local news station of his 14 - member parish .
Grizzard ’s parish website explains that the Bible is the “ final authority concerning all matters of faith and practice , ” for Amazing Grace Baptist Church .
In the Parish doctrinal statement , Grizzard expounds that “ the Scriptures shall be interpreted according to their normal grammatical - historical meaning , and all issues of interpretation and meaning shall be determined by the preacher . ”
The event also seeks to destroy “ Satan ’s music ” which includes every genre from country , rap and rock to “ soft and easy ” and “ Southern Gospel ” and ” contemporary Christian . ”
David Lynch , a resident of nearby Asheville , N.C. , told Raw Story “ it ’s a little disconcerting how close this is to my home . ”

“ They are burning so much stuff I ’ve dubbed them the hypocritical Christian Taliban , ” Lynch said in a phone interview with Raw Story .
“ Just the scope of all the information they want to destroy is pretty disturbing . ”
Church leaders did not respond to Raw Story ’s requests for comment , but the website notes they will be providing “ bar - b - que chicken , fried chicken and all the sides ” at the book burning .

I love Google — and I ’m not just saying that because they deliver 90 % of our traffic and more than 60 % of user OpenIDs , I swear .
But I am a little bitter that their OpenID support has two major flaws which cause us a great deal of ongoing pain :
Google ’s OpenIDs are domain specific .
The very same gmail account , if you sign up on 5 different OpenID enabled websites , will result in 5 different random hash OpenIDs being generated .
While this is probably OK in the general case ( though still an exceedingly rare behavior among OpenID providers ) , it ’s incredibly aggravating for us because we like to let users map their Stack Overflow , Server Fault , Super User , Meta , and Careers accounts to each other .
And cross -site user mapping is a huge PITA when there is no common per-user identifier between those 5 sites .
We have a workaround in place but it is not pretty , and I think writing it drove Jarrod to drink .
Google ’s OpenIDs are random hashes to the server .
This means I have no idea if you used crazyman45@gmail.com , hellaleet@gmail.com , or lovezwafflez1@gmail.com to sign up with us .
It is literally impossible for me to help you figure out which one you need to use to log in .
All I can tell you is , “ you used a gmail account ” .
Which one , I have no idea .
And neither do you , apparently .
While there is certainly an argument for privacy to be made here , it sure would be nice to have the choice between a random per-site hash OpenID like …
And a stable , readable OpenID like …
Well , the good news is , now you can !
Google just gave us a fantastic Thanksgiving Day present in the form of Google Profiles supporting OpenID .
And with a Google Profile , you get to pick a named URL of your choice !
So , if you ’d like to add a named Google OpenID to your account , here ’s how .
First , log in as yourself .
Go to your user page and look for the “ add openid ” or “ change openid ” link .
( Note that we support up to two openids per account and you can change them at any time . )
Since you ’re already logged in you are adding a new openid .
Enter your Google Profile URL in the area where it says “ manually enter your OpenID URL ” , and click Login .
You ’ll get redirected to Google where you can OK the use of your OpenID by our website .
You ’ll get redirected back to us , and we confirm that yes , indeed , you do want to add this OpenID to your account .
( In case you ’re wondering , this confirmation is required — otherwise clicking a single evil link could automatically and silently add a new , rogue OpenID to your account effectively owning you . )
Now you ’re back on your user page — note the newly added OpenID on my account .
And if I want to change it , I can just click “ Change OpenID ” any time I want .
The only thing that throws a monkey wrench into this process is when you have a single OpenID provider and that provider either changes their string format , or goes belly - up .
Do n’t worry , both cases are fixable , but it requires emailing us .
Still , I highly recommend having two different OpenID providers associated with your account at any given time .
Kudos to Google for rolling out named OpenID support in the form of Google Profiles .
While you can of course continue to use the existing Google OpenID support , if you plan to use multiple ‘ stack sites ( or Stack Exchange sites )
I assure you that your life will be much easier if you pick a stable , named Google OpenID rather than relying on the default random hashes .
Bill Sparkman had taken out insurance policies shortly before his death
A US census worker who was found hanging naked from a tree and bound with duct tape killed himself but made it look like a murder , authorities say .
Bill Sparkman , 51 , was found dead on 12 September in rural Kentucky with the word " Fed " scrawled on his chest .
Authorities investigated the mysterious death to see whether Sparkman was the victim of anti-government sentiment .
Investigators concluded the word " Fed " had been written from top to bottom and Sparkman alone manipulated the suicide .
" Our investigation based on evidence and witness testimony , has concluded that Mr Sparkman died during an intentional , self - inflicted act that was staged to appear as a homicide , " said Kentucky State police captain Lisa Rudzinski .
" A thorough examination of evidence from the scene , to include DNA testing , as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence resulted in the determination that Mr Sparkman , alone , handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved . "
It was also discovered that Sparkman had recently taken out prior to his death two accidental life insurance policies totalling $ 600,000 ( £ 362,000 ) , and that if he was killed on the job his family would receive an additional $ 10,000 from the government .
However , the life insurance policies did not cover suicide .
The Large Hadron Collider was shut down yesterday by a hamster in a tutu , weary scientists announced .
The Large Hadron Collider is the successor to the earlier Superconducting Super Collider , which was shut down by the US House of Representatives in 1993 after 14 miles of tunnel had been constructed at a cost of $ 2 billion .
Since its inception , the Large Hadron Collider has been plagued by construction delays , dead technicians , broken magnet supports , electrical faults , helium containment failures , vacuum leaks , birds with baguettes , terrorists , ninjas , pirates , supervillains , hurricanes , asteroids , cosmic energy storms , and a runaway train .
On one occasion it was discovered that the entire 17 - mile circular tunnel had been built upside - down due to a sign error in the calculations , and the whole facility had to be carefully flipped by a giant spatula .
One year ago , hopes were raised for the first time in decades when it was discovered that all the incidents up until that point had been the work of a sinister globe - spanning conspiracy of religious fanatics who , inspired by the term " God Particle " , had decided that no one could ever be allowed to look upon the hypothetical Higgs boson .
This discovery was widely considered to have undermined the theory that Nature abhors a sufficiently powerful particle collider .
Though some found it suspicious that the Higgs boson would even have a religious cult devoted to preventing its observation , the affair did have a patina of surface plausibility - after all , a giant plot to prevent physicists from observing the Higgs boson makes around as much sense as anything else religious people do .
After the conspiracy was shut down by heroic international detectives in an operation so hugely dramatic that it would be pointless to summarize it here , the world began to wonder whether the LHC might really , really work this time around .
Scientists everywhere held their breaths as the bodies were cleared out , the tunnels reconditioned , and the broken magnets replaced , all without incident .
The price of large hadrons held steady on the commodities market , permitting the LHC 's reservoirs to be fully stocked .
Proton beams were successfully formed and circulated through the giant tunnel .
Moments before the first collision was scheduled to probe the theretofore - unachieved energy of 3.5 TeV , a hamster in a tutu materialized from nowhere at the intended collision point .
The poor creature did n't even have time for a terrified squeak before the two proton beams smashed into it , releasing the equivalent energy of 724 megajoules or 173 kilograms of TNT .
The dispirited scientists of the LHC have announced that this will create a 24 - month delay while tiny bits of hamster are cleaned out of the tunnels and anti-hamster - materialization fields are installed in the collider .
At the poorly attended press conference , journalists asked whether it might finally be time to give up .
" Nature 's just messing with you , man , " said a reporter from the New York Times .
" You need to admit this is n't going to work out . "
Professor Nicholas von Shnicker , project leader of the LHC , responded .
" NEVER ! " shrieked von Shnicker , spittle flying from his lips and spattering on his ragged beard .
" Ve vill NEVER give up !
My father spent his life trying to make the LHC vork , and his father !
Even if it takes a century , if it takes a thousand years or ten thousand million years , VE VILL SEE THE HIGGS BOSON IN OUR LIFETIMES ! "
Prof. Kill McBibben is the author of the recently released book Enough , which proposes a new theory of the mysterious Counter - Force that prevents the LHC from operating .
" It 's not the Higgs boson going back in time , " says Prof.
McBibben , " nor is it the anthropic principle preventing a black hole from forming .
We 've just hit the point that we all knew was coming - that we all knew had to happen someday .
We 've reached the limits of human science .
We are just not allowed to build colliders at higher than a certain energy , or know more than a certain amount of particle physics .
This is the end of the road .
We 're done . "
A federal judge ruled Monday that a lawsuit can move forward against the Patent and Trademark Office and the research company that was awarded exclusive rights to human genes known to detect early signs of breast and ovarian cancer .
The first - of - its - kind lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law claims that the patents violate free speech by restricting research .
U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet of New York , in ruling that the case may proceed to trial , noted that the litigation might open the door to challenges of a host of other patented genes .
About one - fifth of the human genome is covered under patent applications and claims .
Sweet wrote : ( .pdf )
The challenges to the patents - in - suit raise questions of difficult legal dimensions concerning constitutional protections over the information that serves as our genetic identities and the need to adopt policies that promote scientific innovation and biomedical research .
The widespread use of gene sequence information as the foundation for biomedical research means that resolution of these issues will have far - reaching implications , not only for gene - based health care and the health of millions of women facing the specter of breast cancer , but also for the future course of biomedical research .
The case against the patent office and patent - holder Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City is the first to challenge a patented gene under a civil rights allegation — in this case the First Amendment .
According to the federal lawsuit , filed in the Southern District of New York , the First Amendment is at stake because the patents are so broad they bar scientists from examining and comparing the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes ( . pdf ) at the center of the dispute .
In short , the patents issued more than a decade ago cover any new scientific methods of looking at these human genes that might be developed by others .
According to the plaintiffs — dozens of patients and researchers — the genes cannot be patented because they exist as naturally occurring products of nature .
The suit claims Myriad did not invent , create or in any way construct or engineer the genes .
Rather , Myriad located them in nature and described their information content as it exists and functions in nature , the suit claims .
In defense , Myriad argued that , among other things , the lawsuit should be tossed because the plaintiffs have no legal standing to bring the case , even though they were " ready .
willing and able to infringe . "
Myriad also argued that there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs ' claims .
The judge disagreed in an 85 - page filing .
The judge noted that the plaintiffs contended that patents grant Myriad ownership rights over products of nature , laws of nature , natural phenomena , abstract ideas and basic human knowledge and thought in violation of the First Amendment 's protections over freedom of thought .
" The facts alleged in the complaint are plausible , specific and form a sufficient basis for plaintiffs ' legal arguments , " the judge wrote .
Judge Sweet cautioned , however , that his ruling was at a preliminary stage of litigation , when one side seeks to dismiss a case before more - intense litigation –- and the possible sharing of confidential information –- begins .
" The question before the court is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims , " Sweet wrote .
The patents at issue give Myriad Genetics a virtual monopoly on such predictive testing for breast and ovarian cancer , according to the suit .
Women who fear they may be at an increased risk are barred from having anyone look at their BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes or interpret them except for the patent holder , which charges about $ 3,000 per test .
About 10 percent of women with breast cancer are likely to have a mutation inherited from their parents in the genes at issue , according to the suit .
The Patent and Trademark Office first issued a patent for a human gene in 1982 to the Regents of the University of California in connection with a hormone promoting breast development during pregnancy .

My father and uncle were reminiscing about their youth , and shared a rather Darwinian story .
In their twenties , they succeeded in assembling one great car out of three junkers .
After they accomplished this , they had enough parts leftover to make a second working car -- but only barely .
This car was missing most of its floorboards , so they could see the ground flash past while driving .
They called this a feature rather than a flaw , and decided to have fun with it .
In the Fifties , high - powered explosives were still easy to acquire .
So , with quarter sticks of dynamite at hand , my future father and his brother drove around throwing dynamite sticks through the gaps in the floorboards , and basically scaring the daylights out of people in cars behind them .
THIS WAS FUN !
They even shortened the fuses to make sure that the sticks would " safely " explode before the car behind them drove over them .
When I heard this story , my first response was , " Were n't you concerned about the gas tank below you ? "
To my amazement they both looked rather surprised , exchanged glances , and said , " We never thought of that ! "
My grandfather just laughed and walked out of the room .

A firefighter looks through the ruins of the building at 457 Notre Dame Ave .
A deadly fire at a Winnipeg bathhouse was alleged started by a customer who was angry to learn he'd had a sexual tryst with a man he thought was actually a woman , the Free Press has learned .
Two people died in the Oct. 11 blaze at the Aquarius Men's Bath while nearly 40 other patrons were able to escape .

Justin Rosdobutko , 25 , has been charged with two counts of manslaughter .
He remains before the courts and is presumed innocent .
His lawyer said this week he plans to vigorously fight the charges .
A friend who went with Rosdobutko to " co-ed " night at the Notre Dame business spoke out this week on the condition his name not be published because of safety concerns .
He has given a lengthy statement to police and is considered a key Crown witness .
" We had been out all night and , I do n't know , we just decided to go there , " said the man .
He said they went downstairs into the locker room area and changed into towels .
They checked out several rooms on the main floor of the facility but eventually became separated .
" A little later on I ran back into him .
He was upset , " said the friend .
The friend claims Rosdobutko told him he had met someone he believed to be a woman , only to discover it was a transvestite .
He felt like he'd been " tricked . "
" I guess anybody would be upset by that , " the friend said .
The two men returned downstairs to get changed back into their street clothes .
Suddenly people began yelling about a fire on the main floor .
Robert Clark
" It was a total panic to get out .
I 've never been in a fire before , " said the friend .
He and Rosdobutko fled the facility and stood outside for several minutes , watching the blaze .
He said Rosdobutko was initially interviewed by police as a witness .
The investigation changed once the friend gave his statement to investigators .
" I 'm just so confused , so stressed , " said the friend , who has n't talked to Rosdobutko since he was arrested .
" I just ca n't see him doing this , I 've known him for a long time , " he said .
Rosdobutko is being held in custody at the Remand Centre .
He was denied bail on Monday .
A court - ordered ban prevents specific details of the hearing from being published .
Rosdobutko
Robert Gene Clark , 62 , of Saskatchewan and Steven Yablonski , 23 , of Winnipeg both died in the blaze .
Police say their investigation is ongoing and further charges could be laid .
They say there is no evidence at this time to suggest the fire meets the definition of a hate crime .
Visitors at the bathhouse frequently roam throughout the building to socialize with each other and have sex in bedrooms there .
The fire caused about $ 500,000 damage to the property at 457 Notre Dame Ave .
The bathhouse 's owner , Somchai Pengpharsuks , lost another business to arson in 1999 , the King and Alexander Steam Baths .
Family members say Rosdobutko often spoke of his dream to become a Winnipeg firefighter .
He is the father of a five - year - old girl , who lives with her mother .
" He 's a good person , a loving and caring father .
He 's not some irresponsible punk , that 's always been our impression , " his uncle , Jamey Rosdobutko , said last week .

A Mesa woman has filed suit in Maricopa County Superior Court accusing a local sports bar of violating city codes by not applying for a building permit for a stripper pole that she toppled from , cutting her ring finger .
ReAnna M. Hedrick , 28 , claims in the October 16 suit that on September 3 , 2008 , she was at Famous Sam's Sports Bar in Mesa , now under a different name , for " Ladies Night " when she thought it would be a good idea to try her hand at the makeshift stripper pole set up in the bar .
As she was spinning and sliding , her suit says , the pole broke from its anchoring in the ceiling and Hedrick 's showgirl moment was shattered .
As Hedrick and the pole came crashing down , her suit says , she grabbed for the top of the pole , which had a jagged edge that sliced the top of her ring finger .
Calls to Hedrick 's lawyer , Lewis Moore III , were not immediately returned , but the bar owner was happy to give New Times his take on the situation .
David Moore calls the case " the definition of a frivolous lawsuit . "
Moore , who admits he was n't there when the incident happened , says the woman was at the bar for a few hours before she decided to take her partying to the pole .
Moore says the pole was n't supposed to be there : it was a gimmick used by a karaoke company .
Moore says the only news he 's heard about the incident came from his insurance company , which he says is handling the lawsuit .

On MSNBC ’s Morning Joe today , host and Republican Joe Scarborough drilled Rush Limbaugh for cheering Chicago ’s failed 2016 Olympic bid .
Scarborough said , “ I will tell you middle Americans that swing elections see that and go oh my God Republicans have gone off the deep end . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
After it was announced that Chicago did not get the Olympic bid , Limbaugh said , “ Obama been “ running around the world for nine months telling everybody how much our country sucks .
He ’s been running around the world apologizing for the United States of America .
Why would anybody award the Olympics to such a crappy place as the United States of America ? ”

Scarborough replied , “ I actually wrote something this weekend just asking a very simple question .
What would have happened if liberals cheered had cheered against the United States getting the Olympics ?
… I would like Rush Limbaugh to tell me who is he helping there other than Rush Limbaugh , because I will tell you , middle Americans , Rush is smarter than that .
Middle Americans that swing elections see that , and go oh my God , Republicans have gone off the deep end . ”
While talking to Katty Kay of the BBC , Scarborough continued , “ I was disheartened over the past eight years .
If I was Paul Krugman , I probably would n’t cast stones regarding blind ideologues , but over the past eight years Democrats hated everything that Bush did .
Bush was called Nazi , socialist , etc. etc .
Now it ’s turned , and now it ’s Barack Obama .
We Republicans did it to Bill Clinton for eight years .
It always seems that one side feels the need to delegitimize the other side .
This can not be helpful to our political process . ”
Scarborough wrapped up the segment with , “ You know what ’s so interesting is , Katty makes a great point .
About 40 % of Americans call themselves conservative .
Twenty percent of Americans call themselves liberal .
This is n’t like the old split in the Republican Party where you used to have moderate Republicans against conservative Republicans .
This has nothing to do with ideology .
This has to do with the harshness of rhetoric .
This is just intemperate people versus temperate people .
It ’s disgusting . ”
Joe Scarborough is an endangered species .
He is a non-radicalized Republican .
I disagree with the vast majority of Scarborough ’s stances on policy , but he understands that cheering a failed Olympic bid by a U.S. city does not help the GOP .
The political environment was absolutely toxic during the Clinton / Bush years , and as a consequence , nothing significant and lasting survived the legislative process .
Republicans have learned this lesson , and are trying to poison the well again to stop Obama .
Scarborough is correct when he looks at the big picture and concludes that the rhetoric of Beck and Limbaugh does n’t help the political process or the Republican Party .
The big winners here are Beck and Limbaugh .
I can see conservative talk radio’s cheering against America being used in campaign ads in 2010 and 2012 .
I am certain that talk radio has gone off the deep end , but I am not sure if this translates to the Republican Party in the minds of American voters yet .
I can see Democrats trying to make that connection for them , and if they are successful , they could absolutely bury the Republican Party .
Republicans need to start listening to Scarborough ’s warnings , and stop follow Beck and Limbaugh off the political cliff .
OTTAWA , Nov. 20 ( Xinhua ) --
About 170,000 doses of A / H1N1 flu vaccine are being withdrawn in Canada from Friday after health officials reported an unusually high number of allergic reactions .
Health officials in the western province of Manitoba reported Thursday a higher - than - usual number of allergic reactions after using vaccine from a batch manufactured by a factory of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) in Quebec .
Usually one or two allergic reactions are expected for a batch of that size , but Manitoba has recorded six severe allergic reactions .
GSK said Friday in a statement that the recall was a precaution and they would investigate to see whether there was something wrong with the batch .
Another province which has been using the vaccine did not report any rise in adverse reactions .
Of the 6.6 million people that had been vaccinated , there were 36 serious adverse reactions , Dr. David Butler - Jones , the country 's chief public health officer , said earlier this week .
One person was believed to have died from a serious reaction to the vaccine , but the death had not been conclusively linked to the flu shot , he said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An outbreak of food - borne illness , linked to dangerous bacteria in ground beef , sickened 28 people and may have caused two deaths in the U.S. Northeast , health officials said on Monday .
A picture of E.coli bacteria is seen in this undated file photo from the USDA .
A New Hampshire resident reportedly died after consuming ground beef that may have been tainted by bacteria that can cause diarrhea , dehydration and kidney failure .
The U.S. Agriculture Department said it became aware the meat might be tainted by E. coli O157:H7 bacteria during an investigation of a cluster of food - borne illnesses in New England .
REUTERS / USDA / Handout
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all but three of the illnesses were in the Northeast and 18 were in the six New England states .
A common strain of E. coli bacteria was involved so tests were under way to see if all of the reported cases have the same cause .
State officials said a death in New Hampshire was linked to the ground beef that is being recalled by Fairbank Farms of Ashville , New York .
The New York State Health Department said a death in the Albany area from E. coli O157:H7 bacteria was being investigated to see if it is linked .
New Hampshire officials did not release information about the death in their state .
The death in New York state last month involved an adult with underlying medical conditions , said the CDC .
Two people were hospitalized in New Hampshire .
Fairbank Farms announced the recall on Saturday of 545,699 lbs ( 248,450 kg ) of fresh ground beef products .
The beef was produced in mid-September and probably was labeled for sale by the end of the month , said USDA .
The Agriculture Department , which oversees meat safety , said an investigation led it to conclude “ there is an association between the fresh ground beef products and illnesses in Connecticut , Maine and Massachusetts . ”
USDA worked with state and federal officials in examining a cluster of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses .
A potentially deadly bacteria , E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration and , in severe cases , kidney failure .
The very young , the elderly and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness .
USDA said it would examine Fairbank Farms ’ food safety plan this week .
A string of food - borne safety scares led the U.S. House of Representatives to pass legislation this summer to require more inspections and oversight of food manufacturers and would give the government new authority to order recalls .
The Fairbank Farms beef went to retailers including Trader Joe ’s , Price Chopper , Lancaster and Wild Harvest , Shaw ’s , a unit of Supervalu , BJ’s , Ford Brothers and Giant , a unit of Ahold , in eight states -- Connecticut , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Virginia .
A complete list of products is available at :
link.reuters.com/vyx27f
The beef was produced September 14 - 16 , and the company urged consumers to check their freezers for products listed in the recall .
Labels of the recalled packages will say EST 492 inside the USDA seal .
Meet Koh and Yurie .
They 're a happily married young Japanese couple who moved from Tokyo to San Francisco a year ago due to a job transfer .
In early September , while on a business trip back home , Koh bought a new game cartridge for his Nintendo DS .
It was mostly out of curiosity — the Japanese Twitterati were all abuzz over a new dating sim called Love Plus , and he just wanted to see what the hype was about .
" I 've tried the other dating sims before just for kicks , but I never got hooked , " he says .
" I did n't expect this to be any different . "
He was wrong .
During that one week in Tokyo , Koh found himself fully committed to his virtual relationship with Rinko , a pouty , hard - ass high school girl who hung out at the library .
The relationship was formal at first , consisting of awkward whispered conversations in which she sent mixed signals and called him by his last name .
As things got more heated , though , she started calling him Kohichi ( calling someone by the first name still carries a degree of intimacy in Japan ) and became more demanding of his attention .
" I felt like I might get sucked into this world , " Koh , who is an engineer at a major game manufacturer by day , tells me .
" It 's not like any dating sim with young girls in it becomes a hit , but this one is really well - made . "
An article posted on a Japanese tech site in September told the story of several women who had complained on an online bulletin about how their family lives were disrupted by husbands addicted to Konami's hit game .
Last weekend , I invited Koh and Yurie over to my house to talk about Koh 's virtual relationship with Rinko , and how — if at all — it had impacted their real world husband - and - wife dynamic .
Koh , what do you and Rinko do together ?
Koh : OK , this is pretty embarrassing .
The DS has a mic and a touchscreen , so … one time , she asked me to say " I love you " a hundred times into the mic .
I was on the airplane when she asked me that , so I was like , no way .
There was also this part where you have to hold her hand on the touchscreen .
If you touch her hand with the stylus , you get to hold her hand .
And then there 's the part where you have to kiss her .
Did you do it ?
Koh : No , no !
The girl 's face shows up on the screen , and you have to touch her lips to give her a kiss .
That 's pretty weird ….
this is embarrassing .
I 'm sweating right now just talking about it .
Yurie : Ew .
Do people really do that ?
Koh : I guess some people do .
What do you think , Yurie ?
Yurie : Until now , I was n't aware of the specifics of the game .
Hearing it now , I 'm like , barf .
That 's just gross .
Koh : I know .
It 's pretty gross .
I really would n't want my wife to see me playing this , me desperately trying to hold hands with a touchscreen .
Yurie :
It sounds like you can really experience the realness of dating .
Koh : Yeah .. the girl also talks a lot .
You hear her voice at every part of the game .
A lot of dating sims are mostly text , but this one has a real humanistic side to it .
I think this comes down to the fact that men are simple .
This is obviously a computer program , but this makes us really feel like there 's a girl inside the DS .
It feels dangerous , like I might get sucked into this world .
Some guys on the Internet are saying that their Love Plus relationships feel more real .
They feel like they 're with their girlfriend every day .
I kinda get it .
But Koh , you have a real woman in your life .
Koh :
That 's why I was able to come back .
Thank god !
I was only stuck in that world for about a week .
Also , I got hooked when I was in Japan on a business trip , so when I came back to San Francisco , I did n't play it that much .
Maybe just for a day .
In the bathtub .
Yurie : I did n't really see him playing it .
Koh :
It 's pretty damn embarrassing .
I think if I was n't able to come back from that world , I would have run out of things to talk about with my real wife .
I can understand why some couples would get in a fight over that .
Yurie , does this bother you at all ?
Yurie :
Not at all .
If he 's just enjoying it as a game , that 's fine with me .
I do n't care that he has a girlfriend inside of the game at all .
I 'm just like , oh okay .
So that 's what you 're into right now .
If we were to get into a fight over this , it would be less about the content of the game and more about how much time he spends playing it .
It does n't matter what he 's doing , but if he spends too much time on the computer , then that 's not good .
Koh : Yeah , if I was playing too many games and that was compromising the time I spent in my real life , that would be a problem .
It 's the same with Second Life or World of Warcraft .
If I got too into something and could n't come back , that would be a problem .
At the same time , though , the danger I felt when I almost got sucked into Love Plus was very human .
If I was single and had gotten too into this …
I do n't know , I recognized that there was a me in there that could have a real attachment to this artificial character on the other side of the DS screen .
It made me think that humans could probably pretty easily develop feelings for AI robots .
It 's the same with animals , right ?
Animals do n't speak words but you can really love them .
But I do think it has something to do with the simplicity of men .
I 'd be really curious to see how women would react to a boy version of Love Plus .
Yurie :
If there was a boy version , I think most women would be able to clearly distinguish between real life and in - game life .
I have celebrities I like , too , but then I also have a husband .
And they 're totally separate .
So what is your Love Plus girlfriend doing now ?
Koh : I 'm too scared to find out .
I 'm probably going to get in big trouble if I open it after leaving her alone for several weeks .
Maybe she 's dead now .
That would be scary .
Yurie : Does that happen ?
Koh : I do n't think so .
But remember Tamagochi ?
They used to die if you did n't feed them .
Yurie :
Oh yeah .
That would be kind of bittersweet .
Update : Koh is informing me that , since our interview a week ago , Yurie has now become addicted to a mini game in Ryu ga Gotoku 3 that entails training a cabaret girl to become the # 1 earner at the club .
" I 've never seen her enjoy a game like that before , " he says .
" The graphics are realistic , and she gets to choose the girl 's makeup , etc .
Now I 'm thinking that maybe women get more hooked on games that involve nurturing or becoming someone . "

Scientists have deciphered the three - dimensional structure of the human genome , paving the way for new insights into genomic function and expanding our understanding of how cellular DNA folds at scales that dwarf the double helix .
In a paper featured this week on the cover of the journal Science , they describe a new technology called Hi-C and apply it to answer the thorny question of how each of our cells stows some three billion base pairs of DNA while maintaining access to functionally crucial segments .
The paper comes from a team led by scientists at Harvard University , the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT , University of Massachusetts Medical School , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" We 've long known that on a small scale , DNA is a double helix , " says co-first author Erez Lieberman - Aiden , a graduate student in the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Science and Technology and a researcher at Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and in the laboratory of Eric Lander at the Broad Institute .
" But if the double helix did n't fold further , the genome in each cell would be two meters long .
Scientists have not really understood how the double helix folds to fit into the nucleus of a human cell , which is only about a hundredth of a millimeter in diameter .
This new approach enabled us to probe exactly that question . "
The researchers report two striking findings .
First , the human genome is organized into two separate compartments , keeping active genes separate and accessible while sequestering unused DNA in a denser storage compartment .
Chromosomes snake in and out of the two compartments repeatedly as their DNA alternates between active , gene - rich and inactive , gene - poor stretches .
" Cells cleverly separate the most active genes into their own special neighborhood , to make it easier for proteins and other regulators to reach them , " says Job Dekker , associate professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at UMass Medical School and a senior author of the Science paper .
Second , at a finer scale , the genome adopts an unusual organization known in mathematics as a " fractal . "
The specific architecture the scientists found , called a " fractal globule , " enables the cell to pack DNA incredibly tightly -- the information density in the nucleus is trillions of times higher than on a computer chip -- while avoiding the knots and tangles that might interfere with the cell 's ability to read its own genome .
Moreover , the DNA can easily unfold and refold during gene activation , gene repression , and cell replication .
" Nature 's devised a stunningly elegant solution to storing information -- a super - dense , knot - free structure , " says senior author Eric Lander , director of the Broad Institute , who is also professor of biology at MIT , and professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School .
In the past , many scientists had thought that DNA was compressed into a different architecture called an " equilibrium globule , " a configuration that is problematic because it can become densely knotted .
The fractal globule architecture , while proposed as a theoretical possibility more than 20 years ago , has never previously been observed .
Key to the current work was the development of the new Hi-C technique , which permits genome - wide analysis of the proximity of individual genes .
The scientists first used formaldehyde to link together DNA strands that are nearby in the cell 's nucleus .
They then determined the identity of the neighboring segments by shredding the DNA into many tiny pieces , attaching the linked DNA into small loops , and performing massively parallel DNA sequencing .
" By breaking the genome into millions of pieces , we created a spatial map showing how close different parts are to one another , " says co-first author Nynke van Berkum , a postdoctoral researcher at UMass Medical School in Dekker 's laboratory .
" We made a fantastic three - dimensional jigsaw puzzle and then , with a computer , solved the puzzle . "

Nutt said skunk use had not caused an upswing in schizophrenia
The row over the reclassification of cannabis has been reignited after the government 's chief drug adviser accused ministers of " devaluing " the evidence .
Professor David Nutt , of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , says it does not cause major health issues .
He accused ex-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith of " devaluing " scientific research .
The Home Office said his view did not reflect that of the government .
In 2004 cannabis went from class B to C . In 2008 , Ms Smith returned it to B. A Home Office spokesman said : " Prof Nutt 's views are his own . "
He added : " The government is clear : we are determined to crack down on all illegal substances and minimise their harm to health and society as a whole . "
It comes after Prof Nutt used a lecture at King 's College in London and briefing paper to attack what he called the " artificial " separation of alcohol and tobacco from illegal drugs .
Precautionary measure A spokesman for the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said Prof Nutt spoke as an academic , and not for the council .
The professor said smoking cannabis created only a " relatively small risk " of psychotic illness , and claimed those who advocated moving ecstasy into Class B from Class A had " won the intellectual argument " .
Public concern over the links between high - strength cannabis , known as skunk , and mental illness led the government to reclassify cannabis to Class B from C last year .
DRUG CLASSIFICATIONS
Class A : Ecstasy , LSD , heroin , cocaine , crack , magic mushrooms , amphetamines ( if prepared for injection ) Class B : Amphetamines , Cannabis , Methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) , Pholcodine Class C : Tranquilisers , some painkillers , Gamma hydroxybutyrate ( GHB ) , Ketamine .

In 2004 , then Home Secretary David Blunkett had approved the reclassification of cannabis from Class B - which it had been since 1971 - to Class C. But in 2008 , Jacqui Smith announced that she would reverse the 2004 decision and put cannabis back into category B .
The decision was taken despite official advisers recommending against the change .
Ministers said they wanted to make the move as a precautionary measure .
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) review of cannabis classification , which was ordered in 2007 , was the result of a " skunk scare " , according to the professor .
In his lecture and briefing paper , entitled Estimating Drug Harms : A Risky Business ? , he repeated his claim that the risks of taking ecstasy are no worse than riding a horse .
Prof Nutt also warned that the reclassification decision may lead to more people taking the drug .
" It may be that if you move a drug up a class it has a greater cachet , " he said , adding the government 's approach " starts to distort the value of evidence " .

He cited research which " estimates that , to prevent one episode of schizophrenia , we would need to stop about 5,000 men aged 20 to 25 years from ever using the drug " .
He said skunk has been in wide usage for about 10 years but , he claims , there has been no upswing in schizophrenia .
The professor accepts cannabis can sometimes cause mental illness , but argues it is safer than tobacco and alcohol and , overall , does not lead to major health problems .
Prof Nutt said : " We have to accept young people like to experiment - with drugs and other potentially harmful activities - and what we should be doing in all of this is to protect them from harm at this stage of their lives .
" We therefore have to provide more accurate and credible information .
If you think that scaring kids will stop them using , you are probably wrong . "
Prof Nutt added : " All drugs are dangerous and what we 're trying to do is educate the population of drug users about the harms of drugs so that no - one can say they have n't been told . "
Following these comments , a spokesman for the ACMD said : " The lecture Prof Nutt gave at King 's College was in his academic capacity and was not in his role as chair of the ACMD .
" We acknowledge that the lecture has prompted further debate on the harms of drugs . "

Physicists at UC San Diego have successfully created speedy integrated circuits with particles called “ excitons ” that operate at commercially cold temperatures , bringing the possibility of a new type of extremely fast computer based on excitons closer to reality .
Their discovery , detailed this week in the advance online issue of the journal Nature Photonics , follows the team ’s demonstration last summer of an integrated circuit — an assembly of transistors that is the building block for all electronic devices — capable of working at 1.5 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero .
That temperature , equivalent to minus 457 degrees Fahrenheit , is not only less than the average temperature of deep space , but achievable only in special research laboratories .
Now the scientists report that they have succeeded in building an integrated circuit that operates at 125 degrees Kelvin , a temperature that while still a chilly minus 234 degrees Fahrenheit , can be easily attained commercially with liquid nitrogen , a substance that costs about as much per liter as gasoline .
“ Our goal is to create efficient devices based on excitons that are operational at room temperature and can replace electronic devices where a high interconnection speed is important , ” said Leonid Butov , a professor of physics at UCSD , who headed the research team .
“ We ’re still in an early stage of development .
Our team has only recently demonstrated the proof of principle for a transistor based on excitons and research is in progress . ”
Excitons are pairs of negatively charged electrons and positively charged “ holes ” that can be created by light in a semiconductor such as gallium arsenide .
When the electron and hole recombine , the exciton decays and releases its energy as a flash of light .
The fact that excitons can be converted into light makes excitonic devices faster and more efficient than conventional electronic devices with optical interfaces , which use electrons for computation and must then convert them to light for use in communications devices .
" Our transistors process signals using excitons , which like electrons can be controlled with electrical voltages , but unlike electrons transform into photons at the output of the circuit , ” Butov said .
“ This direct coupling of excitons to photons allows us to link computation and communication . "
Other members of the team involved in the discovery were physicists Gabriele Grosso , Joe Graves , Aaron Hammack and Alex High at UC San Diego , and materials scientists Micah Hanson and Arthur Gossard at UC Santa Barbara .
Their research was supported by the Army Research Office , the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation .
Health care bill : Calorie counts for Big Macs , vending machines
Democrats want you to know that your McDonald 's Angus Burger meal has about 1,500 calories -- before you buy and burp .
Buried deep in the House health care bill is a provision , likely to raise nanny - state hackles , requiring fast - food chains and vending machine owners to notify customers of calorie counts -- by conspicuously posting nutritional information on menus or machines .
The provision -- Section 2572 -- requires retail food establishments " part of a chain with 20 or more locations " to list calorie counts " on the menu board including a drive - through board , " as is currently required in New York City and other localities .
A " vending machine operator shall provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button " that includes similar data .
Exemptions include items that will be on the menu for less than 60 days -- and limited test runs of food products .
It merges the language of Sen. Tom Carper 's LEAN
Act the MEAL Act , sponsored by Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) and Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , earlier this year .
Such labeling can have a significant impact on consumption habits .
NYC's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene polled 10,000 customers to assess the impact of the city 's menu labeling law , which went into effect in March 2008 , and found that burger buyers ate about 106 fewer calories per purchase .
The idea is popular among progressives and public health types who think it could reduce obesity , hypertension and diabetes rates -- particularly among inner-city folks whose diets are disproportionately composed of cheap , tasty , calorie - loaded Big Macs , Whoppers and Chalupas .
But conservatives and libertarians see it as a major encroachment of the nanny state that has no place in a bill that 's supposed to address affordability , insurance industry abuses and expanding coverage .
Radley Balko at Reason.com on the MEAL bill : " Supporters of menu labeling laws know that complying with these laws will be expensive and onerous .
That 's why they 've only applied them to chain restaurants — restaurants they say can afford to send dishes off for nutritional testing .
That makes the targets of menu labeling laws corporations , a more politically palatable target than the mom and pop diner . "
In June , the National Restaurant Association threw its support behind the Harkin - DeLauro compromise .

Compromised Climate Scientists should be excluded from IPCC , Leading Climate Scientist says —
[ By Professor Hans von Storch of the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg , Germany – Director of Institute for Coastal Research of the GKSS Research Centre in Geesthacht ]
Professor Hans von Storch http://coast.gkss.de/staff/storch/:
There are a number of problematic statements , which will be discussed in the media and the blogosphere .
I found the style of communication revealing , speaking about other people and their ideas , joining forces to “ kill ” papers , exchanges of “ improving ” presentations without explaining .
Also mails from / to Eduardo Zorita and myself are included ; also we have been subject of frequent mentioning , usually not in a flattering manner .
Interesting exchanges , and evidences , are contained about efforts to destroy “ Climate Research ” ; that we in the heydays of the hockeystick debate shared our ECHO -G data with our adversaries ; and that Mike Mann was successful to exclude me from a review - type meeting on historical reconstructions in Wengen ( demonstrating again his problematic but powerful role of acting as a gatekeeper . )
I would assume that more interesting issues will be found in the files , and that a useful debate about the degree of politicization of climate science will emerge .
A conclusion could be that the principle , according to which data must be made public , so that also adversaries may check the analysis , must be really enforced .
Another conclusion could be that scientists like Mike Mann , Phil Jones and others should no longer participate in the peer - review process or in assessment activities like IPCC . [… ]

History Lesson : September Is Best Month for Gold
We ’re heading into September next week , so it ’s a good time to revisit the historic seasonality of gold and gold stocks .
Over the past four decades , September has been the best time for gold in terms of its month - over - month price appreciation .
You can see this on the chart below – in a typical year , the price of gold in September rises 2.5 percent above its August price .
The gold price has risen in 16 of the 20 Septembers since 1989 , by far the best success ratio of any month of the year .
Source : U.S. Global research
What accounts for this predictable trend ?
September kicks off several of the planet ’s most potent gold - demand drivers :
The post - monsoon wedding season in India and Diwali , one of the country ’s most important festivals ;
Restocking by jewelry makers in advance of the Christmas shopping season in the United States ;
The holy month of Ramadan in the Muslim world , whose end in late September is marked by a period of celebration and gift - giving ;
And in China , the week - long National Day celebration starting October 1 and the run-up to the Chinese New Year in early 2010 .
This could be a challenging September in India , the world ’s largest gold consumer .
The economic slowdown and gold prices near record highs drove jewelry demand down 31 percent in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2008 .
On the other hand , the World Gold Council says India ’s bank deposits saw 22 percent year - over - year growth in the second quarter of 2009 , so cash is available to be spent if the rupee price for gold weakens even slightly .
The WGC also expects the wedding and Diwali season to “ underpin a seasonal improvement over the remainder of 2009 . ”
China , the world ’s # 2 gold market , actually saw a year - over - year gold demand increase of 6 percent in the latest quarter , with buyers favoring 24 - carat gold jewelry for its quality and as a store of value .
The WGC says that trend toward the purer form of gold should continue , though the third quarter is usually the low season for this segment of the market .
Source : U.S. Global research While September is a good month for gold , it is historically a great month for gold stocks as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index ( ticker GDM ) , as seen in the chart above .
The GDM index comprises a broader collection of gold miners – including more smaller - cap companies – than either the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index ( HUI ) or the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index ( XAU ) .
After the typically soft months of June and July , the gold miners start to bounce back with a 2 percent bump in August before shooting up another 8 percent in September .
Since 1993 , when it was created , the GDM has been up 11 times in September and down just five times .
In September 1998 , the GDM had by far its best - ever month ( up 54.3 percent ) when the bullion was bouncing off a two - decade low price of less than $ 275 per ounce .
A decade later in September 2008 , however , amid the severe credit squeeze triggered by the global financial crisis , the GDM fell 10.2 percent .
The strong correlation between the gold price and the value of gold - mining stocks explains much of the average September jump for gold stocks .
But the relationship is not lock - step – gold stocks ( particularly for companies that do not hedge their production ) have historically offered leverage to the gold price .
In up markets , earnings growth has tended to exceed the increase in gold price .
Of course , the leverage also works in the opposite direction – gold stocks also tend to decline more when the price of bullion is falling .
One of the most consistent correlations for gold is its inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar – when gold is up , the dollar tends to be down , and vice versa .
Looking at weekly data going back 20 years , this relationship occurs nearly 70 percent of the time .
Source : U.S. Global research
The seasonality chart above shows that September is only second to December in terms of dollar weakness , the average result for the U.S. Trade Weighted Dollar Index ( DXY ) being a 0.66 percent decline from August .
Looking at the 39 Septembers going back to 1970 , the dollar has seen negative performance 26 times , more than any other month of the year .
The Federal Reserve ’s massive stimulus spending and the expectation that the current low - interest - rate environment will continue for many more months are additional headwinds for the dollar , and thus tend to be positive for gold .
In our June commentary “ Why the Time Could Be Right for Gold Stocks , ” we pointed out that gold stocks tend to outperform the overall stock market when the federal government is engaged in deficit spending .
This year ’s federal deficit is expected to be a record $ 1.6 trillion , and the White House projected this week that the deficit will grow another $ 9 trillion between 2010 and 2019 .
These huge deficits will fan inflation fears and keep downward pressure on the dollar .
Based on the long - term record , this may represent a good time for investors who want to establish or add to a gold or gold - stock position in advance of seasonal demand growth .
The guidance provided by historical patterns may improve the chances for investment success , but of course , there are no guarantees that this September will follow the well - established trend .

" Although we have no reports of it ever happening , and I can tell you of no cases of a victim being turned away , there 's nothing in the codes to prevent it from happening , " said Sandy Middleton , state legislative chairwoman for the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence .
She said that the coalition was in the early stages of an investigation into the matter .
State Rep. Brandon Jones , D - Pascagoula , has drafted a bill that would prevent insurers from culling domestic abuse victims from health coverage plans .
Jones expressed concern that Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the recent economic downturn became triggers for domestic abuse .
" It 's such a big problem in our state , " he said .
" Whenever things get bad , domestic violence increases like clockwork . "
Other states that have no laws to prevent insurers from denying coverage based on previous abuse incidents are Idaho , Oklahoma , North Carolina , South Carolina , North Dakota , South Dakota and Wyoming , according to the National Women 's Law Center .
Jones said that the state 's unfair trade laws do enable its insurance regulators to look into cases of mistreatment by insurers .
But domestic victims often never speak up about the abuse that they endure , he said .
" Sometimes just reporting it to the police is traumatic enough .
If they were denied medical coverage , I 'm not sure they would tell anyone , " Jones said .
Jones , who is vice chairman of the House Insurance Committee , said he plans to have the bill ready for session in January .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Unfazed by a recession and rampant inflation , image - conscious Venezuelans show no signs of cutting back on the facelifts , liposuction , and breast augmentation that have become de rigueur beauty treatments .

“ There is never a question of not doing it , but of how you can do it .
We all want to get everything done , ” said Helen Patino , a 37 - year - old former model who had her first breast augmentation when she was 21 and her third about three months ago .
Venezuela ’s inflation is the highest in Latin America , up more than 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year and the South American nation is in recession after a five year boom .
Hard times may even encourage cosmetic procedures as people look for ways to lift their spirits , with many dipping into savings or taking on debt to get operations , surgeons say .
“ The financial crisis has spurred people to spend more on themselves ... to console themselves in this crisis .
I have not seen demand diminishing , ” said Peter Romer , a plastic surgeon in Caracas .
For Iris Delgado , a 57 - year - old dental technician , a lack of funds was not an obstacle to getting a recent eyelid tuck .
“ With the economy , one has to make sacrifices , because you do n’t have the money .
So , you get it from credit cards , from family and you pay for it , ” said Delgado , who borrowed 7,000 bolivares -- about $ 3,250 -- for the procedure , a move she saw as a hedge against inflation in plastic surgery prices .
Like Delgado , many go into debt to finance cosmetic surgery , according to those in the industry .
“ It ’s an investment that people make and they look for money everywhere , ” said Romer , adding that one of his patients moved into a smaller apartment to get a makeover and another traded her car for a facelift .
Leoncio Barrios , a social psychologist at the Central University of Venezuela , said such stories are the exception .
“ The majority of middle and lower - income women do not have property to sell or the capacity to save , ” he said .
“ What is clear is that in the subway you can see ads for clinics that offer credit for this type of surgery , and that women who work use their vacation bonuses and borrow from their work savings accounts , ” he added .

The industry will make sure that cosmetic work remains within reach to ensure a steady flow of income , Barrios said .
“ NEED TO BE BEAUTIFUL ”
Despite the hefty price tag , the choice to get cosmetic surgery is not considered a luxury for some Venezuelans .
“ We need to be beautiful , ” said Patino .
Competition among women , by far the biggest consumers of plastic surgery in Venezuela , to look their best is fierce , and social pressure to get work done is high .
“ Socially , there is a lot of demand , especially from men , to have a good body , ” said Prem Pratita , a 27 - year - old who had a breast augmentation a few weeks ago .
In this image - conscious country , famous for beauty queens who win record numbers of international pageant titles , the idea of getting cosmetic surgery is instilled at a young age .
Patino recalls how , as a child , her mother and aunt dreamt of surgery to get rid of wrinkles .
Now , with a child of her own , the subject is already on the table .
“ I told my husband , ‘ Look honey , if she has your nose , she ’s going to get surgery , ’ ” said Patino .
Some young women even describe moving up a few cup sizes as a rite of passage .
“ It ’s a transformation from being a girl to being a woman , ” said Pratita , who said she was one of the last in her circle of friends to have the procedure .
“ Everybody has a breast augmentation .
Three or four of every seven women have one , ” said plastic surgeon Angel Pena , who likens his surgery to body decoration practiced for centuries .
“ By nature , human beings have the desire to look better ... this desire is timeless and it ’s a desire that does n’t depend on your economic situation ... it ’s not that frivolous . ”
A company has recalled a batch of pencils after a fourth - grade student pointed out an embarrassing message that appeared after he sharpened his pencil .
The pencils carry the slogan '' Too Cool to Do Drugs . ''
But the student noticed that when the pencils are sharpened and get shorter , the message becomes '' Cool to Do Drugs , '' then simply '' Do Drugs . ' '
As a result of the discovery by Kodi Mosier , a 10 - year - old student at Ticonderoga Elementary School , the company , the Bureau for At - Risk Youth , based in Plainview , N.Y. , recalled the pencils .
'' We 're actually a little embarrassed that we did n't notice that sooner , '' Darlene Clair , a spokeswoman , told The Plattsburgh Press - Republican .

The 2009 H1N1 swine flu “ pandemic ” may turn out to be one of the most overblown and expensive medical crises in modern history .
Indeed , this particular swine flu may be one of the weakest in history .
The most recent figures show that the number of flu cases are already dropping in the U.S. , England , and elsewhere .
Just six months ago , officials in the US and UK were predicting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of deaths from this swine flu .
It is a mild illness in most but occasionally can lead to severe complications due to bacterial superinfections .
In the UK , under 200 people have died from the virus and in the US a debatable 4 thousand people have died .
The number of deaths in the US greatly expanded from 1,200 to 4,000 after the CDC recently decided to lump in bacterial infections and “ flu - like illnesses ” with confirmed swine - flu related deaths .
Even with these inflated numbers , in comparison to previous pandemics or even compared to seasonal flu epidemics , this has been a relatively mild illness .
The Spanish H1N1 flu of 1918 was estimated to have killed up to 50 million people .
In 1957 - 58 , the Asian HN2 flu caused the death of 1.5 million to 2 million people .
Only a decade later , this was followed by the Hong Kong H3N2 in 1968 - 69 which is thought to be responsible for one million deaths .
So far the 2009 H1N1 flu has only been implicated as the cause of death for a few thousand people .
What is striking is that just six months ago , officials in the US and UK were predicting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of deaths from this swine flu .
Since that time officials have had to revise their numbers downward on many occasions .
According to the UK Independent , “ Britain ’s Chief Medical Officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , published a worst - case scenario suggesting the country should plan for up to 65,000 deaths .
That planning assumption has since been revised downwards twice .
In September the ‘ worst case ’ was cut to 19,000 deaths , and in October it was cut again to 1,000 deaths .
This compares with an average annual toll of 4,000 to 8,000 deaths from seasonal winter flu . ”
A similar revisionist trend has occurred in the United States .
As a result of the original nightmare “ pandemic ” scenarios , governments around the world have spent billions of dollars to stockpile antivirals ( ie. Tamiflu ) and to propagandize , produce , and distribute H1N1 vaccinations .
The most notable change in how government has tackled this flu emergency has been how they have used the media to spread panic amongst the citizens of the world .
Just take the example of Kathleen Sebelius who is the US Health and Human Services ( HHS ) director .
She has publicly gloated over the US Federal Government ’s campaign to spread H1N1 flu information on children ’s television programming .
This has included putting flu messages and even creating whole television shows devoted to government flu propaganda on programs such as Elmo ’s World on Sesame Street , Sid the Science Kid , and ESPN .
They have also spread their reach into internet social networks like Facebook .
In her testimony before Congress , she remarked that she is particularly proud of hearing stories of children that are now correcting their misinformed parents after they had watched the government programming .
This propaganda campaign is in addition to direct advertising and almost continuous hysteria from supposed health experts on prime time television .
The advice from these individuals is sometimes so obviously biased that it can be nauseating .
How could the estimates have been so wildly exaggerated ?
Unfortunately , it all comes down to power , money , and prestige .
In order to get to the bottom of why swine flu hysteria was so overblown one has to simply ask :
Who is profiting from the whole swine flu hysteria ?
[ efoods ]
In answer to that question one has to look no further than the drug companies and the medical research establishment .
As I have reported previously , drug companies are in line to make billions of dollars over this pandemic and are preparing to expand vaccinations for years to come .
As drug companies have already produced vaccinations for most of the other infectious diseases that cause significant mortality in the western world , they are now looking for a new crop of diseases that could become potential vaccine candidates .
In fact , facing the prospect of curtailed drug spending , pharmaceutical companies foresee vaccination expansion as one of their greatest areas of focus and future profit .
According to the Associated Press ( AP ) , “ vaccines are seen as a critical path to growth for drugmakers , as slowing prescription medicine sales and intensifying generic competition put pressure on company bottom lines . ”
In addition to drug companies , as reported in Reuters , medical researchers have had to respond to “ accusations ” that the “ pandemic has been ‘ hyped ’ by medical researchers to further their own cause , boost research grants and line the pockets of drug companies . ”
In response to this , researchers have maintained that “ we need to know a lot more to conquer the virus , and funding for new research and drugs is vital to be equipped for future pandemics . ”
Where this comes full circle is with the government .
The great majority of medical research spending is sponsored by government .
It is well known that funding from the US National Institute of Health ( NIH ) and other international governmental bodies favors “ pertinent ” or as I like to call it “ trendy ” research .
This funding favoritism is especially true of research that can be used to support government policy positions .
Most recently , this has been seen in the great expansion of government sponsored global warming research .
Now , vaccine experts and their infectious disease cohorts are likely to profit greatly in terms of research grants for preparing for “ future pandemics . ”
One only has to hope that those future pandemics will actually deserve all the attention and expense that this one has .
Finally , central governments profit greatly from supposed pandemics such as this one .
It permits them to try to justify their existence as our “ great guarantors ” of health and safety .
It also allows them to continue to expand their tentacles of influence and power to an even greater extent in individual lives as they try to remove our medical freedom by making health care decisions for us .
Remember that the government , as President Obama ’s top economic advisor Rahm Emanuel puts it , “ never ” likes to “ waste a good crisis ” by not effecting a change that they would ordinarily not be able to accomplish .
In this case , governments are trying to expand their mandate as the sole provider of health care because they were the only ones able to protect us from a supposedly horrific swine flu pandemic .
Even if the truth has been that their efforts have been largely fruitless , the vast majority of people will remain oblivious to this fact .
In the future the government will never cease to congratulate itself for coming to our rescue .
The way government has reacted to this flu reminds me greatly of Orwell ’s “ doublethink ” as employed by the totalitarian government in his book Nineteen eighty - four .
In terms of the swine flu , the H1N1 “ doublethink ” means that government says one thing but the reality is the exact opposite .
This “ doublethink ” says that freedom from death from the swine flu means surrendering your medical freedom to a government health bureaucracy .
The reality is that government intervention will have proven to do little more then spend our tax dollars and come at the expense of our health care freedom .
This is evidenced by the fact the governments have used this mild flu and hysteria surrounding it to create medical emergency acts that would grant powers to forcibly vaccination citizens despite their objections .
One has to ask the question – would government , researchers , and drug companies been able to justify billions of dollars of expenditures and encroachments on our freedoms if realistic swine flu death projections were used from the beginning ?
In addition , would the public have been so eager to tune into government and media flu propaganda , or support totalitarian pandemic emergency power bills , or shown up for mass vaccinations if they knew the truth and not the worst ?
Would they have done any of these things if they had known from the beginning that this pandemic would amount to a few hundred deaths ?
Surely , the answer would be no .
Many health professionals agree that the original estimates were unreasonably high .
According to the UK Independent , “ Dr Steven Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , said : ‘ I thought the original predictions for the number of deaths were incredibly high . ’ ”
As with the avian flu scare before it , these groups have great incentive to inflate worst case scenarios because they have the most to profit from the hysteria .
There is really no reason why this inflationary pattern will not continue so long as government can use the hysteria to justify increased expansion , drug companies can produce the needed pandemic vaccines , and researchers need a reason to justify massive pandemic research grants .
In the end , I urge you to resist the temptation to sacrifice any of your freedoms for any ounce of government “ well - meaning ” slavery , especially over a contrived “ pandemic ’ such as with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu .

Sí Boogie , pero andan diciendo que en el cine pareces una hermana de la caridad
[ email protected ] MORELIA , Mich . —
El matón a sueldo Boogie el Aceitoso , del humorista argentino Roberto Fontanarrosa ( 1944-2007 ) , parece “ una hermana de la caridad ” frente a la violencia que se vive en América Latina , según los productores de la versión fílmica , que se exhibió anoche en el Festival de Cine de la ciudad mexicana de Morelia .
La película animada de Boogie , coproducida por la empresa argentina Illusion Studios y la revista mexicana Proceso , se estrenará en cines en Argentina el 22 de octubre y en México el 14 de noviembre , con guión de Marcelo Páez y dirección de Gustavo Cova .
El personaje del despiadado Boogie nació en 1972 en la revista Hortensia , de la provincia argentina de Córdoba .
En México , la historieta se publicó desde 1977 a 1996 en Proceso .
“ Frente a la violencia que vivimos Boogie parece una hermana de la caridad ” , dijo la periodista mexicana María Scherer , subdirectora de Comercialización de Proceso e hija del fundador del semanario , Julio Scherer .
“ En la revista quisimos mucho a Boogie .
Es un personaje que todos sienten como suyo , y cuando supimos que se estaba haciendo la película decidimos que teníamos que participar ” , agregó .
La cinta podría decirse que es la parodia de Harry el sucio , aquel personaje clásico cinematográfico de Clint Eastwood .
Pero Boogie el aceitoso va más allá .
Es un asesino a sueldo , frío y despiadado a quien la limpieza le importa mucho .
Y qué decir de su ironía .
Creado por Roberto Fontanarrosa para el mundo del cómic , Boogie se burlaba de todos .
Si alguno leyó el cómic original , podría recordar una referencia precisamente a Harry el sucio , donde le preguntan si veía sus películas .
Y Boggie contestaba que definitivamente no le gustaban las historias de amor .
Ahora ese sicario llega a la pantalla grande bajo el título Boogie el aceitoso .
El perfil de “ Boogie ” en la película no dista de la versión original , es machista y sádico .
El filme relata una historia cuya temática , música y estética está dirigida al público adolescente y a los adultos .
Hay mujeres , alcohol y balas .
Fondos en 2D y personajes tridimensionales .
Después de todo , Fontanarrosa lo concibió como una forma de criticar la violencia en la sociedad de EU .
Un héroe singular Boogie nació hace 37 años en la Revista Hortensia .
Siempre se mantuvo soltero y sus hobbies han sido comprar armas y disparar a transeúntes desde la ventana de su departamento .
Anda todo el día con un cigarrillo en la boca .
Lo mismo extorsiona periodistas por orden de algún político o humanitariamente asiste a un suicida al que le falta coraje para acabar su misión .
Es admirador ni más ni menos que de Jack el destripador y detesta a toda la humanidad .
“ Sé que Boogie me despreciaría mucho por sudamericano de un país periférico y por hispanoparlante .
No entraría dentro de sus amistades ” , dijo bromista , en alguna ocasión , Fontanarrosa .
El artista argentino le confirió características acordes a la profesión de sicario : rubio , musculoso , de fuerte contextura física , mandíbula a lo bulldog con dentadura , enorme y perfecta .
“ Seguí el consejo de Quino ( creador de Mafalda , otro clásico ) de ser lo más libre posible de entrada , para no ajustarme al encadenamiento , al cautiverio que significa ceñirse a una evolución cronológica ” , contó Fontanarrosa .
Su personaje se daba lujo de hacer cualquier cosa .
Pegaba a mujeres y a policías negros .
Y cuando disparaba , en lugar de verse la nube con el popular bang bang , sobresalía el crack crack que impactó a todos .
A su creador le comenzaron a caer cartas de todo tipo , principalmente de admiradores : - “ Era una cosa terrible , tipos contentos porque por fin llegaba alguien que les pegara a los negros y a las mujeres ” , narró , “ El caso es que la gente como Boogie , que tiene la violencia como gesto , me da mucho temor .
No me gustan nada esos tipos que dividen las cosas con una línea tajante entre amigos y enemigos ” .
Fontanarrosa comenzó como dibujante humorístico y se destacó rápidamente por su calidad y por la rapidez y seguridad con que ejecutaba sus dibujos .
Estas cualidades hicieron que su producción gráfica fuera copiosa .
Fue un apasionado , como buen argentino , del futbol , deporte al cual le dedicó varias de sus obras , entre ellas el cuento “ 19 de diciembre de 1971 ” , un clásico de la literatura futbolística argentina .
Su equipo favorito fue Rosario Central .
En los años ‘ 70 y ‘ 80 , se lo podía encontrar tomándo un café en sus ratos libres en el bar El Cairo , sentado en la metafórica “ mesa de los galanes ” , escenario de muchos de sus mejores cuentos .
En enero de 2007 anunció que dejaría de dibujar sus historietas debido a que había perdido el completo control de su mano derecha a causa de la enfermedad .
Sin embargo , aclaró que continuaría escribiendo guiones para sus personajes .
Medio año después fallecía víctima de un paro cardiorrespiratorio .
It took the Obama administration less than eight hours to side with Cuba 's Fidel Castro , Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez and Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega over the ouster of Manuel Zelaya in Honduras .
As we have come to expect , Mr. Obama got it wrong again , but this time , nobody noticed .
The U.S. news media , preoccupied with the sudden demise of Michael Jackson , ignored the event in Central America .
For those who care about things more important than the passing of a " pop music legend , " here 's the rest of the story :
Manuel Zelaya , a wealthy rancher and agribusiness executive but self - described " poor farmer , " won a four - year term as Honduran president in November 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote .
Article 374 of the Honduran Constitution bars the nation 's chief executive from serving consecutive terms .
Apparently , one term was n't enough for Mr. Zelaya , a protege of Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez and Nicaragua 's phobic anti-American leader , Daniel Ortega .
Late last year , as the Honduran economy tanked and unemployment grew to nearly 28 percent , Mr. Zelaya forced Elvin Santos , the country 's elected vice president , to resign and began holding conversations with Mr. Chavez and Mr. Ortega on how to hold onto power .
In lengthy Chavez - like populist speeches , he denounced the United States and wealthy landowners and linked himself with leftists in the Honduran labor movement .
On March 23 , he issued an executive decree directing a national referendum on a Venezuela - style constituent assembly to rewrite the country 's constitution in time for presidential and legislative elections in November .
The Obama - Clinton State Department was mute about all this .
Unfortunately for Mr. Zelaya 's aspirations , the Honduran Constitution requires that amendments be passed by a two - thirds vote of the country 's unicameral Congress during two consecutive sessions .
By late May , the Honduran Congress , the Honduran Supreme Court , the commissioner for human rights and the Honduran Supreme Electoral Tribunal all had overwhelmingly declared the referendum unconstitutional .
Mr. Zelaya ignored the people 's representatives , had ballots printed in Venezuela and announced that the vote would take place June 28 .
Again , the O - Team was silent .
In keeping with the rule of law , Honduran Attorney General Luis Alberto Rubi took the case to court .
The Honduran Supreme Court ruled the referendum to be illegal and ordered the ballots to be confiscated .
Late on June 23 , Mr. Zelaya countermanded the court order and directed the army to distribute the ballots .
Gen. Romeo Vasquez , the chief of staff of the Honduran military , sought legal opinions and decided not to distribute them .
The following day , Mr. Zelaya accepted the resignation of Defense Minister Angel Edmundo Orellana and fired Gen. Vasquez .
The Honduran Supreme Court unanimously ruled the Vasquez firing illegal and reinstated the general on June 25 .
That prompted Mr. Zelaya and a group of supporters to seize the ballots and issue another executive decree , which directed government officials to set up 15,000 polling stations at schools and community buildings across the country .
In response to a request from Mr. Rubi , the Honduran Congress - controlled by Mr. Zelaya 's own Liberal Party - opened an investigation into the president 's mental stability and fitness to govern .
Mr. Zelaya replied with a two - hour broadcast harangue in which he claimed : " Congress cannot investigate me , much less remove me or stage a technical coup against me , because I am honest .
I 'm a free president , and nobody scares me . "
On Sunday , just hours before the referendum was to begin , the Honduran army , acting on a warrant issued by the Honduran Supreme Court , arrested Mr. Zelaya and sent him , in his pajamas , into exile in Costa Rica .
The Honduran Congress affirmed Mr. Zelaya 's departure and , in accord with the constitution , named Roberto Micheletti , who had been president of the Congress , interim president of the country .
It has been downhill from there .
Mr. Chavez , Mr. Ortega , Mr. Castro and Bolivia 's Evo Morales immediately condemned the " coup " and demanded that Mr. Zelaya be restored to power .
Mr. Chavez went so far as to threaten military action .
When asked about these events on Sunday , the O - Team punted the issue to the Organization of American States , calling for " all political and social actors in Honduras to respect democratic norms , the rule of law and the tenets of the Inter - American Democratic Charter . "
Now there 's a powerful statement of support for a constitutional process and the institutions of democracy .
Meanwhile , the Clinton State Department is said to be looking at cutting off aid to the impoverished country .
The O - Team does n't seem to grasp that simply holding an election does not guarantee a democracy .
Adolf Hitler was elected .
Hugo Chavez was elected .
The Castro brothers were " elected . "
When potentates decide the rule of law does not matter , that constitutional restrictions on power can be overcome by executive fiat , the people inevitably suffer .
It 's a point to remember this Independence Day weekend , our nation 's 233rd .

A Lehigh Township teenager who claimed he was beaten after trying to sell his PlayStation was actually assaulted when he tried to trade the console for marijuana .
Assistant District Attorney Richard Peppper said today Richard Davis agreed March 9 to trade his PlayStation with William Shelhamer II , of Bethlehem , for marijuana .
The marijuana was actually oregano and the deal went bad , Pepper said .
Shelhamer and Nathan Shiller , of the 200 block of Edmonds Avenue , Moore Township , along with three other unidentified men attacked Davis , Pepper said .
Pepper said it was the other attackers who beat Davis until he was unconscious .
Shelhammer , 20 , said he tried to stop the beating and pulled other people off of Davis .
Shelhamer pleaded guilty to simple assault and attempted theft .
McFadden sentenced him to 18 months probation .
McFadden ordered Shelhamer to pay court costs and $ 450 in fines , perform 20 hours of community service and pay restitution .
Shiller , 20 , pleaded guilty to simple assault and a separate drug charge .
McFadden sentenced him to 18 months probation , 20 hours of community service and ordered him to pay court costs , restitution and $ 650 in fines .
Pepper said prosecutors may charge Davis as well for his role in the crime .
A decade ago , Scientific American published the seminal article by these two luminaries of the Peak Oil awareness movement , that relaunched the debate on M. King Hubbert 's finds , Scientific American appears now as a completely different publication .
Now , however , scientific content does n't seem to be a requisite for its articles .
Among other eerie details , Leonardo Maugeri goes as far as citing " Common Wisdom " to present erroneous facts .
This article , put together by Jean Laherrère and edited by Colin Campbell , is a critical review of the recent article by Leonardo Maugeri published by Scientific American .
Leonardo Maurgeri starts his Scientific American article by quoting statistics for the Kern River oil field in California , suggesting that its very favorable reserve growth is representative of what can be expected more generally throughout the world .
In using this approach , Maurgeri , an economist and vice president of the Italian oil company ENI , follows the work of Professor M. Adelman .
The basic statistics Maugeri quotes are shown in the following table :
Mb 1942 2007 Comulative Production 280 2000 Remaining Reserves 60 480 Ultimate Recovery 340 2480
Alderman commented that the field itself had not changed ; but knowledge of it had .
Maugeri follows the same argument but fails to mention that the number of producing wells had increased from 500 in 1942 to 9318 in 2007 and that as many as 16 000 wells had been drilled in total .
In other words , drilling increased by a factor of twenty yet the reserves increased no more than eight - fold .
He also fails to note that published Proven Reserves in the United States are based on SEC rules such that only the developed part of the field could be reported even though its full size was known from geological maps and appraisal drilling .
The field was discovered in 1899 by a hand - dug well , no more than 45 feet deep , and has been in production since then .
It contains heavy oil ranging in gravity from 10 º to 16 º API , and steam stimulation commenced in 1963 to improve recovery .
The above illustration , taken from the USGS Bulletin 2172 - H 2005 Growth History of Oil Reserves in Major California Oil Fields During the Twentieth Century , shows that Kern River reserves ( in blue ) were larger in 1923 than in 1937 and 1942 .
The California Department of Conservation reports annually all the details of field production , and it is easy to plot annual oil production and reserves of the Kern River Field .
The following graph shows how the reported Ultimate Recovery ( cumulative production + remaining reserves ) of the field have grown in parallel with the number of wells , reflecting the constraints of the SEC reporting rules .
Production began to increase significantly with the steam flooding in 1963 , preceded by cyclic steam injection in 1958 .
These processes , which are well established and normal industry practices , are called technological miracles by Maugeri .
The reported Ultimate ceased to grow in 1985 , reflecting the peak of production per well at 23 b/d in 1982 , being now below 9 b/d.
Production per well seems to have been linear since 1996 and could be extrapolated towards zero in 2020 , meaning that the field will have to stop production before then .
The field covers an area of about 10 000 acres ( 43,5 km2 ) , and supports 9 300 producing wells , giving a spacing of one per acre .
The normal US spacing was one well per 40 to 160 acres , with 10 per acre for infill drilling , .
Kern River is a good example of a field that has been over - drilled .
The ultimate recovery is reported to have grown again in 2001 and 2007 to over 2 500 Mb .
But plotting annual against cumulative production shows a decline since 1999 of about 6 % a year .
As illustrated in the following figure , an extrapolation of the 1999 -2008 data gives an ultimate of 2 530 Mb , compared with the 2 634 Mb reported by the California Department of Conservation for 2007 .
It may also be noted that production per well since 1996 can also be linearly extrapolated towards 2 530 Mb. Annual oil production may be extrapolated with a decline of 5.8 % per year , which corresponds with a cumulative production 2009 - 2060 of 436 Mb .
This is below the reported remaining reserves , which with an indicated production of less than 1 b/d are likely to be below the economic or EROI limit , that being the energy return on energy invested , which has to be positive to make sense .
The Oil - in - Place is variously estimated at 3 500 Mb by Swartz et al 2008 ( Kern River Field : Framework and Future of an Old Giant AAPG Search and Discovery Article # 90076 ) , or at 4 000 Mb by McGregor ( 1996 ) .
It means that the recovery factor is over 70 % , when Maugeri talks about a present 35 % recovery factor for the world .
It is clearly ridiculous for Maugeri to take the example of this very old field of heavy oil found by a hand - dug well and subject to steam flooding , that peaked more than 80 years after discovery , and is still producing , as in any way representative of modern conventional fields .
It is like comparing apples with oranges .
The USGS makes the same mistake when it applies US field growth based on Proved Reserves ( 1P ) to the world as a whole that is based on Proved & Probable ( 2P ) reserve reports .
US field growth is due to the outdated reporting practice , based on obsolete 1977 SEC rules .
These rules will be changed in 2010 , to allow Proved and Probable Reserves ( 2P ) to be reported , meaning the US reserve growth will likely disappear .
Maugeri writes :
According to common wisdom , a field ’s production should follow a bell shaped trajectory known as the Hubbert curve and peak when half of the known oil has been extracted .
He confuses the pattern of individual field production with that of basin or country patterns .
Hubbert was modelling US and world oil production , and not that of an individual field which normally increases rapidly in its early years before declining slowly , with the peak coming before the midpoint of depletion , as well illustrated by the Forties Field in the UK North Sea .
Maugeri , as an economist , talks only about Proven Reserves , but he should know that the development of a field , especially offshore is based on Proved and Probable Reserves .
The net present value of a development is computed on the Mean Probability value and not on Proved Reserves alone , which have a 90 % Probability .
Maugeri writes :
But I believe that those projections will prove wrong , just as similar « peak oil » predictions ( Campbell & Laherrère , SciAm March 1998 ) have been mistaken in the past .
That article was entitled The End of Cheap Oil , at a time when oil was trading at $ 13 / barrel , before sinking to $ 10 / barrel in the following year .
It was in fact ranked by the Sonoma University as within the top 25 most important papers published in 1999 .
It is hard therefore to accept Maugeri ’s claim that it was mistaken .
Maugeri ’s graph compares the oil production forecast of Campbell and Laherrère 1998 with others , failing to note that the former referred to conventional oil only whereas the others refer to all categories .
In fact , Campbell and Laherrère submitted graphs covering all the categories , which were not in fact published .
The plot for combined conventional and unconventional forecast 31 Gb/a ( namely 85 Mb/d ) for 2007 , which is close to what was actually produced .
The mistake was not in the substance of the forecast but in not having better checked the title of the graph published by the Scientific American .
The following graph , for the world ’s liquid production , was published in Laherrère J.H. 1999 Assessing the oil and gas future production and the end of cheap oil ? , CSEG Calgary , April 6 .
Recent ASPO ( Campbell & Laherrere ) forecasts are compared with others ( but not those from Maugeri ) by the US National Petroleum Council 2007 « Hard truths » .
Maugeri writes :
It is absurd to predict a peak of world production because it presupposes that one knows how much oil is in the ground .
On that basis , logic suggests that it would be equally absurd to accept Maugeri ’s claim that the peak is not coming until 2030 or that more than 50 percent of the oil known at the time will be recoverable .
That said , we can agree that no one really knows the volume of oil in the ground , meaning that little reliance can be placed upon assumed recovery factors .
Maugeri believes that only one third of sedimentary basins have been explored , but out of about 600 sedimentary basins only 200 basins have the potential of generating oil or gas for well understood geological and especially geochemical reasons .
He shows that for the past 25 years , the United States had more exploration drilling than any other country .
But he fails to say that the ownership of oil rights in the United States differs from that in the rest of the world .
The United States supports more than 20 000 oil companies , and the economics are also quite different .
For the last 25 years over 60 000 pure exploration wells ( New Field Wildcats ) have been drilled in the United States compared to 5000 in Canada and 40 000 for the rest of the world .
The average size of oil discovery is 0.3 Mb for United States , 0.9 Mb for Canada and 740 Mb for the Middle East , 14 Mb for Africa , and 7 Mb for the world outside US & Canada .
Again comparing the United States with the rest of the world is comparing apples and oranges !
Maugeri writes :
[ … ] by 2030 we will have consumed another 650 billion to 700 billion barrels of our reserves , for a total of around 1600 billion barrels used up from the 4500 to 5000 billion figure
This implies that today we have consumed less than 950 billion barrels , which is clearly mistaken .
Cumulative production is over 1100 Gb according to the industry database produced by IHS ( NAPE International Forum February 4 , 2009 Where Will Tomorrow ’s Oil and Gas Come From ?
Pillars of Oil and Gas , P.H. Stark and K. Chew ) .
Paolo Scaroni , the Chief Executive of ENI , the company for which Maugeri works received the Petroleum Executive of the year 2008 award .
He said in the Petroleum Review of March 2006 [ pdf ! ] in page p25 that replacing reserves is the nightmare of IOCs .
Scaroni ’s words seem to be conflict with Maugeri ’s statement that most of the planet ’s known resources are left unexploited in the ground , and still more wait to be discovered .
Perhaps Maugeri should tell his Chief Executive where all these unexploited and undiscovered oil reserves lie to help ENI replace oil reserves .
Its 2008 Annual Report shows that both its oil reserves and production have fallen compared with 2006 but that its gas has increased .
It may prompt the cynic to ask if whether Maugeri can distinguish oil from gas .
Luís here again : Maugeri 's article has some similarities with one penned by Peter Jackson of CERA a couple of years ago ; in both cases the authors do not seem to understand what the Hubbert Method is .
But while Peter Jackson definitely showed some scientific objectiveness , the same can't be said of Leonardo Maugeri .
October Unemployment Rate Jumps Upward == > 10.2 % !
November 6 , 2009
Posted by geoff in News
UPDATE : November numbers are here
The economic for October predictions were 175,000 non-farm jobs lost , and an unemployment rate at or just below 10 % .
Just based on initial unemployment filings , I think you ’d have had to count on people continuing to drop out of the system to get numbers that low .
So what actually happened ?
As of this morning , the Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that we lost 190,000 non-farm jobs , and that the unemployment rate has risen to 10.2 % .
So let ’s have a gander at where that puts us on the “ OMG Christine Romer and Jared Bernstein Are Teh Suck ” chart :
That ’s pretty startling .
The reason , though , is that fewer people dropped out of the labor force last month .
As I ’ve mentioned ad nauseam in past posts , the labor market is responding sort of oddly in this recession , with millions of people simply dropping out of the labor force .
They ’re not counted among job seekers or even discouraged workers – they ’re gone completely from the statistics .
So a more useful number , I believe , is the number of jobs remaining in the country .
Here ’s that graph :
A Side Note on the Administration ’s Defense of the Stimulus .
The President and his economic team have claimed that the plan is working as intended , that they ’re on track to save the original goal of 3.6 million jobs , but somehow , despite practically drowning in success , we ’re going to have to live with high unemployment for years to come .
Oh , and that everything is still Bush ’s fault .
These claims have been debunked by a variety of sources , including the AP ( and here ) , the Chicago Tribune , the Denver Post , USA Today , the Wall Street Journal , and blogs such as Political Math ( H/ T d3ft punk ) .
But forget the quantitative treatment for a moment and consider what the Obama team ’s graph said on a qualitative level .
The graph says that within a couple of quarters , the stimulus package will stop the increase in unemployment and reverse the employment trend .
That was the real mission of the stimulus .
Stop job loss .
Get the private sector hiring again .
So no matter how convoluted and fanciful the “ jobs created or saved ” numbers get , we just have to remember what the point used to be , and realize how far short we ’ve fallen .
And whose fault that really is .

The world 's first supersonic stealth jumpjet , intended to replace the famous Harrier in British , US and other forces worldwide , has arrived at the American airbase where it will finally begin to flight - test its vertical - lift and hover capabilities .
Doors open - but nothing coming out until now .
The F - 35 " Lightning II " B model will , like other versions of the same aircraft , offer supersonic performance and stealth technology - a combo so far offered in only one aircraft in the world , the famous F - 22 Raptor ultrasuperfighter .
But the F - 35B , unlike its tailhook and normal - runway counterparts , is also equipped with a central lift fan mounted in a shaft through the fuselage and can swivel its jet exhaust downwards too .
This means that an armed and fuelled F - 35B should be able to make a very short takeoff run to get airborne and then , having burned fuel and perhaps released weapons , make a vertical landing supported entrirely by engine thrust .
This Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing ( STOVL ) capability has so far been offered in the Western - aligned world only by the famous Harrier , originally developed in Britain and now in service with the RAF , the Royal Navy and the US Marines .
STOVL means that an aircraft can operate from a cheaply - built carrier at sea , one without catapults or arrester wires , of the type used by and planned for the Royal Navy and US Marines .
It also permits such a jet to operate from a quickly - improvised airstrip ashore , or in some cases from ordinary runways which are too damaged or run-down for conventional aeroplanes to use .
The first F - 35B took to the air for the first time last year , with a British test pilot at the controls in recognition of the UK 's involvement in the project ( Rolls Royce make the lift machinery which attaches to the engine and may get to make some actual engines in future , and BAE make a fuselage section and other parts ) .
This aircraft , " BF - 1 " , should long ago have started trying out its vertical - thrust features in the air , but it has so far flown only as a normal runway aircraft .
( Doors and lids have been opened in flight , and a successful ground hover - pit test was announced in April , but actual vertical thrust has not been used significantly in the air . )
Oh , Mr Brown , I loved that .
Tickle me again , Mr Darling .
Just there .
A back rub , please , Sir David .
A little oil here , Lord Phillips ; a teeny whiplash from you , Lord Myners .
And you , Mervyn King , perhaps another velvety stroke on the erogenous zone .
You are gorgeous , the lot of you .
Who said bankers " just do n't get it " ?
They get it absolutely .
Bankers are doing what they pay themselves to do , make money .
They are performing what economists from Adam Smith to Karl Marx regarded as capitalism 's sacred ritual , profiting by rigging markets and shedding risk .
Like all professions , their first responsibility is to their peer group and their second to their shareholders .
It is not their job to run the country , only sometimes to ruin it .
The banking community came a cropper last year but manoeuvred itself out of trouble by deploying the oldest trick in the book : claiming that the government needed them even more than they needed it .
They were " too big to fail " .
As the debt bubble burst and insurance could not pay , bankers staged a crash raid on the Treasury .
They ensured enough ex-bankers were inside Downing Street at the time , as one debt edifice after another tottered and collapsed into the Treasury 's lap , to be briskly transferred to the insurer of last resort , the taxpayer .
Ministers and regulators bought the gambit hook , line and sinker .
They all hollered that bonuses were " ludicrous " ( Darling ) , that banks had " lost sight of basic British values " ( Brown ) and were " antisocial " ( Lord Turner ) .
But it was all mouth .
For them to accuse the banks of behaving obscenely might be a brief buzz , but what are a few insults to a banker on a roll ?
It was not the banks that do not get it , but those on whom the public relies to guard its interests : Brown , Darling , Myners , King , Turner , the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority .
The bankers this past year have played a blinder .
Next month they will give themselves large bonuses while the nation troops to the dole office .
They merit the order of the golden fleece , first class .
This week the munificence of Downing Street and its regulators turned into a Christmas cargo cult .
The governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , blithely announced that he had kept secret £ 62bn of public loans to RBS and HBOS last year , concealing the fact from Lloyds shareholders who were then about to lose their shirts by being forced to merge with the latter .
This is the same King as had told Northern Rock in 2007 that he could not organise a rescue merger " as the legal advice … was that it could not be done " .
In addition any loan would have to be disclosed by law .
This so - called law strangely changed when the big boys came and started beating King about the head .
Then came today 's report from the latest Hercules sent by Alistair Darling to clean the City 's Augean stables , Sir David Walker of Morgan Stanley .
He predictably concluded that nothing more than a feather duster was needed .
He seemed to think that his fellow bankers would decamp en masse to Monaco if so much as rapped over the knuckles .
So what ?
As if that were not galling enough for the taxpayer , the supreme court – asked to adjudicate on the racketeering of banks towards overdraft customers – stepped forward to pat them on the head .
The judges said it seemed fine to them and went off to make daisy chains in Parliament Square .
The ruling was a repeat of their lordships ' awful Equitable Life judgment of 2000 , indicating that they knew little of equity and nothing of other people 's money .
Nobody but a fool believes that a free market in anything , left to its own devices , will tend to perfect competition .
Economic history attests that it tends to monopoly .
That is why it must be regulated .
Such regulation , in every sphere of economic life , is democracy 's most onerous but essential responsibility .
In the case of British banking in 2008 , the government 's clear duty was to ensure that marketplace discipline curbed the emergence of a debt bubble and that no residual liability , let alone one for some £ 1.3 trillion , should fall on the state .
Last year was a tragic failure of that responsibility and not one person in authority has accepted blame .
The best - told stories might be of millionaire salaries , fancy derivatives , subprimes and sports cars ; but what mattered was the denouement , saddling every man , woman and child in Britain with unprecedented levels of lifetime debt .
This will be paid for in unemployment and higher taxation in the short term , and in a lower standard of living for the foreseeable future .
The bank crash was a national disaster , the economic equivalent of Munich and appeasement .
As yet , no one has explained why such stupefying sums of money were really needed to pay off the rotten debts of banks , whose speculative activities should have been nationalised and left to default .
No one has explained why the enforced separation of good lending from so - called toxic debt was rejected , when just such a separation is planned for Northern Rock .
Throughout the past year , Darling and King justified bank subsidies on one ground alone : that the billions in subsidies would sustain the flow of high street credit .
But they did no such thing .
Every month Darling pleaded for more lending to businesses .
Every month the Office of National Statistics showed that such lending was falling , not rising .
Demand , the essential underpinning of bank credit , was collapsing .
Ministers have spent the past year propping up toxic debt , but not the British economy , which lurched deep into recession .
They did nothing to help it , apart from brief and bizarre assistance to the car market .
This was at a time when governments across the world were racing to prop up consumer demand , successfully speeding recovery .
It was as if Britain was a one - industry town , that of banking .
Darling and his colleagues were clearly out of their depth .
Public money was being spent on an unprecedented scale , with no one in charge knowing where it was going .
Where were the public auditors ?
Still no one has explained the meaning of the much - parroted phrase , too big to fail .
A failed bank may be a terrible thing , but then so is an economy crippled by long - term debt service .
Which is worse ?
Why did nobody ever ask ?
I find it simply incredible that a chancellor can take over a trillion pounds of public money , some of it in secret , without giving a remotely plausible account of why it was risked as it was , rather than in boosting consumer demand .
At present the Chilcot inquiry is asking past ministers and officials why they went to war in Iraq .
The reason is that war kills people .
What happened to the banks last year did not kill people , but in every other sense it was a seismic event in the history of Britain 's political economy .
It was a true collapse in political authority .
I wonder when someone will stop abusing bankers and fix on those really to blame .

Robert Enke funeral : Thousands of fans pay their last respects to suicide goalkeeper at heartbreaking memorial
Tens of thousands of fans gathered yesterday at the Hannover stadium for a memorial service for Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke , whose suicide has shaken the country .
' Robert Enke will never come back to this stadium , the place where he conquered our hearts , ' Hannover club president Martin Kind said at the beginning of the ceremony .
' But it was n't only his success that made Robert Enke so popular , it was the man , his personality . '
The 32 - year - old player , who played for Hannover 96 , stepped in front of a train near his Hannover home on Tuesday evening .

His widow , Teresa , appeared on national television a day later to say her husband had been suffering from depression for six years but did not want it known .
Enke 's coffin was covered with white roses and was placed in the center of the pitch .
Many fans wore black together with the club 's green , white and black scarf .
Before the start of the ceremony , the fans stood and applauded when Teresa Enke walked up to the coffin together with a friend .
Several members of the German national team also approached the coffin to say goodbye to their teammate .
In addition to more than 45,000 fans , German politicians and personalities from the sports world were also present at the stadium .
In a country riveted by football , Enke 's death has prompted a debate about whether players receive sufficient psychological support .
Germany team members and officials pay their last respects .

Enke said her husband had kept his depression secret from the public because he had been afraid the couple 's adopted eight - month - old daughter would be taken away from them if his illness was known .
The couple 's biological daughter , Lara , died of a heart ailment when she was two in 2006 .
Speaking at the ceremony , the governor of Lower Saxony , Christian Wulff , said that Enke 's death should make people rethink society 's values .
' We do n't need flawless robots .
We need human beings with rough edges , with all their weaknesses and wonderful qualities , ' Wulff said .
' We can only guess how big the pressure was that weighed on him . '
Enke 's father told weekly magazine Spiegel on Sunday that his son had suffered for a long time .
' I think that his disease did not arise from something inside of him , but was triggered by his life 's circumstances , ' said Dirk Enke , a psychotherapist , who said he tried to talk to his son several times , but could not get him to open up and talk about his depression .

Dirk Enke also said that his son had been much more affected by his daughter 's death three years ago than was known .
' It took him very long to get away from her , ' Dirk Enke said .
In a farewell note , Enke apologised to his family and the staff treating him for deliberately misleading them into believing he was better , which was ' necessary in order to carry out the suicide plans , ' said Valentin Markser , the doctor who treated him .
Enke 's ailment was not known to his teammates or coaches .
Enke had a good chance of being Germany 's starting goalkeeper at next year 's World Cup in South Africa .

Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Deisler quit football in January 2007 after several bouts of depression and five knee operations .
After the service , the German team will gather in Duesseldorf to prepare for Wednesday 's exhibition against Ivory Coast .
Enke will be buried later today next to his daughter Lara in a small ceremony near Neustadt , outside Hannover .

Will the Boat Sink the Water ?
The Life of Chinese Peasants .
By Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao .
New York : Public Affairs 2006
Review by John Riddell
Is China killing the goose whose golden eggs have financed its economic upsurge ?
Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao pose this question in their gripping portrayal of the suffering and struggles of Chinese peasants today .
Their book ’s title refers to a 1400 - year - old Chinese saying , attributed to Emporer Taizong : “ Water holds up the boat ; water may also sink the boat . ”
That is , the peasantry that sustains the state may also rise up and overturn it .
Chen and Wu argue that in China today , the weight of the state is suffocating the peasantry : the boat may sink the water .
A media and publishing sensation
First published in China in 2004 , Will the Boat Sink the Water takes up what the authors call “ fearsome ‘ forbidden areas ’ … about which the public has been kept in the dark ” .
It sold 150,000 copies in three months and received massive media coverage – a publicity blitz that had the impact of a “ clap of thunder ” .
Although the book is supportive of China ’s government and social order , authorities soon removed it from bookstores .
It then sold an estimated 7 million copies in pirate editions .
Earlier , Chen had written a denunciation of the disastrous pollution of the Huai River , which helped spur the government into a clean - up effort .
Unfortunately , the success was temporary ; a few years later , the polluters were back in operation .
In Will the Boat Sink the Water , Chen and Wu describe peasant efforts to halt blatantly illegal extortions by local officials during the 1990s in the authors ’ native province of Anhui ( see map ) .
In all the cases they describe , officials struck back violently , and several peasants were murdered by police or hired thugs .
The peasants organised protest marches and deputations , and in some cases won the sympathetic attention of high officials in Beijing .
But orders from on high proved ineffective , and when relayed down to the local level , usually came to nothing .
Even in rare cases where murderers were prosecuted , the victims ’ lot was no better .
Chen and Wu are master storytellers .
Their accounts are vivid , poignant and wise in their understanding of peasant life .
Extortion by local officials
All of these struggles turn on the issue of local taxation and what is done with the money .
During the period discussed , township officials had unlimited power to tax the peasantry .
With remarkable ingenuity , they developed an array of 269 listed taxes , and many more that were unrecorded or were invented ad - hoc .
Do you own a pig ?
If so , there are five taxes to pay , often levied even if you do n’t own a pig .
Do you want to marry ?
Twelve taxes are due , including a “ deposit for commitment to mutual devotion ” .
Does this spur you to complain ?
An “ attitude tax ” applies .
Officially , taxes are not supposed to exceed 5 % of income so these impositions were in large measure illegal .
Many stratagems hid the excess levies and the siphoning of revenue to enrich government officials .
The peasant struggles described by Chen and Wu usually involved pressing for an audit of the local government ’s financial records .
But the peasants portrayed in this book suffer from a crucial weakness : lack of legal recourse .
The best they can do is appeal to regional level Communist Party officials – a dangerous and usually futile procedure .
One sneering local official puts his finger on the key point : “ Do you really believe that crap you see on TV and read in the newspapers about the rule of law ?
Do n’t be daft .
Maybe in America … but that is America , not China . ”
Bureaucratic excess
As a result , Chen and Wu write , China ’s state bureaucracy has jumped “ from 2.2 million in 1979 to well over 10 million today ” , mostly in the countryside .
Meanwhile , government services to the rural population – the vast majority – have fallen to 8 per cent of the budget , less than half the previous proportion .
Meanwhile , rural officials enjoy the backwoods equivalent of conspicuous consumption .
China ’s countryside is a “ gourmand ’s paradise ” , Chen and Wu say .
The funds spent on dining at public expense , China - wide , could pay for four Olympic Games , every year – or “ wipe out the disgrace … of children being kept out of school ” because of a shortfall in educational spending .
China ’s two economies
The concluding section of Chen and Wu ’s book situates this drama of rural extortion within the longer story of “ Chinese peasants ’ burden ” .
Confronted in the 1950s with the Korean War and economic sanctions , both imposed by Western countries , China ’s revolutionary government had no choice but “ to prioritize industrialization and accumulate capital at the cost of agricultural development ” , Chen and Wu tell us .
“ It is impossible to do justice to the magnitude of the sacrifice that the peasants made . ”
Their brief account of rural collectivisation parallels what I wrote in ``50 Years After : The Tragedy of China ’s ` Great Leap Forward '' ' .
They note that the vigorous peasant resistance to this process was crushed in the years just before the “ Great Leap ” , and that the “ Cultural Revolution ” ( 1966 –76 ) struck further blows at agriculture .
In 1977 the average Anhui peasant was producing no more grain than his or her counterpart 2000 years earlier .
Residency requirements kept the peasants tied to the land , unable to move to the cities and locked in second - class legal and social status , lacking the economic and social benefits accorded to city dwellers .
The burden of ‘ reform ’
Following Mao Zedong ’s death in 1976 , Chen and Wu say the introduction of a “ household contract system ” ( making the family farm the basic agricultural unit ) unleashed peasant initiative , and peasant income rose 15 per cent per year for six years after 1978 .
But 1984 marked “ a great historical turning point ” .
The government shifted its focus to urban development , and once again peasants paid the price .
The crucial change , in Chen and Wu ’s opinion , was endowing rural townships – successors to the people ’s communes – with the power to impose and collect taxes .
Others tell the story somewhat differently .
Mobo Gao , in his U.S. - published Battle for China ’s Past , stresses government pricing policy – raising the price of agricultural produce after 1978 , then lowering it after 1984 .
Whichever explanation applies , it seems clear that the peasantry ’s post - Mao prosperity was short - lived .
The lure of migrant labour
By 2000 , “ agriculture had become a losing enterprise ” , Chen and Wu state .
“ An army of peasants turned their backs on the soil and marched into the city . ”
In 2005 , a quarter of Anhui ’s population had become migrant workers .
Migrant remittances to Anhui province are as large as the income generated within the province itself .
Migrants return with new skills and ideas .
Many of the migrants have been successful and become small - scale capitalists .
Anhui has become more prosperous : enterprises founded by successful migrants in the province employ 17,000 workers .
Yet Chen and Wu stress the negative side of migrant labour .
In the cities , migrants retain second - class rural legal status .
They are subjected to unpaid and unrestricted forced overtime , exposure to dangerous and unhealthy working conditions , delayed or denied pay , and arbitrary firing in case of sickness or accident .
Back at home , “ as the rural labour force drained away , local agriculture shrivelled and declined , creating a vicious cycle of increasing poverty and decreasing investment ” , no one wants to stay in the country ; “ the peasants do all they can to leave ” .
Able and energetic young people are the first to go .
“ The dwindling human resources soon usher in a decline in material resources ” and a bleeding away of investment capital .
Continuity in governance
Judging by Chen and Wu’s account , the exploitation of China ’s peasants today has much in common with what they experienced under Mao .
It does not involve seizing the peasants ’ land and driving them out of the villages and into the cities – instead , migrant workers retain their land rights and can return home .
Oppression is largely extra-legal and enforced by ad - hoc violence , backed by the authority of the Communist Party .
That may explain the party ’s ambiguity regarding rural social conditions .
Chen and Wu record six major national efforts to reduce burdens on peasants between 1993 and 2001 , none of which , in their opinion , had significant impact .
Local leaders routinely flout national directives with impunity .
Between 1990 and 2000 , per capita taxes paid by peasants were , on average , six times as high as those paid by city dwellers , even though the peasants ’ average income was only one - sixth as great as urban levels .
A peasant advocate in the party leadership – leader of a county in Hubei province – told Chen and Wu : “ The Party Central Committee knows perfectly well that although problems appear at the bottom , the root lies with the top leadership .
Why not pursue it at the top ? ”
But party leaders are reluctant to undercut the power of local chieftains , the mainstay of government authority in the countryside .
Repeal of agricultural taxes
In 2003 , in a major step to revive agriculture , China ’s government eliminated all agricultural taxes .
Chen and Wu , whose book was written immediately after that reform , are sceptical about its impact .
They note the absence of any move to prune back the rural bureaucracy or to provide it with an alternate source of income .
Taxes are being replaced by fees , they say , which are equally open to abuse .
The underlying disparity in power and lack of legal remedies in the countryside is unchanged .
Chen and Wu ’s book was published too early to contain a balance sheet of the tax reform .
But their subsequent personal fate is not encouraging .
Despite its moderate and fundamentally pro-government stance , their book was removed from bookstores .
The authors were subjected to a harassment lawsuit , which won a favourable reception in the courts and dragged on interminably .
Their names , ideas and legal predicament were blacked out from the media .
Ultimately , in self - defence , they reluctantly sought international publicity for their case .
Reformers ’ proposals
Chen and Wu’s book concludes with a survey of the opinions of some reformers within the Communist Party who are concerned regarding the needs of peasants .
Their comments are muted but insightful .
Agricultural specialist Zhu Shouyin condemns the role of the township authorities as “ independent entities with monopolistic power that tended strongly toward the pursuit of profits ” .
China ’s Reform , states , “ Let the peasants enjoy the status of a citizen ; give the peasants their basic rights . ”
Li Changping , editor of the magazinestates , “ Let the peasants enjoy the status of a citizen ; give the peasants their basic rights . ”
Yu Jianrong , an agricultural researcher , contends that “ there is no such thing as citizens ’ rights ” in China , “ only the capital and power and privileges of a ruling clique ” .
What ’s needed is a network of peasant organisations , truly representing their interests , to “ rally the peasants … to replace the current local bureaucracy by peasant self - rule ” .
Noted economist Wu Jinglian closes the book on an ambiguous note .
Famous as a proponent of “ market reform ” , he now describes China today with the words of Charles Dickens : “ The best of times , the worst of times ” , and says that a positive outcome is far from assured .
“ We of course hope for a good one , but the future of China can only depend on our convictions and our efforts of today . ”

Advertisement Rising high through the polluted air of Guangzhou City in southern China is a 71 - storey tower block which , according to its designers , will be the most energy - efficient in the world .
Among a host of features designed either to make or save energy , the one that caught my eye was the shape of the Pearl River Tower itself .
It is built in a curve , facing the prevailing winds .
And it has been deliberately sculpted to increase the speed of that wind and force it through slots in the building where wind turbines will be located .
Now , on many buildings , wind turbines are a waste of space because there 's so much turbulence in cities .
I heard an apocryphal story about a Japanese firm that installed a turbine which needed electric power to keep it turning to save the face of its would - be - green owners .
HOW THE TOWER SAVES ENERGY
High temperature fuel cells complement the sustainable systems
The outer skin controls glare and includes a photovoltaic system for energy Wind turbines generate power which can be fed to mechanical equipment
The design incorporates a " high performance " building envelope
An air displacement system relies on raised floors Cooling tower water passes through embedded tubes in the building
But the American architects of this tower - SOM - insist that their experiments in a wind tunnel show this building will generate economically viable wind power .
The vertical axis turbines will be located in the mechanical floors mandated by the Chinese government as emergency muster floors , so no usable office space will be lost .
SOM claims that by thinking carefully about the use of space combined with energy - saving and energy - generating technology , they have been able to make unprecedented gains , so this building will potentially create as much energy as it uses .
They are by no means the only architects to espouse the principle of integrated design , of course .
But some observers believe that too many buildings are still being put up with a few bolt - on green features , without proper thought as to what could be achieved through a more considered approach .
Take the cooling system in the tower .
Most of the time , air conditioning is done by fat air ducts which gobble both energy and space between floors and ceilings .
Here the cooling is done by a cool water system .
The water flows in ducts through concrete beams , and cool air descends upon the toiling masses from cold water radiators in the ceilings .
Ame Englehart says the building could only have been commissioned in China
This does n't just save energy .
SOM say it saves so much space that it's allowed the building 's owners to put in an extra five storeys of usable office floor at little extra cost .
Indeed , they predict that the extra investments in the building will start making the money in five years .
There are other green features too .
There 's a wide - spaced double - glazed wall , which channels hot air upwards to a mechanical floor where it 's harnessed for dehumidification .
There 's also substantial use of solar photovoltaic technology on the frontages of the building , which curve upwards toward the sun , although the current cost of photovoltaic arrays militated against cladding the building completely in energy - generating glass .
Inside there are numerous automatic control systems to make sure power is n't being wasted .
SOM say they could have coaxed the building to produce more energy but it would have been futile because there 's no facility in Guangzhou to feed self - generated power back into the grid .
To many , this will be a familiar tale .
' Radical ' design I can't verify whether all its claims are true , but the building is undoubtedly an exciting project .
Ame Englehart , director of SOM's East Asia office said : " This building is so radical it could only have been commissioned in China .
The owners are very self - confident and have been prepared to push the design as far as it will go . "
SOM insists that the design is site - specific and can't just be replicated elsewhere .
But the sad observation from my viewpoint standing on the girders of the 24th floor is that this tower is very much the exception rather than the rule .
The Chinese government has increased building standards recently but they still do n't lead to anything like the performance of the Pearl River Tower .
A report in the China Daily during my trip suggested that 40 % of bribery cases in China involve property development .
And a Western businesswoman I bumped into told me her firm could n't persuade Chinese clients to invest in more energy - efficient vehicles even if she could prove that they would start paying back their owners in energy costs in just 10 months .

With San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s announcement last month that he was withdrawing from next year ’s gubernatorial contest , the Democratic field in the race has dwindled to one : Jerry Brown .
Whatever one thinks of Brown ’s merits as a once - and - future governor , that ’s a pretty thin field to choose from .
It ’s not as if the Democrats are a small or embattled party in California , after all .
Barack Obama carried the state by 24 % last November .
Democrats hold both U.S. Senate seats , most statewide offices and have lopsided majorities in the Legislature and the congressional delegation .
Is Brown really the only candidate the Democrats can produce ?
It ’s not as if he has blown away state voters with his current performance as attorney general or his stint before that as mayor of Oakland -- episodes in Brown ’s long public life about which most Californians know little or nothing .
Millions of Democrats do remember -- many of them fondly -- Brown ’s 1975 - 1983 tenure as governor .
But millions do n’t .
And some of us who were around during the Brown years ca n’t forget that although he was a great friend of farmworkers and environmentalists , he also became the avid enforcer of Howard Jarvis ’ Proposition 13 once it passed and helped impose the fiscal straitjackets that make California ungovernable today .
When Brown sought the office the first time around , in 1974 , he was one among many in a crowded and very talented Democratic field .
As Republican Ronald Reagan approached the end of his second term as governor , five leading Democrats -- Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti , San Francisco state Sen. ( and later Mayor ) George Moscone , Bay Area Rep. Jerry Waldie , San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and Brown , then California ’s secretary of state -- vied to succeed him .
Today , as Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger staggers to the end of his term , the line of Democratic hopefuls is radically shorter .

Part of the reason for Brown ’s solitude in the race is the sheer cost of running for governor .
It ’s hard to see what Democrat would want to jump in at this point .
The prospect of having to first run against Brown , who has already raised more than $ 8 million and has n’t even formally declared his candidacy , and then against the likeliest Republican nominee , former EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman , who has tens of millions of her own money to dump into the race , would be daunting to any Democrat without a substantial fortune of his or her own .
Dianne Feinstein has such a fortune but has shown no indication that she ’s willing to give up her comfortable Senate seat for the roller coaster of gubernatorial politics .
Most other Democratic officeholders do n’t have anything like the Feinstein fortune to draw on .
Money has always played a huge role in California politics , of course :
In the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial primary that led to Brown ’s victory , the candidates ’ order of finish was in direct correlation to the amounts they had raised and spent -- a common occurrence in American elections .
But with the advent of candidates such as Whitman and Schwarzenegger , who can fund their own campaigns , potential candidates who ca n’t raise megabucks often opt not to run .
That ’s not the whole story , however .
In 1974 , there was also more coverage of major governmental leaders , particularly at the state level , than there is today .
Local television stations and newspapers maintained Sacramento bureaus .
Many Californians actually knew the identity of the Assembly speaker .
Today the TV bureaus and most of the newspaper reporters are long gone .
( This newspaper is one of the few that still maintains a significant presence in the capital . )
Coverage of Sacramento is a sometime thing at best -- and that ’s with one of the world ’s best - known celebrities serving as governor .
It ’s more difficult for an experienced and able statewide official -- Treasurer ( and former Atty . Gen. )
Bill Lockyer , say -- to achieve the visibility needed to wage viable campaigns for governor .
Brown , who entered politics when Sacramento still got news coverage , was more visible as secretary of state in the early ‘ 70s than he is in the more important position of attorney general today .
Even when Newsom was in the race , Brown assiduously avoided saying anything about where he wanted to take the state .
His newly solitary status can only encourage him to clam up even more .
More Californians are jobless than at any time since the Depression ; the great public universities and colleges that his father , Gov. Edmund “ Pat ” Brown , built are withering away ; state government is paralyzed -- yet Brown maintains a strategic , steadfast silence .
Because he is in some sense a known quantity , he can also be a tabula rasa .
He was already governor , some might conclude ; he knows what he ’s doing -- even though he has given no idea of what he actually might do .

California Democrats deserve a primary , a choice ; a creative , cacophonous discussion of the possible futures for their once - golden state .
Instead , their one candidate is running on silence and nostalgia .
If he goes unchallenged , that ’s one more black mark against California ’s political system .
House Republicans say they ’ll make Democrats feel the political heat for President Obama ’s decision to try Sept. 11 attack plotters in U.S. civilian courts by trying to force a vote on a bill to block those trials .
Republicans will launch a discharge petition — which means if a majority of House members sign on , then the bill would automatically be brought to the floor for a vote , despite the objections of Democratic leaders who control the chamber ’s schedule .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the Obama administration ’s decision to move 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others suspected of planning the Sept. 11 attacks from the Guantanamo Bay detention site to civilian courts in the United States shows Democrats are “ out of touch . ”
“ It really begs the question of what is the administration ’s overarching strategy to fight the terrorists and keep Americans safe .
We have n’t seen that overarching strategy yet , ” Mr. Boehner said .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , the top Republican on the House intelligence committee , will sponsor the petition , Mr. Boehner said .
If successful , the petition would force a vote on the “ Keep Terrorists Out of America Act , ” which would require that a governor and state legislature approve any transfer of a suspected terrorist from Guantanamo to their state .
The Senate already debated this issue earlier this month .
On a 54 - 45 vote , senators gave the green light to Mr. Obama to go ahead with civilian trials for the Sept. 11 plotters .
Attorney General Eric Holder last week announced the decision to hold the U.S. trials .
Mr. Holder and his backers say U.S. courts have shown they can handle the cases , and say the Sept. 11 attackers should not be dignified with military commission trials , which would elevate them to the level of warriors .
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , Maryland Democrat , said he thinks there ’s bipartisan support for Mr. Holder ’s decision , pointing to a letter from three conservative leaders who defended civilian trials as the right legal venue to hear the cases .
But Mr. Boehner and other opponents say the terrorists do n’t deserve the same rights as U.S. citizens , and worry that holding civilian trials signals a return to the 1990s when the threat from al Qaeda was treated as a criminal matter , not a war .
They also argue that sensitive intelligence information could be revealed in court trials and that the accused could use the trials as a propaganda exercise .
The last successful discharge petition was in 2001 , when Republicans and Democrats joined together to force a vote on overhauling campaign finance rules over the objections of Republican leaders who controlled the chamber at the time .

Tinkering with science ( Image : Russell Sach/ Scopefeatures.com )
Terry Pratchett , author of more than 70 books , has died aged 66 .
He had early - onset Alzheimer ’s .
Here we reproduce our interview with him about tinkering with science , his battle with Alzheimer ’s and the odds of escaping from a crab bucket .
TERRY PRATCHETT ’s garden is as full of meandering paths , sudden dead ends and hidden gems as one of his Discworld novels .
Copper - hued fish navigate their way through a weed - choked pond , a tray of Venus flytraps sits in a greenhouse that overflows with chillies the length of a child ’s arm , and beady - eyed tortoises quietly crouch in a herbarium . …
I started my Sunday walk in Shibuya having a look at Yamada Denki and then checking out the H&M Store that opened recently .
mmmm , looks like there is more than one Choo in town making news this week .
I had heard about the new NIKE store opening thanks to TokyoFashion.com and decided to go and check it out .
Since Harajuku is just one stop away on the Yamanote line , I set off on foot .
It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to walk down and on the weekend there are plenty of people out .
On the way I passed plenty of brand stores and took a few snaps of some .
There were plenty of people around , but too close to snap really .
My zoom lens would probably have hit someone in the face if I pointed it at them .
Never a good thing to happen when you want to get a photo taken .
^_^
A few more stores to see
Do you know any / all of the stores above ?
Some names were new to me .
It was so crowded today , there must have been some events on , or maybe everyone was fed up of being kept indoors with the flu and decided to make a break for it to Harajuku .
The new NIKE store which had been my original place to visit was close to Harajuku station .
Unfortunately they were guarding the store closely and did n’t want any photos taken .
Looks like they want to write their own copy rather than have social media getting in on the act .
Sorry , no photos to show you .
Instead here is some more Tokyo scenery to view ^__^ .
With NIKE not wanting any free publicity , I thought I would take some photos of adidas .
Do you normally take a walk on the weekend ?
What area do you normally go to see ?
What sites are there to view along the way ?

Steatopygia is a high degree of fat accumulation in and around the buttocks .
The deposit of fat is not confined to the buttock regions , but extends to the outside and front of the thighs , forming a thick layer reaching sometimes to the knee .
This is a widespread genetic trait of the Khoisan ( more commonly known as Bushmen ) .
It is specially a female feature , but it occurs in a lesser degree at men too ( in most genetic variations of Homo sapiens , females tend to exhibit a greater propensity to fat tissue accumulation in the buttock region as compared with males ) .
This trait is also found amongst the Pygmies of Central Africa or from Andaman Islands ( Southeast Asia ) .
Khoisan see this as a beauty sign : it begins in infancy and is fully developed by the time of the first pregnancy .
Steatopygia is often accompanied by the formation of elongated labia ( labia minora may extend as much as 4 inches ( 10 cm ) (! ) outside the vulva ) .
Look how a Boer in the XVIII the century describes this trait :
" The lining of the body appears to be loose , so that in certain places part of it dangles out .
They have to themselves this peculiarity from other races that most of them possess finger - shaped appendages , always double , hanging down from the private parts ; these are evidently nymphae ( labia minora ) . "
James Cook , the famous British navigator , noted in 1771 , while passing by Cape colony :
" The great question among natural historians , whether the women of this country have or have not that fleshy flap or apron which has been called the Sinus pudoris .
The most recent testimony of travellers commands us to put the cutaneous ventrale of female Hottentots in the same category as the human tail , and in like manner to relegate it to the fables . "
Steatopygia was studied for the first time by scientists in 1805 , by French zoologists P?ron and Lesueur , but at that time , many thought this was inaccurate or exaggerated , or that they had examined monstrosities and represented them as normal , or perhaps the subject may had been regarded as indelicate .
The labia forms can vary amongst Bushmen populations : in South West Africa , each labium is flattened and broadened to form a wing - like object , when laid out flat ( the ' butterfly ' type ) while in Botswana and the Cape Province of South Africa the width is reduced and the anterior part thickened , resulting in an object like the wattle of a turkey - cock .
The ' wattle ' type is commonly 3 - 4 " long ( 7 ? - 10 cm ) , the ' butterfly ' l? - 2 " ( 3.8 - 6.3 cm ) .
Pygmies ( both from Africa and Asia ) and Bushmen are seen as the remnants of the most archaic current races and once , they inhabited most of Africa , from the Gulf of Aden to the Cape of Good Hope and all southern Asia till New Guinea .
Hottentots , of mixed Bushmen - Bantu roots , also often present this trait , as do Basters , mulattoes between Boers and Bushmen or Hottentots , while at the Khoisan , males can present steatopygia more often than Hottentot women .
It seems that steatopygia in both sexes was common in early types of Homo sapiens .
Paleolithic figurines and cave paintings from Europe depicting women , some as old as 30,000 years , clearly display stetopygia .
Those Cro-Magnon were more similar racially to the current Bushmen and Pygmies than any current European type .
However , the type of Neolithic Venus figurines ( about 10,000 years old ) do not strictly match steatopygia , since they have an angle of about 120 degrees between the back and the buttocks , while steatopygia is characterized at an angle of just about 90 degrees .
In 3500 years old Egyptian painting , the queen of Punt is presented displaying steatopygia , so this country still not precisely located could have been situated in Eastern Africa .
These very large buttocks occur sporadically also among current African and Europid women .
( of course , some African women can possess Khoisan genes , so they display real steatopygia ) .
In steatopygia , the buttocks consist of masses of fat incorporated between criss - crossed sheets of connective tissue , joined to one another in a regular manner , while in other greatly enlarged buttocks , there is a mere accumulation of fat between two of the gluteus muscles ( maximus and medius ) .
Steatopygia is believed to be an adaptive physiological feature for female humans living in hot environments , as it maximizes their bodies ' surface - area / volume ratio but keeps enough fat to produce hormones needed for menstruation .
With fat deposited heavily in only certain areas in the middle on the trunk of the body , the limbs are left slim enough to expel heat more efficiently .
But more likely , being able to store large fat amounts is important in very seasonal environments like those in African savanna , where during the dry season , a food shortage installs , and live largely off of their stored fat .
Bushmen and pygmies are still hunters - gatherers , unlike other African populations that practice agriculture , so they do not experience severe food shortage during the dry season .
Women possessing these fat deposits can keep on reproducing through the unproductive seasons , thereby increasing their fitness .
Others say that the steatopygia developed as a response to sexual selection .

NASA launches in - house patch contest to mark shuttle era's end
As the sun sets on its space shuttle program , NASA has turned to its employees to design a patch .
( collectSPACE/NASA )
November 11 , 2009 —
With just six space shuttle flights remaining , the next scheduled to lift off next week , NASA has invited its past and present space program workers to design an emblem to mark the end of the shuttle era .
The winning design will be flown on the shuttle before the fleet retires .
The patch design contest , which began Oct. 15 and runs through the first of next month , takes its inspiration from a
" What we wanted to do was do something similar to what the astronauts do with their patches for their flights , " said Debbie Byerly , who is heading up the contest as technical assistant to shuttle program manager John Shannon .
" We want the employees , or the people who worked here within the last 30 years , to help us design this ' end of program ' patch . "
The shuttle , which made its
The latter is still on - going with STS - 129 , the sixth to last shuttle mission scheduled to launch to the ISS on Nov. 16 with a six - person crew .
The shuttle 's legacy is also represented by the more than 350 people who by the end of the program will have flown to space aboard Columbia , Challenger , Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour .
Byerly said she hopes the patches submitted will capture some of that history in whatever shape they may take .
" I did n't put any templates out there , " she said .
" I wanted [ to challenge ] people to think outside the box .
I wanted them to provide a short narrative as to how the patch was designed , what is included in the patch and what it means to them . "
That meaning may at least be partially influenced by what role the patch designer plays within NASA .
The contest is open to all who work for the federal agency at any of its 16 centers and facilities , as well as all those who work for the myriad of companies that support NASA 's activities as its contractors .
" If any retired people would like to submit a patch design , we'd be more than delighted , " added Byerly .
Other than being employed at some time for the U.S. civil space program , there are no other requirements for entry , including any artistic skills .
" It really is an amateur contest , " Byerly described .
" We have encouraged everybody , it does n't matter if you are a graphic artist , we just want your rendition of what the shuttle program means to you and how you would depict that in a patch . "
NASA 's graphic artists will assist by adapting the winning concept for production .
To select a winner , or winners , Byerly plans two panels .
A group of judges recruited from the various NASA centers will identify their favorite emblem while a vote is also held among the employees .
" We intend to place [ the designs ] on the web and have a ' people 's choice ' award , " Byerly said .
" This was designed and presented to be for employee morale .
The people who will be voting on it will be the employees . "
" We 'll have the top three prizes and then display all the patches and do something nice for everyone who submits something , " she added .
The top winner will see their design become a part of the legacy for which their patch is intended to honor .
" The person whose art is chosen , we will fly that artwork and we will manufacture the patches and then they will get a flown patch along with a big presentation case with their artwork in it , " Byerly told collectSPACE .
" So it should be fun for them and it gives them a chance to be a part of shuttle history . "
A note to NASA workers : if you enter this patch contest , collectSPACE invites you to show us your design .

The shuttle , which made its first flight in April 1981 , is set to be retired after its 134th mission , currently targeted for launch in Sep. 2010 .
Over the program 's 30 years , the five shuttle orbiters have deployed satellites , planetary probes and observatories , including the Hubble Space Telescope , as well as visited the Russian Mir space station and led the assembly of the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The latter is still on - going with STS - 129 , the sixth to last shuttle mission scheduled to launch to the ISS on Nov. 16 with a six - person crew .

What fascinated him above all else , Dr. Tanner said , '' was how the mathematics could become manifest in the paper .
You 'd think paper can't do that , but he'd say you just do n't know paper well enough . ''
One of Dr. Huffman 's discoveries was the critical '' pi condition . ''
This says that if you have a point , or vertex , surrounded by four creases and you want the form to fold flat , then opposite angles around the vertex must sum to 180 degrees -- or using the measure that mathematicians prefer , to pi radians .
Others have rediscovered that condition , Dr. Lang said , and it has now generalized for more than four creases .
In this case , whatever the number of creases , all alternate angles must sum to pi .
How and under what conditions things can fold flat is a major concern in computational origami .
Dr. Huffman 's folding was a private activity .
Professionally he worked in the field of coding and information theory .
As a student at M.I.T. in the 1950's , he discovered a minimal way of encoding information known as Huffman Codes , which are now used to help compress MP3 music files and JPEG images .
Dr. Peter Newman of the Computer Science Laboratory at the Stanford Research Institute said that in everything Dr. Huffman did , he was obsessed with elegance and simplicity .
'' He had an ability to visualize problems and to see things that nobody had seen before , '' Dr. Newman said .
Like Mr. Resch , Dr. Huffman seemed innately attracted to elegant forms .
Before he took up paper folding , he was interested in what are called '' minimal surfaces , '' the shapes that soap bubbles make .
He carried this theme into origami , experimenting with ways that pleated patterns of straight folds can give rise to curving three - dimensional surfaces .
Dr. Erik Demaine of M.I.T.'s Laboratory for Computer Science , who is now pursuing similar research , described Dr. Huffman 's work in this area as ' ' awesome . ''
Finally , Dr. Huffman moved into studying models in which the folds themselves were curved .
'' We know almost nothing about curved creases , '' said Dr. Demaine , who is using computer software to simulate the behavior of paper under the influence of curving folds .
Much of Dr. Huffman 's research was based on curves derived from conic sections , such as the hyperbola and the ellipse .
His marriage of aesthetics and science has grown into a field that goes well beyond paper .
Dr. Tanner noted that his research is relevant to real - world problems where you want to know how sheets of material will behave under stress .
Pressing sheet metal for car bodies is one example .
'' Understanding what 's going to happen to the metal , '' which will stretch , ''is related to the question of how far it is from the case of paper , '' which will not , Dr. Tanner said .
The mathematician G.H.
Hardy wrote that '' there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics . ''
Dr. Huffman , who gave concrete form to beautiful mathematical relations , would no doubt have agreed .
In a talk he gave at U.C. Santa Cruz in 1979 to an audience of artists and scientists , he noted that it was rare for the two groups to communicate with one another .

Advertisement Around the world millions of children are not getting a proper education because their families are too poor to afford to send them to school .
In India , one schoolboy is trying to change that .
In the first report in the BBC's Hunger to Learn series , Damian Grammaticas meets Babar Ali , whose remarkable education project is transforming the lives of hundreds of poor children .
At 16 years old , Babar Ali must be the youngest headmaster in the world .
He 's a teenager who is in charge of teaching hundreds of students in his family 's backyard , where he runs classes for poor children from his village .
The story of this young man from Murshidabad in West Bengal is a remarkable tale of the desire to learn amid the direst poverty .
Babar Ali's ' school ' has some 800 students Babar Ali 's day starts early .
He wakes , pitches in with the household chores , then jumps on an auto - rickshaw which takes him part of the 10 km ( six mile ) ride to the Raj Govinda school .
The last couple of kilometres he has to walk .
The school is the best in this part of West Bengal .
There are hundreds of students , boys and girls .
The classrooms are neat , if bare .
But there are desks , chairs , a blackboard , and the teachers are all dedicated and well - qualified .
As the class 12 roll - call is taken , Babar Ali is seated in the middle in the front row .
He 's a tall , slim , gangly teenager , studious and smart in his blue and white uniform .
He takes his notes carefully .
He is the model student .
Babar
Ali is the first member of his family ever to get a proper education .
HAVE YOUR SAY Everything I have and everything I am today is thanks to my education Mustafa Yorumcu , London " It 's not easy for me to come to school because I live so far away , " he says , " but the teachers are good and I love learning .
And my parents believe I must get the best education possible that 's why I am here . "
Raj Govinda school is government - run so it is free , all Babar Ali has to pay for is his uniform , his books and the rickshaw ride to get there .
But still that means his family has to find around 1,800 rupees a year ( $ 40 , £ 25 ) to send him to school .
In this part of West Bengal that is a lot of money .
Many poor families simply can't afford to send their children to school , even when it is free .
Chumki Hajra is one who has never been to school .
She is 14 years old and lives in a tiny shack with her grandmother .
Their home is simple A - frame supporting a thatched roof next to the rice paddies and coconut palms at the edge of the village .
Inside the hut there is just room for a bed and a few possessions .

Every morning , instead of going to school , she scrubs the dishes and cleans the homes of her neighbours .
She 's done this ever since she was five .
For her work she earns just 200 rupees a month ( $ 5 , £ 3 ) .
It 's not much , but it 's money her family desperately needs .
And it means that she has to work as a servant everyday in the village .
" My father is handicapped and can't work , " Chumki tells me as she scrubs a pot .
" We need the money .
If I do n't work , we can't survive as a family .
So I have no choice but to do this job . "
But Chumki is now getting an education , thanks to Babar Ali .
The 16 - year - old has made it his mission to help Chumki and hundreds of other poor children in his village .
The minute his lessons are over at Raj Govinda school , Babar Ali does n't stop to play , he heads off to share what he 's learnt with other children from his village .
At four o'clock every afternoon after Babar Ali gets back to his family home a bell summons children to his house .
They flood through the gate into the yard behind his house , where Babar Ali now acts as headmaster of his own , unofficial school .
Lined up in his back yard the children sing the national anthem .
Standing on a podium , Babar
Ali lectures them about discipline , then study begins .
Babar
Ali gives lessons just the way he has heard them from his teachers .
Some children are seated in the mud , others on rickety benches under a rough , homemade shelter .
The family chickens scratch around nearby .
In every corner of the yard are groups of children studying hard .
Babar
Ali was just nine when he began teaching a few friends as a game .
They were all eager to know what he learnt in school every morning and he liked playing at being their teacher .
Without this school many kids would n't get an education , they 'd never even be literate
Babar Ali
Did school change your life ?
Now his afternoon school has 800 students , all from poor families , all taught for free .
Most of the girls come here after working , like Chumki , as domestic helps in the village , and the boys after they have finished their day 's work labouring in the fields .
" In the beginning I was just play - acting , teaching my friends , " Babar Ali says , " but then I realised these children will never learn to read and write if they do n't have proper lessons .
It 's my duty to educate them , to help our country build a better future . "
Including Babar
Ali there are now 10 teachers at the school , all , like him are students at school or college , who give their time voluntarily .
Babar
Ali does n't charge for anything , even books and food are given free , funded by donations .
It means even the poorest can come here .
" Our area is economically deprived , " he says .
" Without this school many kids would n't get an education , they 'd never even be literate . "
Seated on a rough bench squeezed in with about a dozen other girls , Chumki Hajra is busy scribbling notes .
Her dedication to learning is incredible to see .
Every day she works in homes in the village from six in the morning until half past two in the afternoon , then she heads to Babar Ali 's school .
At seven every evening she heads back to do more cleaning work .
Chumki's dream is to one day become a nurse , and Babar Ali 's classes might just make it possible .
The school has been recognised by the local authorities , it has helped increase literacy rates in the area , and Babar Ali has won awards for his work .
The youngest children are just four or five , and they are all squeezed in to a tiny veranda .
There are just a couple of bare electric bulbs to give light as lessons stretch into the evening , and only if there is electricity .
And then the monsoon rain begins .
Huge drops fall as the children scurry for cover , slipping in the mud .
They crowd under a piece of plastic sheeting .
Babar
Ali shouts an order .
Lessons are cancelled for the afternoon otherwise everyone will be soaked .
Having no classrooms means lessons are at the mercy of the elements .
The children climb onto the porch of a nearby shop as the rain pours down .
Then they hurry home through the downpour .
Tomorrow they 'll be back though .
Eight hundred poor children , unable to afford an education , but hungry for anything they can learn at Babar Ali 's school .

Babar Ali is a hero ( and I do n't use that word often ) .
He , and his loyal pupils , deserve not only our total respect , but our support and encouragement too .
Rob Baker , Newport , S. Wales
" Be the change you want to see in others " - Babar leads by example - such a humbling story that encourages everyone .
Thank you !
Mari , London
The news is really an eye - opener .
We always blame others including Government , but Babar Ali proves that we can return back to the society if we want .
Pradosh Debnath , Kolkata , India
If there are saints in this world , Babar Ali is one of them .
He sees the problems of others .
If the corrupt officials could learn from this young boy , they would not waste huge public funds that could educate millions .
JK , DSM , Tanzania
In world were you are measured by the materials you own , ( house , cars , clothes etc ) it 's amazing to see a young making the most of what resource there is .
Trying to improve not only the quality of his life , but others around him .
A truly magnificent story about a remarkable young man .
Andrew Anastasi , London Babar
Ali is indeed a rare soul , who at such a young age is filled with a sense of duty , direction and patriotism .
Maybe if more youths of today were like him , the world would be a better place .
After reading the hardship these children go through , I cannot help but think how lucky Malaysian children are .
It 's human nature to take things for granted , some say .
But I will share this story with my students .
In hope that more will be inspired to be like someone like Babar Ali .
Teacher Jason , Penang , Malaysia
I too read this story with my mouth open and with tears in my eyes .
What an inspiration this young boy is .
This article should be read by teenagers in the western world who take their education for granted and think that they are entitled to whatever they want without lifting their little fingers .
I 'll definitely read this article to my teenage daughter .
Fayrouz , Abidjan , Côte d'Ivoire Every student in every senior school in the UK should be given a copy of this at the beginning of each school year ; to remind them of how privileged they are living in this country .
Ian Redding , Burscough , Lancashire , England What BABAR ALI is doing is unquantifiable .
I wish the local authority could give him a helping hand in order to take this ' school ' to where he has in mind .
He is a young man of vision and the whole world should stand up to help the guy .
It 's high time we stopped wasting our resources on things that does n't have a good end result .
This is a project that could go a long way in alleviating illiteracy if given the necessary support .
Say me well to him and tell him we are praying for his success .
Agboola Olawale , Ilorin , Nigeria Babar
Ali gives me hope that there is a India that is fighting and beating the odds despite all that is wrong with our system .... gives me hope that there are people that will lead us to real freedom from the darkness that we live in today ... gives me hope that one day millions of such Indians will be empowered through education to take charge of their own destiny .
I salute every Babar Ali that pushes India forward every single day .
Samudra , Mumbai , India Very inspiring !
it takes me back 30 years as my uncle used to do exactly the same in my native village which had one school where he used to work and had his informal classes for poor students at home .
Mr. Baber Ali , I salute you .
Srinivas Patnala , Grahamstown , South Africa
What a truly remarkable chap !
But hold on , is n't this India , the world 's largest democracy ?
Does n't anyone there want to legislate to make education state funded and available for all ?
What about abandoning their nuclear weapons and space programme to allow this to be funded .
Tim Stokes , Sittingbourne , Kent A powerful example set by Mr. Babar Ali .
After reading this article , I feel like going back home to my village in India and do something like this .
Shiv Sharma , Vermont , USA Just Phenomenal !
Stories like Babar Ali's are inspirational and life - changing .
If the smallest percentage of readers the world over get inspired to give back in some form to further education in such villages , the Indian story will be one of enlightenment .
Rahul S , New York , NY
It 's young people like this who really make the world turn and people stand up and realise that there is more outside of our little corners that is far more remarkable than we could ever achieve .
Donna , Milton Keynes
This is a great story .
I come from Calcutta , W Bengal near to the place Babar Ali is doing this great job .
I am going to Calcutta in November .
I will positively visit the school , meet Babar Ali and will donate anything my resources will permit to support his mission .
Amit Ray , River Hills , USA
To influence one life is itself amazing , and here is Babar , at 16 , influencing and changing 800 lives for their betterment .
Hats off to him and I hope somebody from the West Bengal Education department read this story and hopefully reacts soon !!
Rakzeen , Detroit , Michigan , USA A little ray of light in all that darkness .
I reckon this guy deserves the Nobel prize for peace right now .
Obama could have waited a year .
Reinhard Adolf , Yokohama , Japan I have no words .
It just makes me think that I should not complain about anything and take things for granted .
Florence Nesamani , Pune , India Quite Amazing !
Does this happen here in our planet ?
Ali is doing something which many other could think to be fictitious .
Wondwossen , Adds Ababa
The United States and all other other 1st world countries should support this young person give him the nobel peace prize , more education more peace I believe .
YTFD
I can't believe this , what a remarkable young man !
I read this article with my mouth open .
Thanks for this article BBC it makes me truly , truly humbled .
Olu , Stevenage , Hertfordshire Babar Ali is a great soul .
He will change lot of young lives .
This is truly a remarkable story .
The higher education system in Great Britain USA and should recognize Babar Ali and help him all the way in his noble cause .
Sunil Parikh , Davie , Florida
This article is like a cold shower that woke me up .
my parents pay thousands of euros to my uni every year to give me an education .
Realising that with the same amount of money all these children could much easily get education hurts .
It hurts realising i have the chance and the means to learn , but I 'm even complaining for having " too much to study " .
To see i have Facebook open instead of a book .
We do need articles like this , we do need to wake up .
Melisa , Rome
No doubt , wherever Mr Babar Ali goes , even highly educated and positioned people will stand and respect him .
I salute Babar Ali and pray for the future to be bright and prosperous for ' The Head Master ' and his ' Pupil ' .
May God , through the Government , fulfil their desire .
S.Vijayan , Chennai , India
What an extraordinary story !!
It nearly brought tears to my eyes .
What dedication and commitment in such dire poverty from all these people .
I personally never had any such problems and quite frankly could never dream of any as I was blessed to be in free state schooling in the UK .
However , when I read the story of Babar Ali and his students , it makes me feel tiny .
Thank you for bringing this story BBC .
Sajjid Abbasi , Saudi Arabia
What a wonderful kid , if only we can get his type within our community , we could be better off .
Instead of our graduates to be sitting down under trees to argue unnecessarily they can borrow a leaf from Babar Ali .
Ahmad Ibrahim , Kano , Nigeria
The world needs people like these with the conviction to make a CHANGE in others lives .
Syed , Muscat
This boy deserves the highest recognition by the world 's highest human rights institutions .
He should be awarded a price in form of a school built near his home and named after it .
He should be assisted to train as an educator in order for him to carry on his noble duties to his community
German Lungu , Lusaka , Zambia I was deeply humbled by Babar Ali 's story .
So many people so many parts of the country take education funded by the government for granted .
Deliberately missing lessons etc .
And here are some 800 kids who 'll do anything to get educated , to be better , thanks to this extremely remarkable teenager .
We should be ashamed with our selves if we at some point took things for granted .
Farah , Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia
It 's cost over $ 50 K for my education as a primary school teacher .
I wish I could have sent it to them instead !
Kimberly Luedke , Milwaukee , WI United States India is in the process of a social change and it is the youths like Babar Ali who are trying to bring this change .
It is people like him who are trying their bits and they have kept alive the hopes of numerous people in India whose lives are not rosy but every night they sleep in the hope that tomorrow will bring something good .
Bhavna Karki , Delhi , India
We 're proud of you , Babar Ali !
India needs leaders like you and our world needs citizens like you .
It 's my wish to see you as a great leader in future , who will be able to change the life of not just 800 students , but of 800 villages , and for 800 generations .
Liza , Addu Atoll , Maldives Wow !
Just imagine if every 16 year old did this how smart the world would be ?
What a truly remarkable young man .
Mary , Holden , MA , USA I have deep love and great regards for my country and its people .
I am proud of this lamp lighting other lamps around him .
With people like Babar Ali taking the initiative and doing what they believe in no one can stop my country and its people from moving ahead .
Keep up the good work !

The folks over at Hulu Labs have been busy it seems , as they have just released a version of their desktop client for Linux .
Windows and OSX versions of the desktop client have been out for some time now , but Linux has been left in the dark .
Functionality wise , it operates and plays videos identically to its counterparts .
The Linux version can also be controlled via an IR remote .
We certainly are excited to add this to our entertainment systems .
The release is a bit of a surprise , but a welcome change to the usual treatment of Linux , and it ’s nice to see the mainstream start to recognize it .
Plus , this is just more ammunition for getting rid of those monthly cable / satellite subscriptions .
Remanonjona Feroce founded the village of Anjamahavelo – meaning At the Lucky Baobab – in Madagascar a generation ago .
With memories of a flood still fresh , he chose a spot far from the nearest river .
He cleared the wild forest and sacrificed a sheep in the hope that it would make the owls , lemurs and snakes go away .
" Animals can't live together with little children and young girls , " explained Feroce , an 85 - year - old great - grandfather .
" They do n't want snakes to be here because they have bad spirits .
They strangle children by curling around the neck .
Owls are bad birds .
If one hoots , it means somebody will die . "
The animals did go away , but so did the luck of Anjamahavelo , a cluster of wooden houses .
Southern Madagascar has had three years of crop failure in five years , resulting in chronic hunger for tens of thousands of families and soaring rates of malnutrition , stunted growth and death among children .
Three forces are combining with deadly effect on the Indian Ocean island , which is incalculably rich in wildlife but impoverished in basic infrastructure .
Climate change is widely blamed for playing havoc with the seasons and destroying agricultural harvests .
This is exacerbated by local deforestation , which has altered the microclimate and reduced rainfall .
Finally , a bloody political coup earlier this year paralysed essential services and led to the crippling suspension of several foreign aid programmes .
The UN says that nearly half of households in the south have severe food shortages .
To feed her five children in Anjamahavelo , Tinalisy – her only name – works as a prostitute at the end of each month , when the local men , mostly in the police , have been paid .
The unmarried 27 - year - old has slept with men for sex since she was 17 .
" If the men do n't want to marry , that is not really a problem .
We have to survive . "
Tinalisy says her 20 - month - old daughter , Vany Lentine , suffers a fever each evening .
" We eat once or twice a day – always cassava .
I 'm worried but what I can do ?
There is no money .
People here are unhappy because their children do not eat .
There is nothing to be happy about . "
Other villagers say that the fierce competition for dwindling resources has led to lawlessness and violence .
Valiotaky , 56 , the village chief , supplies an explanation for the drought .
" When we plant trees we do n't have rain and nothing grows , " he said .
" I think God is angry .
Young people do n't respect the traditions . "
Perversely , people in the south are so starved of water that they crave the increasingly fierce cyclones that pound the north three times a year .
Two separate dry seasons have progressively expanded until they meet to form one long hot season , hitting crops such as maize , manioc and sweet potato .
Tovoheryzo Raobijaona , director of a food insecurity early warning system in nearby Ambovombe , said : " Before , people spoke about the cycle of drought every 10 years .
Now it 's every five years , or every three years .
After a bad year like 2009 , people need two to three years to get back to standard . "
Unicef , the UN 's children 's agency , said that in the past six months 8,632 children had been treated for severe acute malnutrition in three southern regions – more than double the expected number .
The UN's World Food Programme ( WFP ) warns that 150,000 children could be affected this year .
There are reports of people resorting to eating lemurs and turtles , even though these are culturally taboo .
They have also resumed cutting down trees for firewood or to make space for rice fields , inadvertently adding to the drought problem by reducing the capacity of forests to capture water that will evaporate into clouds and become rain .
The added impact of global climate change is difficult to quantify .
The World Bank says that only one thing is certain : in the past half century Madagascar has seen a 10 % increase in temperature and 10 % decrease in rainfall .
Experts say it is not a question of whether this trend will continue , but by how much .
Silvia Caruso , deputy country director of the WFP , said : " Environmental degradation and climate change are building on each other .
The results are dramatic in Madagascar . "
This has been compounded by political instability .
In March Andry Rajoelina , a city mayor , businessman and former DJ , seized power from president Marc Ravalomanana after clashes that left dozens dead .
The fallout has been political deadlock , economic downturn , job losses , price inflation , collapsing public services , a flight of investors and international sanctions on a country that relies on foreign aid for half its budget .
Caruso added : " The coup has paralysed services that we need to work with in the provinces .
It has made the response to drought more complex .
We had to fill the gaps at regional level . "
Bruno Maes , Unicef 's representative for Madagascar , described the coup as " a disaster for children " , adding : " Madagascar was on the road to take - off .
They understood it was time to make reforms in health and education , so that all children can have access .
Now all this is frozen .
Nothing is moving . "
Unicef has provided medicine and training to all regional health clinics for acute malnutrition cases , supported food distribution and worked to improve sanitation .
The WFP has begun programmes to provide school meals to 215,000 children , help 8,000 households mitigate against environmental change and supply supplementary feeding to around 70,000 children under two and pregnant and lactating women .
Maes said Unicef was also negotiating with the World Bank to directly administer money earmarked for teachers ' salaries .
" Children 's rights should be addressed in any situation – whatever the crisis . "
Case - study : ' Lack of food is eating us up '
Zanasoa Relais Anjado , 38 , has 11 children .
Her husband , a former plantation worker , is unemployed .
They live in Anjado village in southern Madagascar .
" Lack of food is eating us up every day .
We often go through very hard moments – in the most difficult we ate only tamarinds [ fruit ] mixed with ashes .
We were hungry and tired and had to beg for something to eat .
We were like famine victims … I have 11 children and I do n't know how to feed them .
Sometimes we have one meal a day , sometimes two .
One of my children was sick .
He managed to survive and recover , but I know people in the community who are still very weak .
The river is 5 km from here and we walk for hours to get there …
With rainwater we would cook food and diversify agriculture .
We 'd plant cabbages , green leaves , corn and beans .
What we planted so far dried and failed …
It will be really difficult and we will suffer .
That is why I am asking the government for help , directly and immediately .
Without it , we risk dying here .
I do n't care about the political situation in the country .
The only thing that concerns me is that I 'm eating . "
“ It ’s going to kill the industry , ” said Gary Cook , business manager for UA Local 78 , which represents studio plumbers .
Mr. Lowe , meanwhile , is portraying the studios as greedy giants scheming to trample the little guy .
“ Do n’t let a few movie studios prevent you from seeing the latest DVDs for an affordable price , ” reads a headline on a new Redbox Web site , savelowcostdvds.com .
Redbox , formerly owned by McDonald ’s and now part of Coinstar , is only the biggest of a host of DVD vending companies .
DVDPlay , whose kiosks are also red , has been aggressive in California , while MovieCube is big in Canada .
Blockbuster is scrambling to introduce its own rental kiosks .
There are now about 500 Blockbuster Express machines , and plans call for 2,500 more by the end of the year ; the company expects to open 7,000 in 2010 , a spokesman said .
The kiosk boom is fed by several consumer and business currents , all related to the recession .
For starters , the dismal economy has made people think twice about buying DVDs , especially as the likes of Redbox have made renting easier .
Consumers are also tiring of the clutter :
The average American household with a DVD player now has a library of 70 DVDs , according to Adams Media Research .
Over all , DVD sales are down 13.5 percent for the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 , according to the Digital Entertainment Group , a trade organization .
Studios say some new titles are selling 25 percent fewer copies than expected .
Rental revenue is up about 8 percent over the same period , according to the group .

When people remain closeted , they have no voice .
That 's why we must provide a welcoming environment for our intersex brothers and sisters , writes Sherry Wolf .
I HAVE been on a whirlwind public speaking tour ever since my book Sexuality and Socialism came out in June .
Having written a left - wing historical , political and theoretical analysis that grapples with the entire spectrum of sexual and gender variations , I 've become accustomed to seeing audiences of gender - benders of every self - description .
It has been my great pleasure to meet and befriend many transgender people who feel that I respected their stories and their history -- in a field of writing that largely tends to sideline trans issues .
But one gig I did in Portland , Maine , in September sticks in my mind as the first time in my presence that an intersex person stood up in public , bravely outed himself , and told a gathering of supportive listeners what it was like to go through life as a person who has both male and female parts .
Sexuality and Socialism discusses intersexuality as part of the spectrum of human sexual variation that must be accepted and embraced as the thoroughly normal physical reality that it is .
An estimated one in every 2,000 infants in this country is born intersex , which according to the Intersex Society of North America ( ISNA ) is loosely defined as " a general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that does n't seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male . "
Five times a day in American hospitals , doctors surgically alter a newborn infant 's genitalia for cosmetic purposes , often amounting to mutilation that prevents the grown child from ever experiencing an orgasm .
Ever since the 1950s , doctors have considered it a " medical emergency " to assign a fixed sex to a baby born with elements of both male and female genitalia .
It is a cruel practice that amounts to medically sanctioned child abuse .
AT THE Portland meeting I could see my references to intersex people in the talk drew approving looks from a couple of folks in the crowd .
After speaking , an older gentleman stood up and , in a loud , clear voice , told a story that riveted every person in that room .
He said his name was Richard , and he was born 67 years ago on a farm in rural Maine and worked much of his life in construction .
He had the appearance of a man who'd worked hard with his hands and body and , in his older years , did n't have much money for clothes , dental care or personal frills .
Richard went on to describe how he'd discovered at the age of 24 that he was beginning to menstruate -- after biologically fathering two children and serving in the armed forces .
His breasts grew larger as he entered late female puberty .
Richard lived with the silent embarrassment and shame that many intersex people experience :
Where could he toss a bloody pad on a construction site ?
How could hide his breasts from his co-workers ?
How could he get medical attention from a gynecologist ?
Would his family desert him if they knew the truth about his anatomical variations ?
These and a million other daily insults and inconveniences kept him mum about his intersexuality until 10 years ago , when he turned 57 and could n't remain quiet any longer .
After the meeting , Richard showed me the government papers he must carry with him to gain access to proper medical care .
They were stamped " hermaphrodite " in large , typed letters -- some bureaucrat 's decision on high has retained that nasty , anachronistic slur in formal documentation .
When he asked me to sign a copy of my book for him , I asked him to spell his name just in case .
He placed his hand on my arm and looked at me intently .
" Please call me Riki now that you know who I really am , " he said .
It strikes me that in the same way that the gay and lesbian struggle of the late 1960s and ' 70s opened the door for bisexuals and transgender people to come out and make their demands on the movement and society , it is now necessary for our burgeoning LGBT movement to give expression to the harm and shame that has been done to intersex people .
The case of South African runner Caster Semenya makes a blunt illustration of what will happen without civil rights for and social acceptance of intersex people .
Caster , the 18 - year - old phenom who broke the women 's 800 - meter record in Berlin this past summer , should be celebrating the victory of her young life , but instead is on suicide watch because she was secretly gender - tested and found to have internal testes and no ovaries .
I 'm not sure what circle of hell Dante would have reserved for someone who so callously toys with the life of a young woman , but I can think of a few choice torments .
I truly admire people like Riki who can stand before an audience and speak an intimate and uncomfortable truth .
For Riki and Caster 's sake , activists should work to provide a safe and welcoming environment for our intersex brothers and sisters to come out and join us .
As the LGBT struggle illustrates , so long as a people remain closeted , they have no voice , no respect and no solidarity .
Demand an end to state - sanctioned intolerance and imposition of rigid sex norms on healthy intersex newborns .
Take a few minutes to peruse ISNA 's Web site , and consider reading Jeffrey Eugenides ' novel Middlesex over Christmas break for a start .
Did you hear a glorious roar last night at around 10:20 p.m.?
That was the shrieking happiness of every fan of AMC ’s Mad Men when bombshell turned helpmate Joan Holloway finally — and with hilarious briskness — did to her husband what we ’d been fantasizing since last season .
In the aftermath , Christina Hendricks gave Vulture a Joan ’s - eye view of marriage , the lessons of Helen Gurley Brown ’s Sex and the Single Girl , and the problem of Joan as heroine .
It was so cathartic to see you conk your husband on the head with a vase .
I have n’t seen it yet !
I ’ve been out of town shooting and getting married .
I ’m almost caught up .
What was your reaction when you read the script ?
Well , I had been warned .
My writer told me at the very beginning , and when people have come up to me saying , “ you ’ve got to get rid of that husband , ” I ’m like , just wait .
[ Laughs ]
You ’ll be happy .
In general , how do you imagine Joan ’s daily life with “ Dr. Rape ” ?
Oh God ! [ Laughs ]
You know , there are moments where you see them being kinder with one another , her helping him with the interview .
Or they ’re preparing for a dinner party .
Even though they ’re fighting , she relents and is like , okay , let me help you .
She is a good wife !
And she has convinced herself that everything ’s okay , and she just focuses on those moments .
It did n’t seem to me she married him for his heart .
Obviously , we all remember the rape , the most dramatic moment between the two of them .
But I think when she brings him to the office to show him off , she really is proud of him .
And you know , I think that Joan likes to make things very tidy and clean , whether it be her relationships at work , or her actual desk , or her appearance , or her relationship at home .
I think she justifies certain things and cleans them up in her mind .
Do you think Joan thinks of what happened as a rape ?
No , no , she thinks it was a bad date , a bad evening .
Do you think her husband does ?
No .
I ’ve always thought of Joan as representative of the whole Helen Gurley Brown Sex and the Single Girl idea .
Was that part of the thinking for her character ?
Absolutely .
I read Sex and the Single Girl and Sex and the Office before — not before the pilot , because I did n’t know about it at that point — but after the pilot , and before we started season one .
They were huge inspirations .
I started turning down pages of things that I thought would be useful or relevant , and then I realized every single page was turned down .
[ Laughs ]
Tons of great tidbits that , you know , even if no one else catches them or something , that I ’m thinking of .
Can you give me an example ?
Just certain things , like the way you prepare your desk .
Making sure there are little candies out because that ’s enticing .
Making sure that your slip shows just a tiny , tiny bit when you ’re sitting down because that ’s alluring .
How do you think Joan regards
Peggy at this point in the show ?
Joan has just relented !
She ’s like , okay , you ’re not listening to me .
But they still know they need each other to a certain extent , and I think Joan is still flattered when she needs some advice .
There was a really interesting part in the tractor episode when Joan and Don have this moment at the hospital .
What was the deal there ?
That was fun because I hardly ever have scenes with Jon Hamm .
In season one , he walks by and Joan says something : “ I ’ve always wondered why he ’s never been interested in me . ”
But they quietly respect each other and do n’t really get in each other ’s business .
Was there sexual tension ?
I certainly was n’t playing it as a sexual dynamic .
I was playing it more like , here ’s Joan ’s last day and this crazy bullshit happened , and here ’s a man that she respects , and he ’s saying , “ we ’re going to miss you , ” and she ’s like , “ it feels good to hear that from you because you hardly ever talk to me . ”
Does it ever get frustrating because Joan has been more in the background ?
Yeah , I want to work every day , absolutely .
It ’s also terrible for her to be out of the office , because there ’s less opportunity for her to be in scenes .
Right , yeah , I know !
[ Laughs ]
Tell me about it .
It ’s slightly troubling to me that people seem to regard Joan as a straight - up superhero .
Yeah , I get a lot of this sort of “ you go , girl ! ” attitude .
If you pulled her out of the sixties , people would n’t feel the exact same way .
But I think there ’s so much mistreatment of women , and the fact that she ’s knocked back is powerful for people :
She holds her head up high and works through it , and I think it makes people feel good that she ’s not whimpering in a corner .

" We think we must now accept that there is something very wrong with EU copyright law .
The incontrovertible evidence is that it needs substantial reform every time an innovative service using copyright works comes along , " he said .

This game might be the most awesome thing since sliced bread ; even a while after its original release , I am still thinking about it .
The indie game scene is funny in that something that has years of history can be so below the radar that introducing it again can be fresh news to the majority .
Is n’t that , after all , why we are here ?
To cast some light on the thousands of hidden gems in the dark mines and pathways of the metaverse ?
But we digress ….
The basic concept in And Yet It Moves is not so different from other side - scrollers wherein you try run and jump your way through the levels except that here we find a crazy twist : you can rotate the whole world .
That ’s right !
Up is down and left is right .
You ca n’t fall to your doom , but you can still die .
I played this game a couple years ago after seeing it on a list somewhere on the Interweb .
The thing that got me hooked was how you can do your normal run and jump through the levels like Earthworm Jim , but you also control the world around you .
For example , imagine you are running from a boulder and arrive at a cliff .
You can jump off the cliff , rotate the world , and be standing on the side of the wall .
The game ’s graphics are a love / hate thing with me .
The level and the character look like they have been cut out of a piece of construction paper , a strangely popular design choice among many contemporary indie games , perhaps because it “ breaks down the 4th wall , ” and reminds it us that is the golden age of indie game innovation in much the same way that Nirvana ’s Bleach album or early Mudhoney were anti-establishment and though they were excellent musicians , leaned towards the lo-fi to demonstrate that they were not bred of corporate money .
But the background pictures are pretty to look at .
This game has won various awards at indie game events and was well liked by the guys at IGN ( which we point out only because a large lens like theirs can help move a lot of units for a small indie game ) .
The major drawback I have seen is that the version I played was only two levels long although it has since been re-released as a full - length .
The music is very relaxing which can be good for an after work stress reliever .
Recommended for anyone !

Since the introduction of statins to treat high cholesterol , the decline in lipid levels experienced by the wealthy has been double that experienced by the poor .
While statins are highly effective in reducing cholesterol and improving heart health , their use may have contributed to expanding social disparities in the treatment of cardiovascular disease , according to research by Virginia W. Chang , MD , PhD , of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania , and Diane S. Lauderdale , PhD , of the University of Chicago , published in the September issue of Journal of Health and Social Behavior .
" Income disparities in lipid levels have reversed over the past three decades , " according to Dr. Chang , lead author and Assistant Professor of Medicine and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania .
" High cholesterol was once known as a rich man 's disease , because the wealthy had easier access to high fat foods ( e.g. , red meat ) .
Now wealthy Americans are least likely to have high cholesterol , because they are more likely to be treated with statins , an expensive but highly effective pharmaceutical treatment to lower lipid levels . "
While cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the U.S. , mortality due to heart disease has declined dramatically since the 1980s .
Researchers estimate that about one - third of that reduction is a result of pharmaceutical innovation , including the use of statins .
Dr. Chang notes , " Though statins have a longer - run potential to reduce disparities by making it easier for everyone to lower cholesterol relative to lifestyle changes , they have yet to diffuse widely across all income levels . "
This study was supported in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
GRAND RAPIDS — After Lee Craddock and an adult female relative were held at gunpoint along a rural road , they told police an appalling tale :
They were ordered into the woods near Kent City and forced to have sex while their attacker watched .
The allegations last April led to the arrest of Jeremy Gentz , a Kent City man who resembled an artist ’s rendering of the suspect .
But the investigation has taken a more sinister turn .
Authorities now say Craddock , a convicted sex offender , set up the gunman scenario near 20 Mile Road and Red Pine Avenue NW to sexually assault the young woman , who does not live in his household .
And Gentz — who was jailed as a suspect for four months on a string of felony charges — has been cleared of any wrongdoing and released from jail .
His lawyer said investigators have obtained a confession from the real gunman , who has not yet been charged .
As the case winds through Kent County courts , questions remain , such as how Gentz was ever fingered for the crime in the first place .
Gentz ’s attorney says the 31 - year - old man was jailed after the female victim picked his picture out of a photo lineup , and Gentz was kept behind bars even after Craddock was charged with orchestrating the crime .
“ It ’s truly bizarre and it ’s particularly sad that Jeremy sat in jail with absolutely no corroborating evidence that he was involved or had any connection to this , ” said Jeffrey West , the defense attorney .
“ There was nothing more than a sketch and an incorrect identification .
“ I ’m not sure where the flaw in the procedure was , but it ’s clear that it was n’t handled appropriately . ”
Craddock and the sex - assault victim told police they were riding on his motorcycle when they were flagged down by a man standing along 20 Mile Road .
At the time , the two were traveling to a house where the victim was considering moving .
The man pulled a gun and demanded Craddock and the victim enter the woods and engage in intercourse while he watched .
The victim , at a hearing last summer , testified she said she would rather be shot than follow through with the order , but said Craddock exhorted her to comply because he did n’t want to see her hurt .
The gun-toting man disappeared , and she pushed her 52 - year - old relative off her , she said in court .
Following the alleged assault , the victim and Craddock worked with officers to develop a suspect sketch , which then was distributed to authorities .
Police identified Gentz , who was arrested in July and jailed until last week , because he fit the alleged gunman ’s description and lived in Kent City .
The victim also identified him as the suspect when she was presented six photos of the possible gunman .
Authorities , as recently as Nov. 17 , continued prosecuting Gentz , including fighting West ’s attempt to have an expert witness testify at trial about problems with witness identifications .
That was despite Craddock ’s arrest more than a month earlier for first - degree criminal sexual conduct , conspiracy to commit a sex offense and being a habitual offender .
Craddock allegedly told the woman not to call police after the April crime , gave inconsistent statements to detectives and refused a polygraph , according to an arrest warrant affidavit .
He also drove 2 miles past the house he and the relative were to visit .
“ Based on Lee Craddock ’s deliberate action to place himself and ( the victim ) at the scene of the crime ... investigators believe Lee conspired to commit criminal sexual conduct , ” state police Sgt. Denise Bentley wrote in court records .
Craddock is expected to stand trial on the charges next year .
He remains in the Kent County Jail .
Neither Bentley nor Gentz nor the female victim could be reached for comment .
Kent County Assistant Prosecutor James Benison confirmed Gentz is no longer a subject of the investigation .
No other arrests have been made , he said .
State police records show Craddock has sex assault convictions from 1978 and 1995 .
The Alpine Township man served 12 years in prison for the 1995 attack , records show .
West , Gentz ’s lawyer , said Craddock ’s arrest was never disclosed to him .
Gentz had been charged with a sex offense , kidnapping , unlawful imprisonment , carrying a concealed weapon and using a gun during a felony .
“ These were very aggressive charges considering the lack of information outside of the complaining witnesses , one of whom was involved , as it turns out , ” West said .
“ The truth does come out , but there are innocent victims in the process . ”

Hitler eventually dismissed Fritz Darges over an incident with a fly
The memoirs of one of Adolf Hitler 's closest aides could shed new light on the Nazi leader 's personal involvement in the Holocaust , media reports say .
Fritz Darges , who has died aged 96 , was a member of Hitler 's inner circle for four years of the war .
As Hitler 's last SS adjutant , he was present for all major conferences , the UK's Daily Telegraph reported .
Historians believe his manuscript could provide key evidence that Hitler ordered the deaths of six million Jews .
If so , it would debunk claims by revisionist historians that the Nazi dictator knew nothing of the Holocaust , the newspaper reported .
In an interview with a German newspaper shortly before his death , Mr Darges told how he met Hitler at the Nuremburg party rally in 1934 .
" He had a sympathetic look , he was warm - hearted .
I rated him from the off , " he is quoted as saying .
" I must , and was , always there for him , at every conference , at every inter - service liaison meeting , at all war conferences .
I must say I found him a genius .
We all dreamed of a greater German empire .
That is why I served him and would do it all again now , " he was quoted as saying .
' Sacked over fly '
He also told the German newspaper how he was dismissed by Hitler over a bizarre incident involving a fly .
The fly had been buzzing around the room during a strategy conference in July 1944 , irritating the Nazi leader .
Hitler ordered Mr Darges to get rid of it , but the SS adjutant suggested that as it was an " airborne pest " the job should go to Luftwaffe adjutant , Nicolaus von Below .
He said Hitler then flew into a rage and dismissed him , saying : " You 're for the eastern front . "
Mr Darges had trained as an export clerk but joined the SS in April 1933 .
He became senior adjutant to Hitler 's secretary Martin Bormann in 1936 and was promoted to the Fuhrer 's personal staff in 1940 .
He died at his home in Celle , near Hannover , last weekend .

The world economy is recovering from financial disaster .
But it will not return to normal as we know it , says Simon Cox ( interviewed here )
Illustration by Andy Martin
NEWPORT BEACH , California , is not a bad place to contemplate the future of the world economy .
Its information office promises nine miles of pristine sand , fine dining for devoted epicureans and an atmosphere of laid - back sophistication .
Yet students of economic turmoil will find their subject matter conveniently close to hand .
California 's unemployment rate has doubled to 12.2 % since the start of 2008 .
Saddled with the worst credit rating in the country , the “ Golden State ” is cutting spending on schools , prisons and health care for the elderly , as well as closing parks and laying off staff for three days a month .
It will pay its workers a day late at the end of the fiscal year so that the expense will show up in next year 's budget .
Financial shenanigans are not the sole province of the banking industry .
Newport Beach is also the home of Pimco , the biggest bond manager in the world , which handles $ 840 billion on behalf of pension funds , universities and other clients .
In May the company held its annual “ Secular Forum ” , in which it tries to peer five years into the economic future .
After two days of rumination , Pimco 's laid - back sophisticates concluded that the financial markets may well “ revert to mean ” , which is a statistician 's way of saying that what comes down must go up .
But the next five years will not resemble the five preceding the crisis .
Not every change wrought by the financial breakdown will be reversed .
The world economy is fitfully getting back to normal , but it will be a “ new normal ” .
That phrase has caught on , even if people disagree about what it means .
In the new normal , as defined by Pimco's CEO , Mohamed El - Erian , growth will be subdued and unemployment will remain high .
“ The banking system will be a shadow of its former self , ” and the securitisation markets , which buy and sell marketable bundles of debt , will presumably be a shadow of a shadow .
Finance will be costlier and investment weak , so the stock of physical capital , on which prosperity depends , will erode .
The crisis invited a forceful government entry into several of capitalism 's inner sanctums , such as banking , American carmaking and the commercial - paper market .
Mr El - Erian worries that the state may overstay its welcome .
In addition , national exchequers may start to feel some measure of the fiscal strain now hobbling California .
America 's
Treasury , in particular , must demonstrate that it is still a “ responsible shepherd of other countries ' savings ” .
The notion of a “ new normal ” is convincing , even if you do not agree with every particular .
But some forecasters now harbour higher expectations .
They think the economy will bounce back to its old self , almost as if nothing had happened .
They draw inspiration from the work of the late Milton Friedman , who showed that in America deep recessions are generally followed by strong recoveries .
He likened the economy to a piece of string stretched taut on a board .
The more forcefully the string is plucked , the more sharply it snaps back .
Friedman 's piece of string represents the demand side of the economy : the sum of spending by households , firms , foreigners and the government .
The rigid board symbolises the supply side .
When spending is strong enough , the economy 's resources are fully employed , allowing it to realise its full potential .
As the workforce grows , capital accumulates and technology advances , this limit expands over time .
String theory
In a recession demand falls short of supply , leaving a sorry trail of unemployed workers , shuttered factories and unexploited innovations .
But when the recovery arrives , Friedman suggested , it is all the more forceful because these resources have been lying idle , waiting to be brought back into production .
The economy can grow faster than normal for a period until it reaches the point where it would have been without the crisis , when it reaches its full potential again ( see chart 1 , scenario 1 ) .
Friedman 's story is heartening , but it can come unstuck in two ways .
If the shortfall in demand persists it can do lasting damage to supply , reducing the level of potential output ( scenario 2 ) or even its rate of growth ( scenario 3 ) .
If so , the economy will never recoup its losses , even after spending picks up again .
Why should a swing in spending do such lasting harm ?
In a recession firms shed labour and mothball capital .
If workers are left on the shelf too long , their skills will atrophy and their ties to the world of work will weaken .
When spending revives , the recovery will leave them behind .
Output per worker may get back to normal , but the rate of employment will not .
Something similar can happen to the economy 's assembly lines , computer terminals and office blocks .
If demand remains weak , firms will stop adding to this stock of capital and may scrap some of it .
Capital will shrink to fit a lower level of activity .
Moreover , if the financial system remains in disrepair , savings will flow haltingly to companies and the cost of capital will rise .
Firms will therefore use less of it per unit of output .
The result is a lower ceiling on production .
In the IMF 's latest World Economic Outlook , its researchers count the cost of 88 banking crises over the past four decades .
They find that , on average , seven years after a bust an economy 's level of output was almost 10 % below where it would have been without the crisis .
This is an alarming gap .
If replicated in the years to come , it would blight the lives of the unemployed , diminish the fortunes of those in work and make the public debt harder to sustain .
But even worse scenarios are possible .
A financial breakdown could do lasting damage to the growth in potential output as well as to its level .
Even when the economy begins to expand , it may not regain the same pace as before .
Financial crises can pose such a threat to national incomes because of the way they erode national wealth .
From the start of 2008 to the spring of this year the crisis knocked $ 30 trillion off the value of global shares and $ 11 trillion off the value of homes , according to Goldman Sachs , an investment bank .
At their worst , these losses amounted to about 75 % of world GDP .
But despite their enormous scale , it is not immediately obvious why these losses should cause a lasting decline in economic activity .
Natural disasters also wipe out wealth by destroying buildings , possessions and infrastructure , but the economy rarely slows in their aftermath .
On the contrary , output often picks up during a period of reconstruction .
Why should a financial disaster be any different ?
The answer lies on the other side of the balance - sheet .
Before the crisis the overpriced assets held by banks and households were accompanied by vast debts .
After the crisis their assets were shattered but their liabilities remained standing .
As Irving Fisher , a scholar of the Depression , pointed out , “ overinvestment and overspeculation … would have far less serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money . ”
Japan found this out to its cost in the 1990s after the bursting of a spectacular bubble in property and stock prices .
For a “ lost decade ” from 1992 the economy stagnated , never recovering the growth rates posted in the 1980s .
Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo calls Japan 's ordeal a “ balance - sheet recession ” .
The typical post - war recession begins when the flow of spending in the economy puts a strain on its resources , forcing prices upwards .
Central banks raise interest rates to slow spending to a more sustainable pace .
Once inflation has subsided , the authorities are free to turn the taps back on .
But in a “ balance - sheet recession ” , what must be corrected is not a flow but a stock .
After the bubble burst , Japan 's companies were left with liabilities that far exceeded their assets .
Rather than file for bankruptcy , they set about paying down their stock of debt to a manageable level .
This was a protracted slog which , by Mr Koo 's reckoning , did not finish until 2005 .
In the meantime Japan 's economy stagnated .
By 2002 its output was almost 23 % below its pre-crisis trajectory .
Since Pimco's forum concluded in May , the world economy has palpably improved .
In many ways the new normal is beginning to look a lot like the old , vindicating Friedman 's plucking model .
China is outpacing expectations .
Goldman Sachs is making hay .
The premium banks must pay to borrow overnight from each other is now below 0.25 % , the level Alan Greenspan , a former chairman of the Federal Reserve , once described as “ normal ” .
Companies in Europe and America are selling bonds at a furious pace .
A few months ago financial newspapers were debating the future of capitalism .
Now they are merely discussing the future of capital requirements .
Shock has given way to relief .
The persistence of debt
But the relief is likely to be short - lived .
Just over a year ago , the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy , the world economy fell off a precipice .
When you are falling , you do not look up .
Only when you hit bottom can you stop and contemplate the cliff you must now climb .
This special report will argue that although a “ new normal ” for the world economy is now in sight , it will be different from the old normal in a number of ways .
Demand in rich countries will remain weak and emerging economies will not be able to compensate .
The report will explain why many governments will have to keep their stimulus packages going for longer than expected , or face entrenched unemployment that will permanently lower their economic potential .
Public debt will rise so that private debt can fall .
The banks , the report will show , will remain cautious about lending again , which will slow up the recovery but also make companies more careful about their investment ; and the securitisation markets that became so fashionable during the boom will recede , though not disappear altogether .
A persistent shortfall in demand will weigh on supply .
By the time this crisis is over , as many as 25 m people may have lost their jobs in the 30 rich countries that belong to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) .
The danger is that several million may never regain them .
The mobilisation of capital will be fitful as the financial system copes with past mistakes and impending regulation .
The travails of finance , in turn , may prevent the recovering economy from backing and exploiting innovations .
Like Japan 's bubble years , the years that led to the global financial crisis have left a heavy legacy of debt on the balance - sheets of banks and households , especially in Britain and America .
It is this legacy that allows past losses to depress future gains .
Fisher , again , put it best : “ I fancy that over - confidence seldom does any great harm except when , as , and if , it beguiles its victims into debt . ”
There is no better example of that than American consumers .
YARD 0.4.0 ( codenamed The Whole Nine ) was just released today .
It ’s by far the biggest release since I started writing YARD in 2007 .
For those who do n’t know , YARD is a Ruby documentation tool that surpasses the features of RDoc to bring much richer docs and extensibility to documenteurs .
There ’s plenty of new features to discuss and plenty of new toys to show off ( new templates , live doc server with user comments , new APIs , plugin support ) , so let ’s get started .
New Templates & Templating Engine
The old templates were ugly .
This time , full attention was put into making the templates both aesthetically pleasing and more informative than the old ones .
The unusable , unlinkable frames were removed in favour of a Javascript based menu system with inline search for methods , classes and modules .
The look is much cleaner ( partly inspired by Apple ’s Objective - C and Sproutcore documentation ) and much easier to follow .
And many more meta - data tags are now properly included in the docs .
{.noborder}
The new templates in action , showing docs for ActiveRecord and the list of classes / modules on the top right .
This template re-design is in part due to the new templating engine introduced in YARD 0.4.0 , which allows for much more user customization .
This will be important as people start extending YARD to add other meta - data tags or write plugins ( also new in YARD ) .
My next blog post will be discussing how to write a plugin that customizes the templates to add extra output without having to redesign everything .
Stay tuned for that .
A New Website
YARD ’s homepage was redesigned and moved to http://www.yardoc.org.
I think the new look is much nicer , but the real kicker here is the new Live Documentation Server , powered by YARD to generated docs on the fly .
This is n’t exactly a feature of YARD itself , but a testament to what can be done with YARD .
I mentioned the new templating engine gave a much better ability to customize templates than before .
The engine is partly what makes the live documentation server on YARD ’s homepage possible in order to integrate it with the Sinatra app that powers on - the - fly template generation as well as on - the - fly search .
The live docs also allow for direct links to documentation pages for individual methods ( like YARD :: Templates : : Engine.render ) so linking users to specific methods is now much easier .
The best feature of all , however , is the brand - spanking - new user comments system powered by DISQUS that is available on these individual method pages , allowing users to contribute extra information about methods in one place .
User feedback tends to be key in large projects .
This feature is going to change documentation .
If there is one thing PHP ’s community has over Ruby ’s is a pretty great documentation site .
Well , now PHP can goto hell ; because PHP finally has a goto statement , and Ruby finally has a great documentation site .
{.noborder}
User comments on a documented Ruby method .
If you did n’t find it on the homepage , the docs server is here : http://yardoc.org/docs.
Note that It ’s mostly just an alpha - experimental test to see how YARD holds up .
Things should break in the first few days ; when they do , let me know and they ’ll get fixed .
If everything works out , we will be merging the service back into the beloved http://rdoc.info.
Other Cool Stuff
YARD ’s own documentation is now nearly complete .
This was kind of an embarrassing truth for the last few years , but YARD ’s own documentation was never really up to par .
This release should mark a commitment to bettering YARD ’s own docs .
Generate documentation using meta -data queries .
The yardoc tool now has support for a -- query argument which can take queries on object meta - data to include or exclude classes / modules / methods based on their data .
This means you can now make a query like -- query '@api.text == " public " ' to document only your public API .
A Few New Tags .
@private and @abstract were added to YARD ’s tag library .
@private in particular goes hand in hand with the query feature to allow for RDoc style : nodoc : behaviour .
An important note : this is still not recommended practice by YARD .
You should be documenting all of your code .
The private tag should be added in addition to regular documentation to denote that the class / module / constant or global method is actually in the “ private ” Ruby visibility , even though Ruby cannot express this ( due to visibility limitations on classes , modules and constants ) .
To hide all objects with a private tag you can use the query -- query [ email protected ] or the equivalent argument -- no - private Plugin Support .
YARD now auto - loads any gem named with the prefix “ yard - “ or “ yard_ ” ( with the first prefix being recommended ) .
You can use this autoloading feature to add custom functionality ( like handlers or template customizations ) to YARD .
I will be writing guides on how to do this shortly .
You can read more about all the new features in the what ’s new document in YARD ’s docs .
So that ’s the new release of YARD .
Try it out ( gem install yard ) and start documenting your code .
And remember , if you like YARD and use it often , consider donating to make it even better .
YARD accepts Pledgie donations :

From the early days of the printing press to the dawn of the VHS era , it 's been a clich ?
that the first thing humans do upon inventing a new medium is distribute pornography with it .
While this clich ?
may hold true for most humans and most media , there is one conspicuous exception : the computer geek .
From Nethack to play - by - post forums on the WWW , the first thing that computer geeks do upon inventing a new medium is play Dungeons and Dragons with it — the porn comes later , after the role - playing game itch is scratched .
Thus it was that when I finally got my Google Wave invite and did a bit of poking around , I was n't the least bit surprised to quickly discover a handful of Wave - based roleplaying games already in progress , and many more in various stages of planning .
In the past few days , I 've watched games from the sideline and talked to some Game Masters and gamers — there seems to be an emerging consensus that Google Wave has as much RPG potential as any platform since the venerable and proverbial tabletop .
Getting oriented
If you 're not familiar with the concept behind Wave , do n't worry — it 's hard to explain .
You have to attempt to use it for something before you get any kind of handle on what it is , what it is n't , and what it probably should be .
If I had to describe , the best I could do is this :
Wave is a mash - up of email , IM , IRC , online forums , and wikis , all rolled into an experience that sort of resembles ( to me , at least ) a MOO .
In case you 're curious , here 's a shot of my Wave inbox , in three - pane format , with a Mouse Guard RPG wave on the right :
The GM Brian Ballsun - Stanton 's Mouse Guard wave .
It 's easy to see why many people who use it for the first time wonder what the big deal is — as I said above , you really need to try to accomplish something with it as part of a group before you understand what it 's good for .
And what better way to get your feet wet with Wave than trying to find a missing grain peddler , or solve a zombie murder mystery , or slay a band of bugbears .
Of course , before you can do those things , you have to find other gamers who are actually on Wave .
This can be a bit of a challenge , because getting started with Wave is exactly like getting started with the Web : you need a few URLs in order to get going .
A few people I know had added me to some small waves , but things did n't really take off until I got added to the Hello Ars Technica Nerds wave , a public wave with way too many random people in it .
( It reminds me of the lobby of a MUD / MOO . )
Someone posted a link to " Roleplaying on the Wave : an Index of Wave - Borne RPGs " , and I was off .
If you manage to get a Wave invite and you 're interested in checking out the emerging RPG scene , this wave is your first stop .
The RPG Wave Index
There are currently 11 games listed here in various stages of planning and / or play .
Most of these are indie games , but there is one 4th Edition D&D game and one Shadowrun game listed .
For my first attempt at lurking a Wave - based RPG , I jumped into the Mouse Guard game and watched .
What Wave can and can't do for gamers
It turns out that Mouse Guard is fairly representative of the initial handful of Wave RPGs , in that it's an indie RPG that 's focused on role - playing and dialogue , and not so much on tactical combat .
This is because
Wave is currently suited for games that are centered around either real - time chat or play - by - post , where everything can be done with ( suitably formatted ) text .
A Mouse Guard interaction
The few games I 'm following typically have at least three waves : one for recruiting and general discussion , another for out - of - character interactions ( " table talk " ) , and the main wave where the actual in - character gaming takes place .
Individual players are also encouraged to start waves between themselves for any conversations that the GM should n't be privy to .
Character sheets can be posted in a private wave between a player and the GM , and character biographies can go anywhere where the other players can get access to them .
The waves are persistent , accessible to anyone who 's added to them , and include the ability to track changes , so they ultimately work quite well as a medium for the non-tactical parts of an RPG .
A newcomer can jump right in and get up - to - speed on past interactions , and a GM or industrious player can constantly maintain the official record of play by going back and fixing errors , formatting text , adding and deleting material , and reorganizing posts .
Character generation seems to work quite well in Wave , since players can develop the shared character sheet at their own pace with periodic feedback from the GM .
Unfortunately for those of us who are more into the tactical side of RPGs , it is n't yet well - suited to a game that involves either a lot of dice rolling or careful tracking of player and NPC positions .
Right now ,
Wave bots are hard to get working reliably and widgets are scarce , which means that if you do n't want to use the standard dice bot that Wave debuted with ( dice bots are an old IRC favorite ) then there is n't really another convenient option ; rolls are either made with real dice and then posted on the honor system , or they 're posted in batches and a GM then uses them in sequence .

( GM Quinn Conklin's Wave , After The Blight War
But Wave does have support for bots and interactive widgets , so it wo n't be long before RPG - specific examples of both start cropping up .
Widgets in particular will provide an ideal mechanism for reproducing most elements of the tabletop miniatures experience — mapping , tactical combat , and dice rolling .
Until then , Wavers are stuck with hacks and workarounds , like combat maps that look like they were put together quickly in Microsoft Paint .
Aside from a library of RPG widgets , the main thing that Wave lacks is support for some type of robust moderator privileges .
There is currently no way to enforce rules on who can edit what , so users who want a moderated conversation are forced to resort to clunky solutions like asking everyone to abide by an impractically large set of rules when replying .
Wave needs moderation capabilities for more than just RPGs , and I hope this is something that Google is working on .
In the end , I concur with Wave RPG enthusiast Wyatt Salazar , who wrote a really good blog post on RPGing with Google Wave — Wave has enough potential that it may be the Internet 's best chance yet for superseding the pen-and - paper RPG experience .
But it still has a ways to go before it realizes that potential .
So first of all , having now travelled through Idaho and Montana , where every step we took bore afresh the very real danger of our being mauled by grizzly bears , we decided that for our own safety and indeed the safety of all people everywhere , we should have a plan for being chased by a bear .
An unusual supernova rediscovered in seven - year - old data may be the first example of a new type of exploding star , possibly from a binary star system where helium flows from one white dwarf onto another and detonates in a thermonuclear explosion .
In a paper first published online Nov. 5 in the journal Science Express , University of California , Berkeley , and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) astronomer Dovi Poznanski and his colleagues describe the outburst , dubbed SN 2002bj , and why they believe it is a new type of explosion .
" This is the fastest evolving supernova we have ever seen , " said Poznanski , a UC Berkeley post - doctoral fellow who recently joined LBNL's Computational Cosmology Center .
" It was three to four times faster than a standard supernova , basically disappearing within 20 days .
Its brightness just dropped like a rock . "
This rapid drop , coupled with the supernova 's faintness , the strong signature of helium in the spectrum of the explosion , the absence of hydrogen , and the possible presence of vanadium -- an element never previously identified in supernova spectra -- points toward helium detonation on a white dwarf , the astronomers said .
" We think this may well be a new physical explosion mechanism , not just a minor variation of ones already known , " said co-author Alex Filippenko , UC Berkeley professor of astronomy .
" This supernova is qualitatively different from the complete disruption of a white dwarf , known as a Type Ia supernova , or the collapse of an iron core and rebound of the surrounding material , so - called ' core - collapse supernovae . ' "
Co-author Joshua Bloom , UC Berkeley associate professor of astronomy , also views SN 2002 bj as a " new beast " quite different from the two well - known classes of supernovae .

" We have seen great diversity in those two main supernova mechanisms , but even within that diversity , observationally , there is a limited range of variation spectrally and in how events evolve in time , " he said .
" This object ( SN 2002 bj ) falls outside that range . "
The supernova was detected in 2002 in the galaxy NGC 1821 , in the constellation Lepus , by Filippenko's Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope ( KAIT ) at Lick Observatory near San Jose as well as by amateur astronomers .
Due to an unfortunate alignment of circumstances , the supernova was erroneously classified by the astronomical community as a common Type II supernova and filed away .
In June , Poznanski happened upon the spectrum while searching for Type II supernovae he hopes to use as distance indicators to confirm the accelerating expansion of the universe .
When he carefully examined a high - quality spectrum of SN 2002bj , he realized that the supernova was not a Type II at all , but an unusual kind of supernova more akin to a Type Ia .
The spectrum had been obtained seven days after its discovery by Filippenko and Douglas Leonard , at the time a UC Berkeley graduate student , now an assistant professor of astronomy at San Diego State University , using the Keck I telescope .
" Its classification was a mistake , which is understandable given the conditions of the data .
But , of course , a redress of old data with fresh eyes is not usually this fruitful , " Leonard said .

Pulling out follow - up images made by KAIT , Poznanski and UC Berkeley graduate student Mohan Ganeshalingam found that the brightness of SN 2002 bj dropped off so rapidly that the supernova disappeared 20 days after its discovery .
An image of that area of the sky taken seven days prior to its discovery showed no supernova , so it had brightened and dimmed into obscurity in less than 27 days , whereas most supernovae brighten and dim over three to four months .
Searching through thousands of supernovae spectra , Poznanski and graduate student Ryan Chornock -- now a post - doctoral fellow at Harvard University -- could find none that had such an awkward composition , but they did come across a theory of fast but faint supernovae that seemed to fit .
Proposed by Lars Bildsten and colleagues -- Bildsten is a professor of physics at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara -- the theory involves AM Canum Venaticorum ( AM CVn ) binary systems , which are composed of two white dwarfs , one of which is primarily made of helium that is being slowly pulled by gravity onto its companion .
White dwarfs are the remnants of stars that burned their hydrogen down to carbon and oxygen or , in some particular cases , to helium .
In a 2007 Astrophysical Journal Letters paper , Bildsten and colleagues proposed that in AM CVn systems , when enough helium has been accumulated on the surface of the primary white dwarf , an explosion will occur that can " power a faint … and rapidly rising ( few days ) thermonuclear supernova . "
Christopher Stubbs , chair of the Department of Physics at Harvard University , jokingly dubbed it a ' ' .
Ia '' ( point one A ) supernova , because it is one - tenth as bright for one - tenth the time as a Type Ia supernova , and the name stuck .
Filippenko noted that this explosion is nothing like a regular Type Ia explosion because the white dwarf survives the detonation of the helium shell .
In fact , it has similarities to both a nova and a supernova .
Novas occur when matter -- primarily hydrogen -- falls onto a star and accumulates in a shell that can flare up as brief thermonuclear explosions .
SN 2002 bj is a " super " nova , generating about 1,000 times the energy of a standard nova , he said .
The explosion would have created heavy elements such as chromium , which decays to vanadium and thence to titanium .
Thus , absorption lines of vanadium could be expected , Poznanski said .
Filippenko noted that the past few years have " yielded a bonanza of weird supernovae . "
" A lot of us who have studied supernovae for several decades are amazed at the quality and quantity of data coming in recently , showing interesting new subclasses or even strange new physical classes of supernovae , " he said .
" It whets my appetite for what else we might find out there with these large , wide - sky surveys like the Palomar Transient Factory , Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope .
KAIT has discovered about 800 supernovae , but these new surveys will find thousands or hundreds of thousands of supernovae . "
Poznanski , too , is expecting the current Palomar Transient Factory , which uses a wide - field camera to search the sky daily for new objects , to find more supernovae like SN 2002 bj .
The factory is a project led by Shri Kulkarni , professor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , and involves many of the co-authors on the Science Express paper , including Peter Nugent , co-leader of the Computational Cosmology Center at LBNL , who runs the search for transients .
" The Palomar survey will be able to find many rare objects , like SN 2002bj , by scanning huge parts of the sky and not limit itself to the big , bright and nearby galaxies , " Poznanski said .
Coauthors with Poznanski , Filippenko , Nugent , Ganeshalingam , Leonard , Chornock and Bloom are Rollin C. Thomas , a member of the Computational Cosmology Center , and Weidong Li of UC Berkeley 's Department of Astronomy .

A crisis can break a premiership .
It can also be a rocky path to greatness .
In the case of Britain 's public spending crisis , there is no middle way .
David Cameron has said that he will have to sort out the deficit .
He is right .
There is no hope of ducking that challenge , any more than there is a simple solution to it .
On one point , we can be clear .
The present position is dire .
An annual deficit at twelve per cent of GDP , the National Debt heading towards eighty per cent : that is unsustainable .
Unless the markets were convinced that an incoming government was serious about cutting the deficit , it would face a sterling crisis and a gilt - buyers ' strike .
The consequence would be very high interest rates , killing off any recovery – plus inflation , as the government was forced to print the money which it was unable to borrow , plus higher taxes .
That would mean stagflation , for an indefinite period : worse than the Seventies .
As economic activity imploded and large sections of the City migrated , many of our ablest youngsters would conclude that there was no future in the UK , while many of the less able started rioting .
The SNP and the BNP would thrive .
For the rest of us , it would not be pleasant to live in a failing , demoralised , angry Britain .
So let there be no illusions .
This is the economic equivalent of 1940 .

A new government would start with an intellectual problem .
But it could finish with an opportunity .
The problem is easy to describe and hard to solve .
Mr Penpush of the Circumlocution Office performs no useful function .
His post enables him to prodnose into the activities of useful persons , causing obstruction and adding to costs .
His latest proposal would make it a criminal offence for any adult who had not been expensively vetted to talk to any child , ever .
His department was set up when Gordon Brown was diverting resources from the wealth - creating private sector into the public sector , in order to build up a client base of Labour voters .
He is an obvious economy .
But in the short - run , any economic activity is beneficial .
Mr Penpush pays taxes ; the government needs the cash .
He spends money , thus injecting demand into the economy .
He is paying off a mortgage , thus helping to stabilise the housing market and his building - society 's balance sheet .
If he were sacked tomorrow , all that would be jeopardised , while he received a redundancy cheque and welfare payments .
There are similar problems about tax increases .
They , too , would reduce private sector demand and some of them could be especially damaging .
Though many voters approve of a fifty per cent rate on high earnings , they are wrong .
A generation ago , an American economist made a crucial contribution to economic theory in an improbable manner .
In a doodle on a paper napkin , Arthur Laffer devised his immortal curve .
It dealt with the relationship between tax rates and tax receipts .
According to the curve , lower rates would yield higher receipts .
At the time , this was widely derided , as not worth the napkin it was doodled on .
But during the Eighties and Nineties , it became clear that the Laffer Curve was a sound guide to policy .
All over the world , cuts in tax rates produced higher receipts and happier tax - payers .
Low - tax economies flourished .
In Britain , the Laffer doctrine still applies .
It is vital that the financial services sector should pay a lot of tax .
But it is a mobile industry .
There is no use in demanding extra money from people who have moved to Frankfurt .
The fifty per cent rate was a shabby manoeuvre by a discredited government , desperate for political advantage , heedless of the long - term consequences .
Given the – current – low inflation rate and the competitiveness of the British retail sector , a VAT rate of twenty per cent would be the safest way of raising real money .
Even so , it would deflate demand ; it is not as if there are many spare billions lying around the place .
We cannot deal with the deficit purely by cutting public spending and increasing taxes .
To some extent , we have to grow our way out of the crisis .
So the necessary cuts have to be implemented without imperilling growth .
That will be a difficult feat of economic navigation and there are no models or formulae to guide the men on the bridge .
We need a judicious blend of Maynard Keynes and Montagu Norman , but in what proportions ?
If government spending were cut by ten per cent over three years while higher VAT raised £ 12.5 billion , and assuming that economic growth was running at around two and a half per cent by year three – would that be enough ?
If so , it is probably a minimum , and cuts of that magnitude will not be easy to achieve .
In previous , and smaller , culls of public expenditure , governments have usually started with the low - hanging fruit : postpone capital programmes and freeze recruitment .
Although it is unlikely that this can be avoided , it is a crude solution .
Even if a scythe may be necessary , there ought also to be some more sophisticated tools .
This is where the opportunity can arise .
Until the due allotted day for his electoral execution , it looks as if nothing but dynamite will extract Gordon Brown from No.10 .
The Tories ought to use these last months in Opposition to start a radical process of hard thinking which can carry on in government : nothing less than a fundamental appraisal of the British system of government .
If we were establishing it tomorrow , ex nihilo , what duties would it perform ?
What powers would it have ?
What money should it spend ?
In all this , the Tories should make it clear that their target is neither the front - line public services nor their dedicated employees .
It is the uncontrolled growth of the public sector in recent years .
That has endowed us with a government which is simultaneously weak and authoritarian .
We are unable to control our borders , yet we have councils banning conker - collecting and proposals to harass millions of parents who would just like to put` something back into the community .
What happened to the active citizen ?
He was banned , by the hyper-active bureaucrat .
In Britain today , large parts of the machinery of government seem to be out of control : acting on no rational basis , responding to no public need .
If we could put a stop to that , the deficit would be reduced and the country would be better - run .
There is also waste .
As soon as the Tories come to power , every division of every government department should be required to submit proposals for three per cent , five per cent and ten per cent cuts in costs .
Traditionally , and with the connivance of ministers - including Tory ones - civil servants have used the ' bleeding stumps ' tactic to deflect such requests .
A three per cent cut in health would mean the closure of all cancer wards ; in education , all primary schools ; at the Home Office , all police stations – and so on .
The new government should make it clear that it requires flab , not blood ; that officials who cooperate will flourish : that those who try to protect waste will end up in the waste disposal .
This will require hard pounding .
Hating the whole business , the public sector trade unions will take any chance to trip up the new government .
David Cameron and his colleagues will need to find a way of retaining public support .
Blairite spinning will , of course , be out – but what is an uncontaminated way of saying ' narrative ? '
The Tories also need some inexpensive but popular policies , to make it clear that not everything has to be blood , sweat , toil and tears .
Out of crisis , opportunity .
If that becomes the master narrative of the 2010s , the Cameron government will triumph .
Otherwise , God knows what chaos awaits us .

Mr. Ryan , 58 , usually plays a couple of mornings a week at Grand Central , making him a fixture there , whether commuters notice or not .
On Thursday , Mr. Ryan had set up his microphone and speakers in front of where the Times Square shuttles scoot in and out , and there were near constant lines of people heading in both directions .

There has been another hit to the reputation of the oil and gas industry , with confirmation of a second gas leak in the Timor Sea .
The Northern Territory Government says a small amount of non-harmful gas has escaped from the Puffin oil field , which is operated by Chinese oil and gas company , Sinopec .
The leak was discovered early last month as part of a routine inspection .
The Puffin field lies about 50 kilometres north west of the West Atlas oil rig , where oil has been leaking from a well for nearly 10 weeks .
The Territory Government says the company will take measures to cap the gas leak .
The amount of gas that has escaped from the well is not known .
Meanwhile the company operating the West Atlas oil rig has conceded it could take several more attempts to plug the well .
It is estimated that more than 400 barrels of oil a day has been spewing into the ocean since an underground pipe ruptured almost ten weeks ago .
Rig owner , PTTEP Australasia , says oil has reached Indonesian waters but has not reached the coast .
The company 's director Jose Martins says it is a difficult operation .
" We had planned that it would have been achieved by now , it has n't worked that way , and we would obviously plan now to have another pass this weekend , " he said .
" It may require another attempt after that and if that fails another one after that , and at that point we should be at very high confidence . "
In the 1950s , the social psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a famous experiment that highlighted the fragility of the person in a mass society when he is confronted with the contrary opinion of a majority , and the tendency to conform even if this means to go against the person 's basic perceptions .
This is a chilling text that should be carefully read and remembered whenever we think we are swayed by the mass , against our deepest feelings and convictions .
At that moment we should be on the alert , re-examining all positions ( our included ) and then making decisions as free , mature and fully responsible human beings , whatever the direction taken by the mass or by a majority .
That social influences shape every person 's practices , judgments and beliefs is a truism to which anyone will readily assent .
A child masters his " native " dialect down to the finest nuances ; a member of a tribe of cannibals accepts cannibalism as altogether fitting and proper .
All the social sciences take their departure from the observation of the profound effects that groups exert on their members .
For psychologists , group pressure upon the minds of individuals raises a host of questions they would like to investigate in detail .
How , and to what extent , do social sources constrain people 's opinions and attitudes ?
This question is especially pertinent in our day .
The same epoch that has witnessed the unprecedented technical extension of communication has also brought into existence the deliberate manipulation of opinion and the " engineering of consent . "
There are many good reasons why , as citizens and as scientists , we should be concerned with studying the ways in which human beings form their opinions and the role that social conditions play .
Studies of these questions began with the interest in hypnosis aroused by the French physician Jean Martin Charcot ( a teacher of Sigmund Freud ) toward the end of the 19th century .
Charcot believed that only hysterical patients could be fully hypnotized , but this view was soon challenged by two other physicians , Hyppolyte Bernheim and A. A. Liebault , who demonstrated that they could put most people under the hypnotic spell .
Bernheim proposed that hypnosis was but an extreme form of normal psychological process which became known as " suggestibility . "
It was shown that monotonous reiteration of instructions could induce in normal persons in the waking state involuntary bodily changes such as swaying or rigidity of the arms , and sensations such warmth and odor .
It was not long before social thinkers seized upon these discoveries as a basis for explaining numerous social phenomena , from the spread of opinion to the formation of crowds and the following of leaders .
The sociologist Gabriel Tarde summed it all up in the aphorism " Social man is a somnambulist . "
When the new discipline of social psychology was born at the beginning of this century , its first experiments were essentially adaptations of the suggestion demonstration .
The technique generally followed a simple plan .
The subjects , usually college students , were asked to give their opinions or preferences concerning various matters ; some time later they were again asked to state their choices , but now they were also informed of the opinions held by authorities or large groups of their peers on the same matters .
( Often the alleged consensus was fictitious . )
Most of these studies had substantially the same result : confronted with opinions contrary to their own , many subjects apparently shifted their judgments in the direction of the views of the majorities or the experts .
The late psychologist Edward L. Thorndike reported that he had succeeded in modifying the esthetic preferences of adults by this procedure .
Other psychologists reported that people 's evaluations of the merit of a literary passage could be raised or lowered by ascribing the passage to different authors .
Apparently the sheer weight of numbers or authority sufficed to change opinions , even when no arguments for the opinions themselves were provided .
Now the very ease of success in these experiments arouses suspicion .
Did the subjects actually change their opinions , or were the experimental victories scored only on paper ?
On grounds of common sense , one must question whether opinions are generally as watery as these studies indicate .
There is some reason to wonder whether it was not the investigators who , in their enthusiasm for a theory , were suggestible , and whether the ostensibly gullible subjects were not providing answers which they thought good subjects were expected to give .
The investigations were guided by certain underlying assumptions , which today are common currency and account for much that is thought and said about the operations of propaganda and public opinion .
The assumptions are that people submit uncritically and painlessly to external manipulation by suggestion or prestige , and that any given idea or value can be " sold " or " unsold " without reference to its merits .
We should be skeptical , however , of the supposition that the power of social pressure necessarily implies uncritical submission to it : independence and the capacity to rise above group passion are also open to human beings .
Further , one may question on psychological grounds whether it is possible as a rule to change a person 's judgment of a situation or an object without first changing his knowledge or assumptions about it .
In what follows I shall describe some experiments in an investigation of the effects of group pressure which was carried out recently with the help of a number of my associates .
The tests not only demonstrate the operations of group pressure upon individuals but also illustrate a new kind of attack on the problem and some of the more subtle questions that it raises .
A group of seven to nine young men , all college students , are assembled in a classroom for a " psychological experiment " in visual judgment .
The experimenter informs them that they will be comparing the lengths of lines .
He shows two large white cards .
On one is a single vertical black line - the standard whose length is to be matched .
On the other card are three vertical lines of various lengths .
The subjects are to choose the one that is of the same length as the line on the other card .
One of the three actually is of the same length ; the other two are substantially different , the difference ranging from three quarters of an inch to an inch and three quarters .
Subjects were shown two cards .
One bore a standard line .
The other bore three lines , one of which was the same length as the standard .
The subjects were asked to choose this line .
The experiment opens uneventfully .
The subjects announce their answers in the order in which they have been seated in the room , and on the first round every person chooses the same matching line .
Then a second set of cards is exposed ; again the group is unanimous .
The members appear ready to endure politely another boring experiment .
On the third trial there is an unexpected disturbance .
One person near the end of the group disagrees with all the others in his selection of the matching line .
He looks surprised , indeed incredulous , about the disagreement .
On the following trial he disagrees again , while the others remain unanimous in their choice .
The dissenter becomes more and more worried and hesitant as the disagreement continues in succeeding trials ; he may pause before announcing his answer and speak in a low voice , or he may smile in an embarrassed way .
What the dissenter does not know is that all the other members of the group were instructed by the experimenter beforehand to give incorrect answers in unanimity at certain points .
The single individual who is not a party to this pre-arrangement is the focal subject of our experiment .
He is placed in a position in which , while he is actually giving the correct answers , he finds himself unexpectedly in a minority of one , opposed by a unanimous and arbitrary majority with respect to a clear and simple fact .
Upon him we have brought to bear two opposed forces : the evidence of his senses and the unanimous opinion of a group of his peers .
Also , he must declare his judgments in public , before a majority which has also stated its position publicly .
The instructed majority occasionally reports correctly in order to reduce the possibility that the naive subject will suspect collusion against him .
( In only a few cases did the subject actually show suspicion ; when this happened , the experiment was stopped and the results were not counted . )
There are 18 trials in each series , and on 12 of these the majority responds erroneously .
How do people respond to group pressure in this situation ?
I shall report first the statistical results of a series in which a total of 123 subjects from three institutions of higher learning ( not including my own , Swarthmore College ) were placed in the minority situation described above .
Two alternatives were open to the subject : he could act independently , repudiating the majority , or he could go along with the majority , repudiating the evidence of his senses .
Of the 123 put to the test , a considerable percentage yielded to the majority .
Whereas in ordinary circumstances individuals matching the lines will make mistakes less than 1 per cent of the time , under group pressure the minority subjects swung to acceptance of the misleading majority 's wrong judgments in 36.8 per cent of the selections .
Of course individuals differed in response .
At one extreme , about one quarter of the subjects were completely independent and never agreed with the erroneous judgments of the majority .
At the other extreme , some individuals went with the majority nearly all the time .
The performances of individuals in this experiment tend to be highly consistent .
Those who strike out on the path of independence do not , as a rule , succumb to the majority even over an extended series of trials , while those who choose the path of compliance are unable to free themselves as the ordeal is prolonged .
The reasons for the startling individual differences have not yet been investigated in detail .
At this point we can only report some tentative generalizations from talks with the subjects , each of whom was interviewed at the end of the experiment .
Among the independent individuals were many who held fast because of staunch confidence in their own judgment .
The most significant fact about them was not absence of responsiveness to the majority but a capacity to recover from doubt and to re-establish their equilibrium .
Others who acted independently came to believe that the majority was correct in its answers , but they continued their dissent on the simple ground that it was their obligation to call the play as they saw it .
Among the extremely yielding persons we found a group who quickly reached the conclusion : " I am wrong , they are right . "
Others yielded in order " not to spoil your results . "
Many of the individuals who went along suspected that the majority were " sheep " following the first responder , or that the majority were victims of an optical illusion ; nevertheless , these suspicions failed to free them at the moment of decision .
More disquieting were the reactions of subjects who construed their difference from the majority as a sign of some general deficiency in themselves , which at all costs they must hide .
On this basis they desperately tried to merge with the majority , not realizing the longer - range consequences to themselves .
All the yielding subjects underestimated the frequency with which they conformed .
Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important - the size of the majority or its unanimity ?
The experiment was modified to examine this question .
In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to 15 persons .
The results showed a clear trend .
When a subject was confronted with only a single individual who contradicted his answers , he was swayed little : he continued to answer independently and correctly in nearly all trials .
When the opposition was increased to two , the pressure became substantial : minority subjects now accepted the wrong answer 13.6 per cent of the time .
Under the pressure of a majority of three , the subjects ' errors jumped to 31.8 per cent .
But further increases in the size of the majority apparently did not increase the weight of the pressure substantially .
Clearly the size of the opposition is important only up to a point .
Disturbance of the majority 's unanimity had a striking effect .
In this experiment the subject was given the support of a truthful partner - either another individual who did not know of the pre-arranged agreement among the rest of the group , or a person who was instructed to give correct answers throughout .
The presence of a supporting partner depleted the majority of much of its power .
Its pressure on the dissenting individual was reduced to one fourth : that is , subjects answered incorrectly only one fourth as often as under the pressure of a unanimous majority .
The weakest persons did not yield as readily .
Most interesting were the reactions to the partner .
Generally the feeling toward him was one of warmth and closeness ; he was credited with inspiring confidence .
However , the subjects repudiated the suggestion that the partner decided them to be independent .
Was the partner 's effect a consequence of his dissent , or was it related to his accuracy ?
We now introduced into the experimental group a person who was instructed to dissent from the majority but also to disagree with the subject .
In some experiments the majority was always to choose the worst of the comparison lines and the instructed dissenter to pick the line that was closer to the length of the standard one ; in others the majority was consistently intermediate and the dissenter most in error .
In this manner we were able to study the relative influence of " compromising " and " extremist " dissenters .
Again the results are clear .
When a moderate dissenter is present , the effect of the majority on the subject decreases by approximately one third , and extremes of yielding disappear .
Moreover , most of the errors the subjects do make are moderate , rather than flagrant .
In short , the dissenter largely controls the choice of errors .
To this extent the subjects broke away from the majority even while bending to it .
On the other hand , when the dissenter always chose the line that was more flagrantly different from the standard , the results were of quite a different kind .
The extremist dissenter produced a remarkable freeing of the subjects ; their errors dropped to only 9 per cent .
Furthermore , all the errors were of the moderate variety .
We were able to conclude that dissent per se increased independence and moderated the errors that occurred , and that the direction of dissent exerted consistent effects .
In all the foregoing experiments each subject was observed only in a single setting .
We now turned to studying the effects upon a given individual of a change in the situation to which he was exposed .
The first experiment examined the consequences of losing or gaining a partner .
The instructed partner began by answering correctly on the first six trials .
With his support the subject usually resisted pressure from the majority : 18 of 27 subjects were completely independent .
But after six trials the partner joined the majority .
As soon as he did so , there was an abrupt rise in the subjects ' errors .
Their submission to the majority was just about as frequent as when the minority subject was opposed by a unanimous majority throughout .
It was surprising to find that the experience of having had a partner and of having braved the majority opposition with him had failed to strengthen the individuals ' independence .
Questioning at the conclusion of the experiment suggested that we had overlooked an important circumstance ; namely , the strong specific effect of " desertion " by the partner to the other side .
We therefore changed the conditions so that the partner would simply leave the group at the proper point .
( To allay suspicion it was announced in advance that he had an appointment with the dean . )
In this form of the experiment , the partner 's effect outlasted his presence .
The errors increased after his departure , but less markedly than after a partner switched to the majority .
In a variant of this procedure the trials began with the majority unanimously giving correct answers .
Then they gradually broke away until on the sixth trial the naive subject was alone and the group unanimously against him .
As long as the subject had anyone on his side , he was almost invariably independent , but as soon as he found himself alone , the tendency to conform to the majority rose abruptly .
As might be expected , an individual 's resistance to group pressure in these experiments depends to a considerable degree on how wrong the majority is .
We varied the discrepancy between the standard line and the other lines systematically , with the hope of reaching a point where the error of the majority would be so glaring that every subject would repudiate it and choose independently .
In this we regretfully did not succeed .
Even when the difference between the lines was seven inches , there were still some who yielded to the error of the majority .
The study provides clear answers to a few relatively simple questions , and it raises many others that await investigation .
We would like to know the degree of consistency of persons in situations which differ in content and structure .
If consistency of independence or conformity in behavior is shown to be a fact , how is it functionally related to qualities of character and personality ?
In what ways is independence related to sociological or cultural conditions ?
Are leaders more independent than other people , or are they adept at following their followers ?
These and many other questions may perhaps be answerable by investigations of the type described here .
Life in society requires consensus as an indispensable condition .
But consensus , to be productive , requires that each individual contribute independently out of his experience and insight .
When consensus comes under the dominance of conformity , the social process is polluted and the individual at the same time surrenders the powers on which his functioning as a feeling and thinking being depends .
That we have found the tendency to conformity in our society so strong that reasonably intelligent and well - meaning young people are willing to call white black is a matter of concern .
It raises questions about our ways of education and about the values that guide our conduct .
Yet anyone inclined to draw too pessimistic conclusions from this report would do well to remind himself that the capacities for independence are not to be underestimated .
He may also draw some consolation from a further observation : those who participated in this challenging experiment agreed nearly without exception that independence was preferable to conformity .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuba has ordered all state enterprises to adopt “ extreme measures ” to cut energy usage through the end of the year in hopes of avoiding the dreaded blackouts that plagued the country following the 1991 collapse of its then - top ally , the Soviet Union .
In documents seen by Reuters , government officials have been warned that the island is facing a “ critical ” energy shortage that requires the closing of non-essential factories and workshops and the shutting down of air conditioners and refrigerators not needed to preserve food and medicine .
Cuba has cut government spending and slashed imports after being hit hard by the global financial crisis and the cost of recovering from three hurricanes that struck last year .
“ The energy situation we face is critical and if we do not adopt extreme measures we will have to revert to planned blackouts affecting the population , ” said a recently circulated message from the Council of Ministers .
“ Company directors will analyze the activities that will be stopped and others reduced , leaving only those that guarantee exports , substitution of imports and basic services for the population , ” according to another distributed by the light industry sector .
President Raul Castro is said to be intent on not repeating the experience of the 1990s , when the demise of the Soviet Union and the loss of its steady oil supply caused frequent electricity blackouts and hardship for the Cuban public .
The directives follow government warnings in the summer that too much energy was being used and blackouts would follow if consumption was not reduced .
All provincial governments and most state - run offices and factories , which encompasses 90 percent of Cuba ’s economic activity , were ordered in June to reduce energy use by a minimum of 12 percent or face mandatory electricity cuts .
The measures appeared to resolve the crisis as state - run press published stories about the amount of energy that had been saved and the dire warnings died down .
The only explanation given for the earlier warnings was that Cuba was consuming more fuel than the government had money to pay for .
The situation is not as dire as in the 1990s because Cuba receives 93,000 barrels per day of crude oil , almost two - thirds of what it consumes , from Venezuela .
It pays for the oil by providing its energy - rich ally with medical personnel and other professionals .
Cuba has been grappling with the global economic downturn , which has slashed revenues from key exports , dried up credit and reduced foreign investment .
The communist - run Caribbean nation also faces stiff U.S. sanctions that include cutting access to international lending institutions , and it is still rebuilding from last year ’s trio of hurricanes that caused an estimated $ 10 billion in damages .
In response , the government has cut spending , slashed imports , suspended many debt payments and frozen bank accounts of foreign businesses .
It reported last week that trade was down 36 percent so far this year due mainly to a more than 30 percent reduction in imports .
Another screw - up for notorious Election Director Kathy Dent ...

On October 17th , we reported that World 's Worst Supervisor of Elections Kathy Dent of Sarasota , FL , had discovered in pre-election tests that her new Diebold / Premier optical - scan voting systems failed to properly read paper ballots marked with blue ink .
Her " solution " :
Make sure that black pens were available at polling places , and otherwise have election officials duplicate blue - inked ballots by hand ( and in secret , naturally , where the voter would n't be able to watch ) .
While an attempt could be made to encourage voters to use black ink at the polling place , there was no real way to ensure that absentee voters used black ink , other than try to encourage them to do so .
So , naturally , the inimitable Ms. Dent sent out thousands of sample ballots [ PDF ] encouraging votes to use " a blue or black pen " ...
Dent , of course , is the same disastrous Supervisor of Elections who presided over the 2006 FL - 13 Congressional race in which 18,000 electronic ballots in Democratic - leaning Sarasota disappeared from the county 's ES&S touch - screen systems , in a race decided in favor of the Republican by just 369 votes .
Later , she actively campaigned --- by placing leaflets in the polling place !
--- to keep those touch - screen machines in use , despite that failure , and despite a measure on the ballot in the same election calling for a move to paper ballots .
Since the state now requires paper ballots , Dent chose to install the newest Diebold / Premier optical - scan systems , the ones that do n't read blue ink properly , despite the fact that they had not been federally tested or certified for use at the time .
Florida does not require federal certification tests for voting systems before using them .
Heckuva job --- as usual --- Kathy !
Muhammad was pronounced dead at 2111EST
The man behind the 2002 sniper attacks in and around Washington DC has been executed after a final appeal was thrown out .
John Allen Muhammad 's lawyers say he was mentally ill , but Virginia Governor Tim Kaine rejected a plea for clemency .
On Monday , the US Supreme Court quashed an appeal for a stay of execution .
Muhammad , 48 , was injected with a lethal drug for the murder of Dean Harold Meyers , one of 10 people killed during the attacks .
Muhammad 's accomplice , Lee Boyd Malvo , who was 17 at the time of the shootings , is serving a life sentence in jail .
The pair killed 10 people during three weeks of attacks in Maryland , Washington and Virginia .

Muhammad was put to death at the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt , Virginia .
The procedure took five minutes , and Muhammad died at 2111 ( 0211 GMT ) , Larry Traylor of the Virginia Department of Corrections said .
Muhammad did not speak before it began , and seemed quiet and relaxed , Mr Traylor said .
" Mr Muhammad was asked if he wished to make a last statement .
He did not acknowledge us or make any statement whatsoever , " he said .
He had , Mr Traylor added , been motionless , with his head slightly tilted to the right as the drug was injected .
His lawyer said he had eaten chicken in red sauce , followed by strawberry cakes , for his final meal .
Before the execution J Wyndal Gordon , the state attorney appointed to represent Muhammad , said that he would die " with his head held high and no remorse , maintaining his innocence " .
He was , said his lawyer , " a martyr for everything that 's wrong with the death penalty " .
After the execution , he extended condolences to the victims ' loved ones , but also to Muhammad 's relatives .
" It 's just a tragic situation all around . "
Muhammad 's legal team says the ex-soldier suffered from Gulf War Syndrome .
Timeline : Washington sniper killings
Time runs out for Muhammad Sniper motive remains a mystery Lawyer Jonathan Sheldon told the BBC's World Today : " A psychiatrist examined him and said he 's paranoid and psychotic and delusional and gave many examples . "
Mr Sheldon also said brain scans of Muhammad had revealed malformations linked to schizophrenia .
The shootings left the Washington area gripped by fear , with victims attacked while shopping , outside schools , or just sitting and reading .
Mr Meyers was shot at a petrol station in Manassas , Virginia .
A skilled marksman , Muhammad picked off his targets using a sniper rifle , always with a single round and from a distance .
After three weeks , he was arrested at a truck stop , along with Malvo .

Prosecutors say Muhammad never showed remorse .
In addition to the 10 people they killed around the Washington area , the pair were suspected of murders in other states , including Louisiana , Alabama and Arizona .
Cheryll Witz was one of several victims ' relatives who went to watch Muhammad 's execution .
Malvo said he had shot her father , Jerry Taylor - at Muhammad 's direction - on an Arizona golf course in March 2002 .
" He basically watched my dad breathe his last breath , " she told the Associated Press news agency .
" Why should n't I watch his last breath ? " THE SNIPER SHOOTINGS 1 and 2 .

As is well known , Sprint and Clearwire are slowly pushing forward on their ever expanding 4G network .
Mirroring a report from back in June of this year , Sprint is once again said to be working on a WiMAX - enabled smartphone that will support both 4G and 3G connectivity .
Just as current CDMA mobile phones switch switch between 1xRTT and EV - DO , the new handset will manage WiMAX and EV - DO signals in a similar manner .
The big question is not whether or not Sprint will make such a smartphone , but which OS will this new handset run ?
Analysts suggest that Android will the platform of choice with Samsung as the manufacturer supplying the necessary hardware .
This rumored 4G / 3G smartphone will reportedly launch when Clearwire reaches the 100 million subscriber mark in the US , a goal expected to be achieved towards the end of 2010 .

Hutchison spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said details for the events still are being determined .
But she said there will be one public campaign event with Cheney and a closed fundraiser .
Baker said Cheney knew Hutchison and her husband , Ray , while he lived in Dallas as the chief executive officer of the oil - field service company Halliburton from 1995 to 2000 , and when he became George W. Bush 's vice presidential running mate .
“ I am so pleased , ” Hutchison said Wednesday .
“ I respect the former vice president so much .
We 've worked together .
He knows my record as a conservative in the Senate . ”
Cheney could not be reached for comment .
Cheney also was a donor to Hutchison 's Senate campaigns in the 1990s .
Baker said Cheney as vice president also worked with Hutchison on legislation .
“ He knows her and knows she 's a true conservative leader , ” Baker said .
Other connections between Hutchison and Cheney include former presidential adviser Karl Rove and Dallas fundraiser Jim Francis .
Both are Kitchen Cabinet advisers to Hutchison 's campaign .
Francis in 2000 headed the Pioneer fundraising effort that helped put Bush and Cheney into the White House .
“ It 's not surprising considering they both worked in Washington for so many years , ” Perry spokesman Mark Miner said .

Sarah Palin has been all over the media since her book came out , but the one network that she has n’t been on is CBS .
Palin ’s reps have turned down requests from Katie Couric , and the former Alaska governor is still harboring a grudge against late night host David Letterman .
Palin has made it clear that she is open to all requests , except CBS .
According to Hotline OnCall “ Sources tell Hotline OnCall that Couric ’s producer sent two requests to Palin ’s publisher for interviews during the “ Going Rogue ” book tour , and so far , Couric has been denied .
It ’s not surprising — Palin has not agreed to sit down with more than a small handful of mainstream media interviewers — but the move looks to be part of a larger Palin blackout from CBS News and Entertainment . ”
When Palin was on Sean Hannity ’s program , she told him that she also wo n’t be appearing on David Letterman ’s top rated late night show , “ Forgiveness and vengeance is n’t mine .
I ’m not out for vindication , but I ’m thinking , practically , economically , in terms of a David Letterman visit , I do n’t want to boost his ratings so — no , I have no desire to . ”

Contrary to her statement above , it would seem that Palin carrying a grudge against CBS .
It is almost as if she is blaming the network or her own inability to answer simple , basic questions from Katie Couric .
If Palin is serious about politics , a few appearances on CBS could go a long way towards rebuilding her image .
Instead of blaming Katie Couric for her own failure , she could prepare for the interview and sit down with Couric again .
A serious politician would try to make an effort to rehabilitate their image .
They would not mix the personal with the political as Palin is .
Sarah Palin is missing a golden opportunity by not going on Letterman .
If she really wants to be the conservative values candidate , she could go on Letterman ’s show and contrast herself with the host ’s sex scandal .
Of course , this would involve taking a risk , which is something that Palin does not do .
Instead , she has chosen to play it safe by sticking to Oprah and Fox News .
Palin is getting some really bad advice , but since she does n’t have any advisers , it is my guess that it is her own judgment that is leading her astray .
She will always have her devoted core of followers , which will always be enough to keep her wealthy , but if she wants to be taken seriously , Sarah Palin needs to break out of her self - imposed media bubble .
Analysis of the North Korean nuclear test has thus far focused on the predicament the test puts the Obama administration in .
The United States is unsatisfied with the status quo , but frustratingly lacks the tools to change the situation .
Not enough attention has been paid , however , to the problem that North Korean brinksmanship has created for China .
For some time , China has been content to allow North Korea a degree of latitude , while trying to avoid the worst - case scenarios of war or North Korean collapse .
As North Korean behaviour becomes more erratic , the US , South Korea and especially Japan have greater incentive to take aggressive stances that could endanger China 's interests in Northeast Asia .
The desire to forestall a militarised Japanese response to North Korea could incline China to take a harder stance against North Korea and provide an opening for Sino - American cooperation .
Aggressive North Korean behaviour has unnerved Japan .
Last week , prior to the nuclear test , a Liberal Democratic Party panel suggested that Japan should develop the capacity to launch pre-emptive strikes against prospective enemies .
This is consistent with the more assertive military stance that Japan has taken in recent years , such as the deployment of warships to the Indian Ocean , and the development of sea - based missile defence .
The nuclear test will only give more ammunition to Japanese hawks who wish to alter Article 9 , which limits Japan 's military to defensive options .
Japan is unlikely to develop its own nuclear forces .
As the only people to fall victim to atomic attack , the Japanese have strong cultural reasons to resist nuclear weapons .
Moreover , Japan takes non-proliferation very seriously , and has historically been a strong supporter of the international institutions that undergird it .
However , Japan can increase the size , capability and purview of its conventional forces sufficient to make China nervous about its position in east and northeast Asia .
Historical concerns aside , Japan has the economic and potential military capability to create problems for Beijing 's regional aspirations .
The long - term US relationship with Japan serves to keep Tokyo in check , which is fine with China .
An aggressive North Korea , however , may make this status quo untenable .
As long as North Korean behaviour was tolerable , China faced a situation in which it would bear many of the costs of a North Korean collapse , while reaping few benefits .
The regime 's collapse would create massive refugee problems on the Chinese border , with attendant concerns about the proliferation of nuclear and missile technology .
In the future , however , North Korean brinksmanship will become increasingly costly for the Chinese .
This creates an opportunity for cooperation between China and the United States .
China 's relatively close relationship with North Korea means that Beijing likely has a clearer understanding of the internal situation of the Pyongyang regime than the United States .
China probably has a better notion than the US of the balance of power between factions in the succession crisis , and a better idea of which levers to pull in order to strengthen one faction over another .
China and the United States do not have identical interests .
It 's unlikely that the Chinese have much appreciation at all for North Korean human rights .
China also still has some residual concern about the prospect of a unified , democratic Korea , but China has relatively good relations with Seoul , and China - South Korea trade and investment dwarf China 's economic interest in North Korea .
China cannot " solve " the North Korean problem on its own .
Beijing does not wish to risk a North Korean collapse , and has limited tools with which to affect North Korea policy short of a complete embargo .
Nevertheless , the status quo does not work to China 's benefit .
As long as North Korea continues to test missiles and nuclear warheads , hawkish forces in Japan will grow stronger .
A re-armed , assertive Japan is a bad scenario for Beijing , perhaps even worse than the collapse of the Pyongyang regime .
Although the US and China do n't have identical interests , they share enough of the same fears to make some cooperation possible .
Put bluntly , there is no way to manage North Korea without Beijing 's assistance , and Beijing has a strong incentive to facilitate a manageable situation .
iLingual iPhone app lets you speak impeccable French
There ’s a new iPhone app in town called the iLingual for Emirates which helps you speak in different languages even if you do n’t understand what you ’re saying .
All you need to do is take a picture of a mouth — yours , your friend ’s or just a photo from a book or a magazine — which the app then analyzes and converts for animation .
Once the picture is taken , you can select from a list of 400 phrases , then hold your iPhone or iPod Touch in front of your lips to make it look like you ’re saying the words in French , Arabic or German , depending on which version of the application you have .
iLingual is completely free ( iTunes link ) .
The app was created to help position Emirates as a leader and innovator in the travel industry .

There is " virtually no possibility " of a few scientists biasing the advice given to governments by the UN 's top global warming body , its chair said today .
Rajendra Pachauri defended the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in the wake of apparent suggestions in emails between climate scientists at the University of East Anglia that they had prevented work they did not agree with from being included in the panel 's fourth assessment report , which was published in 2007 .
The emails were made public this month after a hacker illegally obtained them from servers at the university .
Pachauri said the large number of contributors and rigorous peer review mechanism adopted by the IPCC meant that any bias would be rapidly uncovered .
" The processes in the IPCC are so robust , so inclusive , that even if an author or two has a particular bias it is completely unlikely that bias will find its way into the IPCC report , " he said .
" Every single comment that an expert reviewer provides has to be answered either by acceptance of the comment , or if it is not accepted , the reasons have to be clearly specified .
So I think it is a very transparent , a very comprehensive process which insures that even if someone wants to leave out a piece of peer reviewed literature there is virtually no possibility of that happening . "
The IPCC , which was set up by the UN in 1988 , is the world 's leading authority on climate change .
It advises governments on the science behind the problem and was awarded the Nobel peace prize along with Al Gore in 2007 .
Pachauri was responding to one email from 2004 in which Professor Phil Jones , the head of the climatic research unit at UEA , said of two papers he regarded as flawed : " I ca n't see either … being in the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report .
Kevin [ Trenberth ] and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is ! "
Pachauri said it was not clear whether the wording of the emails reflected the scientists ' intended actions , but said : " I really think people should be discreet … in this day and age anything you write , even privately , could become public and to put anything down in writing is , to say the least , indiscreet …
It is another matter to talk about this to your friends on the telephone or person to person but to put it down in writing was indiscreet .
If someone was to say something like this in an IPCC authors ' meeting then there are others who would chew him up . "
Jones has denied any suggestion that he tried to suppress scientific evidence he disagreed with or that he manipulated data .
Some commentators , including the former chancellor Nigel Lawson and the environmental campaigner and Guardian writer George Monbiot , have called on Jones to resign but Pachauri said he did not agree .
He said an independent inquiry into the emails would achieve little , but there should be a criminal investigation into how the emails came to light .
Pachauri said he doubted that trust in the IPCC would be damaged by the affair .
" People who are aware of how the IPCC functions and are appreciative of the credibility that the IPCC has attained will probably not be swayed by an incident of this kind , " he said .
He pointed out that five days after the emails were made public , Barack Obama announced a major commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen .

At the Iraq inquiry this morning , Sir Christopher Meyer has let so many cats out of the bag that it is hard to keep up with them all .
He has confirmed that by the time Tony Blair met George Bush at Crawford , Texas in April 2002 , Blair had already agreed to regime change .
Meyer and others had told the US administration about this change of heart in March 2002 .
The " UN route " was a way to justify the war but the inspectors were never given the chance to do their job .
Or did we know all that already ?
Ever since the war , there has been a massive gulf between what various leaked documents have shown and the official version .
Previous inquiries have failed to close that gap .
Now Meyer , who was the UK ambassador to Washington at the time , has done exactly that .
The government 's version of events was always that it was taking action to deal with the threat of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Leaked documents , most notably the Downing Street documents , show that the policy was to go along with the US desire for regime change and use weapons of mass destruction as a pretext .
This version of events was confirmed by what Meyer said this morning .
I do n't think it could be more explosive .
The inquiry committee gradually brought Meyer to early 2002 , when it became apparent that the hawks in the Bush administration who wanted regime change had won the argument in the aftermath of September 11 .
He said that the UK had been against regime change , mainly on legal grounds .
But by the time Tony Blair visited George Bush at Crawford , he was supporting the policy , but had to be discreet about it .
There was a perception that there was no point trying to go against the Americans .
Was it the case that UK policy was changed in the US ?
It was not as poodlish as that – Blair was a true believer in the evil of Saddam Hussein .
Asked when his instructions changed , Meyer said that he got a chunky set of instructions from Sir David Manning , Blair 's foreign policy adviser , in March 2002 .
Manning came over with a set of instructions to prepare the way for Blair 's visit .
One of the main things he was seeking to do was to say to the US , if you want regime change , you can do it by yourselves , but if you want partners , do it with an alliance , preferably taking " the UN route " .
Meyer said at times that regime change did not necessarily mean invasion but at other times he made clear that this was seen as the inevitable outcome .
He confirmed , as he did in his memoirs , the validity of his March 2002 note to Manning , in which he recorded how he had told Paul Wolfowitz , a leading US hawk , that while Blair backed regime change , there had to be a clever plan to wrongfoot Saddam over the return of weapons inpectors .
Meyer said that the plan initially worked perfectly , with the passing in November 2002 of UN security council resolution 1441 , which put the emphasis on Saddam Hussein .
The US hoped that it would provide a tripwire to justify war but it did not .
As we know now , there were no WMD .
This turned 1441 on its head .
The military timetable , with war slated for March 2003 , did not allow the inspections to work .
There was a desperate scrabble for a smoking gun and attention turned to claims of Iraqi non-co-operation .
Unfortunately , in March 2003 , Hans Blix reported increased co-operation .
I suggested before that Meyer 's and Manning 's evidence could be a game - changer , that given the clear evidence of the Downing Street papers , it would be impossible to claim that Iraq was about WMD and not regime change .
I do n't think Meyer 's evidence could be any more damning .
It looks as if Sir John Chilcot was right – in Meyer 's case – to expect candour , given the mountain of evidence that the inquiry has .
Meyer made clear that he was aware of these papers , none of which have yet been officially published .
Unfortunately , Meyer said that many of his dispatches , warning of problems to come , are missing from the inquiry 's otherwise excellent archive , which is of course dependent on disclosure by the government .
It looks as if the cover - up is continuing , but being botched this time .
Why yes , I am Canadian .
Why do you ask ?

The Chrome OS is here -- sort of .
This week , Google was kind of enough to give the world a sneak peek at its nascent desktop operating system .
And after months of speculation ( and more than a few bogus screenshot galleries ) , I can finally say that I 've seen the future ... and it's not Chrome OS .
The preceding statement should come as no surprise to readers of my Enterprise Desktop blog .
I came to a similar conclusion months ago .
When news of the existence of a Google OS project first leaked out , I gave it an ice cube 's chance in hell of succeeding .
Now , after watching a sometimes touchy - sounding crew from Google 's Mountain View , Calif. , headquarters walk us through the ins and outs of the Chrome OS , I 'm more convinced than ever that my original assessment was right on the money .
[ InfoWorld 's Neil McAllister reports from Google HQ the known details of the Chrome OS and Google 's planned Net appliances . ]
Fatal flaw No. 1 : The Linux foundation
First , there 's the core architecture .
A derivative of Linux , the Chrome OS builds on Linus Torvald 's popular open source foundation to create a lightweight , Web - oriented desktop environment .
However , it also inherits that platform 's many warts , including spotty hardware compatibility .
From power management to display support , Linux has long been a minefield of buggy code and half - baked device driver implementations .
Google recognizes this fact and , in a page out of the Apple Macintosh playbook , has taken the draconian measure of allowing the Chrome OS to be distributed exclusively on a series of as - yet - undisclosed netbook - like devices .
It 's a move born of desperation .
Google knows it can't possibly establish a viable hardware ecosystem and still meet its self - imposed release deadline of " mid-2010 . "
So rather than do the hard work of courting device vendors and building certification processes , Google is taking the easy way out by micromanaging which systems will be allowed to ship with the Chrome OS and then dumping responsibility for the rest of the ecosystem onto the open source community .
Fatal flaw No. 2 : The Web user interface
Then there 's the user interface .
Google looks at the world through the prism of a Web page .
So it comes as no surprise that the primary interface to the Chrome OS is ... Chrome , as in the Google browser .
Unlike a traditional OS , there 's no desktop .
The " applications " running under the Chrome OS are really just interactive Web pages , with the Chrome browser 's tabs serving to separate and organize them visually on the screen .
Basic configuration tasks , like defining Wi -Fi settings , are handled via Chrome OS - hosted pop-up windows , while a simple status bar - like strip at the top of the display informs you about battery life , connectivity status , and so on .
Sadly , none of the above UI constructs is particularly original or compelling .
The tabbed interface and " dockable " favorites are clearly derivative of Mac OS X and / or Windows ( depending on whom you ask ) , as are the status icons and pull - down applications menu .
In fact , nothing about the Chrome OS UI jumps out as innovative .
Rather , it simply replaces one set of metaphors ( Start menu , taskbar / Dock , system tray ) with a bunch of Webified equivalents .
And though I can certainly appreciate the advantages of doing away with those heavy legacy OS windowing layers --
Web content is lighterweight and easier to isolate from a security standpoint -- it also serves to limit the environment 's overall utility .
The world wo n't buy an inflexible OS
And that 's where I believe the Chrome OS ultimately fails .
In its effort to pare the traditional OS model down to the bone , Google has thrown out the one characteristic that made Windows and , to a lesser extent , Mac OS X and full - blown Linux successful : flexibility .
Simply put , the Chrome OS is too narrow .
It assumes that the world is ready to give up the traditional personal computing paradigm and live full time in the cloud .
In reality , most users prefer a hybrid existence , with some of their data and applications stored locally , and others -- typically the freebies , like Gmail -- hosted online .
Perhaps the easiest way to put the Chrome OS into context is by comparing it to the OS it 's designed to supplant : Microsoft Windows .
Like the Chrome OS , Windows lets you boot your system , surf the Web , and manage your data .
Unlike the Chrome OS , Windows also lets you run rich , local applications and services -- and do so on the hardware of your choosing .
Do n't forget that Google 's plans for acceptable hardware to run the Chrome OS is very limiting .
No hard drives or even DVD drives ; only solid state drives .
That may reduce power usage and speed up boot time ( as if that was really an issue ) , but it also means you can't run your own apps , or store and access data , when you do n't have a live Internet connection .
Plus , the supported laptops are only netbook - size laptops , with low - power CPUs that wo n't be all that capable .
Sure , Google says you can use a PC or Mac for that stuff , and Google is right :
You will .
Why you would want a Web - only appliance as well is not so easy to answer .
The bottom line is that while there is virtually nothing that you 'll be able to do with the Chrome OS that you wo n't be able to do equally well with Windows , there are literally millions of things that you can do with Windows today that you 'll likely never be able to do with the Chrome OS .
So do n't be surprised when you start hearing about early Chrome OS adopters trying to reformat their systems with Windows 7 Starter Edition .
After all , people are easily distracted , and the Chrome OS already bores me to death .

Before I start this evening , thanks to all my readers who commented on my post yesterday .�
It was my biggest response ever . �
I sent to the reporter my summary of your comments .
-=-=-==–==-=-=-=-=–==-=-=-=-=-=-=–=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
For my last employer , back in 2004 , since I had a big position on in the hedge funds in equity sensitive life insurers , I went to a Morgan Stanley “ teach - in ” on esoteric issues on reserving and required capital . �
Strangely for me , I arrived first , and waited for others to show . �
If you ’ve ever met me , you would see me at such a time pull out my “ reserve reading , ” and redeem the wait time by catching up on my reading .
Well , being there first did have an advantage in greeting people .�
“ Who are you with ? ” �
The answer was usually some asset management firm . �
But when two particularly well - dressed fellows showed up , the answer was “ The Federal Reserve . ”
“ Huh ? ” I responded . �
“ What interest would the Fed have in insurance reserving ? ”
“ We follow all areas of the financial markets , ” he smiled as he and his partner took a seat behind me .�
Aside from the presenter that Morgan Stanley brought in , I think I was the only actuary in the room , which made for an interesting dynamic . �
I tried not to ask any “ inside game ” questions , but poked at some of the assumptions embedded in the analyses . �
The guys from the Fed were quiet as clams .�
Sure beats working for a living .
Now , it was n’t the first time I had bumped into economists from the Federal Reserve at conferences .�
Half a year earlier , I bumped into some of them at a Credit Suisse conference on insurance .�
Why they wasted time listening to pitches from management teams that they do not regulate was beyond me .
So , after my recent piece , Waiting for the Death of the Chicago School , and the Keynesian School also , Redux , when I read the piece Priceless : How The Federal Reserve Bought The Economics Profession , I said to myself , “ I knew about that .�
Why did n’t I write about that ? ”
The Fed hires Ph.D. economists .�
Lots of them .�
It gives the Fed a large contingent of intellectual defenders .�
It helps them marginalize critics .�
Because of their size , they have considerable sway over academic journals , and over invitations to prestigious conferences ( dey got money mon ) .
There is a kind of paradigm a la Thomas Kuhn here , ( Structure of Scientific Revolutions ) where the dominant paradigm is well - supported economically , and self - interested , but it is false , and being attacked by poorly - funded nobodies who only have the truth on their side .
The Fed does not need most of the people that work for them . �
They have two main functions — monetary policy and banking supervision .�
They could do those tasks with 20 % or less of the personnel . �
Not that I want to unemploy a bunch of economists , but why should they be implicitly funded by the US government ?�
Why should they be doing academic studies ?
Now , some will say that it is a private institution , and it can do as it wishes . �
It is not a purely private institution :
Chairman and board members are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate .
Congress has an oversight role on what the Fed does .
Profits from the Fed flow back to the Treasury .
They have considerable influence over the theories of economics that are used to evaluate their performance .
They administer many of the major money transfer systems between institutions .
They are a major player in regulating the banks ( or not ) — if the Fed does n’t get the other regulators to cooperate , you have a mess like we did 2003 - 2007 .
They affect the value of our currency in the long run , and in the short - to - intermediate run , induce booms and busts in our economy , banks and bond markets .
Given the systematic risk that engenders , many suggest that the the Fed should regulate that as well .
A purely private institution should not have that level of influence across the economy as a whole .�
The antitrust folks get concerned over any entity monopolizing an industry , but this is a greater monopoly still , were it purely private .
The Fed is a chameleon — it ’s public when it wants to be , private when it wants to be and both or neither if that serve them well at the moment . �
I support the idea of auditing the Fed , but I really think we need is a broader debate on what the Fed should do in our country , and whether the authority and size of the institution should not be reduced .

The Obamas ’ taste in art is as broad as abstract canvases by Josef Albers , American Indian scenes by George Catlin and paintings by little - known figures like Alma Thomas , the African - American Expressionist painter .
Works by those artists were among some 45 pieces that the first couple borrowed from several Washington museums to decorate their private White House residence and the West and East Wings , the White House press office announced on Tuesday .
It is a big , wide selection of mostly modern and contemporary paintings and sculptures that also includes works by Mark Rothko , a lead relief titled “ 0 Through 9 ” by Jasper Johns , bronze sculptures by Degas and still - life canvases by Giorgio Morandi .

In the weeks before the inauguration , Michael Smith , the Obamas ’ decorator , paid a visit to Harry Cooper , curator of modern and contemporary art at the National Gallery in Washington .
Mr. Smith was not there to see the latest exhibition , but rather to talk about what art he could borrow .
He was the man who saved Hugo Chávez when all seemed lost .
A coup had ousted Venezuela 's president and buried , it seemed , his leftist experiment .
General Raúl Baduel , however , stayed loyal and tilted the army Chávez 's way during tumultuous days in April 2002 , paving the way for his triumphant return to power and restoring democracy .
A grateful Chávez hailed the general a hero and appointed him defence minister .
They became close allies and confidants .
Times change .
Baduel is now stripped of power and facing corruption charges that could keep him in jail for decades .
Prosecutors say he pilfered state funds .
Baduel says his crime was to realise – and declare – that the president was a tyrant .
" Every day there is more repression , and Chávez 's mask slips further .
The only thing Chávez cares about is being president for life , " he said , seated at a desk in his cell .
" This , " he said , tapping a pile of legal documents emblazoned with his name , " is a judicial farce " .
Since April the general has been kept behind three layers of guards and gates at a hilltop military jail in Los Teques , outside Caracas .
He has been accused of corruption over £ 8 m which allegedly disappeared during his tenure in government , a charge levelled after he broke with Chávez and joined opposition ranks .
Baduel is not alone .
Criminal charges are multiplying against government opponents .
Some are accused of corruption , others of public disorder during demonstrations .
Some are in exile , others in jail pending trial .
Critics say the president has become authoritarian and is using courts to neutralise foes .
" Given the way Chávez and his supporters have undermined the independence of the judiciary it is difficult to have confidence in the fairness of the trials , " said Daniel Wilkinson , of Human Rights Watch .
A tougher approach is already on display .
Police , citing disorder , use teargas to break up demonstrations and jail organisers .
Twelve municipal workers were arrested during a protest over working conditions .
In the western state of Táchira an opposition governor , César Pérez Vivas , was charged after leading a rally that ended in scuffles with government supporters .
" These charges are a tactic to intimidate and discourage people from protesting , " said Jackeline Sandoval , of Fundepro , a human rights watchdog .
By the group 's count there are 38 people in jail for political reasons disguised as corruption or public disorder offences .
Some choose to flee .
Manuel Rosales , an opposition leader and former presidential candidate , is among half a dozen exiles who have sought political asylum in Peru .
Criminal charges , along with blacklisting opposition candidates , usurping municipal power and closing 32 radio stations , mark a new phase in Chávez 's decade - old rule , said one senior European diplomat .
" We 've gone from calling Venezuela an imperfect democracy to an authoritarian regime with democratic characteristics , " he said .
Former US president Jimmy Carter , who has praised Chávez 's pro-poor policies and endorsed his electoral victories , recently voiced concern at an authoritarian drift .
The government declined a request for an interview but has publicly rejected such criticisms as unfair .
Chávez has won successive elections and remains popular .
He is a hero in the slums for spending oil revenue on social programmes .
Opposition parties organise freely and opposition newspapers and TV stations display shrill partisanship which makes Fox TV look tame .
Government supporters say the same elitist , anti-democratic forces that briefly ousted Chávez in 2002 – a coup endorsed by the Bush administration – are again plotting his overthrow .
" I think that behind these mobilisations there are dark forces , " Reinaldo Garcia , head of the national assembly 's human rights commission , told the state news agency ABN .
" We cannot allow them to block the streets and highways , much less burn tyres at strategic spots to provoke problems with the security forces . "
The attorney general , Luisa Ortega , a Chávez ally , said demonstrators who sought to destabilise the government would be charged with " civil rebellion " , which carries 12 to 24 years in jail .
" I would like such people … to know what the consequences will be . "
Steve Ellner , a historian and analyst at Venezuela 's University of the East , said intense polarisation led both sides to overreact but that Chávez remained a democrat , not least because of electoral mandates .
Ellner
He noted however that courts overwhelmingly targeted opposition figures .
" Chávez 's case would be much stronger if he went after corruption within his own government . "
Arresting Baduel neutralised an opponent who could stir trouble in the army .
" Obviously throwing Baduel in jail had a political motivation . "
Since his arrest the general has been kept in a military prison outside the capital .
Denied access to telephones or the internet , Baduel is a forlorn figure whose call for an assembly to rewrite the constitution and rein in the president is largely unheard .
In the 1980s Baduel and Chávez were part of a secret cell of young army officers who plotted to seize power and usher in " real " democracy , but the president had betrayed that promise , said Baduel .
" We are in a new modality of dictatorship which has a facade of democracy . "
The former defence minister , an authority on eastern religions , spends his days meditating , reading , writing and blending fruit juices .
He used to share his cell with a former navy admiral and a former national guard general who were accused of plotting to kill Chávez .
The charges were dropped and they were released last week .
Baduel does not expect to be a free man soon .
" I know I will leave this prison only when Chávez leaves the presidency of Venezuela . "

With the Climategate revelations , momentum is definitely building against the credibility of the climate doomsday mongering , but will it be enough to derail the juggernaut for global warming statism ?
As the Wall Street Journal has noted in its November 27th editorial , “ Rigging a Climate ‘ Consensus ' ” :
The furor over these documents is not about tone , colloquialisms or whether climatologists are nice people .
The real issue is what the messages say about the way the much - ballyhooed scientific consensus on global warming was arrived at , and how a single view of warming and its causes is being enforced .
The impression left ... is that the climate - tracking game has been rigged from the start .
Because of these revelations , the now scandal - ridden Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia has suddenly reversed their long - standing stonewalling and refusal to comply with requests via the U.K. ’s Freedom of Information Act and now will release their “ full data . ”
Meanwhile , in a new report in the Times of London , we now find that , “ Scientists at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) have admitted throwing away much of the raw temperature data on which their predictions of global warming are based . ”
In addition , the New Zealand government ’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research has similarly been “ cooking the books . ”
But perhaps of even greater importance is whether these revelations will finally bring to light the need for a serious re-assessment of the actual operations of academia and scientific enterprise .
For far too long , “ science ” has been shrouded in a cloak of unquestionable authority as the final arbiter of all knowledge .
Such a status has resulted in the creation of enormous , government - funded institutions to examine seemingly every aspect of human existence , with climate science receiving a whopping $ 7 billion annually from the U.S. government alone ( more than is spent on cancer and AIDS research ) .
The conclusions from such endeavors have been viewed by many as utterly sacrosanct , around which public policy and the law itself should allegedly be based .
In the process , this dogmatic commitment to “ science ” and a government - science complex as the source of all higher truth has produced a narrow - minded worship of scientific materialism , the reductionist fallacy of “ scientism . ”
Almost daily for example , media reports claim that “ in the name of science ” yet another enduring human characteristic has now been “ explained ” away — from free will to love , from moral conscience to reason , from education to the arts , from commerce to law — in purely deterministic terms , with government power the requisite means to address social problems by redesigning and controlling mankind .
And the mania regarding “ global warming ” is exhibit A , in which the alleged “ peer - reviewed ” findings of a “ consensus ” of scientists claims to have found the “ fact ” that human emissions of CO2 are creating an ecological holocaust , and only draconian controls on all areas of human life will avert this calamity .
In the process , ethics , economic principles , contrary evidence , and common sense are all swept aside in a mad rush for climate statism .
But with the revelations from Climategate , many people are now beginning to see a grand scam , in which data is deliberately distorted ; peer review is gamed by manipulating and stacking the process ; critics are smeared , black - balled , and de-funded ; opposing papers are kept from publication ; and a cabal of politically - connected scientists are working in concert with certain journalists , politicians , bureaucrats , and interest groups to deceive the public and opinion leaders in order to ram through a politically - correct agenda .
Of course , we have seen such campaigns many times before , all claiming to be based on expert findings in the natural and social “ sciences , ” including eugenics , the creation of the Federal Reserve , zero population growth , the New Deal , ozone depletion , electro - magnetism and cancer , economic bailouts , Superfund , the war in Iraq , and even Obamacare .
The reality that has been missed here is that science is merely a technique or procedure for examining the material world , and the validity of such a technique rests upon a prior philosophical ( metaphysical ) logic of ideas , that is all necessarily non-material .
Moreover , while science can tell us what is materially , it cannot tell us what ought our choices to be with such conditions .
Hence , science , while being an irreplaceable contributing method of inquiry , is contingent and cannot itself be the final authority on truth .
By missing this point and succumbing to the worship of scientism , much of academia and the scientific world has too often corrupted and politicized the enterprise of science , producing its exact opposite .
More than six decades ago , C.S. Lewis prophetically warned us of this very same corruption of science and morality in his brilliant novel , That Hideous Strength , in which a group of university scientists conspires to take over society by manipulating information and people in order to impose the horror of a scientistic , totalitarian state , all to “ save ” nature and create a new “ mankind . ”
Lewis simultaneously examined these central issues in his classic book on epistemology and ethics , The Abolition of Man .
For further prescient assessments of this serious problem and the need for accountable , de-socializing solutions , please see the following :
The Independent Institute was also among the very first and few organizations to debunk the erroneous claims of man-made climate crises , starting ten years ago with such publications as the following :
Finally , the following Institute video is especially timely and incisive :
States of Fear : Science or Politics ? , featuring the late Michael Crichton and a panel of distinguished scientists , including Bruce Ames ( University of California , Berkeley ) , Sallie Baliunas ( Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ) , William Gray ( Colorado State University ) , and Oregon State Climatologist George Taylor

One of the problems for health care reformers is that they 've had to both promise that their legislation will bring about both a world of difference and not much change .
Things will be much better under reform , we 're told , but if you like what you 've got now , nothing will change .
The fact is , for many , maybe most , people , not much will change :
For those on employer plans , premiums will probably rise faster over time than they would have , and depending on what sort of exchange and public plan options get put in place , some number of people might find their employers dropping coverage — leaving employees to buy coverage through the exchange .
But of course , Democrats have had to sell health care reform as the solution to all our health care problems .
Certainly , many less politically informed voters are likely to think of it that way .
And as a result , I suspect lots of people are n't going to be too happy if reform passes and then things do n't change much .
The fact is , even if reform passes , many people who do n't like their health care situation are n't going to see much improvement .
And , as Politico explains , that could have some consequences :
After all the controversy over the public option , people might think that everyone can sign up right away if Congress passes health reform .
Or that insurance premiums will go down .
Or that they 'll be able to shop around for insurance if they do n't like what their company offers .
Think again .
When it comes to the public option , for instance , only about 1 in 10 Americans will be eligible , mainly people who do n't get insurance through work .
Only about 6 million are expected to enroll .
The plan does n't even start until 2013 .
And most people who get insurance on the job would have to stick with it .
No shopping in the new " insurance exchanges " for them .
President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress stand to reap the political rewards if they can pull off health reform , by achieving near - universal coverage , toughening regulations on private insurers and transforming the way health care is delivered .
But Democrats have glossed over nagging details of just how limited reform 's reach would be for some Americans .
And if voters figure it out , experts warn there could be a political backlash .
On a note that 's scary in a different way , the piece quotes Harvard health policy professor Robert Blendon as saying that even if the bill passes , the health care issue is never going to go away :
If the bill becomes law , Blendon said , the campaign for maintaining support for health care reform would only just begin .
" It is not really over in people 's mind , " he said .
This is one of the side - effects of health care reform I suspect people think about less :
Reform wo n't just mess up our health care system , it will infect our political system ; the more our politics and our health care are tied together , the more our political debates will become indistinguishable from our health care debates .
They 'll become permanently intertwined , going on and on , forever and ever , cable news without end .
Cocktail connoisseurs should be on alert .
There could be an aromatic kick missing from your next manhattan or pink gin .
The world is suffering an acute shortage of angostura bitters , the herbal concoction used to give an extra twist of flavour to classic alcoholic drinks .
Bars are struggling to replenish supplies of angostura following a shutdown at the sole manufacturer , a recession - hit firm in Trinidad and Tobago .
Made from a secret recipe of herbs , barks , roots , spices and rum , bitters became popular in Britain as an additive for gin , partly to conceal quinine in tonic water .
In the UK the website of angostura 's main importer , WB Distribution , says the product is completely sold out .
Trinidad 's House of Angostura has blamed a shortage in ingredients and a financial restructuring .
The firm is owned by CL Financial , a Caribbean conglomerate hit by a liquidity crisis , prompting an emergency bailout earlier this year by the government of Trinidad and Tobago .
Patrick Sepe , chief executive of the US distributor , Angostura USA , said the production line ran dry in June and was only just getting back on track .
" There has been a shortage , " said Sepe .
" You ca n't just turn on and off supply of bitters .
It 's not like producing bottled water – it's a very delicate , intricate process . "
Invented in 1824 , angostura was named after a town in Venezuela where a German doctor , Johann Siegert , came up with the recipe as a stomach tonic to ease tropical ailments among soldiers .
Bereft of the classic bitter , certain bars have now turned to alternatives , including supplies from a German company , The Bitter Truth .
" A lot of bars are not happy , " said Mark Ludmon , editor of Bar magazine .
" Any bar that 's trying to do cocktails seriously will feel it 's wrong not to use the right bitters . "
Once owned by the rum firm Bacardi , the House of Angostura was sold in 1997 to CL Financial , which has failed to respond to requests for comment .
According to Trinidad 's Newsday newspaper , CL leveraged Angostura 's profits against a series of acquisitions including a deal to buy control of a Jamaican industrial company , Lascelles deMercado .
It was reportedly left with a TT$ 600 m ( £ 57 m ) hole in its balance sheet .
Tony Conigliaro , an award - winning cocktail inventor and owner of 69 Colebrooke Row , a bar in Islington , north London , said he had stockpiled angostura after learning of the shortage .
He described bitters as a crucial finishing agent in well - mixed drinks : " What bitters will do is stretch the rest of the flavours across the palate . "
Distributors say the US is the world 's biggest consumer of Aangostura bitters , drinking the equivalent of about 750,000 four - ounce bottles or equivalents annually .
Sepe said he hoped supplies would improve in time for Christmas , as shipments are just beginning to resume from the Caribbean : " There have been a lot of rumours that we 're going out of business and that people will never see Aangostura bitters again .
I want to be clear that is not the case . "

BBC News , southern Thailand
Civilian groups , some including women , are being armed
So far the wars of the 21st Century have revolved around insurgencies with nameless , faceless and often fearless fighters bombing , shooting and beheading with little care for their own lives .
Afghanistan and Pakistan show how difficult and expensive these insurgencies are to counter and how disruptive and divisive they can be even with ill - defined , non-specific objectives .
Thailand seems about as far from the Taliban as you can get , yet just a short distance from its golden tourist beaches and paradise islands , an insurgency has been raging for five years .
Someone is killed on average every day in the provinces on the country 's southern border with Malaysia , where a shadowy group of Islamist extremists are stirring up a deepening sectarian divide .
In just five years 3,800 people have been killed and more than 6,000 injured .
But what they want is not totally clear and no group has ever publicly admitted it carried out an attack .
They have no links to al - Qaeda and few ties to foreign organisations except perhaps a few cash donations to keep the Islamic extremist message of violence going .
Tens of thousands of troops have been deployed , and now civilians appear to be encouraged to take the law into their own hands .
Divided communities
At the local Buddhist temple at Trohgen village in Pattani province a class is being held for a group of mostly female community volunteers - but this is no religious ceremony .
Some of Monthira Peng - Iad 's relatives have been killed
It is a refresher course to remind them how to clean , maintain and use the shotguns they have been given by the government for their own protection .
" It 's getting more violent every day , " said Monthira Peng - Iad , a 40 - year - old farmer .
" So many of my relatives have been shot and killed I feel bitter inside .
I want to know how to shoot , so I can help people in the village . "
In a community in which Muslims and Buddhists used to live side - by - side in peace , her rhetoric shows how divisive the insurgency has been .
" It 's time to fight otherwise all the Thai Buddhists will be killed .
We used to be friends and relatives but now we are divided .
Now they see all of us as enemies .
They kill us . "
Civilians targeted
One human rights group says up to a hundred thousand civilian Buddhists and Muslims have been given guns to " protect " themselves in the three southern provinces of Thailand , but this is a figure the military denies .
However many guns there are , the violence does n't appear to be abating .
At al - Furquan mosque in Ai Payae village , Narathiwat province , there are more armed men on guard outside than there are inside for afternoon prayers .
The group of 18 Muslim men were armed by the government but did not appear particularly well - drilled in weapons safety .
They were brought in after an attack on the mosque in June when gunmen opened fire killing ten people and injured 12 .
Ayu Jeh - Ngoh was shot twice , once in the back and once in the leg as he prayed .
He suspects the attackers were from a nearby Buddhist village , taking revenge after a Buddhist was killed in the area .
Others in the area suspect a similar thing , but nobody has been charged with the attack and they said the investigation did not appear to be going anywhere .
The victims are often civilians , especially teachers , who in the most dangerous areas travel to school on motorbikes in groups with armed soldiers as outriders to protect them .
Sukhon Deangchot teaches at a school which has already been bombed once .
" We 're really worried about our security when going to work .
I 've no idea who is targeting us , " she said .
Hearts and minds
Tens of thousands of troops are still struggling to contain the violence .
Thousands of auxiliaries have been trained and civilians have been armed or given radios and drafted in as spies on neighbourhood watch .
Lt Gen Kasikorn Keereesri is the Combined Task Force commander .
He is trying all sorts of counter - insurgency tactics to win people over and isolate the bombers .
Schools , mosques and markets have all been targeted " The number of incidents is decreasing , but every time something happens it is more violent and it causes more damage , " he said .
" The insurgents have started to attack more in big cities now using car bombs which cause more damage inside the city .
" Our strategy is that we have to control the insurgents ' freedom of movement in the villages .
We have to win the hearts and minds of villagers and make them side with us . "
It is a similar challenge facing American and Nato troops in Afghanistan and it is far from easy , even with their huge resources .
Farming courses are run to help poorer people and money is spent on other projects , but there have been human rights abuses carried out by some members of the security forces - something the general accepts has not helped , but says is now being addressed .
Both sides are being dragged into the division and instability which the insurgency brings .
" My house was burned down , my husband was shot dead , my daughter was shot and my son disappeared , " said Kuang Narumon , a 52 - year - old Buddhist .
" We do n't trust each other now , " she said with a nervous , fixed smile .
" We 're separate - not like we used to be . "

Hewlett - Packard Co. said Wednesday it will acquire 3Com Corp. in a $ 2.7 billion deal that will enable the computer giant to expand its sales of networking products at a time when all the big technology vendors want to become one - stop shops for their corporate computing clients .
The acquisition thrusts HP , the Palo Alto firm that makes everything from ink - jet printers to corporate data centers , into direct competition with Cisco Systems , the San Jose company that has been the dominant vendor for computer networking .
" This is definitely a move from HP that competes with Cisco in that space , " said analyst Vanessa Alvarez of Frost & Sullivan business consultants , adding that HP was stung earlier this year when Cisco introduced a server computer that invaded a market important to HP .
But beyond the battle between these two Bay Area giants , industry analysts see other recent deals - such as Oracle Corp .'s $ 7.4 billion bid for Sun Microsystems and Dell Inc. 's $ 3.9 billion offer for Perot Systems Corp . - as attempts by the big software and hardware firms to acquire whatever corporate computing goodies they do n't currently sell .
" Everybody is getting into each other 's territory , " said David Willis , a vice president with Gartner Research .
" It 's all about account control , " said Silicon Valley tech analyst Rob Enderle .
" If you build an entire ecosystem , you get more of the customer 's total spending , and it's a good , high - margin business . "
Week of deals
HP 's networking gambit comes during a week of merger deals in Silicon Valley , including Google 's $ 750 million offer for the mobile advertising company AdMob , Logitech 's $ 405 million bid for the videoconferencing firm LifeSize Communications , and Electronic Arts ' $ 300 million offer for the social - game outfit Playfish .
Assuming the HP bid receives regulatory and shareholder approval , the acquisition would end the 30 - year run of 3Com , the once - fabled Silicon Valley startup that helped create the computer - networking industry and had its name on Candlestick Park from 1995 until 2005 .
But during the late 1990s , 3Com became increasingly overmatched by Cisco in many networking markets , while it was largely unsuccessful with its forays into other areas , such as handheld computing .
At one point , 3Com owned Palm Inc .
In 2003 , 3Com moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Massachusetts and refocused its business on building the hardware and software that provides the internal connections for computer networks .
Around the same time , 3Com began working closely with the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei , a relationship that helped it win a large share of the Chinese networking market - a fact mentioned repeatedly by HP executives in a conference call Wednesday with analysts .
Security concerns
In 2007 , Huawei had sought to become the minority owner of 3Com in a $ 2.2 billion deal that would have given Boston investment firm Bain Capital a controlling interest in the networking company .
But that deal fell apart in 2008 after some U.S. authorities voiced security concerns about Huawei , which was founded by a former officer in the Chinese army .
In Wednesday 's conference call , one analyst asked whether Chinese authorities might try to block the deal , as 3Com networking products are widely used by companies and government agencies there .
An HP spokesperson suggested the company did not anticipate trouble .
HP announced the deal on the same day it reported preliminary quarterly earnings of 99 cents per share on $ 30.8 billion in revenue for the three months that ended in October , compared with 84 cents per share on $ 33.6 billion in sales in the same period a year ago .
HP has bought more than 30 companies since Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd took over in 2005 , including last year 's $ 13.2 billion acquisition of Electronic Data Systems , a leading vendor of consulting and integration services for the corporate computer market .
The Bible , along with other sacred texts , provides solace and inspiration for billions across the planet .
But how literally do its readers take passages such as this one ?
If he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
Very literally , in some cases .
Because this piece of scripture , from the book of Numbers ( 35:16 ) in the Old Testament , evidently provides some Christians with what they believe is " literal truth " and a biblical underpinning to their personal support for capital punishment .
When a man called Khristian Oliver stood trial for murder in Texas 10 years ago , several jurors consulted the Bible extensively during their deliberations .
Key passages were highlighted and handed around among fellow believers .
The " smite him " verse was one of them .
One of these jurors later confirmed that reference to scripture played a part in his deliberation .
In his view , biblical pronouncements always trumped man-made laws and he fervently believed that " the Bible is the truth from page one to the last page " .
This juror , apparently just one of a four - fifths majority of jury members who introduced biblical notions into the jury discussion , also later made it very clear that he was a firm believer in capital punishment , describing life imprisonment as a " burden " on the taxpayer .
Did those religious , believing jury members cross an important line when they began looking up and discussing what they would have seen as " relevant " verses from an ancient text ?
Was it improper ?
Was it perhaps a well - intentioned , but deeply worrying deviation from the expected conduct of a jury ?
A US appeals court certainly thought so .
Last year , the court of appeals for the fifth circuit said that these God-fearing jurors " had crossed an important line " when they searched for guidance in scripture .
It was , said this federal court , a more " egregious " example of this than had occurred in other jurisdictions .
But federal appeals courts are extremely chary of overturning state courts ' decisions .
Oliver 's appeal was dismissed .
Surely the supreme court could n't let this pass ?
In fact , because of growing disquiet in the US about a resort to Bibles in jury rooms , earlier this year a group of 46 federal and state prosecutors joined together in a petition to America 's senior court urging it to examine the Oliver case to clarify law in this area .
The supreme court declined to do so .
Oliver is now scheduled for execution on 5 November .
He is left praying for either a rare clemency recommendation from the Texas board of pardons and paroles or , failing that , a stay of execution from the hardline state governor Rick Perry .
Human rights and faith often go hand in hand , a righteous belief in fairness and truth frequently linking arms with a fervent desire to ensure equality before the law and justice for all .
Religion is a massively powerful fortifier to those suffering oppression and injustice .
Prisoners the world over have held on to or even developed faith to see them through their mightiest challenges .
Indeed , many of those within America 's massive death row system survive the mental torture of years facing a gruesome death in a lethal injection chamber by turning to God .
But when biblical exegesis replaces the solemn , dispassionate weighing of evidence you know that things have gone badly wrong .
It 's one thing for a witness to swear on a Bible to tell the truth before a jury in a courtroom .
It 's quite another for those jury members to take the Bible back with them to the jury room to decide whether a man will live or die .

The European Commission has presented last week its proposal for enlargement of the scale of the GDP as an indicator for the status of the economy .
euinside is publishing herewith the opinion of the senior economic analyst from the Open Society institute Mr. Georgi Angelov :
euinside : How would you comment the idea of the Commission to extend the scale of the GDP to include other indicators ?
GEORGI ANGELOV :
In fact there are many such ideas and the French government has assigned a working group with the task to prepare a report on the future of measurement of the economic indicators .
The issue cannot be solved that easy with signatures or a change , because this is like in a family - there is not just a single indicator that measures the prosperity of that family .
The income is very important , the debts , the environment - whether that family lives in the centre of Sofia , breathing polluted area or lives in the mountain .
In other words there are many indicators that show different things and they cannot be replaced by a single indicator that will show everything .
euinside :
In the communication of the Commission is written exactly this - that the GDP will be supplemented by a pilot ecological indicator that will measure the climate change and the energy consumption , the carbon footprint , the generation of waste .
To what extent such an indicator could add to the whole picture the GDP gives ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : To be honest , there is a big problems with a national measurer because , let 's say in Sofia the situation is one and in a village in the Rodopa mountains is totally different .
To say that in Bulgaria as a whole the environment is well preserved will be wrong .
Compared to France , probably we have more forests and more natural reserves but , on the other hand , in Sofia the situation is exactly the opposite - there is not nature at all , there are no parks , it is very polluted .
In this sense , a single indicator for a whole country , I 'm not sure if it will be able to reflect the whole variety in the different regions of a country .
A think this would be very difficult .
It would be much better if such a measurement is done regionally because it would show more accurately the quality of life in a region and will add to the GDP .
It is clear that the incomes in Sofia are higher but the quality of life in terms of clean air and environment is pretty bad .
In other places in Bulgaria the situation is vice versa - low incomes but very clean environment .
But some indicators can be national .
For example the carbon dioxide or similar things .
But here it is interesting to find out to what extent such indicators are indicative because they depend on the type of industry and the type of economy of a country .
A country where there is only tourism will look very much different than an industrialized country .
Bot countries are totally different as types of economy and cannot be compared .
euinside :
That is exactly the question - if the ecological indicators are included the developed countries that have already applied measures to improve the environment would look much better because they invest in green technology , is n't that right ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : Well , the issue is how these things will be measured because , on the one hand , if we look at the pollution indicator per person then all developing countries would look much better because per person they pollute less than the US or Europe .
The richer countries have a higher intensity of cars , air planes and industry .
In this regard it is important who will win in this debate because if they ask the developing countries they will say we want to measure per person .
But the developed states will say , no , we want to measure an absolute cost .
I guess there will be some political implications as many international issues do .
euinside :
How about the idea for more accurate reporting of the wealth distribution and the social inequality , is there a possibility to measure such things ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : This is a complicated issue because it depends on what we will include , what territory , which countries .
If we take Europe as an entity , there will be large disproportions in wealth distribution , because Bulgaria is the poorest country , 10 times poorer than Ireland or Luxembourg .
Thus it will show that Europe there is much bigger differentiation between rich and poor .
It would be different if we analyse the situation on national level .
The Europe will look much better .
The same goes for other countries .
Of course , if we analyse a country on its own , there will be much less inequalities , especially if compared to a country that is 10 times poorer .
The European , in general , avoid to make such comparisons , although this is a European initiative because , given the poverty indicator , in Bulgaria we should all be considered poor .
euinside : Does it matter what we analyse because in the document the Commission says that the education , healthcare , the access to services , the infrastructure and the houses should also be included in the analysis ?
GEORGI ANGELOV :
By the way this would be very important if it happens , especially regarding the education because this is one of the largest problems .
Beside some international indexes which are an attempt to make any comparisons , in fact it is very hard to see what the quality of education is in different countries .
So , if such a statistics is introduced , it might help a lot to see the development of education and to see which countries are doing better or worse .
But here there is a very big problem because how can we measure the quality of education in countries with different languages , with different alphabets , different systems ?
Nevertheless , it is very important the efforts in this direction to go ahead because , in the end of the day , beside the short - term indicators like wages , incomes , GDP , there are long - term indicators which might be even more important , like infrastructure , education , quality of life , environment because they will determine the development of a country in 10 - 20 years ahead .
euinside :
This is very interesting because if we take the education what are we supposed to measure ?
Some results or the education system itself ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : Generally , the idea is to measure the extent to which children can read , write , whether they understand science .
Further in the education system the situation becomes more complex what exactly do we measure and how are we going to define an international standardization .
In other words , we in Bulgaria can measure the results of some tests because we have a common education system but how can we compare to the Germans or the Finnish ?
And with universities the situation becomes deem .
That is why there is no international quality classification .
euinside :
But should n't we analyse the impact the education has on economy - what we actually miss a lot - to produce people that are useful for the economy or the opposite - we do n't have people to satisfy the needs of the economy ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : In general this is the idea .
The problem is that there is no way we can directly watch what impact the quality of education has on economy because the economy is influenced by many other things .
For example , the judiciary , whether the business environment is good , the monetary system too .
In other words , there are many things that have impact on economy and we cannot watch directly only one indicator .
That is why we need intermediate indicators to show the connection we cannot measure .
Usually when comes to education , we measure the direct results , i.e. whether children have acquired certain abilities at the end of an educational stage .
But it is very hard to do that with the higher stages of education but it 's worth trying .
euinside : Just to conclude , in fact it comes out that it would be very hard to include new indicators to the GDP in the next couple of years which can give really accurate picture of the development of a country compared to others ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : Yes , this is one thing .
On the other hand , there is a need of such various and long - term indicators that will supplement the purely financial aspect of the GDP .
Because if we again take the example with the family - its income for a month can be very high but this does not mean that in 10 or 20 years that income will be high again or that the family lives healthy life or that the life expectancy will be high , or the level of education .
So , there is a need other things to be measured as well without replacing the financial indicators .
The way we measure the incomes of a person cannot be replaced by anything else .
euinside :
In the end of the day , the whole idea of what the Commission proposes is to get a full picture of the situation which will help the more accurate definition of policies on European and on national level .
But I am a skeptic regarding Bulgaria that such a better picture would lead to better policies in the right direction ?
GEORGI ANGELOV : To some extent , I am an optimist because in Bulgaria this is exactly what makes sense - if we are put in a contest to see how bad we are - this is what makes politicians to act .
Usually , in Bulgaria , the politicians and the intellectual circles tend to think that Bulgaria has some unique things which should n't be changed .
But if we see ourselves from the perspective of an international comparison where we are put on the last place , this gives a lot of opportunities for action .
We 've seen this quite often with the business environment indicator .
For years local bureaucrats claim that we are the best in the world but after the World bank releases a list , we see that things are not that nice .
And this is what turns the push back to the politicians and they manage to do things the bureaucracy stumbled .
I think that the comparisons are very important , especially with other countries .
Normally when we think of a typical space strategy game we imagine it to be PC turn - based single player , especially if we ’re talking about 4 x games .
Reference examples of these games are Master of Orion , Galactic Civilizations , Alpha Centauri and the Space Empires series .
In spite multiplayer features are sometimes offered , although somehow limited , there is an emblematic recent case , namely GalCiv2 , where multiplayer possibility is not provided at all .
I invite you to read the article Galactic Civilizations :
The case for no multiplayer where one of GalCiv2 lead developers explains the reasons why they did not included multiplayer in the game .
From a single player to a massively multiplayer online experience
I ’m an hardcore fan of PC strategy single player games , as I grew up with them ( you can check the about page of my blog to see games I ’ve been playing for 20 years now ) .
My experience using multiplayer features in this games is very limited , and my online multiplayer experience nonexistent to a few months ago .
Seeing my sister , also an old school strategy gamer herself , playing World of Warcraft ( a.k.a. WoW ) for about 4 years straight now ( and the single only game she plays these days ) made me think twice about the online massively multiplayer phenomenon and so I decided to give online games a try at my own risk .
I recommend you to read the article World of Warcrack and the future of MMOGs to get the feeling of how addicting WoW is and how this is impacting the gaming society in a way that will only be fully understood in some years from now .
So some months ago a friend of mine , knowing my interest in strategy games , recommended me to try out Travian : an ancient world strategy web - based MMO game .
I enjoyed playing Travian immediately .
First of all it is free , very simple to play ( you only need an Internet connection and a web - browser ) and surprisingly enough to me the game was very addicting .
I did not knew by then ( and frankly I ’m still figuring it out now ) from where was this addicting factor coming from , since the game is pretty basic .
Is it the simple gameplay experience itself ?
Is it the social aspect of the game ?
Or is it both ?
At my own pace I started to play Travian regularly .
Naturally after having a positive experience with Travian I could not stop to ask myself if there could be also some MMO space strategy games , and possibly even 4 x out there .
The answer is yes and a lot of them .
Many are already available , many others are in the making .
Web - based space strategy MMO Boom
So if in the recent past 4 x space strategy games favored so much the single player experience ( as it seems to be its main characteristic ) is it feasible to think that this genre can be successful in the MMO world ?
And a more important question : can the new space strategy paradigm be MMO ?
After making a quick search I found OGame , one of the most influential space strategy web - based MMO games out there .
I played OGame for a while , and I still play occasionally .
It is a satisfactory enough game .
You can read my review of OGame in SpaceSector.com : Ogame Review , Tips and Strategy Guide .
But there are many others .
And the most difficult part these days is to figure out which ones are really worth it to give it a try .
You can get a comprehensive list of space MMO games at Galaxy News .
As you glimpse Galaxy News list of space MMO games you ca n’t help to be surprised , not to say ultimately shocked , to see how many of these games are already available , or under development .
They account 145 space MMO games in their database .
Some of them show great potential .
I tried so far : Astro Empires ( which I already made a review ) , Cosmic Supremacy ( a very complex and promising game ) , Dark Orbit , Ferion and Pirate Galaxy just to name a few .
What ’s your MMO experience ?
I decided to write this post to share with you my experiences playing space and non-space MMO games , since the process of discovering this new type of games to the amazement of how simple but how addicting these games can be .
It would be very interesting to get feedback from you guys , the space ( and also the non-space ) gaming community .
Do you play MMO games ?
If so which ones do you currently play ( or played ) , and which of these do you recommend to other gamers and why ?
Ultimately it would be very interesting to discuss here your opinion on if MMO games could be the new paradigm for 4 x space strategy .

WHEN Jenny Kirsten , a producer for the Food Network , went on her first date with Jason Beberman , a chef at Dressler in Brooklyn , they did n’t splurge on a multicourse dinner with wine pairings .

Matthew Hoggard is " shocked and bitterly disappointed " after Yorkshire told him they will not offer him a new contract .
Hoggard , Yorkshire 's leading wicket - taker in this season 's LV County Championship , finds the news hard to take after holding talks about the possibility of taking on the captaincy next season .

The former England pace bowler told The Times : " I 'm shocked and bitterly disappointed .
I think I 've been loyal to Yorkshire .
" I wanted to commit the rest of my career to the club and I would have relished the thought of captaincy , which I had discussed with ( chairman ) Colin Graves and ( director of cricket ) Martyn Moxon .
" Now I have effectively been sacked and I 'm not even going to play for Yorkshire again , which makes me incredibly sad . "
He continued : " What really upsets me is that I was n't given the chance in my final game to say goodbye to the Yorkshire supporters , who have been so good to me over the years .
" Other players who knew they were n't going to be around next year were given a handshake and a send - off in front of the fans .
" All I got after 15 years at the club was a cup of coffee in the chief executive 's office . "
The White Rose have cited financial reasons for their decision to release the 32 - year - old , who has been with the county for 15 seasons .
The England and Wales Cricket Board are introducing age - related incentive payments for counties next season , which will not help the cause of experienced players bidding to stay in the game .
Several other counties are believed to have expressed an interest in Hoggard , whose last England Test appearance came in New Zealand in March last year .
He added : " I 'm just going to have to look at other options now .
" I was looking forward to using my experience to bring on the next generation of Yorkshire bowlers , but I 'll have to do that somewhere else now .
" I still feel as though I 've got a good few years in me and it's up to me now to prove that Yorkshire were wrong to let me go . "
David Chalmers is a philosopher of mind , best known for his argument about the difficulty of what he termed the “ hard problem ” of consciousness , which he typically discusses by way of a thought experiment featuring zombies who act and talk exactly like humans , and yet have no conscious thought ( I explained clearly what I think of that sort of thing in my essay on “ The Zombification of Philosophy ” ) .
Yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing Chalmers in action live at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York .
He did n’t talk about zombies , telling us instead his thoughts about the so - called Singularity , the alleged moment when artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence , resulting in either all hell breaking loose or the next glorious stage in human evolution — depending on whether you typically see the glass as half empty or half full .
The talk made clear to me what Chalmers ’ problem is ( other than his really bad hair cut ) : he reads too much science fiction , and is apparently unable to snap out of the necessary suspension of disbelief when he comes back to the real world .
Let me explain .
Chalmers ’ ( and other advocates of the possibility of a Singularity ) argument starts off with the simple observation that machines have gained computing power at an extraordinary rate over the past several years , a trend that one can extrapolate to a near future explosion of intelligence .
Too bad that , as any student of statistics 101 ought to know , extrapolation is a really bad way of making predictions , unless one can be reasonably assured of understanding the underlying causal phenomena ( which we do n’t , in the case of intelligence ) .
( I asked a question along these lines to Chalmers in the Q&A and he denied having used the word extrapolation at all ; I checked with several colleagues over wine and cheese , and they all confirmed that he did — several times . )
Be that as it may , Chalmers went on to present his main argument for the Singularity , which goes something like this : 1 . There will soon be AI ( i.e. , Artificial Intelligence ) 2 .
There will then soon be a transition from AI to AI+3 .
There will then soon be a transition from AI + to AI ++ Therefore , there will be AI ++
All three premises and the conclusion where followed by a parenthetical statement to the effect that each holds only “ absent defeaters , ” i.e. , absent anything that may get in the way of any of the above .
Chalmers was obviously very proud of his argument , but I got the sense that few people were impressed , and I certainly was n’t .
First off , he consistently refused to define what AI ++ , AI + , or even , for that matter , AI , actually mean .
This , in a philosophy talk , is a pretty grave sin , because philosophical analysis does n’t get off the ground unless we are reasonably clear on what it is that we are talking about .
Indeed , much of philosophical analysis aims at clarifying concepts and their relations .
You would have been hard pressed ( and increasingly frustrated ) in finding any philosophical analysis whatsoever in Chalmers ’ talk .
Second , Chalmers did not provide a single reason for any of his moves , simply stating each premise and adding that if AI is possible , then there is no reason to believe that AI + ( whatever that is ) is not also possible , indeed likely , and so on .
But , my friend , if you are making a novel claim , the burden of proof is on you to argue that there are positive reasons to think that what you are suggesting may be true , not on the rest of us to prove that it is not .
Shifting the burden of proof is the oldest trick in the rhetorical toolbox , and not one that a self - respecting philosopher should deploy in front of his peers ( or anywhere else , for that matter ) .
Third , note the parenthetical disclaimer that any of the premises , as well as the conclusion , will not actually hold if a “ defeater ” gets in the way .
When asked during the Q&A what he meant by defeaters , Chalmers pretty much said anything that humans or nature could throw at the development of artificial intelligence .
But if that is the case , and if we are not provided with a classification and analysis of such defeaters , then the entire argument amounts to “ X is true ( unless something proves X not to be true ) . ”
Not that impressive .
The other elephant in the room , of course , is the very concept of “ intelligence , ” artificial or human .
This is a notoriously difficult concept to unpack , and even more so to measure quantitatively ( which would be necessary to tell the difference between AI and AI + or AI ++ ) .
Several people noted this problem , including myself in the Q&A , but Chalmers cavalierly brushed it aside saying that his argument does not hinge on human intelligence , or computational power , or intelligence in a broader sense , but only on an unspecified quantity “ G ” which he quickly associated with an unspecified set of cognitive capacities through an equally unspecified mathematical mapping function ( adding that “ more work would have to be done ” to flesh out such notion — no kidding ) .
Really ?
But wait a minute , if we started this whole discussion about the Singularity using an argument based on extrapolation of computational power , should n’t our discussion be limited to computational power ?
( Which , needless to say , is not at all the same as intelligence . )
And if we are talking about AI , what on earth does the “ I ” stand for in there , if not intelligence — presumably of a human - like kind ?
In fact , the problem with the AI effort in general is that we have little progress to show after decades of attempts , likely for the very good reason that human intelligence is not algorithmic , at least not in the same sense in which computer programs are .
I am most certainly not invoking mysticism or dualism here , I think that intelligence ( and consciousness ) are the result of the activity of a physical brain substrate , but the very fact that we can build machines with a degree of computing power and speed that greatly exceeds those of the human mind , and yet are nowhere near being “ intelligent , ” should make it pretty clear that the problem is not computing power or speed .
After the deployment of the above mentioned highly questionable “ argument , ” things just got bizarre in Chalmers ’ talk .
He rapidly proceeded to tell us that A ++ will happen by simulated evolution in a virtual environment — thereby making a blurred and confused mix out of different notions such as natural selection , artificial selection , physical evolution and virtual evolution .
Which naturally raised the question of how do we control the Singularity and stop “ them ” from pushing us into extinction .
Chalmers ’ preferred solution is either to prevent the “ leaking ” of AI ++ into our world , or to select for moral values during the ( virtual ) evolutionary process .
Silly me , I thought that the easiest way to stop the threat of AI ++ would be to simply unplug the machines running the alleged virtual world and be done with them .
( Incidentally , what does it mean for a virtual intelligence to exist ?
How does it “ leak ” into our world ?
Like a Star Trek hologram gone nuts ? ) Then the level of unsubstantiated absurdity escalated even faster : perhaps we are in fact one example of virtual intelligence , said Chalmers , and our Creator may be getting ready to turn us off because we may be about to leak out into his / her / its world .
But if not , then we might want to think about how to integrate ourselves into AI ++ , which naturally could be done by “ uploading ” our neural structure ( Chalmers ’ recommendation is one neuron at a time ) into the virtual intelligence — again , whatever that might mean .
Finally , Chalmers — evidently troubled by his own mortality ( well , who is n’t ? ) — expressed the hope that A ++ will have the technology ( and interest , I assume ) to reverse engineer his brain , perhaps out of a collection of scans , books , and videos of him , and bring him back to life .
You see , he does n’t think he will live long enough to actually see the Singularity happen .
And that ’s the only part of the talk on which we actually agreed .
The reason I went on for so long about Chalmers ’ abysmal performance is because this is precisely the sort of thing that gives philosophy a bad name .
It is nice to see philosophers taking a serious interest in science and bringing their discipline ’s tools and perspectives to the high table of important social debates about the future of technology .
But the attempt becomes a not particularly funny joke when a well known philosopher starts out by deploying a really bad argument and ends up sounding more cuckoo than trekkie fans at their annual convention .
Now , if you will excuse me I ’ll go back to the next episode of Battlestar Galactica , where you can find all the basic ideas discussed by Chalmers presented in an immensely more entertaining manner than his talk .
This looks like a Ferrari Formula 1 car , but is made from £ 40,000 of designer clothing - and it goes at zero miles per hour .

Entre 2007 et 2009 , la part du peer - to - peer ( P2P ) est passée de près de 40 % à 18 % du trafic sur Internet , selon une étude du cabinet Arbor Networks , citée par Wired .
L'analyse s'appuie sur 264 milliards de gigaoctets de données , obtenues auprès de plus de cent fournisseurs d'accès du monde entier .
Parallèlement , le trafic sur le Web ( http ) , représenterait 52 % , contre 42 % deux ans plus tôt .
Faut - il y voir le déclin d'un système d'échanges de fichiers , qui depuis la fin des années 1990 , notamment avec le service Napster , est considéré par l'industrie musicale comme une menace ?
" Le piratage n'a ni diminué , ni augmenté durant ces dernières années " , analyse Patrick Waelbroeck , maître de conférences à l'Ecole nationale supérieure des télécommunications .
" Le P2P a simplement crû moins vite que d'autres applications " , explique - t- il .
MIGRATION VERS LE STREAMING
Pour expliquer le déclin de la part du peer - to - peer , l'étude d'Arbor Networks avance en effet la concurrence des services en streaming , tels que YouTube , Dailymotion ou Deezer .
Selon le magazine Informationweek , qui a également pu consulter l'étude , entre 25 % et 40 % du trafic Internet est désormais lié à la vidéo .
Aux Etats - Unis , la plate - forme de vidéo Hulu , née en 2007 , qui permet de voir directement des séries et des émissions de télévision , avec une bonne qualité , est particulièrement plébiscitée .
M. Waelbroeck note également une évolution similaire dans les pratiques musicales : " Ecouter de la musique est devenu une manière , parmi d'autres , de se divertir .
Beaucoup d'internautes écoutent des radio en ligne , et cela leur suffit : ils n'ont pas besoin de passer par les réseaux de peer - to - peer . "
Arbor Networks justifie également la baisse du P2P par la migration du téléchargement vers les services d'hébergement de fichiers , tels que Rapidshare et Megaupload .
" Les échanges physiques , via disques durs , ou copies de clés USB , n'entrent pas dans les statistiques " , souligne aussi l'universitaire .

When our leaders have no awareness of the disastrous consequences of their actions , they can claim ignorance and take no action .
Or when our leaders have no hard evidence as to what might happen in the future , they can at least claim uncertainty .
But when they have full knowledge of an impending disaster … they have proof of its inevitability in ANY scenario… and they so declare in their official reports … but STILL do n’t lift a finger to change course … then they have only one remaining claim :
INSANITY !
And , unfortunately , that ’s precisely the situation we ’re in today :
Three recently released government reports now point to fiscal doomsday for America ; and one of the reports , issued by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , says so explicitly :
The CBO paints two future scenarios for the U.S. budget deficit and the national debt .
But it plainly declares that fiscal disaster will strike in EITHER scenario .
Furthermore …
The CBO states that its fiscal disaster scenarios could cause severe economic declines for decades to come , including hyperinflation and destruction of retirement savings .
The CBO then proceeds to admit that even its worse - case scenario could be understated by a wide margin due to panic in the financial markets or vicious cycles that are beyond control .
Separately , in its Flow of Funds Report for the second quarter , the Federal Reserve provides irrefutable data that we are already beginning to witness the first of these consequences in the United States : an unprecedented cut - off of credit to businesses and consumers .
Meanwhile , the Treasury Department shows that America ’s fate remains , as before , in the hands of foreigners , with the U.S. still owing them $ 7.9 trillion !
And despite all this , neither Congress nor the Obama Administration have proposed a plan or a timetable for averting these doomsday scenarios .
Their sole solution is to issue more bonds , borrow more , and print more without restraint .
That is the epitome of insanity .
Yes , the great government bailouts of 2008 and 2009 have bought us some time … but they have promptly proceeded to sell us into bondage .
Yes , they have given us safe passage over tough seas … but only to throw our assets onto the global auction block for the highest bidders .
The one bright spot :
Unlike some governments , ours does not conceal the evidence of its folly .
Quite the contrary , the proof pours forth from these three government reports in relatively blunt language and unmistakably blatant numbers …
Report # 1
Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) :
The Long - Term Budget Outlook
The CBO opens with a chart predicting the most dramatic surge in government debt of all time .
It shows that even in proportion to the larger size of the U.S. economy today , the government debt has ALREADY surpassed the massive debt loads accumulated during World War I and the Great Depression … and will soon surpass even the massive debt load of World War II .
“ Large budget deficits , ” write the authors of the CBO report , would …
“ Reduce national saving , ” leading to …
“ More borrowing from abroad ” and …
Less domestic investment , ” which in turn would …
, ” which in turn would …
“ Depress income growth in the United States , ” and …
“ Seriously harm the economy . ”
Worse , on page 14 , the CBO warns that :
“ Lenders may become concerned about the financial solvency of the government and …
“ Demand higher interest rates to compensate for the increasing riskiness of holding government debt . ”
Plus…
“ Both foreign and domestic lenders may not provide enough funds for the government to meet its obligations . ”
The magnitude of the problem cannot be underestimated .
The CBO declares on page 15 that :
“ The systematic widening of budget shortfalls projected under CBO ’s long - term scenarios has never been observed in U.S. history ” and …
It will also be larger than the debt accumulations of any other industrialized nation in the post - World War II period , including Belgium and Italy , the two worst cases of all .
But the CBO admits that even these frightening projections may be grossly understated because :
“ The analysis omitted the pressures that a rising ratio of debt to GDP would have on real interest rates and economic growth . ”
“ The growth of debt would lead to a vicious cycle in which the government had to issue ever - larger amounts of debt in order to pay ever - higher interest charges . ”
“ More government borrowing would drain the nation ’s pool of savings , reducing investment ” and …
“ Capital would probably flee the United States , further reducing investment . ”
But none of these are factored into the analysis .
On page 17 of its report , the CBO writes …
“ The analysis … does not incorporate the financial markets ’ reactions to a fiscal crisis and the actions that the government would adopt to resolve such a crisis .
Because [ our ] textbook growth model is not forward - looking , the analysis assumes that people will not anticipate the sustainability issues facing the federal budget ; as a result , the model predicts only a gradual change in the economy as federal debt rises .
“ In actuality , the economic effects of rapidly growing debt would probably be much more disorderly as investors ’ confidence in the nation ’s fiscal solvency began to erode .
If foreign investors anticipated an economic crisis , they might significantly reduce their purchases of U.S. securities , causing the exchange value of the dollar to plunge , interest rates to climb , and consumer prices to shoot up .

Report # 2
U.S. Federal Reserve :
Flow of Funds Accounts
of the United States
The Fed ’s data on page 12 tells it all :
The impact on the U.S. credit markets is not just a future scenario .
It ’s happening right now .
Yes , the government is getting its money to finance its exploding deficits ( for now ) .
But it ’s hogging all the available supplies , while American businesses and average consumers are getting shut out or even shoved out .
Specifically …
In the first half of last year , the U.S. Treasury raised funds at the annual pace of $ 411 billion in the first quarter and $ 310 billion in the second quarter .
But if you think that was a lot , consider this : THIS year , the Treasury has stepped up its pace of borrowing to annual rates of $ 1.443 TRILLION in the first quarter and $ 1.896 TRILLION in the second quarter .
That ’s 3.5 times and over SIX TIMES MORE than last year ’s , respectively .
Meanwhile , the private sector is getting killed …
Last year , banks provided new credit at the annual pace of $ 472.4 billion in the first quarter and $ 86.7 billion in the second .
This year , they ’re not providing ANY new credit — they ’re actually LIQUIDATING loans at the rate of $ 857.2 billion in the first quarter and $ 931.3 billion in the second .
So if you ’re running a business , you may want to think twice before asking your bank for more money .
Instead , they may decide to TAKE BACK the money they ’ve already loaned you !
Ditto for mortgages .
Last year , mortgages were being created at the annual clip of $ 522.5 billion and $ 124 billion in the first and second quarters , respectively .
This year , on a net basis , mortgages have n’t been created at all .
Quite the contrary , the Fed reports that , on a net basis , they ’ve been liquidated at an annual pace of $ 39.3 billion in the first quarter and $ 239.5 billion in the second .
Getting cash out of credit cards and other consumer credit is even tougher .
Last year , folks were able to add to their consumer credit at annual rates of $ 115 billion and $ 105 billion in the first two quarters .
This year , in contrast , they ’ve been forced to CUT back on their credit at annual rates of $ 95.3 billion in the first quarter … and at an even faster pace in the second quarter — $ 166.8 billion .
Never before in my lifetime have I witnessed a more severe case of crowding out in the credit markets !
And never before has the CBO been so right in its forecasts of fiscal doomsday :
One of its dire forecasts was already coming true even before it issued its report .
Report # 3
U.S. Treasury Department :
Treasury Bulletin
Each and every month , the Treasury reminds us of the single fact that no one in the Treasury wants to face :
The U.S. is deep in debt to the rest of the world , and on page 48 , it provides the evidence : total liabilities to foreigners of $ 7,898,435 million ( nearly $ 7.9 trillion ) !
This is n’t a new record .
It was actually slightly more last year .
But the fact is NOTHING has been done to reduce our debt to foreigners .
Quite the contrary , it is the deliberate policy of our government to pile up more — to sell foreign investors and central banks on the idea that they must continue to lend us money .
The fact that this could potentially put our nation into deeper jeopardy is overlooked .
And the dire forecast by the CBO that foreign investors might pull the plug is pooh - poohed .
Good luck and God bless !

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Procter & Gamble
Co is voluntarily recalling about 120,000 bottles of Vicks Sinex nasal spray after finding the bacteria B. cepacia in a small amount of the product made at its plant in Gross Gerau , Germany , and sold in the United States .
While no illnesses have been reported , the bacteria could cause serious infections for an individual with a compromised immune system or a chronic lung condition such as cystic fibrosis , P&G said .
So far , the problem appears to be limited to a single batch of raw material mixture involving three lots of product sold in the United States , Germany and the United Kingdom , where the company is recalling the product , P&G said .
P&G said it found the bacteria in a small amount of product from a lot sold in the United States .
It is testing the U.K. and German lots that were produced from the same batch of raw material mixture .
The three lots account for about 120,000 bottles of product , a spokesman said .
Last year , P&G sold 4.4 million bottles of the spray in the United States alone , he added .
The U.S. recall involves lot 9239028831 of Vicks Sinex Vapospray 12 - Hour Decongestant Ultra Fine Mist .
In the United Kingdom , lot 9224028832 of Vicks Sinex Micromist Aqueous Nasal Spray Solution is being recalled .
In Germany , lot 9224028833 of Wick Sinex Schnupfenspray Dosiersystem is being recalled .
The bottles are 15 milliliters in all three markets .
P&G said consumers who have the product should discard it and can call the company for a replacement coupon or refund .
The recall comes just a few weeks after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned P&G about the marketing of other Vicks products , its DayQuil and NyQuil products with vitamin C .
Shares of Cincinnati - based P&G fell 1 percent to $ 61.81 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
In yesterday ’s post , something I said … provoked some strong reactions .
I wrote that the fundamental difference between most commentary on the left and commentary on the right , is as follows :
Commentary from media outlets and personalities on the left , such as Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow , consists primary of opinions , backed up by facts , and infused with passion … with the intention of inciting the passions of their viewers to act on the aforementioned facts and opinions .
This , I called “ activism . ”
Commentary from media outlets and personalities on the right , such as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly , consists primary of opinions , backed up by misinformation / disinformation , and infused with passion … with the intention of inciting the passions of their viewers to act on the aforementioned misinformation and opinions .
This , I called “ propaganda . ”
Some insist that this assessment reflects an opinion .
Some attempted to explain that which side is in possession of facts is subject to interpretation .
But see , that ’s the funny thing about facts … they are facts REGARDLESS of what my opinion my be .
In truth , they are facts with no regard for who speaks them , or for who believes them .
I will explain , as I believe that there exists in this country a fundamental misconception regarding “ fact ” and “ opinion . ”
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE :
If I say that the sun is a near - perfect , non-solid ( plasmatic ) sphere , consisting primarily of hydrogen and helium … that is a FACT .
It is a fact , because it is supported by a wealth of evidence , stemming from extensive research .
This would be a fact if Keith Olbermann said it …or if Rush Limbaugh said it .
It would be a fact even if I did n’t like Keith Olbermann or Rush Limbaugh and they said it .
It would be a fact even if nobody accepted it …in fact , for a prolonged period of human history , this was either “ not known ” or “ not accepted , ” but this did n’t make it any less true , or any less a fact .
If you say that the sun ( we ’re assuming you ’re not speaking metaphorically ) is a giant flashlight , that God turns on in the morning and off in the evening … that is FALSE .
It would be just as false if Keith or Rush said it …and just as false even if everyone agreed with you .
You might even offer up facts to support the claim : “ It is bright and emits light , like a flashlight … and it is dark at night and bright in the day . “
It should be obvious , however , that these facts do not make the end assertion and more true or and less false .
It is still … not a FACT .
If I say that God made the sun …that is an OPINION .
I can list any facts I wish to support this , but as it is completely impossible for the statement to be proven true or false , it will remain in the realm of opinion .
I might as well have said that “ the sun is good ” or that “ the sun is stupid . “
These value judgments similarly express opinions , and no amount of “ proving my case ” will change that .
Similar to facts , the opinions do not gain any merit based on who utters them , nor based on how many people share them .
A MORE COMPLEX , AND CURRENTLY RELEVANT EXAMPLE :
If I say that America tortured detainees through the use of waterboarding … that is a FACT .
It is a fact , because it is supported by a wealth of evidence .
It is documented and admitted that we waterboarded detainees , and waterboarding meets every available definition of torture , whether we are looking at Webster ’s Dictionary , at our own federal law , or at international treaty language .
This would be true if Keith said it or if Rush said it .
It would be true even if not one single American believed it .
If you say that waterboarding was performed legally … that is FALSE .
Whether or not the President approved it , or Department of Justice attorneys approved it … they do not make federal law ( only Congress has that power ) and they do not interpret the law ( only the courts have that power ) .
Waterboarding is torture , by all available definitions and it is clearly forbidden according to our federal law and the international treaties that we have entered into .
Keith or Rush could make any statements they wished to to justify it …it would still be illegal and false to say otherwise .
Any facts regarding it ’s efficacy ( or lack thereof ) , it ’s intended use to “ make us safer , ” or of the threat presented by a particularly detainee … would do nothing to render this statement any more true , or any less false .
It is still … not a FACT .
If I say that torturing detainees is un-American … that is an OPINION .
I can cite any Christian or historical objections I may have , I may mention that it is an illegal act , but in the end I am making a value judgment which can not be proven true or false .
This will remain an opinion regardless of whether Keith or Rush speaks it …regardless of how we feel about those speakers … regardless of how many people agree or disagree with it .
THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT :
So , when I say that Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow use facts upon which they base opinions , this is a statement which does not reflect my views of them nor their opinions .
The facts which they employ , and which I have extensively researched , would be facts even if they were not the people uttering them .
They would be facts even if I disliked Keith and Rachel…even if I did not believe what they were saying was true .
Now , that being said … they use these facts to formulate opinions , and those opinions I do not always agree with .
That ’s to be expected … I may disagree with their opinions … but disagreeing with the facts upon which they form those opinions would be pointless , and indeed , foolish .
In much the same way , when I say that Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , and Bill O’Reilly use misinformation and falsehoods to form their opinions , this is ALSO a statement which does not reflect on my views of the speakers nor their opinions .
The falsehoods which they employ , and which I have extensively researched , would be false no matter who spoke them .
They would be false regardless of my feelings towards Limbaugh , Beck , and O’Reilly … false whether I liked or disliked them , agreed or disagreed with them .
Sometimes , as with the “ flashlight ” example above , these individuals will use facts to attempt to “ prove ” their false statements … but as in the “ flashlight ” example , these facts do not make their statements any less false .
That being said … since it is these falsehoods which they use to form their opinions , I am most likely to disagree with their opinions .
The falsehoods themselves , being false , do not require my “ agreement ” nor “ disagreement “ … but the opinions based upon those statements ARE subject to judgment , and will likely only be agreed with by those who either do not require that opinions be based on facts , or those who do not know that their falsehoods do not represent facts .
To people who do not value the truth , or who cannot tell falsehood from truth , or who cannot separate statements of fact from statements of opinion … their lives AND OPINIONS are at the mercy of any speaker who knows how to capture their interest and how to speak to their fears and prejudices .
Sadly … about one quarter of Americans fit this description , and even more tragically they ’re not reading this right now … they ’re listening to Rush or watching FOX .
BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP , N.J. — Conservative groups plan to rally tomorrow near a New Jersey school where students performed a song celebrating President Barack Obama .
The planned rally has school district officials planning to beef up security at the B. Bernice Young School in Burlington Township , which houses kindergartners through second - graders .
The song drew national attention last month after a video of the performance was posted on YouTube .
Conservatives say it shows how schoolchildren are being indoctrinated to idolize Obama , allegations school officials have denied .
The Obama song initially was performed during a Black History Month assembly in February and was repeated in March when author Charisse Carney - Nunes , who wrote the children ’s book “ I Am Barack Obama , ” visited the school .
Someone apparently with Carney - Nunes videotaped that performance and posted it at the author ’s Web site without the approval of school officials .
A copy of that video appeared in September on YouTube , titled “ School Kids Taught to Praise Obama . ”
Citing concerns for the safety of students and staff , Superintendent Christopher Manno has asked organizers to reconsider the protest because classes will be held that day .
Manno said protesters will not be allowed on school property and additional district staffers will be on hand .
Bill Haney , a rally organizer , said members of several groups would take part in the protest , although it was not clear Sunday how many people would be involved .
“ Consider this a protest to squelch this trend to politicize our youth , ” organizers said in a prepared statement .
“ We are supporting the constitutional rights of our children and protest against the progressive social agenda promoted by the New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association . ”
It was a bizarre cat - and - mouse game , played on Sunday across scores of makeshift billboards in New York .
One group of artists and activists spread across Lower Manhattan , transforming innumerous wheat - pasted posters  the ones that readily sprout over scaffolding  into their own canvas .
They would whitewash the posters and then create their own work , or allow anti-advertising advocates to spread their own messages .
But just as quickly as they whitewashed and put up art , workers arrived to put up new posters where the artists had obscured the old ones .
Documentary film - maker Kirby Dick ( " This Film is Not Yet Rated " ) has just released his latest doc , " Outrage , " about anti-gay politicians who are secretly gay .
These are the twisted lawmakers who campaign against gay rights in public , but who are , in fact , gay ( and who generally enjoy the rights they 're publicly against , thanks to their power and privilege ) .
An official selection of the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival , OUTRAGE investigates the hidden lives of some of the country 's most powerful policymakers – from now - retired Idaho Senator Larry Craig , to former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevy – and examines how these and other politicians have inflicted damage on millions of Americans by opposing gay rights .
Equally disturbing , the film explores the mainstream media 's complicity in keeping those secrets , despite the growing efforts to " out " them by gay rights organizations and bloggers .
Through a combination of archival news footage and exclusive interviews with politicians and members of the media , OUTRAGE probes the psychology of a double lifestyle , the ethics of outing closeted politicians , and the double standards that the media upholds in its coverage of the sex lives of gay public figures .
As Barney Frank , perhaps the best - known openly gay member of Congress explains , " There is a right to privacy , but not a right to hypocrisy .
It is very important that the people who make the law be subject to the law . "
An international study of more than 17,000 people with schizophrenia has found striking similarities in symptoms , medication , employment and sexual problems , despite the fact that it covered a diverse range of patients and healthcare systems in 37 different countries .
The research , published in the November issue of IJCP , provides a valuable international profile of the mental health disorder , which is estimated to affect as many as one in every 250 people at some point in their lives .
Schizophrenia is the fifth leading cause of years lost through disability in men and the sixth leading cause in women .
" The Worldwide - Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes study ( W - SOHO ) was a three - year observational study designed to assess costs and outcomes in outpatients using antipsychotics " says lead author Dr Jamie Karagianis from Eli Lilly Canada Inc .
" It has enabled us to build up a valuable international picture of the demographics and treatment of schizophrenia across ten European countries and 27 countries from East Asia , Latin America , North Africa and the Middle East .
" Minimal selection criteria were applied by the 1,563 clinicians who took part to ensure that the patients were representative of those receiving treatment in actual clinical practice settings across the world .
" Baseline data on the 17,384 patients - who were all starting or changing their antipsychotic medication – showed that they had an average age of 38 and 57 % were male .
Median duration of their illness was seven years and one in ten were receiving antipsychotic medication for the first time .
" On average , 19 % were in paid employment , 69 % were living in dependent housing and 62 % had reported sexual problems in the previous month .
" Although there were some regional and country variations , on the whole the study provided a strikingly similar overall pattern when it came to key health , medication and socio- economic factors . "
Patients were assessed at baseline and at three , six , 12 , 18 , 24 and 36 months .
All clinicians taking part in the study were free to determine what treatment and medication their patients received and no drugs were provided by the study sponsor .
Key findings of the W - SOHO survey included :
26 % of the study participants were taking more than one antipsychotic and about 74 % were taking other prescribed drugs at the same time .
10 % were taking antipsychotics for the first time .
The key reasons for changing medication were the same across all the regions surveyed , with two - thirds of the investigators citing lack of effectiveness , followed by intolerance , patient request and incomplete adherence to the medication .
Just over 34 % of patients had been admitted to an inpatient facility because of their schizophrenia in the last six months .
With the exception of the Latin American region ( 40.8 % ) all the other regions showed very similar rates , ranging from 31.2 % to 36.3 % .
Sexual dysfunction averaged 61.5 % .
With the exception of East Asia ( 33.5 % ) , the other regions reported similar levels ranging from 57.9 % to 67 % .
The CGI - SCH scores ( used to measure the severity of the illness ) were remarkably similar , with an overall average of 4.4 and regional scores ranging from 3.9 to 4.7 .
The positive score averaged 3.9 , negative score 4.0 , depressive score 3.4 and cognitive score 3.7 .
Just under 26 % of the patients had ever attempted suicide , with regional scores ranging from 21.7 % to 30.1 % .
Paid employment status was similar , averaging 19 % and ranging from 16.2 % to 22.6 % .
Just under a third of patients ( 32.1 % ) were in a relationship , ranging from 25.1 % to 38.6 % in five of the six regions .
People in East Asia were much more likely to be in a relationship ( 47.4 % ) than anywhere else .
" There has been considerable debate about whether developed and developing countries display different outcomes when it comes to schizophrenia and 21 of the 37 countries in our study are emerging or developing economies " says Dr Karagianis .
" Despite being drawn from a variety of economies , cultures and practice settings , the patients who took part in the W - SOHO study were remarkably similar across the six regions in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics .
However , there were also important differences noted in some areas and these differences have as much relevance to clinical practice as the similarities observed .
" We hope that this study will help to build up a clearer picture of schizophrenia and its treatment across the world .
One thing that is very clear from our study is that this mental health disorder has a profound impact on the lives of people , irrespective of geographical borders . "
The regions , countries and patient numbers included in the study were :
Central and Eastern Europe – Czech Republic ( 477 ) , Hungary ( 189 ) , Lithuania ( 100 ) , Poland ( 599 ) , Romania ( 136 ) , Russia ( 159 ) , Slovakia ( 301 ) , Slovenia ( 214 )
Northern Europe – Denmark ( 31 ) , France ( 915 ) , Germany ( 2,869 ) , Ireland ( 53 ) , Netherlands ( 160 ) , UK ( 263 )
Southern Europe – Greece ( 690 ) , Italy ( 2,869 ) , Israel * ( 76 ) , Portugal ( 166 ) , Spain ( 1,987 ) * included in this category because of similar ethnicity , economy and healthcare systems
Latin America – Argentina ( 349 ) , Chile ( 152 ) , Colombia ( 197 ) , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras pooled ( 267 ) , Mexico ( 1,019 ) , Peru ( 96 ) , Puerto Rico ( 217 ) , Venezuela ( 269 )
North Africa and the Middle East – Algeria ( 300 ) , Egypt ( 183 ) , Turkey ( 662 ) , Saudi Arabia ( 196 )
East Asia – Korea ( 821 ) , Malaysia ( 105 ) , Taiwan ( 297 ) .

The war of the Clouds has already begun .
As more and more Enterprise , personal apps choose to go online , Cloud is getting richer , more powerful and impact ?
Every other day we see a new cloud service coming up .
There are 100s of Cloud services that let you host your apps on their Servers with a highly scalable architecture , and High availability ( Practically five 9s of uptime ) , all that at a fraction of cost of ownership .
Without getting into detail of stuff you , probably , already know , let ’s give a look at comparing the cloud Computing services from industy ’s leaders .
Let ’s compare : Google`s App Engine vs. Microsoft`s Windows
Azure , back to back , feature by feature :
Language Support :
At this year ’s PDC , when Microsoft talked about Windows Azure , the announcement came with a surprise that blew everyone away : Support for .NET ( C# and Visual Basic ) , C++ , PHP , Ruby , Python , Java .
On the other hand , Google App Engine does only Java and Python , atleast at this time .
Programming languages is not the only restriction in GAE .
Another restriction is that you get only Servlets , JSPs , you ca n’t host EJB based Apps .
Now that ’s not good !
Winner : Azure
Application Types
Azure offers two different kinds of application models : Web Roles and Worker Roles .
Web roles are your typical request / response HTTP paradigm similar to GAE ’s Web based Request model .
More interesting is the Worker role that adds processing and logic that does not need to be triggered via a web request , rather , run Natively on the system as Service / process .
This gives you the ability to run background tasks and opens up a whole raft of application possibilities .
On the contrary , limited stuff can be achieved in AppEngine using Cron Jobs or via Java / Python based application schedulers .
In GAE , it would go like this :
The Cron job needs to ping a URL which executes a task , but that task is limited by the request timeout .
Basically you have 30 seconds to finish processing while Azure can run for hours on a single task .
May be , this is not the best example as it ’s asynchronous but I know you got the point .
Winner : Azure
Development / Ease of Migration
Both of them provide a secure access , abstract from the underlying OS , hence both prohibit system level access like Files , Sockets , etc .
This introduces an additional step for the the developers to make sure they run independently .
Like Microsoft quoted “ give us your application in USB drive that can run with . bat file ”
Both cloud services offer a number of plugins for IDEs to make application development and deployment easy .
Microsoft wants developers to automate the deployment from a bat file or any Windows native runnable , on the contrary , Google gives you Deployment descriptors for directly deploying into the Webserver .
Because of this , people would argue that GAE is simpler when it comes to application deployment .
What ’s more important is to emulate the GAE and Azure system offline .
Developing an application anywhere , anytime for the cloud is a key enabler .
Though , both of them claim to be competitive , but in my experience I found AppEngine Emulator works 99 % cases , Azure misbehaves , sometimes .
Winner : AppEngine slightly better than Azure
Integration with Other Apps
Google will let you use all your Google Apps ( Accounts , Docs , Gmail , IM etc )
Pre-integrated with the service at almost no hassle .
With this comes integrated email , XMPP IM at zero cost .
Azure looks pretty cool , on this too .
Microsoft claims that it will integrate well with SharePoint , SQL server , outlook and all other apps that Microsoft has to offer .
Of course , you will have to purchase them .
Winner : - Tie -
Customized solutions
Another important point of consideration is “ How customizable the solution is ” .
What we actually mean is : apart from the default webserver / database can we choose any other ?
Yes in Azure , No in AppsEngine .
Azure will let you run a different database and webserver of choice but Google restrains you to their proprietary solution .
I know Google ’s solution is awesome but what if my application is written in such a way that it needs AppServer like Weblogic and an Oracle database ?
Winner : Azure
Performance
We are not comparing the hardware both clouds have to offer , ofcourse both of them are good .
Rather we are comparing the services that come built - in for High performance , distributed applications .
AppEngine offers distributed caching using Memcache .
I heard Azure plans to include Velocity .
Otherwise , if you only have one web instance you can use ASP.
NET caching .
If you have multiple web instances , then you need a way to invalidate the other server ’s cache .
Inter - role communication is coming soon which would make this possible .
Winner : Hard to compare
Scalability
Azure claims
High scalability , but is yet unproven in this area and would remain so until we see their service Officially launched , next year .
On the Google ’s front , web is the proof that GAE would not hold up against traffic of a serious or sustained nature .
Concerns with CPU and storage limitations , caching , database immutability plus one way in and out ( via the Google API ) .
In GAE the app automatically scales .
In Azure you need to change the config to add new web or worker role instances .
For few this is more painful as it requires more monitoring and it ’s also harder to write worker roles that balance effectively especially since in code you ca n’t tell how many are running .
Of course we will have to wait and see how Azure stacks up in this regard practically , so it ’s pretty impossible to compare both technologies at this time .
Winner : - Tie -
Storage
Azure offers a few different storage options including Table Storage that leverages the ADO.
NET Data Services Framework to get the job done .
GAE encourages Persistence and “ soft schema ” based large tables which are able to achieve High performance using auto - partitioning approach .
On the bad side , GAE blobs are stored in the regular data store and are limited to 1MB .
Azure supports 50 GB blobs .
Which is something serious .
Winner : - Tie - ( Both have advantages , flaws )
Cost of Ownership
Though official packages and plans are n’t out for Azure , but there ’s one thing we know of for sure :
It ’s definitely not free .
Google gives you a fairly capacitive Engine for free and of course to scale higher , you need to pay an affordable amount .
Google offers a decent resource utilization ( CPU and bandwidth ) that can serve 5 million pageviews for an average application .
For free account , AppEngine restricts total storage to be less than 500 mb .
But I believe 5 million transactions capacity would be enough for small enterprise or a self - hosted developer webapp .
From what we have learned from the past , there ’s no doubt Google ’s pricing are much more competitive than Microsoft can ever think of .
Credit goes to Open Source .
Winner : AppEngine
Verdict
Google ’s offering is fairly proven and competitive when it comes down to prices , scalability and performance .
But when it comes to application / language support , Azure takes a big lead .
At this point of time , Google is not targeting to serve just - any - other business but rather a “ niche of Enterprises , developers ” that rely on Python , Java web applications based on simple servlets , JSPs with decent persistence mechanisms .
Microsoft has really done a great job at expanding the horizon to a wider scope .
I definitely applaud them for this achievement but it all nails down to one concern :
Would you host your IT Business at the mercy of Windows Servers ?
You have to decide !

Drag the Mayan symbols below to change the date .
, each about 394 years long .
In three years , a newcycle will begin .
Gold is proving its resilience as the dollar declines .
The yellow metal continues to break price records , and is on track to hit $ 2,000 an ounce as demand outstrips supply .
With world banks likely to follow India ’s recent landmark purchase , and opt for precious metal assets over the greenback , mining companies , gold funds and gold producers are promising investment vehicles for those hoping to capitalize on gold ’s wild ride .
See the following article from Money Morning for more on this .
![ filekey = |4868| align=|right| caption=|| alt=|gold growth| ]
Gold has surged 60 % in the past 12 months and it ’s not letting up .
The “ yellow metal ” is continuing that scorching surge into the last part of the year , establishing new highs on a near - daily basis .
In fact , gold established yet another record price Wednesday when it peaked at $ 1,153.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) .
And the records are going to keep on coming .
With the U.S. dollar in a freefall and global gold demand rising , analysts say the precious metal will likely continue its bullish trend through at least the first half of 2010 .
It could rise as high as $ 2,000 an ounce , which would represent a 73 % gain from current record levels .
“ Everything is pointing to the price of gold going higher , ” Mike Sander , an investment adviser at Seattle - based Sander Capital Advisors , wrote in an e-mailed report .
And “ a whopping budget deficit continuing to balloon , a Federal Reserve in no place of raising rates , and central banks all over the world diversifying away from the dollar , ” will be the main catalysts for gold ’s continued rise , he said .
Indeed , the U.S. Federal Reserve ’s loose monetary policy has put the dollar under duress .
The central bank has pumped more than $ 2 trillion into the U.S. economy since the financial crisis began more than two years ago .
It has lowered its benchmark Federal Funds rate to a record - low range of 0%- 0.25 % and it has stepped up purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage - backed securities .
More recently , the return of investor risk appetite and the widespread belief that the Fed will have to keep its stimulus measures in place as the U.S. economy struggles out of a long and deep recession have put downward pressure on the greenback .
The dollar tumbled about 20 % against the euro in the past year , and the Dollar Index – which measures the greenback against the euro and five other currencies – fell to a 15 - month low of 74.679 on Monday and was retesting that low as of Wednesday .
With the dollar in freefall , central banks and hedge funds have sought shelter in hard assets , particularly gold .
That ’s a big reason why gold has experienced such a remarkable run this year .
“ You have to consider the amount of money sloshing around the world right now – China ’s $ 2.2 trillion in reserves , India ’s $ 285 billion in reserves , all of the money in central banks throughout the Middle East , ” said Martin Hutchinson , a contributing editor for Money Morning and a veteran banker with more than two decades experience in the international marketplace .
“ If all of the serious money charges into gold and gold really gets going , you ’ll see a tremendous spike in prices . ”
Concludes Hutchinson : “ I believe the price of gold will hit $ 2,000 an ounce next year . ”
Such steep run-ups have happened before .
From 1978 to 1980 , for instance , gold soared from $ 185 an ounce to $ 850 an ounce , Hutchinson recalls .
Interest rates were about 10 % at that time .
Credit is much easier to get today .
“ Right now , the cost of borrowing money and investing in gold is virtually zero , ” Hutchinson said .
How Global Demand Will Drive Gold to $ 2,000
Indeed , the bull - run in gold is already well underway , and it ’s picking up steam .
Prices actually began their most recent rally when the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) earlier this month revealed that it sold 200 metric tons of gold to the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) from Oct. 19 to Oct. 30 .
The RBI paid $ 6.7 billion for the 200 metric tons of the yellow metal – the equivalent of about 8 % of the world ’s annual mine production .
The move surprised many analysts , as India for the past 15 years had largely neglected its gold reserves .
India ’s gold holdings peaked at 20 % of its foreign exchange reserves – all the way back in 1994 .
Since that time , India ’s gold holdings had fallen :
Indeed , prior to the central bank purchase , India ’s gold holdings had dropped to just 3.6 % of the nation ’s estimated $ 285.5 billion in foreign reserves .
Little wonder that last month ’s gold purchase nearly doubled India ’s holdings , which now stand at 558 metric tons , or 6.2 % of the nation ’s forex reserves .
India ’s gold holdings as a percentage of foreign reserves are now higher than even China ’s .
The People ’s Bank of China ( BOC ) holds about 1,054 metric tons of gold , equal to roughly 2 % of its $ 2.3 trillion in foreign currency reserves .
Asia ’s third - largest economy now has the world ’s 10th - largest gold reserve , behind Russia , which has about 568 metric tons .
“ Our Reserve Bank decided to buy some gold .
I think about 400 tonnes .
That ’s normally something we do from time to time .
The IMF wanted to sell gold and we wanted to buy gold , ” Pranab Mukherjee , India ’s finance minister , said in an interview with the Financial Times .
However , analysts have been far less flippant about the purchase .
Timothy Green , the author of “ The Ages of Gold , ” described India ’s purchase to Bloomberg News as “ the biggest single central - bank purchase that we know about for at least 30 years in such a short period . ”
“ The only comparable event was the U.S. ’s steady purchases in the 1930s and 1940s , ” he said .
Analysts believe India ’s highly publicized purchase – which was made when prices were near record highs – will spawn a chain reaction in which other countries and investors ramp up their gold purchases .
“ This is a landmark trade , ” Jonathan Spall , a director at Barclays Capital ( NYSE ADR : BCS ) and a gold specialist , told the FT .
“ Central banks are conservative institutions and India ’s move is a sign for other central banks and sovereign wealth funds that were contemplating buying gold . ”
The IMF said in September that it would sell 403.3 metric tons of the metal to shore up its finances and increase its ability to lend at reduced rates to low - income countries .
And with 203.3 metric tons still on sale at the IMF , do n’t be surprised if China decides to bulk up on gold , too .
China , the world ’s sixth - largest holder of gold , has increased its yellow - metal reserves by 76 % since 2003 .
But the 1,054 metric tons it now holds is equal in value to just 2 % of its world - record $ 2.3 trillion in total reserves .
“ It is but a matter of time until China and the IMF announce much of the same , ” Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of The Gartman Letter , told Bloomberg .
Worldwide demand for gold is clearly on the upswing .
However , just as that ’s happening , supply and production of the precious metal are falling .
Annual worldwide mine production of gold has decreased by nearly 8 % since 2001 , even as the price of gold has tripled .
Meanwhile , investment demand for gold remained very strong – surging 46 % in the second quarter of 2009 from a year ago , according to the World Gold Council .
“ Everyone who says that gold will hit $ 2,000 in five years is wrong , ” said Money Morning ’s Hutchinson .
“ It will be back down in 5 years .
If it ’s going to $ 2,000 it will get there next year . ”
“ It will turn around when [ central banks ] start taking monetary policy seriously , and they wo n’t do that in a hurry , ” he added .
“ Gold ’s bull run is a bubble , just like all the other bubbles .
Except this is more of a bang than a bubble , because it ’s taking place so quickly . ”
Four Ways to Play Gold
1. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( NYSE : GDX ) : Gold miners benefit disproportionately from a rise in the price of gold , because their production costs are fixed .
This means that miners are a more - leveraged way to play gold than the metal itself , particularly since surging speculative demand can increase mining companies ’
Price / Earnings ( P/E ) ratios .
2. SPDR Gold Shares ETF ( NYSE : GLD ) : GLD holds more than 1,000 ounces of gold , and has a market capitalization of $ 39 billion .
As an investment , GLD is more convenient than buying gold bars directly .
The fund ’s share price fluctuates in concert with the price of gold .
3. Barrick Gold Corp. ( NYSE : ABX ) : Barrick is the largest and financially strongest gold producer , with a market capitalization of $ 43 billion , reserves of 124.6 million ounces of gold ( plus copper and silver ) , and operations in North America , South America , Australasia and Africa .
4. Yamana Gold Inc. ( NYSE : AUY ) : A growing gold producer with a $ 6.8 billion market capitalization that made an unexpectedly good profit in the fourth quarter of 2008 , Yamana is expanding both production and reserves ( currently 19.4 million ounces ) with operations in Canada and Latin America .
Its expansion magnifies the likely potential benefit from an increase in gold prices .

Just when you thought you ’d seen all the health - insurance evil possible , now comes another shocker : a UnitedHealth subsidiary in Colorado denied coverage to Peggy Robertson , mother of two , because she was n’t sterilized after her caesarian - section delivery procedure , according to a letter made public .
Almost 1/3 of all deliveries are done by c-section –meaning that in Colorado and likely elsewhere , fertile women are regularly denied coverage unless they agree to sterilize their wombs .
This comes after reports that a health insurance company considered rape to also be a “ pre-existing condition . ”
The meaning is clear : America ’s health insurance industry hates us all , and they hate fertile women most of all , if only because they represent two detestable Americans in one body .
In the letter , UnitedHealth ’s Colorado subsidiary tells Robertson that normally they would simply waive coverage on her womb for a period of three years following a c-section , but since Colorado banned pre-existing waivers , poor United Health had no choice but to deny the mother of two coverage of any sort [ full letter below , hat tip to eXiled Online reader Tyler ] :
In order to consider coverage without a rider , we require certain requirements to be met .
One requirement is that some form of sterilization has occurred since the caesarian section delivery .
Also , women age 40 or over , who had their last child two or more years prior to applying for coverage , will not require a rider .
The letter was dated 2007 – that same year , United Health profits rose to over $ 4 billion , on earnings of over $ 70 billion , pushing the company ’s Fortune 500 ranking up to number 21 from 37 in 2006 .
2007 was an interesting year for UnitedHealth on a lot of fronts : the SEC slapped a $ 468 million fine on the CEO , William McGuire , who created the UnitedHealth monster , for stock option fraud .
That may sound like a serious punishment until you realize that UnitedHealth gave McGuire a golden parachute retirement package worth $ 1.8 billion–on top of his 9 - figure annual pay packages .
This year , UnitedHealth was forced to pay $ 350 million to settle a class - action lawsuit after it was discovered that UnitedHealth used a rigged database designed to defraud American doctors and policyholders .
Watch Peggy Robertson explain how UnitedHealth is preventing her from having a third child here :
No wonder UnitedHealth denies coverage to rape victims and fertile mothers : UnitedHealth is the largest mass - rapist in America , why the Hell would it want to cover people for something they ’re doing every minute of every working hour ?
And who hates fertile wombs more than serial rapists ?
Golden Rule Insurance Letter — Sterilize or Die
While lying is never good , sometimes you dread a date so bad that you ’ll do anything to get out of it .
The only thing is that you do n’t want to be blunt and hurt their feelings .
Therefore , the best approach is to get out of it immediately and then deal with it later .
That means you hope they never ask you out again ; or they eventually get the idea .
Either way , desperate times call for desperate measures .
These are the 5 most polite ways to get out of a date that still allows them to claim some self - respect .
1. Illness
“ I ’m sick and it just suddenly came on . ”
Another classic is “ I was n’t feeling very well earlier but I kept hoping I would get better by tonight . ”
“ Can you hear how scratchy my voice is ? ”
Or “ my head is just pounding out of control with a migraine and it will only get better if I go to bed earlier . ”
Then end by saying “ I ’m really sorry but we ’re going to have to do it some other time . ”
Â
Then maybe the some other time wo n’t work out
2. Family Emergency
Another classic excuse that I myself have used a couple of times in order to get out of either a first or a repeat horrible date is by claiming there ’s a “ family emergency . ”
This is a great one because you can use it before the date comes to pick you up .
Or you can use it during the date by making sure that you have someone call you during your date so that you can answer it and make it look real .
That way you can exit if you must but still allow them some dignity .
Plus , they probably wo n’t ask you what happened because it ’s a personal problem that you do n’t want to share .
However , be prepared with a reason that ’s believable and difficult for them to verify .
3. Work Late
Thousands of men and women use the “ I have to work late ” excuse every year but it works .
This is a great excuse because if you have a job like mine it ’s very believable .
Or you can explain that someone was ill and left work immediately so you have to cover them .
Depending on what your job is , pick an excuse that fits your job .
But this can also backfire so be careful .
If you work at a place where they can drop by and you are n’t there when they drop by : Watch out or you ’re S.O.L .
Because if the date ends up bringing you dinner to the office and you ’re not there , you are going to look stupid and feel like a jerk .
Not to mention how the date will feel .
4. Rain Check
Just flat out say ” something came up and I need to take a rain check . ”
This is less detailed which allows you more flexibility than the other excuses .
They ca n’t really track or verify that something went wrong so this is a pretty safe bet .
Unless you run into the person later that night , then you played it safe because you never said exactly what reason you had to cancel the date .
Just that you needed a rain - check for a later date .
And if you so desire , never again .
5. Double Booked
One other tactic that you can try is to say that you did n’t realize you “ already had something going on . ”
Just make sure to mention you planned the other activity first and you ca n’t get out of it .
This can work wonders because even though you may not want to go out with this person and may just want to say to their face your ugly and I do n’t like you .
Remember how you handle the situation may influence whether a guy or girl asks you out .
If you did n’t want to go but got sucked into a date , do n’t worry these excuses can help get you out of it .
While lying is n’t good , it can get you out of a sticky situation like this .
Sometimes it is justified , particularly if you ’re asking married individuals .
These 5 excuses will give you the ability to get out of the date , and push off the inevitable fact at least temporarily that you do n’t want to say “ I ’m not interested . ”

The US believes that freedom of expression and political participation are universal values , Barack Obama told an audience of young Shanghai students today , in a townhall - style meeting streamed live on the White House website , broadcast on a local Shanghai television station and carried as text on a major Chinese portal .
The president tackled issues ranging from internet censorship and the US stance on arms sale to Taiwan to his Nobel Peace Prize , in his question - and - answer session with around 300 students – his sole meeting with the Chinese public during his three - day visit to the country .
But some expressed disappointment at the soft tone of many questions and said he should have addressed human rights violations in China more directly .
In brief opening remarks Obama repeated earlier assurances that America welcomed China 's rise adding : " Because of our co-operation , the US and China are more prosperous and more secure . "
But he went on to highlight differences between the two countries , telling his audience : " We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation .
" But we also do n't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation . "
" These freedoms of expression , and worship , of access to information and political participation – we believe they are universal rights .
They should be available to all people , including ethnic and religious minorities , whether they are in the United States , China or any nation . "
Asked about China 's great internet firewall Obama described himself as " a big supporter of non-censorship " and said criticism enabled by freedom of expression in the US made him a better president .
The president , who arrived in Shanghai late last night to begin the Chinese leg of his four - nation tour , answered questions from internet users and called at random on questioners in the audience – handpicked by officials at universities in the area .
Participants in such events are carefully briefed in advance on what they may ask .
China - watchers in the US have long encouraged their government to reach out to the Chinese public , as well as the country 's leaders .
But the lengthy negotiations required to arrange today 's town hall meetings – and the compromises required – are testament to the difficulties of doing so .
At one stage US officials considered ditching the event because of disagreements over the number of attendees – they initially wanted 1,000 present – and whether it would be broadcast live or not .
Campaigners have pushed hard for the president to speak out publicly on human rights issues .
Aides have already indicated that he will raise them in his meetings with Chinese leaders .
But Nicholas Bequelin , Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch , said Obama had missed an opportunity , framing such issues as a question of political culture rather than international legal norms .
" What 's important is to put a degree of pressure on the Chinese government for its repressive practices , " he said .
" You can not do that without a degree of straight talk .
That 's not what happened at this meeting …
What was needed was to include things relevant to what is happening in the country – as he did in Cairo , for example . "
For the most part , the president focused on a message of collaboration and mutual respect .
Many of the most sensitive issues mentioned in the thousands of questions posted ahead of the event – such as Tibet – did not emerge .
" There are very few global challenges that can be solved unless the US and China agree , " he told a questioner , citing the need to make progress on climate change .
" Other countries around the world will be waiting for us … If they say ' The US and China are not serious about this ' , they will not be serious either .
That 's the burden of leadership that both countries now carry . "
Obama 's acknowledgement yesterday that time had run out to secure a legally binding deal at Copenhagen and backed plans to postpone a formal agreement until next year at earliest .
But aides hope that the world 's two largest emitters can move closer on the way forward .
Obama is now on his way to Beijing for two days of talks with Hu and premier Wen Jiabao , which will also address North Korea and Iran 's nuclear programmes and the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He will also visit the Forbidden City and Great Wall .
Mo Shaoping , one of China 's best - known human rights lawyers , told the Financial Times that people " from the American side " had contacted him to see whether he would meet Obama and that he was subsequently questioned about the event by public security officers .
The US embassy said it had no knowledge of such a meeting .
Dozens of dissidents and activists have been detained ahead of his arrival , as is common with major visits .

Green Apple Books is donating 100 % of the profits from sales of Sarah Palin 's Going Rogue : An American Life to the Alaska Wildlife Alliance -- Green Apple blog
Did you think I was going to say toilet paper ?
Or birdcage liner ?
Something to do with animal waste in general or perhaps roadkill , moose droppings or Alaskan elk carcasses in particular ?
Well , I am not going to say that .
It 's just far too easy , and obvious , and does nothing to give either " Going Rogue " or the former VP candidate its / her proper respect , and , of course , by " respect " I mean quivering lamentable hellshot of blinding cerebral pain that makes you wince as though you 've just been smashed in the face with a hammer .
Here then , a far more artfully compiled list of things you can do with the former Alaska governor 's book -- or , as millions might say , " book " -- should you accidentally stumble across one in a trash bin somewhere , which is very likely indeed , given how it will surely be available in the remainder bin at Wal - Mart in about three weeks , and you can pick up an entire pallet for about five bucks and a dead chicken .
1 ) Compost .
Did you know most hardback books are nearly 100 percent compostable ?
That you could take that copy of " Going Rogue " you found in the dumpster at the Olive Garden , tear out all of its pages and mix them with the pile of rotting lettuce , taco drippings and bat guano in your back yard , let the maggots have at it , and create some nutrient - rich soil in which to grow your veggies ?
It 's true !
Nothing like taking the most inorganic substance known to man -- the tiny fundamentalist Republican mind -- and turning it back to nature .
SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING : Studies have shown that consuming foods grown using compost made from the pages of any book written by conservative politicians and / or Fox News pundits may result in bloating , brain damage , grammar mutilation and the mad desire to taxidermy your cat .
2 ) Gift wrap .
Imagine the surprise , the wonder , the fuzzy Christian bliss that will flood over your NRA - loving grandpa when you hand him his Christmas present this holiday , and he sees it 's been slathered all over with pages from the chapter about Sarah 's moose - hunting adventures , or how God is responsible for bringing Sarah her lug - nut of a husband .
Not only are you saving some trees by not using standard gift - wrap , your grandpa will probably be so deeply touched , he will likely run right out and shoot something large and antlered for you .
Joy to the world !
3 ) Insane person , donation to .
Perhaps you think insanity is sort of like Mexican food , the same ingredients remixed in different combinations .
You could not be more wrong .
Truly expert craziness -- the frothy spitting , the yelling at imaginary clowns , the walking sideways -- requires real work , years of honing and practice , just the right mix of phlegm , chemical imbalance and semi-coherent cultural referent .
What better gift for your local raving sociopath than a book chock full o' words that are already damn near incomprehensible to begin with ?
Toss a copy of " Going Rogue " to your favorite street maniac , watch his eyes turn flaming plaid with excitement , and wait for the fresh bout of inspired gibberish .
Fun for kids !
4 ) Masturbatory aid .
I do n't know , either .
But apparently it 's the perfect device to rub all over your naughty bits as you make a sex tape that 's about as genuinely dirty as watching salmon spawn .
( Note : Carrie Prejean only ) .
5 ) Iranian revolution , trigger for .
Right now , the last thing Iran 's cretinous leaders want is another pro-democracy uprising from the educated classes .
What better way for the U.S. to inspire a new round of violent unrest than by air - dropping hundreds of thousands of copies of " Going Rogue " all over the streets , each with a personal note saying , " With love , Ayatollah . "
Iranian citizens will be so insulted by this obvious effort to keep them ignorant and oppressed , a new bout of aggressive resistance is bound to be unleashed , leading to inevitable government overthrow .
Viva la revolucion !
6 ) Torture device .
A no -brainer , really .
Got a suspect in custody ?
A nasty Taliban leader hell - bent on undermining America 's love of shopping malls and sparkling vampires and free streaming porn ?
No problem .
Strap 'em down , gag 'em up , and watch their eyes widen in horror as you pull up a chair and begin reading .
" Going Rogue . "
It 's the new waterboarding !
7 ) Unruly child becalmer .
( Similar to above , only family friendly ) .
Got a kid who refuses go to bed ?
Wo n't stop screaming for another bedtime story ?
Whip out " Rogue " and threaten to read more words from " the scary bright - faced lady who talks like an encephalitic ferret who 's been smacked by a baseball bat and wo n't shut up . "
Your kids will pipe down in an instant .
8 ) FBI profile confuser .
Attention , conspiracy theorists :
Are sinister government agencies tracking your every move ?
Worried they know your habits and proclivities , your weird predilection for elaborate bunny masks and chain mail underwear and infrared video equipment ?
Salvation has arrived .
What better way to throw the FBI , CIA and black helicopters off your trail than by displaying a copy of " GR " prominently in your living room for all the satellite surveillance cameras to see ?
Watch as their interest in your disturbing personal behavior drops like a stone , as they realize you 're actually dumb as a pinecone and are therefore no threat whatsoever to the dominant paradigm of fear , sexual hysteria and sad cultural fetish for pathetic sparkling vampires who never have sex .
9 ) Cry for help .
Do not be at all surprised if , as you near the end of this book , you hear a knock on your door .
You open it only to find your two remaining friends and one family member standing there with some physical restraining devices , a large syringe of instant muscle relaxant and some heavyset dudes in white coats .
What 's this ?
An intervention ?
You 're worried about my well - being ?
My sanity ?
Get away from me !
I 'm fine !
No , no , no !
You 'll never take me !
Get away from my bunny masks !
What do you mean , a nice , long stay at a mental hospital for some " rest " ?
Nooooo !
Many years of drug / electroshock therapy later , you will hopefully awaken from your nightmare GOP fever dream , and thank them .
10 ) Apocalypse detector .
It has been widely rumored that HarperCollins secretly embedded a tiny sensor in the cover of thousands of copies of " GR " to be sold in various welfare states and Glenn Beck 's Elmo fetish dungeon .
When the Rapture is nigh , the sensors will cause Sarah 's breasts to glow bright red and start blinking furiously .
Soon after , the book will begin smoking , and quickly burst into flame .
Then Jesus will reappear , laugh hysterically , and with a friendly wink , whisk all fundamentalist Christians away to the great monster truck rally / moose hunting lodge in the sky .
Then the real peace on Earth begins .
Rejoice !

The media mogul Oprah Winfrey will end her daytime talk show , “ The Oprah Winfrey Show , ” in 2011 as she prepares to start a cable channel of her own .
Larry Downing / Reuters
A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey ’s production company , Harpo , confirmed Thursday evening that Ms. Winfrey would make an announcement on her show on Friday .
The plans were first reported by WABC , the ABC station in New York City .
“ The sun will set on the Oprah show as its 25th season draws to a close on Sept. 9 , 2011 , ” Tim Bennett , the president of Harpo , said in a message to affiliates .
After her broadcast talk show winds down , Ms. Winfrey will concentrate on her coming cable channel , OWN : The Oprah Winfrey Network .
OWN will have its premiere in January 2011 , according to a person with knowledge of Ms. Winfrey ’s decision who insisted on anonymity .
Ms. Winfrey , 55 , informed her talk show staff of her decision on Thursday afternoon .
The television world had expected that she would make a decision about the fate of her program by the end of the year .
Ms. Winfrey told her staffers that she will not transfer the show to cable .
She is expected to produce new programs for OWN , and may appear on some of them .
In a statement , CBS Television Distribution said , “ We have the greatest respect for Oprah and wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors .
We know that anything she turns her hand to will be a great success .
We look forward to working with her for the next several years , and hopefully afterwards as well . ”
OWN is a joint venture between her production company and Discovery Communications .
Getting the channel off the ground has proved challenging amid management turnover and an uncertain advertising climate .
The timeline for OWN will theoretically give Ms. Winfrey about nine months to promote her cable channel on her existing show .
Sometimes called the Queen of Talk , Forbes estimates Ms. Winfrey ’s net worth to be $ 2.7 billion .
“ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” is the most successful talk show in syndication , reaching about seven million viewers a day .
It has been vital to the success of ABC , whose local station group has been the primary home of the show since it started in syndication in 1986 .
Is Dubai the “ New Lehmans ” ?
Not quite , at least on the broad numbers .
Lehmans went down with debts of $ 500bn ; the disarray in Dubai looks like losing everyone involved about $ 80bn , certainly not much when set against the $ 2,700bn ( $ 2.7trillion ) of banking losses accumulated over this crisis .
But the blow to confidence , at a time when the world is trying to crawl out of the worst downturn in three quarters of a century , is far more grievous .
It has already shaken the stock markets ; the fear now gripping them has the potential to induce more panic and set back recovery by months , if not years .
That is prospect too horrible to contemplate .
Fortunately , we have had sufficient experience of financial crises to know precisely what needs to be done now ; swift , bold international action .
As with Iceland , the Ukraine , Hungary and many other states , Dubai can and should be saved .
The damage is containable .
Aid must come from Dubai ’s partners in the United Arab Emirates , especially oil - rich Abu Dhabi ; from the Gulf Cooperation Council , dominated by Saudi Arabia ; and from the IMF .
Abu Dhabi ’s sovereign wealth fund alone is worth about $ 700 bn , the biggest in the world .
So the funds are there to organise some sort of rescue ; the political will must be found .

If the rumours are to be believed , the British banking groups , as you might expect on their past record , are badly exposed to this latest mess , with the obvious potential for yet another substantial bill for the hard - pressed UK taxpayer .
So we are entitled to know how much the banks stand to lose in Dubai .
Early on in the credit crisis the G20 demanded transparency from the banks about the scale of their losses .
Openness might help calm the incipient panic building around the banks once again .
In any case , this is a harsh reminder that the credit crunch is far from over ; and the global financial system is only functioning at all because it is on life - support provided by governments and central banks .
Short of oil , Dubai attempted to create an artificial economy from reclaimed land and borrowed capital ; but it was unnatural , both economically and environmentally sense .
Grand as Palm Island and those imperious tower blocks appear , they are badly devalued collateral , a financial mirage .
As our banks are discovering , Dubai is simply sub - prime in the desert .
The fast food landscape in Saigon is dominated by KFC , a questionably finger lickin’ good American fried chicken import that can be found on every one of the city ’s major arteries .
KFC is incredibly popular with Vietnamese youths and the rising middle class because it represents modernity and Western tastes ( not to be confused with good taste ) .
The establishments are also spic and span , air conditioned and offer free parking and Wi-Fi—amenities that are becoming increasingly important to locals .
While I have n’t eaten at KFC in years , I ’m pretty sure the Original Recipe has n’t changed one bit since the last time I dug into a 10 - piece bucket .
District 3 ’s Su
Su restaurant specializes in cơm gà xối mỡ , a type of Vietnamese fried chicken that ’s loads better than the Colonel ‘s , but does n’t draw the kind of crowds and birthday parties it ought to .
I would most definitely rock the big 2 - 7 at Su Su if I were still in Saigon .
What ’s unique about Su Su ’s chicken is the style in which it is fried .
Hot grease is unleashed upon wings ( canh ) and thighs ( dui ) to order , and they ’re served dangerously piping .
The chicken is prepared al fresco , which causes the air outside the eatery to smell like an intoxicating brew of bubbling fat and seared spices .
This unique frying technique yields chicken with crispy skin and moist meat .
The fried chicken is served on a platter with a scoop of com do , a mild tomato - flavored rice , rau ram ( Vietnamese coriander ) and slices of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers .
There ’s also a savory dipping sauce made of drippings , soy sauce and garlic that really brings the chicken and rice up a couple of notches .
A minor tweak that would make Su Su even better is the addition of gizzards to their menu .
Although gizzards may be a turn off to many , I love their chewy , unyielding texture .
And speaking of awesome fried chicken , my mom makes a killer lollipop fried chicken .
Check out her recipe here .

Raelians believe humans were created by extra-terrestrials
The Turkish authorities say they are discussing what to do with an Iranian atheist who says she fled persecution in Iran .
Negar Azizmoradi , who is the leader of the Raelian movement in Iran , was arrested after she arrived in Turkey last week .
Supporters say she faces the death penalty for her beliefs if she returns .
Turkey gives only limited recognition to refugees , and has in the past sent back Iranian asylum - seekers .
With their libertarian attitude to sex , and their belief that humans were created by extra-terrestrials , Raelians inevitably fall foul of the religious authorities in Iran .
The crime of apostasy - rejecting religious faith - carries the death penalty there , and supporters of Negar Azizmoradi say that is what will happen to her if the Turkish government sends her back to Iran .
She is being detained in Istanbul for not carrying a proper passport when she arrived in Turkey last week .
The authorities are now discussing her fate .
Large numbers of Iranians cross the border into Turkey , many in search of work , but some also fleeing political or religious persecution .
Turkey does not normally recognise asylum seekers from neighbouring countries - thousands are kept in detention centres , pending possible re-settlement in third countries - most are trying to reach the European Union .
Some , including Iranians , have been forced back over the border .
The Raelian movement is now campaigning to prevent that happening to its one - time leader in Iran .
It 's green .
It 's herbal .
It 's organic .
It 's compassionate .
It 's healing .
And it 's nonprofit too .
This plethora of adjectives is not describing a gimmick to cash in on alternative energy or a new diet plan .
No , it 's L.A. 's latest retail craze : medical marijuana .
Those words , pulled from the Los Angeles city clerk 's website , were the most common descriptors in the names of the 966 dispensaries registered in the city .
A Times analysis of pot store names , however , showed that the most frequently occurring word was the socialist - tinged " collective , " appearing in 199 of the names .
Whether that choice of words is merely merchandising double - speak or genuine cultural expression -- a point on which reasonable minds might differ -- may ultimately be of little consequence .
But by plotting the addresses of the pot dispensaries , The Times has made another finding :
At least 260 of them fall within 1,000 feet of a school , a library or a park .
The distance is significant because it's the buffer in a proposed law the Los Angeles City Council has been kicking around for a couple of years .
The ordinance is still pending , with no vote yet scheduled , while council members figure out how to shield their constituents from too much underground pot culture without trampling the dispensaries ' legal right to exist .
Back in September I outline a simple
Perl script to remotely monitor the status of various web servers I manage and report on any failures .
One shortcoming of the script is that
it has no memory of the previous state of the websites listed for
polling .
Thus , once a site fails , the script will continuously report
on the failure until resolved .
For some , this might be just fine , a
simple repetitive reminder until corrected .
For
others however , this might not be ideal .
If , for example , the problem
is non-trivial to solve , the last thing one needs is a nagging every
few minutes that the issue has yet to be resolved .
I for one am all for notification
without excessive nagging .
The obvious answer to this dilemma is
to store the previous state of the server such that it can be used to
test against the currently state ; if the state of the server has
changed , a notification gets sent .
Thus one straightforward notification that something has changed .
As a bonus , by reporting on the change
of state , the script will now report on when the server has come back
online as well as when it has failed .
This simple change eliminates
what would have been a manual process previously ; notifying
stakeholders that the issue has been resolved .
Since the Perl script is evoked by cron
on a regular basis and terminates once polling is complete , the
“ current ” state of a site will need to be store in secondary
memory , i.e. on disk , for future comparison .
This is pretty
straightforward in Perl :
sub logState ( $ $ ) { my ( $ host , $ state , $ time ) = @_ ; # Create a filehandle on our log file my $ fh = FileHandle ->new ( " >> $ fileLoc " ) ; if ( defined $ fh ) { # Print to file the necessary information # delimited with a colon print $fh " $host : $state : " .$ time -> datetime . "
" ; $ fh -> close ; } }
With a new Filehandle object the script
opens the file previously assigned to the $ fileLoc variable for
appending ( the ‘>>’ immediately prior to the variable denotes
write by appending ) .
If a Filehandle object has been
successfully created , the next step is to write a line to the file
with the information necessary for the next iteration of the monitor
script , specifically the host information and its current state .
Note that each line (
) in the file
will denote information about a specific site and that the related
information is separated by a colon ( : ) .
This will be pertinent later in the code , reading of the log file at the next scheduled
execution of the monitor script :
# Our array of polling sites ' previous state my @hostStates = ( ) ; # Populate said array with information from log file my $ fh = FileHandle -> new ( " < $ fileLoc " ) ; while ( < $ fh > ) { my ( $ line ) = $ _ ; chomp ( $ line ) ; push ( @hostStates , $ line ) ; } $ fh -> close ;
In this bit of code the goal is to get
the previously logged state of each site and populate an array with
the information .
At the moment how each record is delimited is n’t of
concern , but simply that each line is information relating to a
specific site and gets its own node in the array .
Note , since the objective here is to simply read the log file the “ < ” is used by the filehandle to denote that the file is “ read - only ” and not “ append ” .
Once the polling of a specific site
occurs , the first item of concern is determining the site ’s previous state .
For
that the following bit of code is put to use :
sub get PreviousState ( $ ) { my ( $ host ) = @_ ; # For each node in the array do the following foreach ( @hostStates ) { my ( $ line ) = $ _ ; # Break up the information # using our delimiter , the colon my ( $ domain , $ state , $ time ) = split ( /:/ , $ line , 3 ) ; # If we find our site return the previous state if ( $ domain eq $ host ) { return $ state ; } } }
In this function each element in the
array is broken down to relevant information using the split
function , which delimits the record by a given character , the colon .
From here it is a simple matter of testing the two states , the
previous and current state before rolling into the notification
process .
The complete , improved remote monitor :
OAKLAND , California ( Reuters ) - A gunman walked into a Tacoma , Washington - area , coffee shop on Sunday morning and fatally shot four police officers , law enforcement officials said .
The four were preparing for their day shift shortly after 8 a.m. when the man shot them with a handgun , they said .
Pierce County Sheriff ’s Department spokesman Ed Troyer described the shootings at the Forza Coffee shop as an ambush .
“ There were baristas in there and other customers and they were not hit , ” said State Trooper Brandy Kessler .
Troopers and other law enforcement officials are helping with the investigation in the Tacoma suburb of about 60,000 , which is about 40 miles southwest of Seattle and near McChord Air Force Base .
The gunman escaped and a $ 10,000 reward for information has been offered , Troyer said .

The BBC has rejected Welsh Secretary Peter Hain 's warning that it could face legal action over BNP leader Nick Griffin 's appearance on Question Time .
The show is due to feature Mr Griffin and other panellists on 22 October .
Mr Hain wrote to the BBC 's director general arguing the British National Party was " an unlawful body " after a court ruling on its membership policy .
But Mark Thompson said the court case did not " legally inhibit " the BBC from allowing Mr Griffin on the programme .
In a letter to Mr Hain the BBC chief said : " It remains the BBC 's obligation to scrutinise and hold to account all elected representatives and to do so with due impartiality .
" We are also advised that if there were to be any election - local or national - tomorrow , the BNP would still be able to field candidates .
" We therefore do not agree that the developments in the Central London County Court proceedings legally inhibit the BBC from allowing Nick Griffin to participate on the Question Time programme and our position remains as set out . "
' Unlawful body ' Downing Street said the prime minister did not oppose the BBC decision to have the BNP on the programme , saying Gordon Brown believed it was important to expose what a party stood for .
Number 10 also made clear Mr Brown had no problem with Mr Hain 's opposition to the BBC decision , saying he had a long and distinguished history of anti-racism .
No BNP representatives have yet appeared on the BBC 's flagship panel show .
But the corporation reviewed its position following the party 's success in last June 's European elections , in which Mr Griffin was one of two BNP candidates to be elected as an MEP .
The BBC has said it is obliged to treat all parties with " due impartiality " .
Your approach is unreasonable , irrational and unlawful
Peter Hain
Question Time and the BNP
Who 's afraid of the BNP ?
But in his letter to the director general , Mr Hain , a prominent anti-apartheid activist before becoming an MP , said the decision should be reconsidered in light of a legal case about ethnic restrictions on the BNP 's membership rules .
The party has agreed to amend its constitution after the Equalities and Human Rights Commission sought an injunction , claiming the BNP was breaking the Race Relations
Act by restricting membership to " indigenous Caucasian " people .
Mr Hain wrote : " Now that the BNP have accepted they are at present an unlawful body , it would be perverse of you to maintain that they are just like any other democratically elected party .
On their own admission , at present , they are not .
" If you do not review the decision you may run the very serious risk of legal challenge in addition to the moral objections that I make .
" In my view , your approach is unreasonable , irrational and unlawful . "
Mr Hain said the invitation should be suspended until a new constitution could be agreed and the court was satisfied that the party passed " a basic threshold of legality " .

He added : " In the meantime , surely you have no choice but to rescind the invitation and await the court 's final decision on the matter ?
" You are giving the BNP a legitimacy even they dare not claim in their current unlawful status . "
Anti-fascist campaigners have said they will stage a demonstration against Mr Griffin 's appearance on the show at the BBC's Television Centre , west London .
As well as Mr Griffin and Mr Straw , panellists are expected to include Conservative peer Baroness Warsi , Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne and playwright and critic Bonnie Greer .
A court heard last week that Mr Griffin had agreed to ask his party to amend its constitution so that it does not discriminate on grounds of race or religion .
BNP members will be asked to agree to the proposed changes at a meeting in November .

The covert Bush administration program that used retired military analysts to generate favorable wartime news coverage may not have been terminated , Raw Story has found .
In interviews , Pentagon officials in charge of the press and community relations offices — which worked in partnership on the military analyst program — equivocated on the subject of whether the program has ended .
ADVERTISEMENT
Last May , the Pentagon ’s Office of Inspector General issued a memorandum rescinding a Bush administration investigative report on the retired military analyst program because it “ did not meet accepted quality standards for an Inspector General work product . ”
The now - retracted report had exonerated officials of using propaganda and referred to the program as just “ one of many outreach groups . ”
Yet Donald Horstman , Pentagon Inspector General deputy director , also stated in the memorandum that his office would n’t probe further because the “ outreach program has been terminated and responsible senior officials are no longer employed by the Department . ”
Raw Story ’s investigation , however , has shown that some “ responsible senior officials ” are still employed by the Defense Department , including Bryan Whitman , who remains a chief Pentagon spokesman and head of all media operations , and Roxie Merritt , who is head of the Pentagon ’s community relations office .
Raw Story has discovered that Horstman ’s other justification for not reopening an investigation at the time – “ because the [ retired military analyst ] outreach program has been terminated ” – remains an open question .
A week after David Barstow ’s New York Times expose on the program broke in April 2008 , Whitman said the military analyst program ’s suspension was only “ temporary . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Reiterating at the time that he thought the program was merely a way to better inform the American public , he also said , “ It ’s temporarily suspended just so that we can take a look at some of the concerns . ”
When Raw Story asked Mr. Whitman if this program was still being run out of the Pentagon , he first replied firmly , “ No , not at this point . ”
But then , in what seemed an attempt to downplay his role in the program , he quickly added , “ Again , it ’s not one of my programs and it would be up to the leadership of public affairs , a new assistant secretary of defense , making any sort of determination to go forward if they deemed it appropriate , necessary , whatever . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s hard for me to tell what future leadership might decide to do , ” Whitman continued .
“ Again , since it ’s not part of the media operations aspect of public affairs here , it ’s not a program for which I will be making a decision about . ”
Raw Story also asked Roxie Merritt if she could confirm that the military analyst program has been officially terminated .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ms. Merritt , in an email interview , first replied , “ [ A ] t the present time , we do n’t have regularly scheduled conference calls with retired military analysts ” but that “ we would not , however , preclude responding to queries for information from or provide future opportunities for them to talk to defense leaders and program managers . ”
Merritt also noted that should there be regularly scheduled conference calls with the military analysts again in the future , they would be shared in various publicly accessible formats .
She added , though , “ Obviously , there are operational security and privacy act issues and other government regulations that must be handled carefully , but we make every possible effort to be open and transparent . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked then to confirm if , in the interim , her office has been open to providing information on an individual basis to retired military analysts , Merritt replied , “ Sure .
If asked , we would provide them with the same information that we would provide you if you had a question about DoD . ”
During the interviews , neither Whitman nor Merritt expressed concern about the way the military analyst program was run by the Bush administration .
Iraq then and Afghanistan now
Internal Pentagon documents show that the military analyst program was stepped up in 2005 , when US public support for the war in Iraq began to sour .
Today , as recent polls show American support for the war in Afghanistan plummeting , the Pentagon and the Obama White House are facing a similar problem .
If the military analyst program , in some form or another , is still being run from the Pentagon , then the two most senior players in the Bush administration propaganda project remaining at the Defense Department , Bryan Whitman and Roxie Merritt , would be poised to step up activities once again .
ADVERTISEMENT
And they are not currently under the watchful eye of any direct superiors who ’ve been brought in by the Obama administration .
While Whitman said that the future of the program would be up to the next assistant secretary of defense , he also confirmed that that position , which is filled by political appointment , remains vacant .
No one , he added , has even been nominated yet .
Merritt is in a similar position of enhanced authority because the position above her has yet to be filled .
Currently serving as President Obama ’s director of the Pentagon office for community relations , she ’s also its de facto chief until a new deputy assistant secretary of defense for internal communications is appointed .
ADVERTISEMENT
What ’s more , Merritt — whose email signature line was “ Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of All Who Threaten It ” ( p. 30 ) — formerly worked as Whitman ’s press office director at the time of the military analyst program ’s increased activity in 2005 .
Whitman and Merritt ’s career civil servant status also continue to buffer them from scrutiny regarding political or ideological motivations , regardless of their activities in the Bush administration .
Retired Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner , an expert in military strategy and operations who has taught at the National War College , Air War College and Naval War College and has been critical of Bush administration strategy , expressed disgust at the Bush holdovers who took part in propaganda against the American public , regardless of whether they were political or career appointees .
Commenting on Whitman ’s presence in the Obama administration , Gardiner said , “ He should be so tainted with what the Bush administration did that that in itself would be enough that he should be gone , even if he ’s a career appointee . ”
“ The list of things that Pentagon public affairs participated in during the run- up [ to the Iraq war ] and immediately after the invasion are horrendous , ” Gardiner continued .
ADVERTISEMENT
But he pointed out that Whitman “ serves as a career person as long as his performance is satisfactory to his immediate superiors . ”
As to suggestions that Whitman be held accountable by a congressional investigative body for his part in the military analyst program , Gardiner noted , “ Congress does n’t evaluate individual performance of people .
It evaluates the performance of organizations . ”
Journalist and historian Norman Solomon said he found an “ unfortunate logic ” to Whitman remaining at the Pentagon .
Solomon , who recently visited Afghanistan on a fact - finding mission , told Raw Story , “ A White House that sees fit to continue on with Robert Gates might see no problem with continuing on with Bryan Whitman . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He added , “ The empirical answer [ to why he remains ] would be that he ’s still useful . ”
Veteran foreign correspondent Reese Erlich , who is currently independently covering the Afghanistan war , believes that “ to some extent , the Obama administration is just simply replicating all the same mistakes of the Bush administration – particularly the war in Afghanistan . ”
“ And if you ’re going to do that , ” he explained in an interview with Raw Story , “ then you need propagandists who can make stuff up to make the war seem more popular in the short run . ”

Deaf ear + blind eye towards problem = folks willing to ' deaf - eye ' the law
by Jeremy Hooper
With a bill that 's solely designed to protect LGBT citizens from bias - motivated crimes , you really have to wonder what our opposition means when they say they intend to " defy " the law :
" To sign the [ hate crimes bill ] in the Rose Garden is another slap in the face and shows the level of contempt President Obama has for the majority of Americans who oppose the " homosexualization " of marriage and public education .
The Christian Anti-Defamation Commission will soon be announcing its plans , along with other leading pro-family groups , to defy , counter and challenge this unconstitutional attack on our religious liberty . "

Exactly how does a group defy , counter and challenge this act ?
Are they going to hold public beatings of homosexuals ?

Bullshit to the Christian Anti-Defimation Commission - just by their feckin name they 're defaming Jews and all other non-christian sects - the Hate Crimes Bill wo n't do anything to them , but would n't it be funny if they got some of their own ANTI - CHRISTIAN HATE spewed back at them .
It would n't hurt MY feelings one bit !
CADC can give it but they can't take it !!!
Poor babies !
( Yeah , RIGHT ! )
They 're all on your way to hell in any event - CHRIST did not preach the HATE CADC spits out and wo n't be looking generously on them on Judgment Day .
My God it will piss you off to see GAY folks going in the Gate and you being shown your way " downstairs " .

The AP has been trying hard to sell the idea of recovery over the last few weeks , but even the AP ca n’t spin double - digit unemployment .
In a piece published last night , they took a decidedly pessimistic tone in reporting the accelerating pace of job losses , using the somewhat ironic headline “ What recovery ? ”
Just when it was beginning to look a little better , the economy relapsed Friday with a return to double - digit unemployment for only the second time since World War II and warnings that next year will be even worse than previously thought .
The jobless rate rocketed to 10.2 percent in October , the highest since early 1983 , dealing a psychological blow to Americans as they prepare holiday shopping lists .
It was another worse - than - expected report casting a shadow over the struggling recovery .
President Barack Obama called it “ a sobering number that underscores the economic challenges that lie ahead . ”
He signed a measure to extend unemployment benefits and to expand a tax credit for homebuyers .
Economists had not expected the 10 percent mark to come so quickly and immediately darkened their forecasts .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com , and Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. , predicted the rate will peak at 11 percent by mid-2010 .
They earlier had projected 10 .
5 percent .
Unemployment at 11 percent would be a post - World War II record .
Only once since then has joblessness hit double digits in the United States — from September 1982 to July 1983 , topping out at 10.8 percent .
The economy “ relapsed ” ?
Not exactly .
The unemployment rate has been rising steadily all year long , with a slight and momentary decline in July .
The month - over - month increase is the largest since May , and four times as large as the last monthly difference .
So why call it a relapse ?
The AP has been talking about “ recovery ” for a couple of months in its financial reporting , which was substantiated by nearly no data at all .
The third - quarter GDP gave that meme a boost , but that relied on a couple of major government interventions ( Cash for Clunkers and the housing tax credit ) .
It did n’t indicate much genuine private - sector growth at all , which belies any notion of “ recovery . ”
In fact , the AP has now discovered this :
The survey of companies does n’t count the self - employed and undercounts employees of small businesses .
So the economic picture could be even more dire .
…
Troubles for small businesses could have a disproportionate effect on the economy , because they account for about 60 percent of the nation ’s jobs .
They tend to rely on credit cards and home equity lines — both of which banks have tightened — for cash flow .
The worsening economy — which is what we have — is heavily impacting the engine of new - job growth , small businesses .
As reader Geoff A points out , even Obama understood double - digit unemployment as a sign of a wrecked economy … in January , at least , when arguing for his Porkulus bill :
In a radio address Saturday , Obama warned Congress that delay could bring perilous consequences : “ If we do n’t act swiftly and boldly , we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double - digit unemployment , ” he said .
Well , yes we could — and as the AP belatedly realizes , we have n’t yet seen a recovery at all , even by Obama ’s standards .

Crowdsourcing is an increasingly popular way to tackle big problems — both Facebook and Google are taking this approach to translating the web into multiple languages .
Now Google is leveraging the wisdom of the crowds for another purpose : the Building Maker tool helps users make accurate 3D models of buildings for representation in Google Earth .
Using Google - provided aerial photographs , you essentially overlay appropriate 3D shapes on top of several different views of a building to construct an accurate model of it .
When finished , submit your building to Google for review .
If approved , the model will be added to the 3D Buildings layer in Google Earth .
For now , you can only construct buildings in 50 cities ( dear Google : no Los Angeles ?
What gives ? ) , but the company will be adding more over time .
You do n't have to be familiar with a building to generate a decent model of it , though — and for geography and travel buffs it 's a fun way to engage with different cities around the world .
Just like with the Monopoly City Streets " virtual " building initiative , you can use the free Google SketchUp to edit or modify your creations , and the finished products will live in the Google 3D Warehouse , an online database of 3D models .
Check out a video demo of Building Maker below and let us know if you 've had a chance to use the tool , or if you plan to .
We found it fun , easy , and even slightly addicting .
All of this is presented with real graphic verve .
( Even though I ’m a text guy , I could n’t keep my eyes off the witty drawings . )
To ginger up the story , the authors often deviate from the actual facts .
As they admit in an afterword , Russell never met Frege or Cantor in the flesh .
Nor , I am fairly certain , did he ever say to Whitehead , “ I ’m tired , man . ”
( You expect Whitehead to reply , “ Me too , bro ! ” )
We are assured , however , that no liberties have been taken with “ the great adventure of ideas . ”
And for the most part the ideas are conveyed accurately , and with delightful simplicity .
If you do n’t know much about infinity , for instance , you are invited to check in to “ Hilbert ’s Hotel ” — which , with its infinite number of rooms , can miraculously accommodate additional guests even when it ’s completely full .
There is one serious misstep , though .
It has to do with the notorious paradox that Russell discovered in the spring of 1901 : the paradox of the set of all sets that do n’t contain themselves as members .
( Think of the barber of Seville , who shaves all men , and only those men , who do not shave themselves .
Does this barber shave himself or not ?
Either possibility yields a contradiction . )
The authors have fun unpacking Russell ’s paradox , but they exaggerate its fallout .
The paradox did ultimately doom Russell ’s ( and Frege ’s ) project of reducing mathematics to pure logic .
However — and this is something that Russell himself failed to realize , along with the authors — it left mathematics pretty much undisturbed .
When Cantor heard of Russell ’s paradox , he did not react like a madman , the way ­“ Logicomix ” caricatures him .
He calmly observed that it did not apply to his own theory of sets , which evolved into the present - day foundation of mathematics .
It is true that Cantor did suffer fits of madness ( the magus of infinity died in a mental asylum ) , as did many other figures in this story .
Frege , the consummate logician , ended up a foaming anti-Semite .
Kurt Gödel , who proved that no logical system could capture all of mathematics , starved himself to death out of a paranoid fear that people were poisoning his food .
Russell maintained his own grip on sanity , but his fear of hereditary madness was borne out when his elder son became schizophrenic and his granddaughter , also schizophrenic , committed suicide by setting herself afire .
Russell ’s philosophical confidence , however , was shattered by his onetime pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein , who made him realize that he had never really understood what logic was .
Is it madness to be driven by a passion for something as inhuman as abstract certainty ?
This is a question the four creators of “ Logicomix ” ponder as , in a beguiling coda , they make their way through nighttime Athens to an open - air performance of the “ Oresteia . ”
Oddly enough , Aeschylus ’ trilogy furnishes the concluding wisdom , which , at the risk of triteness , I ’ll condense into a mathematical inequality :
Life > logic .
NAIROBI , Kenya ( CNN ) --
Heavy rains triggered by El Nino weather patterns could potentially prove devastating for east African nations that have been water - starved for months , the United Nations has warned .
A Turkana boy holds an empty cup in a village in northwestern Kenya .
Kenya , Somalia , Tanzania and Uganda are facing mudslides , crop destruction , waterborne diseases and disrupted road networks , the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday .
Djibouti , Eritrea and Ethiopia could also be affected .
The effects of flooding are expected to be exacerbated because so much greenery has disappeared in the drought .
" More than 23 million people in pastoral , agricultural and suburban communities , as well as internally displaced people and refugees in the region , are reeling from the impact of water and food shortages , pasture scarcity , conflict and insecurity , " said John Holmes , the under - secretary general for humanitarian affairs who is coordinating emergency relief operations .
" While we cannot prevent these climatic shocks , we certainly can mitigate their disastrous effects through forward planning and the right funding from the donor community , " he said .
Uganda , hit by El Nino a decade ago , is planning to apply some of the lessons learned this time around , said Fred Opolot , a government spokesman .
" The government has allocated funds and resources to areas that will be affected , " he said .
" Our disaster preparedness department is using press briefings , among other ways , to inform the public . "
Though the department is not very well - funded , he said , the government is working with groups such as the United Nations and international aid agencies to prepare for floods .
" It is a multifaceted effort ... we want to ensure citizens are sensitized to the dangers of El Nino and things such as bridges are in good condition . "
The rainy season begins in the Horn of Africa in mid-October and runs through the end of the year .
Meteorologists have forecasted that this year 's rains will be more intense than usual because of the El Nino phenomenon , caused by a rise in temperature in the Pacific and Indian oceans .
Aid agencies are already buckling under the weight of helping millions of people who have suffered through months of failed crops , drought and erratic rains caused by climate change .
In Somalia , 450,000 people in the Juba and Shabelle river basins could suffer , the United Nations estimates .
In neighboring Kenya , some 750,000 people -- 150,000 of whom are refugees -- could be affected .
The Turkana , a pastoral tribe in northeastern Kenya , is already reeling from a severe drought that has left scores of people dead and remains of skeletal cows strewn across the flat , arid land .
The remote region has no access to resources , making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods .
CNN 's Moni Basu and Faith Karimi contributed to this report .

What does the Bible say about AIDS / HIV ?
Question : " What does the Bible say about AIDS / HIV ?
Is AIDS / HIV a judgment from God ? "
Answer : Fundamentally , all disease is a judgment from God. Adam and Eve did not know corruption of any kind before the Fall .
When God pronounced judgment on Adam , death entered the world ( Genesis 3:19 ; Romans 5:12 ) .
All sickness , from the common cold to cancer , is part of the curse , and we who live in a cursed world are subject to decay .
So , yes , AIDS / HIV and other STDs ( along with all other diseases ) are part of God ’s judgment in a cursed world .
The Bible plainly teaches that our choices bear consequences .
Whatever a man sows , that ’s what he reaps ( Galatians 6:7- 8 ) .
Righteousness brings blessing : “ Keep my commands and you will live ” ( Proverbs 7:2 ) ; and sin brings judgment : “ He who sows wickedness reaps trouble ” ( Proverbs 22:8 ) .
One of our problems is that we want total freedom to choose our actions , but we want them consequence - free .
The reality is when we choose a course of action , we automatically choose its corresponding result .
Scripture warns that sexual sin carries a built - in judgment from God .
“ He who sins sexually sins against his own body ” ( 1 Corinthians 6:18 ) .
“ God will judge . . . all the sexually immoral ” ( Hebrews 13:4 ) .
It can not be denied that living according to biblical principles ( sexual fidelity within marriage ) drastically reduces one ’s chances of contracting HIV / AIDS and other STDs .
Romans 1:18 - 32 is an indictment of the heathen , idolatrous world .
It starts with these words : “ The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men . ”
This passage teaches that the sin of homosexuality has its roots in a denial of God .
It brings about shame , degradation , and a “ due penalty . ”
Since STDs such as AIDS / HIV are attendant , for the most part , upon sexual sin , they must be considered as part of the “ penalty ” which reveals “ the wrath of God ” against the wickedness of men ( verse 18 ) .
A key phrase is “ God gave them over , ” which occurs three times .
God gave them over to sexual impurity ( verse 24 ) ; to shameful lusts ( verse 26 ) ; and to a depraved mind ( verse 28 ) .
The meaning is that mankind chose to go its own way , and God allowed it .
Granting mankind the freedom to go even further astray was itself a punishment on previous sin .
None of this is to say that everyone with AIDS / HIV is guilty of sexual sin or that homosexuals are beyond redemption .
Tragically , some people have been infected with AIDS / HIV by blood transfusions , by innocent contact with another person who has AIDS / HIV , and most sadly , by being conceived in the womb of a mother who has AIDS / HIV .
The Christian response to AIDS / HIV should always be one of grace and mercy .
No matter how a disease was contracted , our responsibility is to be ministers of grace , love , mercy , and forgiveness .
We do not have the right or authority to proclaim that an AIDS / HIV contraction is a specific judgment from God on a specific sin in a person ’s life .
We have a responsibility to do good to all ( Luke 10:29 - 37 ) , and the gospel we share is still “ the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes ” ( Romans 1:16 ) .
Over the last years people have been working on a free replacement set for the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sounds so OpenTTD can be played without you having to have Transport Tycoon Deluxe .
Great input has been given for both OpenGFX , the graphics replacement set which is 98 % finished and still needs 208 sprites , and OpenSFX , the sound replacement set which is 83 % finished and still needs 12 sound samples .
With your input we hope that we can finish both of these projects before the next major release so we can include them in the packaging / documentation and thus make the first truely free OpenTTD .
So , can you draw , mix sounds or record sounds ?
This is the way to donate to the project so we can meet our objectives .
In China two men have been executed after being convicted of abducting and trafficking 15 children .
China 's Supreme Court said the trade in stolen children , carried out by organised gangs , was on the rise .
Parents , unable to have sons of their own , buy boys from the traffickers for around £ 3,000 each .
The BBC has obtained rare footage of Chinese police who are trying to curb the trade , but many thousands of children are being snatched off the streets to be sold every year and most are never recovered .

At last weekend 's Edinburgh TV festival , the annual MacTaggart Lecture was delivered by Niles Crane from Frasier , played with eerie precision by James Murdoch .
His speech attacked the BBC , moaned about Ofcom and likened the British television industry to The Addams Family .
It went down like a turd in a casserole .
Still , the Addams Family reference will have been well - considered because James knows a thing or two about horror households : he 's the son of Rupert Murdoch , which makes him the closest thing the media has to Damien from The Omen .
That 's a fatuous comparison , obviously .
Damien
Thorn , offspring of Satan , was educated at Yale before inheriting a global business conglomerate at a shockingly young age and using it to hypnotise millions in a demonic bid to hasten Armageddon .
James Murdoch 's story is quite different .
He went to Harvard .
Above all , Murdoch 's speech was a call for the BBC 's online news service to be curbed , scaled back , deleted , depleted , dragged to the wastebasket , and so on , because according to him , the dispersal of such free " state - sponsored " news on the internet threatens the future of other journalistic outlets .
Particularly those provided by News International , which wants to start charging for the online versions of its papers .
Yes Thorn - I mean , Murdoch - refers to the BBC as " state - sponsored media " , because that makes it sound bad ( although not quite as bad as " Satan - sponsored media " , admittedly ) .
He evoked the goverment 's control of the media in Orwell 's 1984 , and claimed that only commercial news organisations were truly capable of producing " independent news coverage that challenges the consensus " .
I guess that 's what the News Of The World does when it challenges the consensus view that personal voicemails should remain personal , or that concealing a video camera in a woman 's private home bathroom is sick and creepy ( it magically becomes acceptable when she 's Kerry Katona ) .
Another great example of independent consensus - challenging news coverage is America 's Fox News network , home of bellicose human snail Bill O'Reilly and blubbering blubberball Glenn Beck .
Beck - who has the sort of rubbery , chucklesome face that should ideally be either a ) cast as the goonish sidekick in a bad frat house sex comedy or b ) painted on a toilet bowl so you could shit directly on to it - has become famous for crying live on air , indulging in paranoid conspiracy theorising , and labelling Obama a " racist " with " a deep - seated hatred for white people or white culture " .
As a news source , Fox is about as plausible and useful as an episode of Thundercats .
Still , at least by hiring Beck , they 've genuinely challenged the stuffy consensus notion that people should only really be given their own show on a major news channel if they 're sane .
The trouble is , once you 've gasped or chuckled over the YouTube clips of his most demented excesses , he 's actually incredibly boring : a fat clown with one protracted trick .
His show consists of an hour of screechy , hectoring bullshit : a pudgy middle - aged right - winger sobbing into his shirt about how powerless he feels .
It 's an incredible performance , but it belongs in some kind of zoo , not on a news channel .
But that 's the Murdoch way .
Now there 's a lengthy , valid , and boring debate to be had about the scope and suitability of some of the BBC 's ambitions but , quite frankly , if their news website ( a thing of beauty and a national treasure ) helps us stave off the arrival of the likes of Beck - even tangentially , even only for another few years until the Tories take over and begin stealthily dismantling the Beeb while a self - interested press loudly eggs them on - then it deserves to be cherished and applauded .
To finish his speech , Murdoch claimed , " The only reliable , durable , and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit . "
Or to put it another way : greed is good .
Then he clopped off stage on his cloven hooves , guffing out a hot cloud of sulphur as he left .
Designed for “ scientists , geologists , archaeologists or adventurers ” , Nissan ’s 4×4 Terranaut features a “ spherical laboratory ” that is accessed from a 360 degree swiveling seat .
Unfortunately , all these workstations leave room for only one passenger side door .
More pics after the jump .
“ What ’s the chance of seeing the Terranaut on the street ?
Pretty good if you own a Holladeck * . ”
